# MTE-corpus
Documents used as input for the Mars Target Encyclopedia and text
extraction scripts.

Documents are stored in .txt files with UTF-8 format.

Annotations are stored in .ann files.  They were auto-generated by a
keyword matching script.  These directories contain annotations that
have not been human reviewed:

* `lpsc14-text`
* `lpsc15-text`
* `lpsc16-text`

These directories contain annotations after human review:
  
* `lpsc14-text-reviewed-target`: target annotations manually corrected
 
Note: To align spans with extracted text, be sure to treat the text as
UTF-8.  For example, in Python, use

   `text.encode('utf8')`
