# MTE-corpus
Documents used as input for the Mars Target Encyclopedia and text
extraction scripts.  The text files were extracted from publicly
available PDF abstracts from the 
[Lunar and Planetary Science Conference](https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2016).

## Documents
Documents are stored in .txt files with UTF-8 format.

Annotations are stored in .ann files ([format info](http://brat.nlplab.org/standoff.html)).  
They were auto-generated by a keyword matching script.  
These directories contain annotations that have not been 
human reviewed:

* `lpsc14-text`
* `lpsc15-text`
* `lpsc16-text`

These directories contain annotations after human review:
  
* `lpsc14-text-reviewed-target`: Target annotations manually corrected - Element and Mineral not reviewed
* `lpsc15-text-reviewed-target`: Target annotations manually corrected - Element and Mineral not reviewed
 
## Scripts

Text was extracted from source PDFs using [src/extract_text_utf8.py](https://github.com/wkiri/MTE-corpus/blob/master/src/extract_text_utf8.py).

Note: To align spans with extracted text, be sure to treat the text as
UTF-8.  For example, in Python, use

   `text.encode('utf8')`
