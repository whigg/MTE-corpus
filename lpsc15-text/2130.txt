(jccook@boulder.swri.edu)Background: The majority of Pluto's known atmosphere prior to the New Horizons flyby is comprisedof N2, with minor (<1%) amounts of CH4 and CO[1, 2]. The atmospheric escape rate has been estimatedbetween ∼1027 to ∼1028 N2 particles s−1, dependingon solar activity and heliocentric distance (i.e., [3]). Ashas been suggested by various works since the 1980s,some of the gas leaving Pluto may reach Charon. Recently, [4] has shown that some of that N2 may forma weak atmosphere around Charon, and become temporarily bound to Charon's surface. Ground based observations of Charon by [5] suggest an N2-ice detection, but it has never been confirmed. This year, theNew Horizons spacecraft will make a close encounterwith Pluto and its satellite system. Using the instruments aboard New Horizons, observations are plannedto examine the surfaces of Pluto and Charon, the atmosphere of Pluto and search for an atmosphere aroundCharon down to the ∼nbar level. Here we examine acombination of ground-based observations of Charon'ssub-Pluto hemisphere from [6] and use spectral modelsto further constrain or detect the abundance of N2-ice.Then we determine what abundances are necessary forNew Horizons to detect N2-ice or gas at Charon.Motivation: The atmospheric models of Charon presented in [4] suggest under nominal solar conditionsa column density of ∼2-3×1022 N2 molecules cm−2.This is below the sensitivity of 1023 molecules cm−2 fora 3σ detection using New Horizons' Alice UV spectrograph operating in solar occulation mode [7]. Howeverthese results are highly sensitive to surface temperature,and if the surface is only a few degrees warmer, thenthe column densities do become significant enough todetect. Under the conditions assumed by [4], N2 willfreeze onto the night-side surface. Once reintroduced tosolar heating at sunrise, sublimation of N2 will occur.This makes the dawn terminator a prime place to lookin the Charon solar occulation data for its atmosphere.However, if the surface is colder than expected, then theN2 may form a detectable frost layer. If this is the case,the detection of N2-ice may be possible, but again isolated to regions around the pole and dawn terminator.Past Observations: In 2005, [6] obtained high SNR(50-100) spectra of Charon using Gemini North withthe NIRI and Altair (adaptive optics) instruments. Observations were made in H-band (1.50-1.80 µm) andK-band (1.95-2.40 µm) at a resolving power (λ/∆λ)of ∼500. Observations were made within 10◦ ofCharon's sub-Pluto (0◦) and anti-Pluto (180◦) hemiFigure 1: Gemini North/NIRI+Altair observations(black) and Hapke model (red) of Charon (bottom) andresiduals (top).spheres. Fig. 1 shows the sub-Pluto K-band spectrumof Charon. These spectra showed the absorption bandsat 1.5, 1.65 and 2.0 µm due to crystalline H2O ice seenpreviously by [8, 9, 10]. Another previously seen bandnear 2.21 µm, was definitively identified as ammoniahydrate [6]. Water ice and NH3-hydrates have been seenin spectra of Charon at all observed longitudes [11, 12].Future Observations: With the arrival of New Horizons, new spatially resolved spectra of Charon will beobtained using the LEISA instrument, the near-infraredspectral imager [13]. The instrument is designed tomake spectral maps of the surface of Pluto and Charon.LEISA performs in a push broom fashion, building a256 (spectral) × 256 (spatial) × n (spatial) image cube,where n is an arbitrary length. Spectra from LEISAhave a resolving power of ∼260 from 1.25 to 2.50 µmand resolving power of∼560 from 2.10 to 2.25µm [14].We will use the high-resolution spectra to determine theshape and variations of the 2.15 and 2.21 µm bands ofN2 and NH3-hydrate, respectively. Starting weeks before closest approach, New Horizons will make regularobservations of Charon to make hemispheric maps ofthe surface at resolution of 8 km/pix. These observations will be useful in determining the global distribution of numerous species, including N2. At closest approach, smaller regions of Charon will be observed at upto 4.7 km/pix resolution. Shortly after closest approach,Charon will occult the sun from the viewpoint of NewHorizons. New Horizons will perform the Charon occultation to look for an atmosphere in absorption.2130.pdf

Each contour line represents where ∆χ2νis1 (green), 2 (yellow) and 3 (red).Modeling Spectra: We use Hapke's theory to produce model spectra of Charon that matches the data inFig. 1. We assume two spatially separated spectral units.The first unit is an intimate mixture of pure crystallineH2O ice at 40 K and kaolinite, a phylosilicate with ablue spectral slope. [9] noted that pure crystalline H2Oice does not match spectra of Charon at longer wavelengths, and that a blue neutral absorber was necessary.In our experience, kaolinite produces the best match inK-band. The second spectral unit is an intimate mixture of ammonia hydrate (NH3·H2O) and ammoniumhydroxide (NH4OH), both of which produce absorptionfeatures at 2.21 (stronger) and 1.99 (weaker) µm in addition to the crystalline H2O ice bands. Given this composition, the best-fit model is about 36% (first unit) and64% (second unit) of the observed surface. We then rerun the model including a third spectral unit of pure N2ice. N2 has two phases of ice. The hexagonal, β phase,that forms at temperatures >35.6 K and the colder, cubic, or α phase. Figure 2 shows that if N2 grains are1 µm in diameter, then it covers <31% of the observedsurface regardless of ice phase. If, however, the grainsizes were similar to those found on Pluto (1-10 cm),then the upper limit on the observed surface area is 1220% for β N2 and 8-14% for α N2.Modeled LEISA data: We rebin the Gemini datafrom Fig. 1 to the spectral sampling of the highresolution segment of LEISA as a proxy. We find the3σ limit for the detection of α and β N2 for data ofdifferent SNR levels over the wavelength range 2.10to 2.18 µm. These results are shown in Fig. 3. Forlarge grain N2-ice, the α N2 is detectable if covering>10% of the observed area for high SNR (∼100) data.However, for finer grains the ability to detect eitherform of N2 becomes more difficult and would need tocover >30-40% of the observed area. In addition, theFigure 3: Signal-to-noise estimates for the 3σ detectionof α (black) and β (red) N2 on Charon.ability to distinguish between α and β N2 becomesimpossible for grain diameters .300 µm.Discussion & Conclusion: The close proximity ofCharon to Pluto means that Charon is capable of capturing gas that has escaped from Pluto. Recently, [4]showed how Charon may have a weak N2 atmosphereand some N2-ice. If the surface temperature of Charonis as [4] modeled, then the atmosphere is too weak forNew Horizons to detect. However, small differences inthe surface temperature (i.e., few K warmer) may produce a detectable atmosphere. But, if conditions arecolder than expected, then N2 will remain bound to thesurface. Since the detection of either an atmosphere orN2-ice is so sensitive to temperature, the observationsmade by New Horizons will be critical in understanding the role atmospheric escape from Pluto may have onCharon, such as the formation of nitriles. In addition,since New Horizons will obtain spatially resolved spectra of Charon, mapping the distribution of N2-ice mayhelp to determine the origin of N2 on Charon, e.g., eitherfrom Pluto, or delivered from cometary impacts [7].References: [1] Young, L.
