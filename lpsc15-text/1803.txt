 RAYED CRATERS ON DIONE.  Naoyuki Hirata 1 and Hideaki Miyamoto 1, 1 The University Museum, The University of Tokyo, Hongo, Tokyo 113-0033 Japan, hirata@um.u-tokyo.ac.jp   Introduction: Dione is a Saturn's mid-sized satellite with 561 km in radius. Dione is known as the third densest moon of Saturn, which suggests that Dione is composed of an icy mantle with a rocky core whose mass fraction is estimated to be 50 % [1]. Notable features on Dione include exogenic surface features, for example the ray system of Creusa crater or the dark terrain [2,3,4]. The ray system of Creusa consists of numerous radial rays ejected from Creusa crater (located at 76°W, 49°N; Fig. 1a). As well as the Moon or Mercury, Dione appears numerous rayed craters [5] (Fig. 1b, c). Among them, Creusa crater is the largest rayed crater, whose diameter is 36.2 km [5]. Its ray system extends almost all over the leading hemisphere as long as at least several hundred km [5]. Generally, rays are made of fresh inner material ejected from an impact crater at it formation [e.g. 6, 7]. After the formation, rays gradually fade out with time because of various surface alterations, and therefore, craters with the ray system are considered to be young geological features. As well, the ray system of Creusa is also considered as one of the youngest geological features on Dione because of exposure of fresh inner material [4, 8]. The aim of this work: One of the purposes of this study is to examine the stratigraphic relation of the ray system of Creusa, which is useful to discuss the geological history of Dione. For example, the ray systems of Copernicus or Tycho are well studied in terms of the cross-cutting relations in 1960s [e.g. 9]. Similarity, we develop a new projection map to examine the distribution of the ray system of Creusa. The other purpose is to constrain the age of Creusa crater and to estimate the retention time for rays on Dione, which has an important role to discuss the geologic timescale of surface alterations. Although surface processes on icy satellites are experimentally or theoretically studied well, it would be hard to understand the geologic timescale. Instead, the timescale can be estimated by the retention time for rays, which can be suggested by the fraction of rayed craters out of all craters. We note that the fractions of rayed craters on the Moon and Mercury are roughly a tenth those of all craters [10], which indicates that terrestrial ray systems are fading out during 1 Gy. This is consistent with the age of rock samples from Copernicus crater obtained by Apollo 12. Copernicus crater, whose ray system has been already unclear, is known to be formed 800 Ma [11]. Similarly, the retention times for rayed craters on Ganymede and Callisto are estimated to be a few Gy, based on their crater densities [12].  Interestingly, Wagner et al. [5] estimates that rayed craters on Rhea or Dione must be much younger than 500 Ma. This implies that the maturation of soil on Rhea or Dione may be much more rapid than that on the Moon, Mercury, or satellites of Jupiter. This estimate is based on the crater size-frequency distribution of the floor of Inktomi crater (also known as the largest rayed crater on Rhea), which indicates its young age estimated to be 280 Ma or 8 Ma [5]. However, except for Inktomi on Rhea, rayed craters on Dione and Rhea are not imaged at sufficient resolution for a crater counting. Instead, we examine the fraction of rayed craters on Dione, which can show the accurate retention time for rays on Dione and constrain the age of Creusa crater.  Data: We examine all of currently-available 1881 images (higher than 5 km/pixel) obtained by the ISS camera onboard the Cassini spacecraft by Dec. 2013. These images are available via NASA's Planetary Data System. Thanks to the observations during the last decade, the entire surface of Dione has been aerially surveyed at a resolution of 700 m/pixel or better. Result and Discussion: As a result, we find that Dione has at most 100 rayed craters exceeding 2 km in diameter. This implies that the retention time for rays on Dione is likely to be as long as several My or several ten My, which is much shorter than those on Galilean satellites. This is probably explained by E ring bombardment, which can play a role to make the retention time shorten. Moreover, we find that (i) the ray system of Creusa crater extends all over the surface of Dione when it is formed and (ii) the ray system is partially erased on the trailing hemisphere (Fig. 2). We conclude that the accumulation of the dark material, whose resultant deposits form the dark terrain on the trailing hemisphere, may bury rays. Those results indicate that the dark terrain is formed in very recent. We show a detailed discussion in the presentation.  References: [1] Matson, D. L. et al.
