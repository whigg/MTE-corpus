ORIGIN OF ORBITS OF SECONDARIES IN DISCOVERED TRANS-NEPTUNIAN BINARIES. S. I.

Contact: siipatov@hotmail.com.       Introduction: Ipatov [1-2] and Nesvorny et al. [3] supposed that trans-Neptunian binaries were formed by contraction of rarefied preplanetesimals (RPPs). Ipatov supposed that a considerable fraction of transNeptunian satellite systems could get the main fraction of their angular momenta due to collisions of RPPs.  Prograde and Retrograde Rotation of TransNeptunian Binaries: Based on the data from http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/astro/astmoons/, below we study inclinations is of orbits of secondaries around 32 objects moving in the trans-Neptunian belt (Fig. 1) and discuss how such inclinations could form. Note that is is considered relative to the ecliptic and differs from the inclination relative to the plane which is perpendicular to the axis of rotation of a primary. For example, is=96o for Pluto, though Charon is moving in the plane perpendicular to the Pluto's rotational axis. Besides the 32 considered objects with known values of is, the above website contains also information about many binaries with unknown is. The fraction of objects with is>90o equals 13/32≈0.406 at all values of eccentricity e of a heliocentric orbit of a binary, and it is 13/28≈0.464 for e<0.3. The distribution of is is in the wide range almost from 0 to 180o (Fig. 1a). It shows that a considerable fraction of the angular momentum of the RPPs that contracted to form satellite trans-Neptunian systems was not due to initial rotation of RPPs or to collisions of RPPs with small objects (e.g., boulders and dust), but it was acquired at collisions of the RPPs which masses did not differ much,  because else the angular momentum would be positive. Ipatov [1] noted that the angular momentum of collided RPPs could be positive or negative depending on heliocentric orbits of the RPPs. Some excess of the number of discovered binaries with positive angular momentum compared with the number of discovered binaries with negative angular momentum was caused in particular by the contribution of initial positive angular momentum of RPPs and by the contribution of collisions of RPPs with small objects to the angular momentum of the final RPP that produced the binary. Also there could be some excess of positive angular momentum at mutual collisions of RPPs of similar sizes.  Orbits of Binaries at Different Separation Distances: All four secondaries of the considered binaries with e>0.3 move in prograde orbits (i.e., is<90o). For e>0.3 the ratio as/rH of the separation between the primary and the secondary to the Hill radius of the binary was smaller than 0.024, while as/rH can exceed 0.225 at e<0.3 (Fig. 1a). Note that the trans-Neptunian objects with e>0.3 could form in the feeding zone of the giant planets (see, e.g., [4]), i.e., closer to the Sun than the objects with e<0.3. Maximum values of as/rH (and also of as) are greater for greater semi-major axis a of a heliocentric orbit of an object at 38<a<46 AU (there is no place in the abstract for all analyzed figures). We suppose that for smaller distances a from the Sun the mean sizes of collided RPPs could be smaller, and so the mean values of as for the formed binaries could be smaller. The smaller sizes of the collided RPPs at smaller distances from the Sun could be due to their smaller Hill radii (which are proportional to a) at the collisions and may be also due to faster contraction.  For as/rH<0.008, except one object, the values of is are between 60o and 105o, i.e., are in some vicinity of 90o. Probably, such is were originated because for smaller sizes of collided RPPs (that produce binaries with smaller as/rH) the ratio of their sizes to the height of the disk where RPPs moved was smaller, and collided RPPs often moved one above another, but not in almost the same plane as in the case when the sizes of RPPs were about the height.  Fig. 1c shows that is is between 60o and 130o for es<0.1, but is can take any values for greater eccentricities es of orbits of secondaries around objects moving in the trans-Neptunian belt. For objects with es<0.1, as/rH<0.011; es<0.15 at as/rH<0.008. Eccentricities es are typically greater than 0.2 at as/rH>0.011. The values of es are usually in the range of 0.3-0.7 at 0.009<as/rH<0.035 and can be in a wider range (from 0.15 to 0.9) for as/rH>0.035. The greater maximum values of es at greater values of as/rH are in accordance with the formation of satellites from a disk of material (e.g., if the disk formed as a result of contraction of a rarefied condensation). Orbits of satellites of planets are also almost circular for small distances from planets. Inclinations of Orbits of Secondaries at Different Diameters of Components of Binaries: No dependence has been found for the plot of is vs. the diameter of the primary. The absence of such dependence can be a result of the evolution of the disk of RPPs, if the height of the disk of collided RPPs is greater than radii of collided RPPs. For the ratio ds/dp of diameters of the secondary to the primary greater than 0.7, is can take any values, but 1512.pdf

there are no objects with 130o<is<180o and ds/dp<0.7, and there is only one binary with is<50o and ds/dp<0.5 (Fig. 1c). The absence of binaries with is>130o at ds/dp<0.7 may be caused by that the contribution of initial positive angular momentum of RPPs to the final angular momentum of the RPP that contacted to form the considered binary was greater (and the angular momentum acquired at the collision of RPPs of similar masses that produced the final RPP was smaller) at ds/dp<0.7 than at ds/dp>0.7. The smaller contribution of the angular momentum acquired at the collision at smaller ratio ds/dp could be caused by that in this case the masses of collided RPPs differed more than at greater ds/dp. The fraction of binaries with ds/dp>0.7 is 20/32≈0.625. A considerable (about 0.8) fraction of binaries with ds/dp>0.7 was also obtained in the computer models considered by Nesvorny et al. [3].    Dependencies of Inclination of a Secondary on Orbital Elements of a Heliocentric Orbit of a Binary: Below we discuss dependencies of is on orbital elements (a, e, i) of a heliocentric orbit of a binary object (or an object with several satellites) moving in the trans-Neptunian belt. At 38<a<44 AU the maximum values of is are greater for greater values of a semimajor axis a of a heliocentric orbit of an object (Fig. 1d). The values of is exceed 134o only at 44<a<46 AU, and is<110o at 38<a<40 AU. Initial semi-major axes of objects with e>0.3, probably, were less than 38 AU [4]. Smaller maximum values of is at smaller a can be caused by that the maximum values of the contribution of the angular momentum at a collision of two RPPs to the final angular momentum of the formed RPP were smaller (i.e., the role of initial positive angular momentum of RPPs was greater) at smaller a (as maximum values of a separation as are smaller at smaller a).  The maximum value of is typically is smaller at greater eccentricity e of a heliocentric orbit. It is close to 180o at e<0.1, is about 128o at e≈0.2, and is less than 90o at e>0.37.  At i>13o the values of is are in some region around 90o (61o≤is≤126o) and e≥0.219; in particular, 68o<is<110o at 13o<i<24o. May be some of the binaries with i>13o originated at a smaller distance than most of other considered TNO binaries. The discussion of dependence of is on a is presented above. Conclusions: The model at which a considerable fraction of the angular momentum of the rarefied condensation that contracted to form a satellite system was acquired at a collision of two condensations is in accordance with observations of trans-Neptunian binaries. For any other theory of formation of transNeptunian binaries, it is needed to explain the observations of the binaries, e.g., a considerable fraction of binaries with negative rotation.
