These variations include both enrichments and depletions of 33S relative to CDT, and it has been suggested that irons preserve a record of differential incorporation of photo-dissociated S-bearing molecules in the meteorites parent bodies [2].  The study of S isotope compositions in chondrites appears to be more complex. While the bulk of analyses have established homogeneous S isotope compositions without significant 33S anomalies for chondrite sulfur [3-6], some 33S anomalies have been reported. For instance, refractory sulfides with Δ33S≈1 ‰  from Allende were reported by [4], a 0.1 ‰ 33S enrichment in refractory sulfides from the ordinary chondrite Djahala was reported by [1], and Δ33S anomalies associated with large 34S mass fractionations in sulfonic acids were reported by [7].  Here, we report on the initial phase of a study to examine the various forms of sulfur in CM chondrites. In this report, we describe a Δ33S anomaly for the bulk of sulfur from a fragment of the CM chondrite Murchison. This is a distinct fragment from the one analyzed by [5]. Our data suggests 33S heterogeneity also exists at the the bulk sample scale. We also address the origin of the various S pools in these rocks. We additionally present preliminary results obtained on another CM carbonaceous chondrite: Cold Bokkeveld that does not preserve evidence for a 33S anomaly.  The S isotope data of sulfur from the Murchison fragment may provide insight into the origin and processing of the sulfur in the CM parent body and possibly constraints on the way that this anomaly is transferred to differentiated planetesimals.   Methods:  We used sequential extraction techniques to extract S from four pools: Sulfide, sulfate, elemental S and insoluble organic matter (IOM). Sulfur in Cold Bokkeveld and Murchison was extracted from cruhed samples (~150 mg aliquoted out of ~500 mg of total allocated powder) using a sequential extraction protocol as follows. Samples were first processed in N2-flushed Milli-Q water for 24 hours to dissolve sulfate and soluble organic compounds. This step yielded ~5000-6000 ppm S as sulfate. This extraction was repeated for the two chondrites and yielded non-detectable sulfate (i.e. < 50 ppm) in the repeat, indicating the first extraction was quantitative. Sulfates were then precipitated as BaSO4, subsequently reduced to H2S using the Thode method, and then converted to silver sulfide. The rock samples were then processed in N2flushed ethanol for 24 hours to dissolve naturallyoccuring elemental S. This step yielded between 500 and 1000 ppm S. The extraction was repeated and did not yield any detectable S. Importantly, we also quantified elemental S through HPLC techniques. This yielded estimates matching our wet chemistry extractions, within uncertainties (±5%). Supernatent was separated and the dissolved S0 was reduced to H2S and subsequently converted to silver sulfide.

The rock samples were then digested in a subboiling CrCl2 + HCl solution for 3 hours in order to extract sulfide. The solid residue was then processed with the Raney-Nickel technique, a de-sulfurization process designed to extract carbon-bound reduced S (i.e., S associated with IOM) described elsewhere [8]. An additional sample of a Murchison IOM residue was processed with this technique that had been extracted from the chondrite previously at the Carnegie Institu tion of Washington following a standard procedure described elsewhere [9]. The silver sulfides produced for each S pool were fluorinated to SF6, purified, and analyzed using dual inlet Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry at the University of Maryland.  Results: The bulk S contents are 1.29 and 1.59 wt.% for Murchison and Cold Bokkeveld, respectively. For both chondrites, sulfides and sulfates are the dominant S pools, each representing between 40 % and 50 % of the bulk S. Elemental S represents < 10 % of the bulk S for both samples. Sulfur extracted during the Raney-Nickel step represents ~5 % of bulk S for both samples. For both chondrites, we observe a δ34S spread of ~5 ‰ between the extracted S pools (Fig. 1). Both sulfide and sulfate (as well as Raney-Nickel sulfur) have nearzero δ34S, leading the bulk δ34S of our samples to be close to the origin, at +0.2 ‰ and -1.1 ‰ relative to VCDT for Murchison and Cold Bokkeveld, respectively. However, elemental S displays a clear 34S enrichment with respect to CDT, of about +5 ‰ (Fig. 1).  In Cold Bokkeveld, bulk S has Δ33S and Δ36S at +0.010±0.015 ‰ and +0.130±0.324 ‰, respectively (1σ), i.e., indistinguishable from CDT. In detail, the sulfate pool displays a slight 33S enrichment with respect to sulfide and elemental S: the Δ33S of sulfate is +0.025±0.008 ‰ compared to more negative values for sulfide, of Δ33S=0.004±0.008 ‰, and for elemental S, with Δ33S=-0.007±0.008 ‰. The average values for Δ33S and Δ36S in Murchison are +0.198±0.059 ‰ and +0.194±0.167 ‰, respectively. The Δ36S variability between Murchison compounds is similar to that in Cold Bokkeveld, as revealed by the comparable standard deviations, but the Δ33S variability is much higher: The Δ33S value for sulfide is +0.136±0.009‰, whereas it is significantly higher for sulfate, at +0.261±0.016‰, and for elemental S, at +0.236±0.008‰ (Fig. 1).  For both chondrites, S extracted at the RaneyNickel step is indistinguishable from sulfide in terms of Δ33S. For δ34S, its values are close to sulfide but somewhat elevated, by ~1 ‰. The S extracted from the IOM pool of Murchison was too small to achieve a reliable Δ36S measurement, but its measured Δ33S was clearly distinct from sulfide and from the bulk meteorite, with a value of +0.64±0.12‰, associated with a δ34S value of +1.7±1.0‰.   Discussion:  Our isotope data show clearly resolvable mass independent Δ33S variability in S from a split of the Murchison meteorite that is present in sulfide, sulfate, and elemental S. While carbonaceous chondrites (and CM in particular) have been reported to carry various S pools, including a component of elemental S that would represent <10 % of the bulk S, it is of of unknown origin [5]. CMs also contain sulfates (typically amounting to >20 %, often around ~50 % of the bulk S [5]) whose origins remain poorly constrained. It is likely that both elemental S and sulfate originate from oxidation of a more reduced phase, but the nature of this process (e.g., kinetic vs. equilibrium, nature of the electron receiver) also remains poorly understood.  Elemental S was observed in similar quantities in both the CM chondrites studied here. In Murchison, the observation of a stong Δ33S difference between sulfide and elemental S shows that the latter does not come from a simple oxidation of a single homogenous sulfide pool because oxidation is expected to be a largely mass-dependent process.  The similar Δ33S for sulfate and elemental S suggests that sulfate and elemental S originate from oxidation of the same sulfur pool. The observation of a small Δ33S for sulfide suggests that this pool was present as part of the sulfide pool in this Murchison split. If directly related (as suggested by their similar Δ33S  value), the  variability in δ34S values of elemental sulfur and sulfide/sulfate in the two studied chondrites is consistent with a mass dependent isotope effect associated with oxidation of elemental S.
