McSween1. 1Planetary Geoscience Institute, University of Tennessee, Knoxville TN. 2University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh PA, balta@pitt.edu. 3Arizona State University, Tempe AZ.   Introduction: The 2012 ANSMET expedition to Antarctica located 3 new shergottite meteorites on the Larkman-Nunatak icefield, named as LAR 12011, LAR 12095, and LAR 12240. The initial description suggested possible pairing of LAR 12240 and LAR 12095 and of LAR 12011 with previouslycharacterized meteorite LAR 06319. We obtained thin sections of these three shergottites from the Meteorite Working Group and characterized their petrography, mineralogy, and geochemistry to assess their pairing, relationships to other shergottites, and martian petrogenesis. Characterization was done at the University of Tennessee using Nikon microscopes and a Cameca SX-100 EPMA. Trace element analyses of individual phases are being conducted at Arizona State University using the Cameca IMS 6f ion microprobe. LAR 12095: This sample is an olivine-phyric shergottite containing large olivine and occasional pyroxene phenocrysts surrounded by groundmass of pyroxene, maskelynite, and minor phases. The section is composed of ~17% olivine, 61% pyroxenes, 21% maskelynite, and 1% spinel and sulfide grains. Olivine Mg # ranges from 70 to 59, with Mg-rich grain cores rare and only found in the largest grains. Olivine crystal size distribution (CSD) measurements show negatively-sloped arc shapes with flattening (and overabundance) of coarse (>1 mm) grain sizes. Pigeonites range in composition from En67-56Fs25-33Wo8-11, augites have a narrow range from En49-45Fs20-25Wo30-34, and there is a clear compositional gap between augites and pigeonites (Fig 1). Augites are not abundant, making up <10% of pyroxene analyses. Maskelynites range from An66-53 and are low-K (<1 wt. % K2O). Spinels are Cr-rich and do not extend to Ti/Fe-rich with the exception of rare ilmenite grains. A notable Alenrichment is found in spinels comparable to those reported in SaU 005 or Dhofar 019 [1]. Phosphates are dominated by merrillite; only a single apatite was located. Merrillites are Mg-rich, with Mg ~ 5x the molar abundance of Fe. As in other shergottites, this phase is the main rare earth element (REE) carrier. Its REE pattern has a slight Light-REE (LREE) depletion (CInormalized La/Sm ~0.15), and is relatively flat in the heavy-REE (HREE). Sulfides are mostly iron-rich pyrrhotite but occasional high-Ni pyrrhotites are present.  LAR 12240: Effectively all measured features of LAR 12240 reproduce those of LAR 12095. The sample is also an olivine-phyric shergottite composed of ~16% olivine, 59% pyroxenes, 23% maskelynite, and 1% spinel and sulfide. Olivine Mg # ranges from 69 to 58, with Mg-rich grains rare compared to those close to Mg # 60. Olivine CSD measurements show negatively-sloped arc shapes with flattening and overabundance of coarse grain sizes. Although the abundance of coarse grain sizes is similar for both LAR 12095 and 12240, the olivine abundances do not overlap at the smallest grain sizes; this difference may be an artifact of the small size of the LAR 12240 section. Pyroxene compositions fully overlap those in LAR 12095, including the relative scarcity of augites (Fig. 1). Maskelynites range from An67-52 with <1 wt. % K2O, again within error of the range observed for LAR 12095. Spinels are Cr-rich, do not extend to Ti/Fe-rich compositions with the exception of rare ilmenite, and contain the same notable Al-enriched end-member. Merrillites were common and Mg-rich, with Mg ~ 4.8x the molar abundance of Fe, and no apatites were located. Sulfides are dominated by iron-rich pyrrhotite but again occasional high-Ni pyrrhotites are present. The REE abundances and patterns in minerals of LAR 12240 are similar to those of LAR 12095.

Our thin section was separated into two pieces; the upper piece contained 19% olivine, 48% pyroxenes, 31% maskelynite, and 2% spinel and sulfide, while the bottom contained 25% olivine, 29% maskelynite, 44% pyroxenes, and 1.5% spinel and sulfide. Olivine Mg # ranges from 75 to 45, with most olivine cores in the range of 70-73. Olivine CSD measurements show negatively-sloped shapes with very little flattening at coarse grain sizes. Pigeonites range in composition from En71-51Fs2546Wo3-8, augites range from En51-31Fs25-38Wo25-30, with a continuous compositional range. Maskelynites range from An52-38 and contain 3-6% wt. K2O. Spinels range from Cr-rich to Fe(III)/Ti-rich, covering the full range commonly found in shergottites. Phosphates included merrillites, OH-rich apatites, and rare Cl-rich apatites. Merrillites have Mg ~2x Fe. Sulfides are uniformly pyrrhotite.  2294.pdf

Assessment of pairing: LAR 12240 and LAR 12095 overlap almost completely in their petrological and geochemical characteristics with the exception of a single apatite grain found in LAR 12095 and slight differences in the olivine CSD at the smallest grain sizes, both of which could be artifacts of our section of LAR 12240 being a smaller, less-representative area than our section of LAR 12095. All mineralogical, major, and trace element measurements support a hypothesis of these samples being paired but do not suggest pairing with any other well-studied shergottite.  LAR 12011 overlaps in composition and mineralogy with LAR 06319, with some variation in modal abundances between observed areas. Distinct features of LAR 06319, including OH-rich apatites, a full range of spinels from Cr-rich to Fe(III)/Ti-rich, olivine CSD patterns, and olivine cores close to Mg # 72 [2] are also reproduced. Our measurements are consistent with LAR 12011 being paired with LAR 06319, and thus its petrogenesis will not be discussed further. Petrogenesis of LAR 12095/12240 and comparison to other shergottites: As these samples are not paired with currently-known shergottites, here we consider unique details of their petrogenesis.  Olivines are commonly homogeneous and generally Fe-rich relative to other olivine-phyric shergottites. The most Mg-rich olivines, ~Mg # 70, are among the most Mg-poor cores in rocks of this class, comparable to those found in Dhofar 019 and NWA 1068 [4], but LAR 12011/12095 do not contain olivines as Fe-rich as found in those samples. Instead, groundmass olivines and olivine rims cluster close to Mg #58-62, as found in Dag 476 and SaU 005/094 except at lower Mg # in this case. High-Mg cores are found only in the largest (> 1 mm) olivines and are virtually absent from our section of LAR 12240, which contains fewer of the largest phenocrysts than our section of LAR 12095. Most olivines are therefore in the range 58-62. This narrow range bears closest resemblance to the narrow ranges observed in olivines from enriched, lherzolitic shergottites RBT 04261 and NWA 7397 [5]. Pyroxene compositions form a tight range. The closest match in both augite and pigeonite compositions appears to be SaU 005/094 [6-7], but those in LAR 12095/12240 are slightly more Fe-rich. Both augites and pigeonites overlap those observed in DaG 476 [8], but LAR 12095/12240 lack the orthopyroxene found in that sample. They also generally overlap the pyroxenes found in lherzolitic shergottites LEW 88516, ALH 77005, and NWA 7397 [5,9] Maskelynite compositions generally resemble those found in SaU 005/094, although those in SaU are slightly more Na-rich [6-7]. Mg/Fe ratios in phosphates and the large range in pyrrhotite Ni contents also resemble those in SaU 005/094 [7], although LAR 12095/12240 contain sulfides with higher Ni contents. The REE pattern of merrillite, which dominates the REE budget, is also most similar to that of the SaU 005 whole-rock (CI-normalized La/Sm ~0.16 and a relatively flat HREE pattern [10]). SaU 005 and associated paired samples therefore are the closest major and trace element match to the LAR 12095/12240 pair. The pyroxenes, maskelynites, and minor phases share some common details, although the olivines in 12095/12240 are notably more Fe-rich. SaU 005/094 have affinities to the lherzolitic shergottites in the narrow mineral composition ranges observed, implying high degrees of equilibration and residence at pressure where lherzolitic shergottites are thought to form [5, 7]. A final detail is revealed by our analyses. An olivine in LAR 12095 and a pyroxene in LAR 12240 each contain rounded inclusions of the same mineral (Fig. 2). The olivine inclusion could only be distinguished optically as no compositional change was observed across the boundary, implying diffusive equilibration; the pyroxene inclusion was not equilibrated but diffusion in pyroxenes is slower [11]. These inclusions imply crystallization of olivine and pyroxene at depth and dissolution of both minerals prior to final crystallization. A similar sequence was previously described for EETA-79001A but with irregularly shaped olivine inclusions [12]. This sequence also generally fits with the “affinity” between SaU 005/094 and the lherzolitic shergottites discussed previously [7].
