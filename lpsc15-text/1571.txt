Introduction: Our goal is to create geodetically controlled high-resolution (1 m/pixel) Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) [1] narrow angle camera (NAC) [2] polar mosaics of the lunar north and south polar caps, poleward from 85° latitude. The final products of this effort will include controlled mosaics of all useful and useable images and "illumination" controlled mosaics made at every 10° of solar longitude. Similar mosaics were previously made under the Lunar Mapping and Modeling Project (LMMP) [3]. However, they [4] were only from 85.5° poleward (going to 85° increases the area by 23%), using a smaller number of images. They were also not optimized to allow the creation of separate mosaics showing solar illumination changes. Further, we have corrected some problems in the control network used for the previous mosaics and have improved our image tie-pointing methods and network solution parameterization. Illumination Mosaics: There will be 36 mosaics for the north and south poles, at every 10° of solar longitude. We are evaluating whether to make one or two types of mosaics in each case, including averaged mosaics and mosaics with the best illuminated images shown in front of other images. Note that doing such averaged mosaics (see Figure) is only possible when the images are controlled to the sub-pixel level, thus allowing images to be co-added, increasing the SNR in low light conditions and showing all areas ever illuminated (at least while the images were collected). With 148 possible mosaics at 1 m/pixel, 32 bits/pixel, each mosaic is ~86 GB in size for a total volume of ~13 TB. The final mosaics and updated geometry information (SPICE [5]) will be archived to the Planetary Data System (PDS). These mosaics will provide many benefits for science, engineering, exploration, and for supporting future mapping and global lunar reference frame improvement efforts. The high resolution and accurate registration properties will be useful for identifying small scale permanently shadowed regions (lunar cold traps) or areas of lengthy solar illumination (ideal sites for future exploration [6]), targeting observations by future missions (e.g. [7]), detailed surface characterization and landing site assessment [8], geological and resource mapping, and change detection. Other Benefits: This work also helps improve capabilities for the development of further large controlled mosaics, as well as provide information on what critical tools will need to be developed in advance of such work [9]. These products can also be used to characterize the precision and accuracy of a priori LRO SPICE data and possibly to provide further geometric calibration of the LROC and LOLA instruments. The updated SPICE (orientation, or C kernel) data could also be used to improve the LRO Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) [10] results. For example, improved orientation data would allow for a new type of "crossover" adjustment of LOLA data with controlled simultaneous NAC images.   Figure: Area (at 85.°588N, 123.°159E) in north polar cap showing 7 images (top) in an uncontrolled averaged mosaic vs. (bottom) a controlled averaged mosaic. Note blurring and doubling of some features in the top image with offsets up to 165 m. The scale is 3 m/pixel. Current Solution Statistics: Control solutions are being performed with the USGS ISIS software package [11] and in particular the jigsaw application [12]. We have completed preliminary control network solutions for both poles, but are making further improvements by checking and updating tie-pointing measurements, and evaluating the usefulness of either problem images or images unlikely to contribute much to the illumination mosaics (e.g., those with solar latitude on the opposite side of the equator or with very small areas of 1571.pdf

illumination). Images not used are tracked for future use, or for possible manual work to update an area of interest. These networks have not yet been constrained (controlled to ground in absolute coordinates). The following table shows the current network results: Current Solution North Pole South Pole Images 7,295 18,972 Points 374,025 1,648,933 Measures 2,414,102 13,900,384 Std. Dev. (pix.) 0.37 3.9 (prelim.) Max. resid. (pix.) 3.29 ~700 (prelim.) Technical Problems Encountered: Numerous problems have been encountered but they have been largely addressed for the current purposes. Problems include a) manual checking of high residual tie points; b) manual measures needed to be added for some "island" images (i.e. with few areas of illuminated overlap with other images) including 26 images in the north; and c) some images have not been successfully controlled because they are blank (532 in the north), or they are part of an island and the images do not overlap. We are also still assessing the best way to winnow out bad data near the edges of images and in shadows when the mosaics are generated. This caused black line artifacts in the previous LMMP best-resolution image on top mosaics, and is still causing similar artifacts for such mosaics as well as for averaged mosaics. Comparison to Other Networks: Due to the significant increase in the number of images used, these networks are substantially larger than the original LMMP networks, and in terms of the total number of control points and measures, comprise the largest solar system control networks ever done, possibly including terrestrial networks. Only a final global THEMIS IR controlled mosaic [13] is likely to exceed these networks in size in the next several years.

For example, we have tried to illuminate LOLA gridded digital terrain models (DTMs) and do image matching to LROC images (at 20 m/pixel). Such matching failed due to the lower resolution of the illuminated DTMs, although this could be attempted again with improved LOLA models that incorporate more data. We now plan to use NASA Ames Stereo Pipeline [15] routines that are to be available soon. Algorithms have been successfully developed for matching between LOLA track data and Apollo Metric camera images and are being adapted to do matching to NAC images. We plan to install this software at USGS and create tools to use the matching information for comparison with or in our network solutions, in the latter case redoing our solutions with the LOLA tie information constrained appropriately to the accuracy of the LOLA track data. Plans: This year we plan to finish the initial full north and south pole solutions, create preliminary averaged mosaics and test 10° illumination mosaics, and derive LOLA-based control points for comparison. In 2016, we will complete final solutions tied to LOLA points, make final mosaics, archive products to the PDS, and document the work with a journal article. Future Needs: This work serves as a reminder of the need for developing cartographic processing tools for even larger mosaics. Examples are the global THEMIS IR work or the likely global coverage of the Moon at 2 m/pixel with LROC images - with a need to possibly control well over 1 million NAC images - as opposed to the ~26,000 images being worked here. Previous recommendations [9] regarding the need for doing NASA cartography planning and developing such tools still stand. Acknowledgements: This effort is funded by the NASA Lunar Advanced Science and Exploration Research program, and builds on early funded efforts by the LRO Participating Scientist Program and LMMP. We also acknowledge the tremendous work and effort by LRO mission and the LROC and LOLA personnel, without which this work would not be possible.  References: [1] Vondrak et al. (2010) Space Sci.
