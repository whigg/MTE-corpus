Mass loss as a driving mechanism of tectonics of EnceladusLeszek CzechowskiUniversity of Warsaw, Faculty of Physics, Institute of Geophysics, ul. Pasteura 7,02-093Poland (lczech@op.pl/Fax: +48-225546882) SummaryThe mass loss from SPT is the main drivingforce of the following tectonic processes on Enceladus:subsidence of SPT, flow in the mantle and motion ofplates.1. IntroductionEnceladus, a satellite of Saturn, is the smallestcelestial  body  in  the  Solar  System  where  volcanicactivity is observed. Every second, the mass of ~200 kgis  ejected  into  space  from  the  South  Polar  Terrain(SPT) - Fig. 1. - [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].Figure 1: The jets from 'tiger stripes' in the South PolarTerrain on Enceladus (after NASA PIA10355). The  loss  of  matter  from  the  body's  interiorshould lead to global compression of the crust. Typicaleffects  of  compression  are:  thrust  faults,  folding  andsubduction. However, such forms are not dominant onEnceladus. We propose here special tectonic model thatcould explain this paradox. 2. Subsidence of SPT and tectonicsThe volatiles  escape from the hot region through thefractures forming plumes in the space - Fig.1. The lossof  the  volatiles  results  in  a  void,  an  instability,  andmotion of solid  matter  into the hot  region  to  fill  thevoid. The motion includes - Fig. 2:(i) Subsidence  of  the  'lithosphere'  ofSPT.(ii) Flow of the matter in the mantle. (iii) Motion  of  plates  adjacent  to  SPTtowards the active region. If  emerging void is being filled by the subsidence ofSPT  only,  then  the  velocity  of  subsidence  is  ~0.05mm·yr-1.  However,  all  three  types  of  motion  areprobably  important,  so  the  subsidence  is  slower  butmantle  flow  and  plates'  motion  also  play  a  role  infilling the void. Figure 2: A scheme of suggested processes in theactivity center (after [6]).Note that in our model the reduction of the crust area isnot a result of compression but it is a result of the platesinking.  Therefore  the compressional surface  featuresdo not have to be dominant. 3. Models of subsidenceThe  numerical  model  of  suggested  process  ofsubsidence is developed. It is based on the typical set ofequation:  Navier-Stokes  equation  for  incompressibleviscous liquid, equation of continuity and equation ofheat  conduction.  The  Newtonian  and  non-Newtonianrheologies  are  used.  The  preliminary  results  of  themodel  indicate  that  the  the  subsidence  rate  of  ~0.05mm·yr-1 is possible if we assume Newtonian rheologyof the ice. For non-Newtonian rheology more probablevalue  is  ~0.01  mm·yr-1.  In  this  case  the  velocity  ofmotion of the 'mantle' material is higher. 2030.pdf

4. Experimental model Fig. 3 presents the map of the STP (left hand part of thefigure).  One  can  see  the  low  polygonal  regionsurrounded  by  the  characteristic  'arcs'.  In  thelaboratory  model  we  observe  the  regular  pentagonalplate (model of STP) sinking in viscoelastic material.Its rheology corresponds to assumption that icy platesare warm enough to creep like glaciers. The right handside of the Fig. 3 presents the situation 150 hours afterbeginning of sinking. The most of the plate is alreadycovered by the material - the size of the plate is givenby  the  yellow  double  arrow.  Note  'kinks',  that  areformed  above  vertices  of  the  plate.  Contrary  toexpectations (the viscoelastic material behaves like thefluid for the considered time scale) these 'kinks' appearto  be stable  features.  This  fact  suggests  that  'plates'adjacent to the SPT could behave like a glaciers.Figure  3.  The  image  of  STP  (left  hand  side,  afterNASA). Model of subsidence is on the right part of thefigure. (after [6]).  5. ConclusionsOur hypothesis  is  a natural  consequence  of observedmass loss. In our opinion this mass loss is a main factordriving tectonic motions. Of course, it does not excludesome form of solid state convection in the icy mantle,but in fact this convection is not needed. The time of operation of this form of tectonics is notknown.  There  are  some  observations  suggesting  thatthe activity in the STP is now decreasing. The periodicchanges  of  activity  are  possible.  Other  observationssuggest  that  in  the  past  there  were  other  centers  ofactivity similar to the present STP [1]. The indicationof the future activity centers is less certain. However,the ovoid-shaped depression up to 2 km deep, of size200×140 km with the center  at  200E, 15S is a goodcandidate - Fig.4 [7, 8].AcknowledgementsThe research is partly supported by National ScienceCentre (grant 2011/ 01/ B/ ST10/06653).
