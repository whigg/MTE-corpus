We have been studied on carbon formation from reformed rocks of carbon-bearing compounds naturally and artificially, because any carbon-rich materials are usually difficult to be separated by normal condition of fluids and rocks. Recently we have reported preliminary that many examples of carbon-rich grains can be obtained at collision explosions in Earth's atmosphere by meteorite showers of the Nio and Chelyabinsk meteorites [1, 2]. The purpose of the present paper is to elucidate the formation of carbon-rich grains formed by meteoritic showers in air.     Carbon-rich grains of the Chelyabinsk meteorite: The Chelyabinsk meteorite (LL5) fallen recently (15th February, 2013) showed meteoritic shower which have been collected many "fragments" of ca. 400 pieces on the fields (ca. 3.5kg in total). The samples in this study are collected at Deputaskiy, Russia (Nos.CH-19 to 21) and unknown field (sample No.CH-50 similar to No.CH-20) [2] as follows.       1) All fragments are mainly changed by the collected grains on the ground caused by the meteorite shower processes of carbon-rich (No.20), mixed (No.19) and complete new fragments (No.21) as shown in Figs.1 to 3.       2) Sample No. CH-19 which is largely mixed with chondrite and carbon shows iron-rich sulfides, carbides and isolated carbon-bearing grains, where irregular void- rich textures shows larger evaporating process in local sites (Figs.1-3) This indicates that meteorite shower produces carbon-rich grains which was reported from the comet and/or previous sediments of impact sites [2].    Fig. 1. Electron micrograph of the Chelyabinsk meteorite with void-rich texture to show local quenched process.           3) Sample No. CH-20 shows primordial chondritic composition with considerable carbon contents which is irregularly mixed with chondrite and carbon.    4) Sample No. CH-21 which is not primordial meteorite of chondritic materials shows SiC in composition. This indicates that meteorite shower produces single grains of moissanite SiC which was previously reported from the cosmic dusts and original sediments of impact sites [2].  5) All exploded fragments in air contain significant carbon contents with the analytical FE-SEM (JEOL) instrument. However, carbon-separation to show the most carbon-rich grains (>80%C) are only obtained at the completely mixed sample (No.CH-19) among partial melted sample (No.CH-20) and re-melting crystalline material SiC (No.CH-21) [2].      Fig. 2. Electron micrograph (compositional images) of the sample Chelyabinsk (CH-19 in this study) with analytical scanning electron-microscope (FE-SEM) shows carbon separated grains by complete evaporation process by meteorite explosion in air [2].

Carbon concentration sites: Terrestrial carbon sources are considered to be complicated from the deep interior to shallow surface in active planet Earth, though there are no consideration on sources of meteoritic asteroids concentrated on meteoritic shower explosions in air (not from terrestrial rocks) as shown in Fig.6. The present results are considered to be new carbon- concentrated source within Earth's air by meteoritic shower process, which might be clues for carbon materials on the air planet of the Solar System [2, 3].

Summary: The present study is summarized as follows:      1) Carbon separation and concentration process can be found at explosions of meteorite shower in air of the Chelyabinsk (Russia) and Nio (Japan) meteorites.     2) The present results suggest that two meteorite shower produce carbon-rich FeS and moissanite SiC grains which were considered to be originated from the comet and/or previous sediments of impact sites [2].    3) Carbon concentration process by explosions of meteoritic is considered to be new site and sources between extraterrestrial and terrestrial locations.     4)  The present result can be explained new carbon   source of impact-related sites (without any remained craters or meteorites).
