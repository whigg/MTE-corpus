Introduction: Kasei Valles is the largest channel system on Mars with a length of ~3000 km, ~500 km width, and a depth of ~3 km It is widely believed to have been carved by catastrophic floods of water originating from Echus Chasma during Mars' early history [1-3]. Ages based on crater counting statistics place the initial channel formation in the Hesperian between 3.6-3.8 Ga, with fluvial activity possibly continuing to 2.6 ± 1 Ga [4]. The Kasei channels likely formed through a complex interplay of volcanic, tectonic and surface processes, including formation mechanisms ranging from lava flows to glacial scouring [1]. Here, we reexamine the channels and focus our analysis for evidence of episodic vs. sustained fluid flow for the creation of island/bars located east of Sharanov Crater (Fig. 1; 28°N, 55°W). We measured island/bar aspect ratios to determine their likely method of formation and to calculate potential maximum water elevations, measured cross-section elevation profiles of the channel to determine channel dimensions, and applied a bedrock erosion model based on the measured values to determine ranges for formation timescales, discharge rates and sediment fluxes. Methods: We used a combination of topographic datasets in ArcGIS to measure island/bar aspect ratios, to constrain channel cross-sectional width and depth (HRSC [5]) and to determine regional/local channel bed slopes (MOLA [6]). We cross-referenced with images from HRSC, CTX, and HiRISE to determine island/bar morphology, and to identify features of water flow such as terraces. Measured values were used to calculate discharge and bedrock erosion rates following the model of Sklar and Dietrich [7].  Figure 1. HRSC images and topography [5] (H1015_0000, H1004_0000, H0100_0009) of study area with 300 m contours and a location of a cross-sectional profile.  Islands/Bars: We first identified and measured the length (L), width (W), and height (H) of islands/bars within Kasei Valles (limited to areas of HRSC coverage). These forms were analyzed through imagery and topography by measuring aspect ratios (L/W, Fig. 2). All island/bars measured are teardrop shaped, thinning in the inferred downstream direction. This shape minimizes drag and therefore can have a diagnostic L/W value associated with steady or long-lived flow conditions (Fig. 2) [8]. Aspect ratios varied from 2 to 8.5 with a median value of ~3.6 (n = 43), slightly higher than that determined for similar forms in Athabasca Valles, L/W = 2.5 (n = 11) [9]. We also measured aspect ratios of several types of islands on Earth for comparison. These include islands in perennial rivers such as the Columbia on the WA/OR border and the Rakaia river in New Zealand, an ephemeral river in the New Mexico desert, lava formed islands on Hawai'i, and glacial drumlins in Saskatchewan. We also compared with values determined previously for Kasei island/bars based on Viking imagery and those for streamlined forms in the Channeled Scablands [10]. Overall, the measured island/bar aspect ratios are comparable to Earth islands formed by sediment deposition. They diverge from islands formed by: scablands-type erosion, which have a median L/W = 2.5 [10]; lava flows, which are not streamlined; and glacial drumlins, which are not teardrop shaped and have L/W = 1.7-4.1 (Fig. 2) [11]. The island/bars in Kasei were likely constructed through a combination of sediment erosion and deposition via overtopping in flood stages [8]. This implies the maximum island height is indicative of the water depth during deposition and therefore constrains flow depths for erosion modeling.  Figure 2.

Also plotted for comparison are streamlined forms from the Channeled Scablands [10] (green), alluvial bars for selected perennial rivers on Earth (blue), and a combination of ephemeral rivers, lava islands, and glacial drumlins (purple), compared to drag calculations of streamlined alluvial bar forms [8].   Bedload Erosion Model: We used the Sklar and Dietrich [7] model to calculate erosion rates (Fig. 3): 2/322/1 2111 **08.0                  f st sc stv bw uq qq kgYR E  where E is erosion rate in mm/yr; Rb=ρs/ρw-1 represents the buoyant density of sediment where sediment density (ρs) = 2900 kg/m3 [12], water density (ρw) = 1000 kg/m3; g is gravity (3.74 m/s2); Y, kv, and σt are rock strength parameters; qs is the sediment mass flux per unit width, where channel width (W) is measured from the profile (30 km in most models); τ* is the nondimensional form of the boundary shear stress which depends on ρw, g, W, flow depth (Hw, from islands/terraces) = 10-300 m, grain diameter (Ds) = 0.1 m [13], and slope (S, measured) = 6x10-4; and τc* is the non-dimensional critical shear stress (0.045).  Figure 3. Example output of erosion model with changing sediment supply rate (x-axis) and water depth (lines) at a fixed grain size, notice a the maximum erosion rate for a water depth of 150 m.  Previous research derived catastrophic fluid discharge rates of 105-109 m3/s [1,13-14] assuming a bulk sediment concentration of ~40% by volume [15]. Our calculated fluid discharge is on the order of 106-108 m3/s, similar to previous work. The peak, instaneous erosion rates are 0.01-41 mm/yr for water depths between 14-300 m (Fig. 4), assuming an average grain size of 0.1 m [13]. Using channel depths of 300-800 m and assuming the continuous bedrock erosion under constant flow, the minimum timescale of formation is 103-107 yrs, several orders of magnitude larger than previous estimates [13-14]. These erosion rates corresond to sediment fluxes of 105-106 kg/s. The time-integrated, erosive sediment volume is 1013-1014 m3, indicating sediment concentrations 0.01-7% by volume, orders of magnitude lower than previous estimates.  Figure 4. Calculated time to erode a 800 m channel based on peak erosion rates (right axis, red circles) from Fig. 3 with corresponding water discharge rates (left axis, blue squares) and sediment concentrations (right axis, purple diamonds) for various water depths and sediment supplies at a fixed grain size (0.1 m) and channel width (30 km).  Conclusions and Implications: The analyzed morphology and aspect ratios of the island/bars in Kasei Valles are most similar to islands forming in perrenial rivers on Earth today. This implies that the island/bars in Kasei were likely constructed through a combination of sediment erosion and deposition in long-lived flows. If we assume a warm, wet early Mars, it would require continual erosion over 40 Myr to bring the channel to its current depth (~800 m). This scenario is unlikely as significant (peak) erosion only occurs in the beginning of a flood stage, conditions unlikely to persist for 40 Myr. However, if we envision a scenario with intermediate glacial and wet periods tied to obliquity cycles, where liquid water was present (i.e. the surface temperature was high enough to produce ice melt) 15% of a cycle (~500,000 yrs), it would take 300 Myr to erode an 800 m deep channel. If the erosion began ~3.64 Ga, channel formation would be done by ~3.35 Ga, consistent with estimates of crater count ages [4]. These are minimum timescales of formation, as they are based on ideal parameters. It would likely take well over 300 Myr to create a channel system this size suggesting a reevaluation of sediment and water budgets over Mars' history. References: [1] Carr (1979) JGR, 84, 2995-3007.
