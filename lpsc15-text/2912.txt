Lonar Crater, India: An analog for Mars in the field and in the laboratory            S.P. Wright,           Planetary Science Institute, Tucson, AZ   Introduction: “There is no perfect analog for Mars on Earth” (1st line [1]). The primary geologic processes on Mars are basaltic volcanism, sedimentation, impact cratering, and alteration. The 1.8 km diameter Lonar Crater in the state of Maharashtra, India includes morphological features of cratering and impactite deposits. The pre-impact strata consisted of fresh basalt overlying aqueously-altered basalt. Geologic History/Stratigraphy/Samples: Lonar Crater is a young (~570 ka) [2] impact site emplaced in ~65 Ma Deccan basalt, which is an excellent analog material for Mars with ~45-50% labradorite and ~35% augite/pigeonite before lower flows were altered and then shocked. In ejecta, both fresh and aqueously- altered basalt are found as impact breccia clasts in a ~8 m thick lithic (relatively unshocked; “throw out”) and ~1 m suevite (all ranges of shock pressure; “fall out”) ejecta. Two geologic histories are possible at Lonar after the initial basaltic volcanism: 1.) the alteration of impactites/glasses of a range of shock pressures (“post- impact alteration”), which likely increase the rate of alteration where compared to pristine, igneous miner- als, and 2.) the existence of altered basalt protoliths (“pre-impact alteration”) now vitrified as in-situ brec- cia clasts or float. Both geologic histories have impli- cations for the discoveries of alteration minerals found solely in Martian ejecta blankets with remote VNIR data. Alteration minerals are briefly listed here, and these mirror those suggested for Mars: chlorite, serpen- tine, zeolites, hematite, palagonite, calcite.  Two as- pects of studies of Lonar Crater can be described: fieldwork and sample analyses. Fieldwork demon- strates that underlying, altered basalt (by groundwater) is only exposed in the ejecta due to impact. Otherwise it would be at depth and not available to the field geol- ogist (or rover). There are two goals of sample anal- yses performed for Lonar Crater samples: 1) those that characterize the mineralogy and geochemistry (petrog- raphy, XRF, XRD, SEM) for detailed descriptions of what the samples were and are, i.e. the determination of the state of alteration of the protolith and constraints on the amount of shock pressure received, and 2) those that mirror spectral and instrumental analyses sent to Mars  via  rovers,  such  as  TIR,  VNIR,  Mossbauer, LIBS, APXS, and, again, XRD. Merit:  Lonar includes mineralogical signatures of alteration in basaltic ejecta and a crater-floor breccia deposit: phyllosilicates and aqueous alteration.  Impac- tites are found as shocked and melted rocks in a lay- ered ejecta blanket. On Mars, we must be able to un- ravel the geologic histories of sedimentary rocks, al- tered rocks, and soils.  Evidence for the climate history is reflected in the alteration of materials in the ejecta blanket. The erosion processes producing gullies on crater walls can also be studied on the rim and interior walls at the site. The basaltic lava flows of the target and interflow deposits are analogous to the Martian crust. The engineering merit of the Lonar site includes the preservation of ejecta topography of a simple im- pact crater. The site can support tests of drilling into ejecta blankets and exploration tests on the surface and excavated cross sections of ejecta.                                                   Figure 1.

Suevite drapes a lithic breccia unit in localities throughout near-rim ejecta.
