Introduction:  It is widely accepted that silicates are present mainly as amorphous phase in circum and interstellar regions and also in protoplanetary disks (e.g., [1]). The presence of amorphous silicates as GEMS in cometary dust (e.g., [2]) and in the matrix of some carbonaceous chondrites (e.g., [3]) suggests that amorphous silicates are one of the most primitive materials in the early solar system too. It has been proposed that molecules such as H2 and ice were formed by surface reaction on amorphous silicate dust in molecular clouds [4]. Some organic materials might also be formed by Fischer-Tropschtype reaction [5] on amorphous silicates as well as metallic iron in the early solar system. In order to understand the detailed processes and rates of these surface reactions, experimental work has been made. However, many experiments have been done on the substrates of metals or simple oxides although some experiments were done using amorphous silicate substrates (e.g., [6]). In the present study, amorphous silicate films were made by using different physical vapor deposition (PVD) methods (radio frequency sputtering deposition (SFSD), pulsed laser deposition (PLD), and electron beam physical vapor deposition (EBPVD)) for preparing substrates for surface reaction experiments that mimic processes in molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks. Target and substrates:  Sintered forsterite was used as targets in the present PVD experiments because Mg and Si are the major elements in the amorphous silicate dust. About 1% of Al2O3 is contained as impurity in the target (a product of Nishimura Porcelain Co., Ltd.), which was used in the RFSD and PLD experiments. Several materials were prepared for the substrates. (a) Gold (Au/Ni/OFC): a disk of oxygen-free cupper (OFC) (10 or 25 mm in diameter and 2 mm thick) plated with nickel (~0.2 µm thick) first and then gold (~1.3 µm thick) (Fig. 1A). Gold is used as a reflecting surface for attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR) spectroscopy, which makes it possible to measure IR spectrum of a reaction product, such as organics, together with the amorphous silicate film. (b) Silicon (Si): a silicon plate with (111) surface (7×1 mm2 and 1 mm thick). Ice deposited on this substrate will be observed by an atomic force microscope (AFM). (c) Aluminum (Al): a disk of aluminum (25 mm in diameter and 2 mm thick). H2 molecules formed from H atoms absorbed on this substrate will be examined. (d) Corundum (Co): a corundum plate with (0001) surface (10×10 mm2 and 0.5 mm thick). (e) Soda lime glass (Gl): a slide glass plate. (f) Cupper (Cu): a cupper plate. (e) and (f) were used as a reference. PVD experiments and results:   RF sputtering deposition (RFSD).  Amorphous silicate thin films were grown in Ar plasma (45 W) at Osaka University (SVC-700RF, Sanyu Electron Co., Ltd.). Pressure during the deposition was ~60 Pa with the base pressure of <7×10-4 Pa. The film thickness was changed by changing the distance between the substrate and the target (Ds-t = 220-600 mm) and the duration (60-240 min). Growth temperature for the film was not controlled. Relatively a wide area (~50 mm) can be deposited. The film surfaces were observed using FE-SEM with EDS (JEOL JES-7001F). Some cross-sections were observed using FE-TEM/STEM with EDS (JEOL JEM-2001F) after micro sampling of ultra-thin sections by FIB (FEI Quanta 200 3DS).  The films on   Figure 1. Amorphous silicate films formed by RFSD. (A) BF-TEM image (Au/Cu/OFC substrate, DS-T=60 mm, 240 min). (B) SEI-SEM image (Au/Cu/OFC substrate, DS-T=22 mm, 120 min). (C) SEI-SEM image (Co substrate, DS-T=32 mm, 60 min). (D) SEI-SEM image (Si substrate, DS-T=32 mm, 60 min).  the Au/Ni/OFC Au/Ni/OFC substrate were measured by ATR-IR (Perkin Elmer Spectrum One). The film surface on the Si substrate was also observed by AFM. Films 140-300 nm in thickness were deposited. They are amorphous silicate based on the SAED patterns (Fig. 1A). Minor amount of MgO was also detected in runs with short Ds-t (220-320 mm) probably due to high temperatures of the substrates. IR absorption of amorphous silicate (10 and 16.75 µm) was detected. Mg is depleted relative to Si in the films (Mg/Si~1.2-1.4). Oxygen is almost stoichiometric although detailed analysis was not made. The surface morphologies of the films are different on different substrates. Aggregates of particles from 100 to a few hundreds nm in size were observed on the substrates of Au/Ni/OFC (Fig. 1B) and Al. The surfaces are almost flat consisting of aggregates of very fine particles <100 nm in size on the substrates of Co (Fig. 1C), Gl and Cu. Spheres ~1 µm in diameter, which may be splashes condensed in a gas, were rarely observed on the two types of films. In contrast, the films on the Si substrate have blisters with different sizes (from < 1 to a few tens µm). In runs with short Ds-t (220-320 mm) blisters became large and burst (Fig. 1D). Pulsed laser deposition (PLD).  Experiments were made at Natural Institute for Material Science (NIMS: COHERENT Compex Pro 50). KrF excimer laser (λ = 248 nm) with a pulse width of 20 ns, a repetition rate of 5 Hz, and an averaged fluence of about 1 J/cm2 was irradiated on the forsterite targets with DS-T of 50 mm for 90 min. Growth temperatures for the film was not controlled. Pressure during film growth was 1×10-3 Pa with O2 gas flow or 1×10-5-1×10-6 Pa without gas flow (the base pressure was3×10-7 Pa). In contrast to the RFSD experiments, only a limited area (~10 mm) can be deposited. The run products were examined by SEM, TEM/STEM and ATR-IR. Amorphous silicate films 150 nm in thickness were deposited. SAED pattern of any crystals was not detected. IR spectrum was consistent with amorphous silicate. Mg is depleted relative to Si (Mg/Si~1.3). The surface morphologies are almost the same as those in the RFSD experiments except for the Si substrate, where any blisters were not observed and the surface was almost flat consisting of aggregates of very fine particles ~ a few tens nm in size. Splashes were more abundant than in the RFSD experiments.  Electron beam physical vapor deposition (EBPVD).  Experiment was made at Research Institute for Electronic Science, Hokkaido University (SANVAC ED1500R). In this experiment, Rh was first deposited on the Co substrate using a Rh target to make a reflecting surface for ATR-IR, and then amorphous silicate was deposited using the forsterite target. The target materials were held in ZrO2 crucibles. The base pressure was ~10-5 Pa. Deposition was finished when the thicknesses became 60 and 30 nm on a film thickness meter for Rh and forsterite, respectively, with the rate of 0.0010.006 nm/s. The run product was examined by SEM, TEM/STEM and ATR-IR. The TEM observation with EDS analysis showed that the thickness is 110 nm for Rd film but only 30 nm for amorphous silicate film, which contains a large amount of Zr used as the crucible. Silicate features were not detected by the IR measurement. Discussion and concluding remarks:  In the present study, amorphous silicate films 100-300 nm in thickness were successfully obtained by the RFSD and PLD experiments except for the RFSD experiments using the Si substrate. The EBPVD experiment is not suitable at the present state for our purpous. The chemical compositions of the films (Mg/Si~1.3) were different from that of forsterite (Mg/Si=2) even in the PLD experiments, in contrast to previous PLD experiments, where amorphous silicates of olivine solid solution stoichiometries with small amount of excess oxygen were obtained by using olivine targets [7]. The reason for the Mg/Si fractionation in the present study is unknown. The surface morphologies are different on different substrates although the reason is not known. Slightly rough surfaces consisting of aggregates of particles on the substrates of Au/Ni/OFC and Al mean that their large surface areas are of advantage for reaction on these surfaces. Blisters appeared on the Si substrates. It seems likely that blisters did not form by mild PLD, while they formed and finally burst by intensive RFSD. Some physical properties of the substrate may be responsible for the blister formation. However, the values of electric resistivity, thermal conductivity and thermal expansion for Si are in between those for metals (Au/Ni/OFC, Al and Cu) and ceramics (Co and Gl). The atomic radius of Si (111 pm) is smaller than the ionic radius of O2- (140 pm) and this misfit may cause the blister formation (the atomic radii of Au, Al, Cu are ~130-140 pm).
