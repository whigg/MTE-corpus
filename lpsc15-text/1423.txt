WATER AND CHLORINE ABUNDANCE ALONG THE TRAVERSE OF CURIOSITY ACCORDING TO DAN MEASUREMENTS.  I. G. Mitrofanov1 and M. L. Litvak2, 1Institute for Space Research, Profsojuznaja str. 84/32, 117997 Moscow, Russia, imitrofa@space.ru, 2Institute for Space Research, Profsojuznaja str. 84/32, 117997 Moscow, Russia.   Introduction: The presence of water molecules in the soil of Gale Crater is thought to be the direct evidence for existence of a water reservoir in the crater a long time ago. Layered sediments over the Gale Crater floor are thought to have accumulated in past epochs, when episodes of water inflow and evaporation took place in the crater. The layers of water-bearing minerals contain the history of these episodes of sedimentation. Studies of such water-bearing minerals is the goal of DAN investigation onboard the Curiosity rover.  Instrumentation: DAN is a Russian-contributed instrument on MSL (see [1, 2]), which addresses the need for these measurements. It uses a method of active neutron sensing of the shallow subsurface. DAN has a pulsing neutron generator (PNG), which produces 2 microsecond pulses of 14.1 MeV neutrons at a frequency of 10 Hz; there are about 107 particles in each pulse. One active measurement is about 15 minutes long; therefore, 1011 neutrons are radiated for active neutron sensing at each spot.  High-energy neutrons penetrate down into the subsurface and follow a random walk through interactions with soil nuclei.  They change direction and decrease in energy at each interaction: the diffusion of neutrons takes place in the subsurface, and is accompanied by a moderation of their energies. A large fraction of neutrons leak out from the surface, producing the dynamic albedo of neutrons (this process gives the name of the DAN instrument). The post-pulse emission of albedo neutrons takes place during a time interval varying randomly from several hundred microseconds up to several milliseconds. Due to the random character of moderation of individual leaking particles, the flux of postpulse neutrons has also a broad energy distribution from an upper limit that of approximately the initial energy of the injected particles down to the thermal energy for neutrons (i.e., those particles, which were moderated down to thermal equilibrium with the soil).  The efficiency of the moderation process is known to depend on the presence of hydrogen in the soil because during a neutron-hydrogen collision, the light nucleus of hydrogen atom (a proton) takes about the same recoil energy, as the scattered neutron. When the content of hydrogen is increasing in the soil, more neutrons are leaking with thermal energy (and, correspondingly, less particles are outflowing with epithermal, or higher energy). Also, the post-pulse emission of thermal neutrons depends on the content of elements with strong neutron absorption; the chlorine is shown to be the most important of them [3, 4]. Therefore, the measurement of time profiles of post-pulse emission of thermal and epithermal neutrons allow to test the presence and hydrogen and chlorine in the irradiated soil. Results. The data analysis of the DAN investigation is presented for 375 individual spots of active mode measurements along 9700 meters of the traverse over the period of 837 sols in the Gale crater. The totality of DAN data shows that both water and chlorine abundances vary significantly along the traverse. It is found that a model of constant water content with depth has to be rejected for practically all tested spots, while a twolayer model, with different water contents in the top and bottom subsurface layers, is supported by the data. The data analysis shows that all three model parameters, the top water content, the bottom water content and the depth of the bottom layer, vary along the traverse. On the other hand, the single-layer model works well for the chlorine abundance at practically all tested spots, which means that the content of chlorine does not vary with a depth down to subsurface, but still varies along the traverse.  According to the DAN data, the majority of testing spots has the so-called direct water distribution, where the drier top layer, with about 0.5 - 2.0 wt% WEH (water  equivalent hydrogen), lies above the wetter bottom layer with more (much more at some spots) than 2.0 wt% WEH. The content of chlorine, as the substituting equivalent for all absorbers, varies along the traverse between 0.5 wt% up to 2.5 wt%. Comparison of DAN results with other instruments findings: DAN data is compared with data from APXS and SAM for all drilling sites [4, 5]. In particular, for Rocknest, John Klein and Cumberland spots, there is rather good agreement between DAN and APXS for chlorine, and between DAN and SAM for water (see Table 1). The average water content 2.2 - 2.4 wt% WEH found by DAN at John Klein and Cumberland sites is consistent with 20 wt% phyllosilicate abundance found by ChemMin [6]. The content of water in phylloosilicates is thought to be about 10 wt%, so, the product of   these two fractions leads to the bulk water content of ~2 wt%, in agreement with DAN. Discussion: There are no well-seen trends along the traverse of the water and chlorine abundance in the crater Gale. On the other hand, DAN detectes less water and more chlorine in the Gale's soil than one could suspect based on the HEND orbital data onboard the Mars Odyssey [7, 8].

SAM and APXS, which are contact and direct analysis instruments, should not be considered problematic. The probing mass for DAN is orders of magnitude larger than the mass analyzed by SAM and APXS. In this sense, the remote sensing observations by DAN and the direct analysis by SAM and APXS are highly complementary and provide important information at multiple scales.  References: [1] Litvak M.
