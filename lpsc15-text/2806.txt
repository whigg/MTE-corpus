ABSORPTION OF SOLAR ENERGETIC PARTICLES BY MARS: FIRST RESULTS FROM MAVEN R. J. Lillis1, D. L. Larson1, J. G. Luhmann1 and B. M.

Introduction: One of the main goals of the MAVEN mission is to understand the response of Mars' upper atmosphere to solar inputs.  One of the most important (if irregular and episodic) inputs is that from solar energetic particles (SEPs), primarily in the form of protons.  In order to understand how SEPs interact with the upper atmosphere, we need to characterize their angular distributions and how those distributions change with energy.  An SEP event tightly beamed along the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) affects only the hemisphere around where the IMF is normal to the surface and a very sharp SEP 'shadow', whereas an isotropic event will result in a much more diffuse shadow [1].  Therefore, studying SEP shadows gives an important window into the character of a given SEP event.  Figure 1: cartoon showing that  shadowing of SEPs by Mars is energy dependent due to their different gyroradii.    SEP shadows observed by MAVEN.  When Mars is in the SEP field of view, high-energy particles are preferentially blocked because their paths are closer to straight lines.  Lower energy particles can take curved paths into the detector.    References: [1] McKenna-Lawlor et al., EPS, 2012.  2806.pdf
