Because H in the upper atmosphere isultimately derived from the breakdown of water in thelower atmosphere, H escape is an important loss process for the initial water inventory of Mars. H escapealso provides a potential source of oxidizing power tothe Martian atmosphere and surface, provided it is notbalanced by the nonthermal escape of O from the atmosphere.Historically, measurements of the Martian H coronahave been intermittent, making it difficult to establishwhether variability in the H escape rate exists and quantify its potential causes. Before Mariner 9, it was anticipated that seasonal variations in the H corona wouldmanifest as a consequence of the changing lower atmospheric water inventory [2], but observations gatheredin the winter of 1971/72 showed little variation in theFigure 1: Insertion orbit composite map of the Mars Hcorona. Observations made during the high-altitude insertion orbit allow unprecedented high signal-to-noisemaps of the H corona out to 10 Mars radii.brightness of the corona, despite a global dust storm andnear daily coverage of the corona over a two month period [3]. Combined with the discovery of the lower atmospheric odd-hydrogen cycle in the same year, theseobservations led to the interpretation that exospheric His sourced from molecular H2, whose decades-long photochemical lifetime buffers short-term changes in the Hescape rate [4, 5]. Later observations made by Mars5, SPICAM on Mars Express, and ALICE on Rosettadid not challenge this interpretation, owing to a lack ofhigh-cadence seasonal measurements, particularly during Mars Southern summer [6, 7, 8].In late 2007, coordinated observations made usingHST and SPICAM observed a factor of two change inthe brightness of the H corona, well-correlated with theend of Southern summer and the perihelion egress ofMars, as well as the decline of the 2007 global duststorm [9, 10, 11]. More recent observations in a seasonal HST campaign have revealed a brightening ofthe Mars corona during Southern spring and perihelioningress, consistent with a seasonal variation in the hydrogen inventory of the corona and the escape rate of Hfrom Mars [12].These observations indicate that H escape varies bymore than an order of magnitude as a function of season, setting the stage for MAVEN measurements of theH escape rate over the course of its one-year primarymission. Observations made by MAVEN during its primary mission will cover the majority of southern summer on a 9 hour cadence, providing for the first time auniform high-resolution database of the time-variationof the H corona at Mars.Observations: MAVEN observes the H corona withits remote sensing platform, the Imaging UltraVioletSpectrograph (IUVS) [13]. IUVS simultaneously observes in the FUV and MUV, covering 115-330 nm intwo separate channels. Lyman alpha is the brightest signal in the FUV airglow of Mars, and is ubiquitous in ourobservations. During MAVEN’s 35-hour insertion orbit,special observations were made that allowed large scalehigh signal-to-noise mapping of the H corona to a distance of 10 rMars, as shown in Figure 1. For the 4.5hr primary science orbits, the instrument is pointed inertiallyacross the elliptical spacecraft orbit during inbound andoutbound legs. Spacecraft motion carries the instrumentboresight across altitudes in the range 0-3000km; derived brightness profiles are shown in Figure 2.Because these observations are optically thick, theirinterpretation requires forward modeling and radiative2190.pdf

Initial results fromthis processing and the escape rates derived will be presented and placed in context with prior observations described above.Implications for Water Loss History: MAVEN’sdriving goal is to understand the history of atmosphereand volatile loss to space over the past 4.5 Billion years.Such an understanding is only possible through a comprehensive characterization of the processes at work inthe atmosphere today, so that these processes can beprojected into the past. Thermal H escape may be thedominant mechanism removing water from the Martianatmosphere today, but determining the total amount of Hremoved by this process over Martian history is likely tobe complicated by many factors, including the climateand solar forcing history of the atmosphere.H escape today exhibits a strong seasonal dependence,which is likely derived from seasonal variations in theamount of water vapor at high altitude [16]. Percentlevel changes in the total column due to detached upperatmospheric water layers can drive order of magnitudechanges in H escape on a timescale of months, providing a convenient connection between lower atmosphericdynamics and H escape in the corona of Mars.In order to understand the impact of the altitude distribution of water vapor on the H escape rate, simultaneous observations of coronal H and the altitude profile oflower and middle atmospheric water are required.References: [1] D.
