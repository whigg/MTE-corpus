Introduction:  Titan is the only other known planetary body besides the Earth with stable liquids on its surface. In addition, it possesses a massive N2 atmosphere with CH4 as the second most abundant constituent. Methane displays a meteorological cycle in Titan's troposphere [1], and is thought to be a major compound in the surface liquid reservoirs. The principal product of methane photolysis in Titan's stratosphere and ionosphere is ethane, which condenses and accumulates on the surface, forming bodies of liquid according to photochemical models [2]. Titan's dense nitrogen atmosphere and hydrocarbon lakes, together with the high solubility of N2 in both methane and ethane [3] result in N2 dissolution in surface liquids. The exact composition of Titan's liquids, however, is still poorly known. Vapor-liquid equilibrium calculations with activity models [4], Regular Solution Theory [5, 6] and Statistical Associating Fluid Theory [7] are some examples for approaches in use to estimate lake composition. Though, in the absence of extended datasets at Titan relevant temperature and pressure conditions, the used thermodynamic and kinetic parameters are often uncertain, extrapolated values. Using our recent work on experimental measurements of evaporation rates and liquid compositions under simulated Titan conditions [8, ref. lpsc abstract for mixtures], we present preliminary results on the thermodynamics and kinetics of N2 dissolution in liquid hydrocarbons under cryogenic conditions relevant to Titan's surface. Methods: The experiments were conducted in a facility specifically designed to simulate Titan's surface [10]. The simulation chamber is the same that has been used for previous experiments on hydrocarbon evaporation [e.g 8] and spectroscopy [11]. Titan relevant temperatures are achieved with flowing liquid nitrogen through various parts of the chamber, and a pressure of 1.5 bar is maintained with N2 gas. Sample gases (C2H6 and CH4) are then condensed and introduced into a petri dish connected to an electronic scale. Mass loss over time, along with the temperature, are continuously recorded over the course of the experiment.  In this work we use previous evaporation data obtained for pure CH4 [8] and C2H6-CH4 mixtures [9] and focus the study on the initial plateau section of the curves (Fig. 1) where N2 dissolution is expected [9].     Figure 1: Experimental data for pure methane. A. Mass versus time showing the plateau zone after CH4 pour, from 0 to 2000 s followed by the steady-state evaporation. B. Similar data after linear correction for the steady-state part. The increase of mass during the plateau zone is attributed to the dissolution of N2 in liquid methane.   Results: To obtain a first order estimate on the amount of N2 dissolving in liquid methane and ethane-methane mixtures, we make the following assumptions: 1. N2 only dissolves in methane. While N2 is soluble in both methane and ethane, it is ~ 5500 times more soluble in methane at 100 K and 1 bar [12]. Furthermore, there is no observable N2 dissolution in the data for pure C2H6 liquid [9]; hence, we assume it is negligible compared to the role of methane. CH4 evaporates with the same rate over the duration of the experiments. N2 dissolution is then estimated from mass conservation, i.e. the amount of CH4 evaporating is approximately equal to  the amount of N2 dissolving, causing the horizontal plateau (Fig. 1A). Pure methane and mixture evaporation rates are determined from a least-square fit to the steady-state portion of the mass vs. time curves [8, 9] (Fig. 1A). Then the deviation from this initial evaporation rate (the plateau section) gives the theoretical amount of N2 dissolved (Fig. 1B).  Initial CH4:C2H6 mole fractions Mole fraction of  dissolved N2 Average temperature of the  liquid (K) Average temperature of chamber atmosphere (K) 1.00:0.00 0.34 N/A 93.7 1.00:0.00 0.14 N/A 93.7 0.86:0.14 0.11 89.4 90.4 0.85:0.15 0.09 90.8 91.1 0.80:0.20 0.02 93.8 93.6 0.74:0.26 0.01 91.5 90.9 0.00:1.00 0.00   Table 1. Amount of estimated N2 dissolution in CH4-C2H6 mixtures at various initial concentrations. Temperatures are averaged values over the duration of the plateau in each experiment.   Based on our preliminary study, there is a correlation between increasing methane concentration and the amount of N2 dissolving (Table 1) from 1% at 74% CH4 to 34% for pure methane. Though, there is some discrepancy in the obtained values between the same methane mole fractions, e.g. pure methane showing 14 and 34% dissolved N2 (Table 1). Nevertheless, our results clearly show that N2 is more soluble in methane than ethane. Such behavior would also explain why the evaporation rates of CH4-C2H6 mixtures are systematically slower than predicted by pure binary mixture theory [9]  Figure 2. Mole fraction of dissolved nitrogen N2 as a function of the initial mole fraction of methane in the mixture. We observe an exponential increase of N2 solubility with increasing methane above 0.7 mole fraction of CH4.   Discussion: Various thermal processes are expected to occur over the part of the data this study is focused on, and the nature of the plateau is probably more complex than solely N2 dissolution. Right after condensation, while N2 is dissolving, the system is also attempting to reach equilibrium. Thermal transfer was shown to play a role in the case of pure methane experiments [8], which together with evaporative cooling would contribute to the plateau appearance of the initial portion of the mass vs. time curves. Furthermore, if methane is not thermally buoyant over the plateau region, it will not evaporate with the same rate as it does over the steady state part. Based on the combination of these effects and previous experimental results for pure methane [8], a scenario where N2 dissolves faster than the time span of the plateau and the initial evaporation rate of CH4 seems more plausible. In this case, methane and nitrogen would both evaporate (Fig. 1A) until a metastable equilibrium is reached. These results are very important for current and future studies of Titan surface. Indeed it has been suggested that methane could undergo evaporative cooling due to its fast evaporation rate. However, N2 could also act like an antifreeze. Alternatively, ethane evaporates very slowly and should not be subjected to evaporative cooling, although it freezing temperature is not affected by nitrogen. However, it is possible that some "ideal" mixture of methane and ethane could easily freeze on Titan, creating possible albedo variations on the surface [13].  Hence, the assumptions made in this study only allow us to provide an upper bound to the amount of N2 being dissolved. Further detailed analysis will enable more accurate estimates of N2 dissolution in Titanrelevant mixtures at cryogenic temperatures. Particularly, we will investigate if the solubility of N2 is only function of the concentration of CH4 or if C2H6 has an effect through ternary mixtures.
