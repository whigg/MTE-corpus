Summary:  A finite element model is developed to estimate the magnetic induction by the metallic core in Venus.  Introduction:  The deep layers of Venus are usually modelled from the Earth's structure as scaled to the mass and radius of Venus, but the parameters of these layers, including the size of the Venusian core, remain unknown [1]. Magnetic sounding provides a means to estimate the size of the metallic core using measurements by past and ongoing Venus missions. One approach of magnetic sounding is to measure the induced dipole moment of the core at low altitudes. The induced dipole moment develops because in reality the magnetic field cannot remain steady for a sufficient amount of time to diffuse completely into the core. This approach has successfully found that the size of the lunar core is approximately 400 km in radius [2]. The magnetic field induced by the lunar core was measured by the Apollo 15 and 16 sub-satellites when the Moon entered the uniform magnetic field in the lobes of the Earth's magnetotail. In principle, the concept of magnetic sounding can be applied to Venus and Mars, but the background magnetic fields at these two planets have more complicated geometries [3]. At Venus, the solar wind interaction with the planet develops a magnetic sheath draped over the sunlit side of the planetary ionosphere and stretching in the anti-sunward direction. Mars has a similar induced magnetosphere plus further complications due to the strong crustal remanent fields. Thus, the analytic calculation of the magnetic induction by the core as done in previous lunar studies is no longer applicable in these more complicated settings. Finite Element Model:  The purpose of this study is to develop the numerical tools for calculating the magnetic induction within the Venusian magnetosphere. As a first attempt, our analysis is focused on a simplified two-dimensional geometry in the noonmidnight meridian. A current sheet with a thickness of 150 km is assumed to start from an altitude of 300 km on the dayside and extend to the nightside in the tail direction. Another current sheet with a thickness of 300 km is located at the center of the magnetotail. The current density on the magnetopause is highest at the subsolar point, gradually dropping to half of its value at the terminator and remaining constant along the tail. The magnetic field follows the magnetostatics equations and is bounded by the included magnetosphere, and the core is considered to behave as a perfect conductor. The calculations are performed using the finite element method [4] that considers the above assumed geometry and the boundary conditions. Figure 1 demonstrates the finite-element mesh for the modeled domain for the scenario where the core radius (RC) is half of the radius of Venus (RV). The mesh contains approximately 8000 nodes, and the number of nodes varies slightly with the core size.   Figure 1. Finite element mesh in the noon-midnight meridian, including regions for the core, the rest of the planet, and the current sheets along the magnetopause and in the magnetotail.  Magnetic Induction due to a Metallic Core:  Figure 2 presents the calculated magnetic field vectors in the noon-midnight meridian, and the result is consistent with the anticipated magnetic field within the induced magnetosphere: The magnetic field lines drape around the core on the dayside, and the field is more aligned to the tail direction at locations past the terminator. To estimate the magnetic field that can be detected by spacecraft, Figure 3 plots the estimated directions of the magnetic field as a function of the solar zenith angle of the spacecraft at an altitude of 200 km. Four scenarios with different core radii (or r = RC/RV) are considered. The results show that the magnetic field is nearly horizontal on the dayside, and the magnitude of the dip angle increases when the spacecraft enters the nightside. For the solar zenith angles between 90 and 145, the dip angle slightly decreases with the core size. The magnetic field becomes nearly vertical at largest solar zenith angles. For the solar zenith angles greater than 145, the dip angle rises faster when the core radius is greater, because the magnetic field direc tion is altered more when the distance between the core and the central tail current becomes shorter.  -25000-20000-15000-10000-500005000 -8000 -6000 -4000 -2000 02000 4000 6000 8000 X [km] Z [ km ]Magnetic Field Vector Figure 2.

Future Work:  The above estimation can be improved by incorporating realistic values of electric currents within the induced magnetosphere. The calculations can be extended to three-dimensional space to estimate the magnetic induction not only in the noonmidnight meridians but also at other local times. We will include these improvements in our follow-up studies for future comparisons with satellite observations and estimation of the size of the Venusian core. References: [1] Aitta A.
