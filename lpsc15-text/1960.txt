In ten years, more than 100 targeted flybys of Titan have been performed. We focus our study on the analysis of the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) data set, with a particular emphasis on the atmospheric polar features. First evidences for a vast ethane cloud covering the north pole have been detected as soon as the second targeted flyby in December 2005 [1]. The first detailed imaging of this north polar feature with VIMS was obtained in December 2006, thanks to a change in inclination of the spacecraft orbit [2]. At this time, the northern lakes and seas of Titan were totally masked to the optical instruments by the haze and clouds, whereas the southern pole was well illuminated and mostly clear of haze and vast clouds, allowing the observation of Ontario  Lacus with optical instruments. Subsequent flybys revealed that the extended north polar cloud system was progressively vanishing around the equinox in 2009 [2,3,4], in general agreement with the predictions of Global Circulation Models [5]. It revealed progressively the underlying lakes to the ISS and VIMS instruments. With the ongoing season transition, the first evidence of a major change on the opposite side of Titan occurred in May 2012, with an atmospheric vortex growing over the south pole, at an altitude of ~300 km (Figure 1).   Figure 1 : First evidence of an atmospheric feature over the south pole, as seen by VIMS during T83 (22 May 2012) and T84 (6 June 2012) flybys.   Mapping of the south pole with VIMS: In order to systematically characterize this newly forming feature, we have computed global hyperspectral mosaics of the north and south poles of Titan for each of the targeted flybys. We used VIMS wavelengths sensitive both to clouds and surface to produce synthetic RGB false color maps. Figure 2 displays examples of these orthographic maps centered over the south pole.    Figure 2 : VIMS orthographic mosaics centered over the south pole of Titan, using a false color composites with the red, green and blue channels controlled by the reflectance at 4.78 µm, 2.89 µm, and 2.00 µm respectively.   The T23 flyby in January 2007 shows a typical example early in the Cassini mission, where no particular feature is observed over the sunlit pole, except very localized outbursts of methane clouds (yellow arrow). After the first detection at T83 and T84, the southern polar vortex is systematically observed during each flyby, as shown for example by the red arrows in the set of maps from T86 to T101 in figure 2, acquired with different viewing geometries and illuminating conditions.   Spectral signatures:  The detection of HCN ice signatures in VIMS spectra of the northern polar hood has been first described in [6]. The presence of HCN spectral signatures within the southern vortex has also been recently reported in [7].    Figure 3 : typical VIMS spectra within the south polar vortex (up) and outside of the vortex (bottom), acquired during the T91 flyby. Spectral signatures of HCN appear in the form of diagnostic peaks near 3.21 µm and 4.78 µm.      We systematically find such spectral signatures within the vortex in all the maps presented in figure 2, as shown for example in the reflectance spectra displayed in figure 3. The upper plot has been extracted from a region within the vortex, observed at T91 in May 2013. The bottom plot, shown for comparison, has been taken outside of the vortex during the same T91 flyby. The main difference is the presence of diagnostic peaks near 3.21µm and 4.78 µm, which is suggestive of HCN species. As noted by [6], these spectral features are due to either solid or liquid HCN. This occurrence is probably due to the decrease of solar irradiation at the south pole after the equinoxe, which could give rise to a cold winter pole [7].   Conclusion: With still 20 targeted flybys to go before the end of the solstice mission planned in April 2017, Cassini will be able to monitor the continuous evolution of the southern vortex during the progressive transition from autumn to winter.
