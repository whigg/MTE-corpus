Introduction:  Cordierite  is  an  extremely  rare phase in lunar rocks. The mineral was documented as a minor  phase  in  the  Apollo  15  spinel  troctolite 15295,101 [1] and as a single inclusion in spinel from the  Apollo  17  spinel  cataclasite  72435  [2].  In  lunar meteorites  cordierite  has  never  been  found  before. Here we report on an occurrence of cordierite in the Dhofar 025 lunar feldspathic meteorite. Methods:  A polished thick section of Dho 025 was studied  using  traditional  methods  of  optical  and electron microscopy (JEOL JSM-6610LV with a Gatan MonoCL4 CL system). Chemical compositions of the mineral  phases  were  measured  using  a  JEOL JXA8530F and Cameca SX100 microprobes in Vienna. Results:  Dho 025 is an anorthositic impact melt breccia  containing  mineral  and  lithic  fragments  set within a glassy impact melt matrix [3]. Lithic clasts of anorthositic,  noritic,  gabbro-noritic  and  troctolitic composition are common. Two clasts of VLT basalts were found as well. Most of the lithic clasts are impact melt  breccias  and crystalline impact  melts.  However granulitic  and  cataclastic  rocks  are  present  as  well. Coarse-grained  lithic  clasts  with  a  possibly  primary texture are rare. Recrystallization is typical for many lithic fragments of the Dho 025 meteorite. Pyroxene is mainly  orthopyroxene  En53-94Wo1-5,  pigeonite  and augite  En39-74Wo5-45.  Olivine  is  Fo61-95.  Plagioclase  is An93-98.  Accessory minerals are Al-Ti chromite, spinel, ilmenite, troilite, Fe-Ni metal.  It should be noted that Dho 025 is moderately weathered and has one of the oldest terrestrial ages among lunar meteorites [4]. One grain of plagioclase (150x280 µm in size) set within the impact-melt matrix of the meteorite contains an  inclusion of  polygonal  shape (43x50  µm in size) (Fig. 1,2a). The inclusion has mostly a sharp boundary with  the  host  plagioclase.  One side  of  the  inclusion contacts with the impact-melt matrix of the meteorite. The  inclusion  consists  of  symplectite  intergrowths cordierite and an Al-rich phase (<1 of µm in size) that is  too small  for a precise analysis  but appears to be pleonaste.  The cordierite  composition is presented in Table  1  and  corresponds  to  the  formula Mg1.78Fe0.26Al4.02Si4.93O18 Mineral  modes  of  the inclusion  are  87  wt.%  cordierite  and  13  wt.% pleonaste. Host plagioclase is An97  containing 0.2-0.3 wt.% FeO and 0.1 wt.% MgO. A CL study shows that the core of this plagioclase is shocked whereas the rim does not have any shock features (Fig. 2), suggesting the post-shock formation. Table 1.

Fig.1. BSE image of the cordierite-pleonaste inclusion (cordierite - dark-grey; pleonaste - bright).   Discussion:  In  MG#  cordierite  of  Dho  025  is lower  than  that  of 15295,101 and  similar  to  that  of 72435 but has a little higher Ca content than two other lunar cordierites (Table 1). Соrdierite is a low pressure phase and can be formed in spinel  troctolites with a lowered Ca content [6]. At a higher pressure cordierite reacts with olivine to produce high Al orthopyroxene and spinel according to the reaction: 5Mg2SiO4(Fo) + Mg2Al4Si5O18(Crd) = 10MgSiO3(En) + 2MgAl2O4(Spl) [5]. The reaction has been used to estimate PT conditions of  formation  of  the  spinel+Al-rich  orthopyroxene association  [5,6].  Thus,  it  can  be  suggested  that  the Dho 025 cordierite-bearing plagioclase grain could be a  fragment  of  a  spinel  troctolite.  However,  the PT conditions of  formation  of  the  source  rock  of  the plagioclase fragment cannot be calculated because the chemistry of co-existing mafic phases is unknown. Another  possibility for the origin of the Dho 025 cordierite can be suggested by taking into account the cordierite-spinel  symplectite.  Such  symplectites  are unknown in lunar rocks but are common in high-grade terrestrial rocks and their formation is usually ascribed to  cooling  and/or  decompression  following  a metamorphic  peak.  They  are  also  known  from metamorphic  rocks  in contact  with  igneous  rocks which are believed to be  the  result of reaction with a melt  [e.g.  7].  Compositions of  the  terrestrial symplectites  have not  been  reported  but  the  bulk composition  of  the  Dho  025  cordierite-spinel symplectite  (Table  1)  corresponds  to  the  formula Ca0.01Na0.01Mg0.83Fe0.20Al2.04Si1.94O8  that is very close to the Mg-analog of anorthite (MgAl2Si2O8). This phase is  unknown in  the  nature  but  was  synthesized  by  a solid state reaction at 1300ºC [8]. The field of stability of the phase has not yet been determined but we can suggest that the phase possibly exsolved from the host anorthite  and  then  decomposed  into  cordierite  and spinel. However, the morphology of the inclusion does not look like the result of an exsolution. Acknowledgements:  This study was supported by Russian Academy of Sciences (Program #22).
