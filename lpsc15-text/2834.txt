Early thermaland collisional processes affected such planetesimalsto varying degrees depending on the time scale and dynamics of early planet growth. Recent observationshave revealed that many large (>~1000 km in diameter) trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) exhibit features ofcrystalline water ice in their surface spectra, as well asspectral features of more volatile ices [1, 2]. There is also increasing evidence now that multiplesystems exist among icy body populations and are incomplex physical states, which should owe theirprovenance to large disruptive collisions between atleast partially differentiated bodies [3, 4, 5]. The internal differentiation and surface composition of objectsin these systems depends not only on their impact history, but also on the thermo-chemical alteration modes.These telltale observations should be accounted forwhen considering the alteration history and bulk processing of dwarf planets and their icy-rocky progeny.Our approach is aimed at addressing the following issues: (i) What processes led to the observed diversityof dwarf planets?; (ii) How much internal heat isgained and retained through radioactive decay andepisodic large collisions?; (iii) What should be the relative abundance of organic molecules and volatile ices(CO, CH4, N2 etc.) that survive during the early violent evolution of the outer planetary disk? Modeling Issues: Our initial model for an the objects in question is that of a porous aggregate of  various volatile compounds (as ices or trapped gases) andrefractory silicate-metal solid grains, comprising thebulk matrix [6]. Chemical compositions for these objects are taken from existing simulations of chemicaland dynamical evolution of disk material [7]. The keyvolatile species (e.g., H2O, CO, CO2, NH3, CH4) arealso the most commonly observed in comets [8], whichare remnants of such an early planetesimal population. Thermal and chemical internal evolution is examined self-consistently, as the abundances and locationsof all species evolve, and we record mass ratios, temperatures, pressures and porosity variations [6, 9]. Thepresence of volatile species in the interior can affectthe overall heat balance and accompanied phase transitions [9, 10]. Another important factor involvingvolatiles, mostly water ice, is the effect of shock-induced melting and vaporization on the fragmentationand flow regimes within the body, during massive collision events [11, 12]. To explore the effects of collisions on the internal distributions of volatiles, we conduct 3D numerical simulations of collisions betweenicy-rocky bodies. We utilize both the CTH shockphysics code [13] and a version of the SPH code GADGET2, which was modified to handle tabulated equations of state, and has been used previously in simulating giant planetary impacts [14, 15]. Results: We follow a long-term thermal evolutioncalculation (~1 Gyr), through the bulk alteration oftemperature, porosity and composition for icy dwarfplanets (>1000 km in diameter). Some initial configurations result in a complex, differentiated structure.Fig. 1 shows a snapshot of the internal temperature,porosity and composition profile for a 1000 km-radiusbody, at the end of a long-term calculation. We can seea complex, differentiated structure, where the deep interior holds a few percent of water melt fraction, whilethere are shallower layers that can retain conditions forvolatile ice preservation (CO2 and HCN, for this specific model). There exists a distinct separation betweenthe warmer interior, which is much more compactedand hydrous, and the colder exterior, which is muchmore porous and stratified. If an evolved object, suchas this, is subject to a massive collision, the effects ofpartial melting and porosity quenching may actuallyserve to trap more volatile species. This means that thedeep interior will not necessarily experience extremealteration. Such an effect could even be more pronounced for porous or partially-differentiated objects. Fig. 2, top panel, shows a snapshot of an SPH collision simulation of two differentiated ice-rock bodies(colors denote rock, hydrated mineral rock and waterice). The composition is roughly similar (rock/ice massratio = 2.5), with the target having D = 1200 km andthe impactor's D = 600 km. The collision is oblique (45deg.) at a v = 1 km/s (quiescent Kuiper beltconditions). We see that through the collision eventthere are several smaller fragments being ejected thatare predominantly icy or rocky. The end distribution ofmaterial closer and on the surface is much less homogeneous than the initial composition and includesmuch larger fractions of rock. The bottom panel of Fig.2 shows the pressure conditions experienced by the icecomponent (“crust”) of the target. Pressure regimes forwater ice are denoted by colors as pore crush strength(0.1 GPa), incipient water ice melting (1.6 GPa) and2834.pdf

complete water ice melting (3.48 Gpa) [12]. We seethat the overall melt fraction is small (~ 1%) and mostof the work is spent in porosity quenching. This compaction can be effective at increasing thermal conductivity and reducing flow permeability. We focus on understanding the effects of differentcollision regimes (e.g., merging, disruption, hit-andrun, and graze-and-merge) on early volatile preservation. These regimes include potential family-formingcollisions between differentiated bodies [16]. In the future, such results can be used to estimate the cumulative effects of multiple impacts.
