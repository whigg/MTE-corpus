Introduction:  The North Pole of Mars is capped by seasonal carbon dioxide ice deposits during Martian winter and a residual water-ice snowpack during the spring and summer. The water-ice sublimates during spring and summer, thus contributing to Martian cloud formation [1]. In summer, it is observed that the waterice snowpack experiences grain growth. The grain growth processes are poorly understood, however ice sintering processes are probably the largest contributers to the observed ice grain growth [2]. In an effort to begin replication of grain growth in the lab and inspire future instrumentation for exploration on Mars, we constructed an ABS plastic, 3Dprinted simulation chamber and observed water-ice grain growth under Earth conditions. One application of this to the Martian climate is a proposed LIDAR, Atmospheric/Surface Experiment at Nightitme (ASPEN) [3], that would orbit Mars with capabilities to simultaneously address topics such as mapping of cloud structure, mapping of large-grained CO2 ice in the polar night, discriminate between H2O and CO2 ice on the surface, monitor the spring and summertime retreating polar caps for signs of entrained "sublimation flows" caused by subliming CO2 ice, as well as a number of other functions [3]. Laboratory Design:  Thermo-Electric Cooler (TEC). To condense water vapor and grow ice, a TEC was obtained from Adafruit Industries. The TEC includes a small, rectangular peltier attached by thermal paste and foam to an aluminum heat sink and fan (figure 1A). The lowest temperature achieved by cold surface of the peltier was -5° C, however this was observed to be dependent upon the ambient temperature of the room as well as the exposure of the fan to cooler air. Camera. A 1024 x 1024 resolution camera took images of the peltier surface through a 1 inch lens mounted either in a horizontal or vertical position depending on the position of the TEC.  3D-Printed Chamber. The 3D-printed chamber was designed to fit the needs of a low-cost, simple laboratory set up for observation of ice-grain growth, with future plans for spectroscopy and polarimetry experiments. Rhino 3D, a commercial modeling software that utilizes a NURBS mathematical model was used to design the chamber[4]. The final design was a hollow box with a 2-inch circular cutout on the top for taking camera images, a 1 inch circular cutout on the front side with a ledge for a 5mm thick, 1 inch diameter window for spectroscopy and polarimetry experiments to access ice samples in the future. It also included a half-circle cutout on the bottom of the left side for wires from the peltier and a temperature sensor to leave the chamber. It was made of  grey ABS plastic, as available from the NASA Ames' Space Shop. It was sized to fit to the 90 x 90 mm heat sink of the TEC (figure 1B). Experiments:  Once the chamber was designed and implemented in the lab, a number of different experiments were performed. For each, the camera was set to take one image every minute over a period of 7 hours for each experiment. In-between experiments, leftover ice and water was removed from the peltier to start over with as dry and flat a surface as possible. 1. Blank Peltier. Water vapor condensed upon the peltier of the TEC and froze, averaging at about -2° C. The ice grains were very fine, stacking to make a smooth, flat mound of ice on the peltier estimated to be around 12mm thick upon inspection a day later. Small white grains were observed, but the growth was mostly transparent. Water had collected upon the top of the heat sink, indicating that the ice growth had reached a maximum height before the ambient temperature began to melt the top of the ice, causing the liquid to run off the sides on to the heat sink.  2. Ice Cubes. Instead of using just the water vapor from the lab, store-bought ice cubes were placed on the peltier. They immediately adhered to the cold surface and eventually water vapor condensed and froze upon peltier and the ice cubes themselves. The ice cubes appeared to grow outward from the structure they were already in, expanding layer by layer with small, fine ice grains (figure 2).   3. Water Droplets. For this experiment, water was dropped from the tip of a screwdriver in small, spherical droplets onto the -1° C surface of the peltier. Upon hitting the surface, most retained their spherical shape and adhered immediately. Others "splattered" or stuck flat in a circle, unable to retain their shape if the droplets were too large or accumulated too much momentum        Figure 1A.                   Figure 1B. Figure 2.  when dropped (figure 3A).   After the 7 hours, the droplets had frozen and increased in size (figure 3B).  4. Addition of Conductive Material. In the interest of adding a conducting material to the flat surface of the peltier, a penny was placed on the surface. Water was allowed to condense on the penny, and did so in a pattern reflecting the shape of Lincoln's head and facial features (figure 4A). What appeared to be bubbles condensed around the edges of the penny as well, and later froze into round ice grains, with smaller patterns in the areas between two round ice grains. The water on the face of the penny froze in the patterns it condensed in and the grains grew outward from those shapes (figure 4B). 5. Addition of an Insulating Material. Two plastic buttons were placed on the peltier to act as insulators from the cold surface. Water condensed on top of the buttons, but not as quickly as upon the rest of the peltier, and it did not freeze. In the holes of the buttons, however, ice grain growth was observed from the surface of the peltier all the way to the top of the button and above (figure 5).   Discussion: Though a number of different experiments were performed to stimulate different types of ice growth, variables that were not controlled for were observed to contribute to the variances in ice growth as well.  The ambient temperature in the lab proved to be a very significant factor. If the lab was allowed to rise in temperature due to heat produced from the TEC or from lack of air conditioning on a warmer day, the ice samples would result in smooth, fine grains and an overall transparent ice slab on the peltier, due to a cycle of melting and refreezing in accordance to temperature rise and fall, as indicated by this graph of average particle size of the ice sample per minute:   The overall trendline indicates ice grain growth, however the peak at around 9:53pm and following trough a minute later, indicating that a large metling event occurred very quickly.  Conclusion: We have investigated water-ice grain growth inside a 3D-printed chamber. The next steps for this experiment are to closely examine the ice growth at different ambient temperatures, improve water vapor deposition via changes in the sample chamber, and to perform polarimetry and spectroscopy experiments on ice inside the sample chambers.
