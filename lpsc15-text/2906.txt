DEVELOPMENT OF INTERCRATER PLAINS ON MARS.  R. P. Irwin III, Center for Earth and Planetary Studies, National Air and Space Museum, Smithsonian Institution, MRC 315, 6th St. at Independence Ave. SW, Washington, D.C. 20013 (irwinr@si.edu).   Introduction: Many publications have focused on Martian valley networks and stratified deposits that formed from around the Noachian/Hesperian boundary through the Late Hesperian Epoch [e.g., 1-3].  Studies of impact crater modification, however, show that most of the erosion on Mars took place earlier in the Noachian Period [4-6].  The concurrent development of extensive intercrater plains in the Martian highlands is a major unresolved issue that has received little attention since the early studies based on Mariner 9 imagery [7,8].  Interpretation of the geologic processes that shaped these areas is not a simple matter, due to the passage of time and the poor preservation of small diagnostic landforms.  Here we summarize some key observations of Martian intercrater plains and their implications for the Noachian paleoclimate. Classification of intercrater plains: The local morphology of intercrater plains varies between two end members.  At one extreme, some plains are heavily cratered at small diameters, reflecting both a lithology that is resistant to aeolian erosion and relatively little deposition of sediment through time.  At the other, some surfaces, most of which are confined to basin floors, are extremely rough at high resolution due to recent aeolian deflation.  The more common morphology is intermediate, with subdued small craters [9].  The latter areas presumably reflect little change in the surface topography since the Noachian Period, with impact cratering more or less balanced by aeolian resurfacing at local spatial scales. At regional scales, intercrater plains can be divided into nearly flat basin floors and sloping intercrater surfaces.  Neither of these surfaces is densely cratered  (Fig. 1) relative to Mercury, indicating that substantial resurfacing took place as heavy bombardment waned. Age of resurfacing: Based on the new global geologic map of Mars [10] and with individual outcrops in each unit lumped together, the sloping intercrater plains were last resurfaced during the Middle Noachian Epoch, between the impacts that formed the Isidis and Argyre basins.  Many highland crater floors and intercrater basins have a Late Noachian crater population, suggesting later substantial resurfacing [11]. Key observations: Perhaps the most fundamental characteristic of Martian intercrater plains is the reduction of relief in the landscape, which is found at all spatial scales.  At the kilometer scale, the infilling and loss of small craters are much greater than on the intercrater plains of the Mercury, which retain large populations of heavy bombardment secondaries (Fig. 2).  The original ejecta morphology of larger Noachian craters has been lost on Mars, and the highlands never developed dense valley networks.  At scales of tens to hundreds of kilometers, the rim reduction and infilling of impact craters also represents a loss of relief.   Fig. 1.

The net erosion of topographic divides and infilling of basins suggest that crater modification was gravitydependent.  Younger Noachian craters have both less infilling and less degraded rims than similarly sized, older craters that they superimpose, so crater modification was progressive with time [4], not limited to a brief period.  Moreover, floor deposits are often much younger than crater rims, so modification continued long after each impact and was not the direct consequence of the impact. Noachian Mars does not appear to have experienced a lot of fluvial erosion by Earth's standards.  In the multibasin highland landscape, most of the oldest basins have intact divides, showing that they never 2906.pdf

filled with water and overflowed.  The lack of dense fluvial dissection is mentioned above.  Moroever, the planform distribution of valley networks indicates ongoing control by crater topography, not evolution of well-developed drainage basins [1,12].  Valley networks incised older intercrater surfaces primarily around the Noachian/Hesperian transition, and earlier dissection is not well preserved in most areas. Discussion: The observations above are consistent with limited fluvial erosion of intercrater plains, but it was likely not the only effective geologic process.  Volcanism may account for some of the basin infilling, but not the rim erosion.  Impact cratering modifies older craters to some extent, but it increases the number of craters up to saturation, so it is not a means to eradicate small craters globally.  Nearly all Noachian craters <4 km in diameter are missing from the surface record [11,13].  Uniform airfall mantling is not consistent with the topographic distribution of net erosion at higher elevations and net deposition in lows [5]. In addition to some fluvial erosion, water is needed for weathering and reduction of the cratered crust to transportable particle sizes.  The extremely low weathering rates for basalt on present-day Mars demonstrate that more favorable conditions prevailed in the past [14].  Aqueous weathering would also facilitate aeolian erosion of promontories, and water may have enabled cementation of basin fill [15].  Thus water may have facilitated erosion by wind. These considerations suggest that Noachian Mars was wetter than Amazonian Mars but not nearly as wet as Earth.  Impact cratering was the main relief-forming geologic process, and aqueous weathering with slow aeolian and fluvial erosion helped to reduce that relief and smooth the intercrater plains.  Significant denudation of the landscape was rare except on steep slopes. References: [1] Pieri D. C. (1980) NASA TM81979, 1-160. [2] Malin M. C. and Edgett K. S. (2000) Science, 302, 1931-1934.
