Introduction:  The uppermost portion of regolith on airless bodies represents the boundary layer between the surface and space. This layer, typically less than 1 cm in thickness, is characterized by significant thermal gradients (~60K / 100 µm) that complicate the interpretation of spectral thermal emission remote sensing data. These thermal gradients exist within the optical skin depth and infrared emitting layer and make thermal emission from airless bodies wholly different from Earth and Mars (where the surface boundary layer is essentially isothermal). With a typical thermal skin depth of 10s cm, lunar diurnal observations offer little leverage on the properties of the regolith's upper millimeters. However, lunar eclipses have a much shallower thermal skin depth (Figure 1), providing critical insight. Here we use Diviner Lunar Radiometer observations, thermal models, and laboratory experiments to investigate spectral thermal emission from the regolith boundary layer during eclipse. Spectral Thermal Emission:  Multispectral thermal emission measured by Diviner has two primary components: (1) the intrinsic emissivity of the regolith driven by its composition, and (2) Planck radiation driven by regolith temperature. When present, vertical anisothermality (thermal gradients) and horizontal anisothermality (roughness, thermophysical differences) provide an additional slope to the emission spectrum [1,2,3,4].  During an eclipse there is no change in emissivity therefore observed spectral variations must be caused by temperature and anisothermality.  In this study we focus on rock-free areas to evaluate the problem in terms of temperature and thermal gradients.  Diviner Lunar Radiometer:  Diviner is the first multispectral thermal infrared instrument to globally map the surface of the Moon. Diviner has nine spectral channels to measure broadband reflected solar radiation and emitted thermal infrared radiation between 0.3 and 400 μm [5].   The data used in this study were collected during the October 2014 lunar eclipse. Diviner operated throughout the eclipse and collected nadir-pointing data and multi-orbit targeted observations of Kepler crater and a cold spot [6] near 3 N / -33.3 E [7] (Figures 2, 3). The spatial resolution ranges from 150 m to 1300 m in the current elliptical "frozen" orbit (since Dec 11, 2011). Calibrated Diviner data are available through the Planetary Data System (PDS) Geosciences Node.  Figure 1. The eclipse thermal wave is more than an order of magnitude shallower than the diurnal wave.  Experiments and Models:  We will validate the Diviner observations against laboratory measurements in simulated lunar environment (SLE) and thermal models. We will use the Simulated Lunar Environment Chamber (SLEC) at University of Oxford and the Simulated Airless Body Emission Laboratory (SABEL) at JHU/APL [8]. In these environment chambers, a particulate sample is heated (by conduction and/or illumination) within a cold radiation shield, under high vacuum.  SLEC and SABEL can create thermal gradients of variable magnitude and simulate the wide range of temperatures relevant to this study. This study uses modified versions of 3D ray tracing thermal models developed for the interpretation of Diviner diurnal data. These models are described in Paige et al., 2014 [7]  Summary:  This study will, for the first time, use multispectral thermal infrared remote sensing of a lunar eclipse, validated with laboratory experiments to investigate the structure of the regolith boundary layer.
