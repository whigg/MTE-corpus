The availability of samples offers a rare opportunity to construct a cosmic-ray exposure constrained by direct observations related to the meteoroid's size and recent orbital history. Towards this end, we report 26Al and 10Be activities of up to 10 Chelyabinsk (LL5) samples  Experimental methods: The samples analyzed were chips (57-110 mg) taken from the same specimens analyzed for noble gases [1,2] and/or Sm isotopes [3]. Samples were dissolved in a 4:1 (vol:vol) mixture of conc. HF and conc. HNO3. Be and Al were separated and prepared for accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) at Purdue University as described by [4].  Results: Results are shown in Table 1. Unusually high Mg contamination was observed in some Al samples prepared for AMS, leading to larger uncertainties of the 26Al activities of HR-4 and HR-9. The activities of both 26Al and 10Be vary by 1-to-2 orders of magnitude, but are well correlated (Figure 1). They also correlate well with the independently measured concentrations of 3He (R2≥0.99; Figure 1). Discussion:  We begin constructing a cosmic-ray exposure (CRE) history with the simplest hypothesis, a one-stage irradiation model and then comment on samples that do not fit the mold. Meteoroid size: The size of Chelyabinsk has been estimated to be 9-10 m in radius, r [5], which corresponds to a mass of 1010 kg (density=3.5 g/cm3) The mass collected to date amounts to only 103 kg.  In a one-stage history, the Chelyabinsk meteoroid must have been large enough to accommodate all the concentrations measured for the cosmogenic nuclides. 10Be and 26Al concentrations vary by factors of 97±32 and 61±15, respectively; the spreads are even larger for cosmogenic  3He (>400), 21Ne (>400), and 38Ar (300), but may be influenced by gas losses or prior irradiation. The ranges of variation, factors of ~40, modeled by [6] for a spherical meteoroid with a radius of 3 m are smaller. We conclude that the radius of Chelyabinsk was at least 4 m and regard 3 m as a firm lower limit. Table 1. Activities and inferred sample depths, d.

Modeled concentrations decrease from maxima at depths of ~15 cm to slightly lower values at the surface and to much lower values at depth of 5 m.     As radius increases, the maximum possible production rates decrease. For example, for r≥5 m, modeling gives P26,max≤38.5 dpm/kg and P10,max≤12.5 dpm/kg. With these maximum production rates and reasonable CRE ages (see below) it is difficult to reproduce the highest measured 10Be and 26Al activities. Thus either the mass calculations from fall phenomena measurements are too high, the measured activities are too high, the modeling results are too low, or the irradiation was complex. Cosmic ray exposure (CRE) age, T: Several onestage CRE ages have been presented: ~1.5 Ma (36Cl/10Be; [7]); ~1.2 Ma (36Cl/21Ne, [8]) and < 5 Ma (81Kr; [8]); and 1.2 Ma (21Ne in HR-7; [2]). The most precise of them places the T in a range comparable to the half-lives of both 26Al (0.7 Ma) and 10Be (1.38 Ma), implying that neither isotope reached its limiting (saturation) value. Under these conditions, we use the equation     10 26 10 10 26 26 , 1Be Al 1 TT r d eP P e            to calculate T for Chelyabinsk. P denotes a production rate either modeled for a sphere with radius r at a depth d, or empirical. From the slope of the best fit line of Figure 1 and ignoring the small intercept, we obtain 10Be/26Al = 0.20±0.01. Empirical values of P10/P26 are available for two large L or LL chondrites, namely, Gold Basin (R=3 to 5 m, N=15; [9]) and QUE 90201 (R=1.5 m, N=13; [10]), which give P10/P26 = 0.30 and 0.31, respectively. Ratios from [6] are comparable at 0.33, and vary little with depth. With P10/P26 = 0.31 we obtain 0.9≤T(Ma)≤1.4 Ma for 0.19≤10Be/26Al≤0.21 and a single best estimate of T26/10 = 1.2±0.3 Ma (N=7; σmean) or T26/10 = 1.03±0.14 Ma (N=5) excluding the extreme ages of HR-2 and HR-9. Similar calculations using the 3He/10Be ratios (Figure 1, lower panel) and a modeled value of P3/P10=0.745 (10-9 cm3 STP g-1 Ma-1/(dpm/kg), r=5 m; [6]) yield average ages of 1.38±0.27 (N=7) or 1.34±0.16 excluding HR-2 and HR-9. Because of the larger uncertainties associated with some 26Al measurements and the high sensitivity of T26/10 to small differences in the 10Be/26Al ratio, at this time we prefer the 3He/10Be CRE age of 1.34 Ma. CRE ages may also be calculated from 21Ne (or 38Ar. Correlations of 21Ne with 26Al (R2=0.44) and of 10Be (R2=0.76), however, are poorer with HR-4, 5, and 6 as noticeable outliers. Noting that Itokawa, Chelyabinsk, and Appley Bridge have CRE ages that are similar and unusually short for material with LL-chondrite composition, Meier et al. [11] suggested that a single collision produced all three objects. Orbital data are permissive if not strongly supportive of this hypothesis [12]. Textures and the Ar/Ar systematics of the three objects differ and the apparent CRE age of Itokawa may reflect erosion. If, nonetheless, the hypothesis of [11] is correct then the LL precursor was a very complex body. Sample depths: By using the model calculations of [6] for P26 and P10 and assuming a CRE age of 1.34 Ma, we can assign depths to the samples (Table 1).  Outliers: Figure 1 shows a tension between matching simultaneously the measured cosmogenic nuclide ratios (slopes of best-fit lines), and the high activities measured for some samples, which constrain the meteoroid's size. Nyquist et al. [3] argue that the high 3He/21Ne and 22Ne/21Ne ratios and high cosmogenic nuclide concentrations of HR-9 require the higher production rates characteristic of smaller meteoroids, r<1 m or perhaps of unusual exposure geometries.  HR-5 presents a different kind of problem. While intermediate concentrations of 26Al, 10Be, and 3He appear mutually consistent, the cosmogenic 21Ne and 38Ar concentrations are the largest reported for any Chelyabinsk sample and imply a CRE age of ≥1.8 Ma for r=5 m. Furthermore, by standard measures the 3He/21Ne ratio of HR-5 is at least 3 times lower than expected. A two-stage history involving a long irradiation at great depth followed by recent excavation and 3He loss is a possibility, although the 4He concentration of HR-5 does not appear to be unusually low. The 3He, 21Ne, and 38Ar concentrations of C3-2 scatter but are ~10× lower than those of the two samples closest in shielding depth, namely, 102-7 and 1036. 26Al and 10Be activities, in contrast, are only 2-4× lower.  Conclusions: Modeling of Chelyabinsk as an object 5-m in radius irradiated in one stage for 1.3 to 1.4 Ma adequately reproduces measurements of 26Al, 10Be, and 3He, for 10 samples. Inconsistencies with results for 22Ne/21Ne, 21Ne, and 38Ar for HR-5 and HR-9 may require a complex CRE history.  References: [1] Popova O. et al. (2013) Science, 342, 1069-1073. [2] Haba M.K. et al.
