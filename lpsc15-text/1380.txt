Initial results on the interior were published in [6]. With data from the primary and extended missions, the determination of the gravity field has been extended to spherical harmonic degree and order 1200. Lunar tidal Love numbers are determined and inner core signatures were sought.  The moment of inertia was published in [6]. Love numbers were published in [2,3,6]. This abstract discusses a search for an inner core and tidal dissipation.  Degree-1200 Solution:  The GRAIL mission gathered accurate tracking data between two Moon orbiting spacecraft [1]. The Primary Mission was 89 days long, from 1 March 2013 to 29 May 2013. The Extended Mission was 106 days long, from 30 August 2013 to 14 December 2013. Previous gravity fields of degree 660 [2,3] and 900 [4,5] have been described. In addition to a gravity field of degree and order 1200, solutions included parameters for lunar GM, degree-2 and 3 Love numbers, degree-2 tidal dissipation, inner core periodic signals, orbit states, solar radiation pressure, and periodic nongravitational accelerations. The final half-wavelength resolution is 4.6 km at best and 6.1 km globally.  Inner Core: An inner core could be detected from its gravitational field [7]. The axis of rotation of a solid inner core within a liquid outer core can be different from the axis of the mantle. With an axis of rotation tilted by a different amount than the mantle, inner core degree-2 harmonics would produce variable gravity as the core rotates. This would cause time varying C21 and S21 harmonics viewed in a mantle-fixed frame. The period would be 27.212 days. A search for variable C21 and S21 harmonics was one goal of GRAIL.  The GRAIL solutions include four parameters for the inner core. They consist of cos F and sin F components of the 27.212 day C21 and S21 coefficients, here called C21C, C21S, S21C, and S21S. The angle F is the mean angle from the orbit's node on the ecliptic plane to the Moon's direction. The degree-1200 solution with data from the entire mission finds the following unnormalized values for the 4 periodic coefficients.  C21C = (-6.2±7)x10-11  (1) C21S = (-7.8±7)x10-11  (2) S21C = (+3.3±5)x10-11  (3) S21S = (-3.8±5)x10-11  (4) The foregoing values and uncertainties are smaller than the original mission goal of 1.3x10-10.  Since the GRAIL gravity fields are anchored to the crust and mantle and the inner core has a different orientation, the inner core should produce variable gravity as it rotates. If the angle between the mantle and inner core orientations Im-Iic is small, then most of the inner core gravity field just adds on to the field from the rest of the Moon. Rotating the inner core field into the mantle frame gives small variable coefficients that depend on sin(Im-Iic). Expressions for the external gravity field were given in [7]. With inner core gravity field coefficients J2 and C22 (unnormalized) we derive  C21C = S21S  (5) W + J2 sin(Im-Iic) = -( C21S + S21C ) / 2  (6) sin(Im-Iic) C22 cos(2! ic ) = ( S21C - C21S ) / 4 (7) sin(Im-Iic) C22 sin(2! ic ) = -( C21C + S21S ) / 4  (8) tan(2! ic ) = ( C21C + S21S ) / ( C21S - S21C )  (9) where J2 and C22 are evaluated at the lunar surface, and τic is the longitude difference between the (equatorial) principal axes of the inner core and mantle. The W parameter allows for distortion of the mantle by a fluid core that rotates about an axis that is close to the normal to the ecliptic plane [8]. Parameter W depends on the size of the fluid core. From an approximate calculation W is estimated to be ≤13x10-11 (unnormalized), but is probably closer to 4x10-11 for a medium size core.  Weighted numerical combinations are    ( C21C + S21S )/2 = (-4.6±4.3)x10-11   (10)   ( C21S + S21C )/2 = (-0.1±4.3)x10-11   (11)   ( C21S - S21C )/2 = (-4.7±4.3)x10-11   (12) giving    τic = 22º (+11º,-30º)  (13)   C22 sin(Im-Iic) = (3.3±2.8)x10-11  (14)   W + J2 sin(Im-Iic) = (0.1±4.3)x10-11 .  (15) The most plausible solutions would have positive J2 and C22, but since W is positive, the value of (15) is near zero, and the value of (14) is positive, the central values do not satisfy this criterion. It is necessary to introduce deviations comparable to the uncertainties to reach this standard. The periodic 2,1 coefficients appear to be too small to recover information on the inner core that is above the noise level.  Small inner core signals can be caused by small J2 and C22 values or small Im-Iic. The former can be caused by small inner core size or a nearly spherical 1380.pdf

gravity field. The Im-Iic difference can be small when gravitational coupling between the inner core and mantle is strong. The coupling comes from the internal gravity field interior to the CMB attracting the exterior gravity field from the inner core. Some combination of these influences explains the weak signal.  The difference Im-Iic depends on two torques: one is between the Earth and the inner core J2 and C22 and the other is the coupling between the inner core and the mantle. Model calculation predict that the latter is much larger and the torque ratio is a useful parameter. The torque from the Earth depends on the inner core J2+2C22 and moment of inertia. The coefficient C21S can be computed from inner core J2+2C22, torque ratio, moment, and τic. As an example, we show a figure for the 240 km radius iron core of the Weber et al. model [9]. The C21S solution value and ±1-σ uncertainties are shown with horizontal lines. The inner core moment is 1.2x10-4 of the lunar moment. The 32X and 64X indicate two torque ratios, but larger and smaller values are possible. The W value was set at 4x10-11, it depends on the outer core size, and angle offset τic was taken to be 0 (-45º≤τic≤45º). The plotted C21S curves become large near a resonance that occurs when the natural free precession period of the inner core matches the 18.6 yr precession period of the lunar orbit node. We can say that the inner core is not near that resonance. The difference Im-Iic is degrees near the left-hand side of the plot and tenths of a degree near the right side. The values for the torque ratio and J2+2C22 are unknown and we cannot bound their values.  Love number and Tidal Dissipation: The degree1200 solution finds a potential Love number k2 of 0.02410±0.00006. This value is compatible with previously published values from GRAIL [2,3,6]. The new solution also determines a tidal phase shift finding k2/Q = (5.8±0.6)x10-4 or Q = 41±4 at 1 month, where Q is the quality factor that arises from dissipation. For comparison, the values derived from lunar laser range analysis are k2/Q = (6.4±0.6)x10-4 and Q = 38±4 at 1 month [10,11]. There is good agreement between the two determinations.  Core Shape:  Analyses of the GRAIL mission data found values for the lunar gravity field coefficient S21 that were larger than their uncertainties [2,3]. A small nonzero S21 means that the principal axes of the moment of inertia matrix are not quite aligned with the reference frame. The misalignment is an order-ofmagnitude larger than the frame-generating fits to Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) data indicated [12]. A nonspherical shape for the inner and outer core boundaries can explain the discrepancy [13]. The new solutions show a finite S21 value that is compatible with earlier results. They also show a small positive C21 value.  Summary:  A degree and order 1200 solution provides a higher resolution gravity field and an improved fit to the GRAIL data. Although mission requirements were met, a search for inner core periodicities does not find results above the noise level. A phase shift associated with tidal dissipation gives a tidal Q of 41±4 at a one month period.
