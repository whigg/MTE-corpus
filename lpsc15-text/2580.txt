Introduction:  This lab has been involved in simulations of asteroid impact processes using the NASA Ames Vertical Gun Lab (AGVR) for a number of years.  The experimental setup involves hanging a sample in the center of the chamber and surrounding the sample with passive detectors to record particles produced in the disruption.  The passive detectors are spaced around the sample at locations that were originally chosen at random [1].  Subsequent study of the results deduced that the particles from the disruption were distributed in a cone-shaped pattern.  There have been questions as to the best placement of these detectors and this study is one attempt to validate the positioning of the passive detectors.  The ideal detector would be a half-sphere covering the sample position.  This is impractical for several reasons, including the logistics of the construction and placement, as well as the enormous amount of time required to process and measure all of the aluminum foil.   Experimental:  To get a better feel for the location of the impact debris plume resulting from the disruption, a ring was designed that could be positioned around the sample in the chamber.  Lengths of oneinch wide polystyrene where glued together.  Cross pieces were added to maintain the separation of the rings and to provide stability.  Aluminum foil strips with a thickness of 26 Âµm were attached to the backside of the ring with tape.  The detector is placed on the bed of the gun chamber and anchored.  The passive detectors are placed in their typical positions above the 360 detector (Figure 1).  After the shot, the aluminum foil is removed and analyzed in the typical fashion [2].  The 5 x 25 cm aluminum detectors were cut up vertically and lengthwise and mounted in 35-mm slide mounts resulting in 10 to 24 slides.  The slides were scanned and processed using ImageJ.  Five shots have been done with the 360 detector on the floor of the chamber.   Results:  In each case, there appears to be one primary location for the majority of the particles.  Figure 2 shows the results from Shot 140627, a 229-gram piece of NWA 869 shot with a 1/4-inch aluminums sphere at 5.08 km/sec.  Of the more than 100,000 holes measured, more than 95% occurred in sections 10, 11 and 1, the side of the ring adjacent to the projectile port between sections 10 and 11.  In detailed evaluation of the foils, there is minimal difference between the top and the bottom of the foil.  In the regions between section 5 and 9 there were very few holes.  This is the region running between passive detectors 2 and 3.  The mass frequency distribution pattern showed the typical shape for sections 10, 11 and 1.  Farther fromthe debris cone, the shape is less distinctive (Figure 3).  Other shots using different materials, different shot speeds and different projectile sizes showed similar patterns, with the bulk of the particles occurring in the region across approximately 3 sections of the detector centered around the projectile entry hole.   Conclusion:  The passive detectors in the locations used provide the same basic information as the 360 detector.  Further experiments could be done with the 360 detector mounted at heights above the floor of the chamber, but it is expected there will be little difference in the outcome.  In general, it is concluded that the current setup is the best possible configuration in terms of time and outcome. References:  [1] Durda D. D. and Flynn G. J. (1999) Icarus, 142, 46-55.

The projectile enters through the white circle in the upper center of the image and travels toward the front of the image.  The four passive detectors start to the left of the projectile entry with #1 at 55o, #2 at 139o, #3 at 235o and #4 at 345o.  The sample hangs in the center of the detector ring.  The ring is about 100 cm across.  The foils in the ring spaces are numbered starting with Space 1 just to the right of Passive Detector #1.  2580.pdf
