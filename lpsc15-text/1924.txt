Introduction: CK chondrites are the only group of carbonaceous chondrites (CCs) with petrologic types ranging from 3 to 6 [e.g., 1]. One of the striking features of matrices in CK chondrites is the heterogeneous composition of feldspars [e.g., 1-4]. However, the origin and formation of these feldspars, often chemically zoned, is still debated. We studied feldspars in the matrices of 11 CK samples, especially at the type 3-4 transition, in order to supply additional constraints on their origin. Methods: This study was carried out on 11 CK chondrites: NWA 1559 (CK3), NWA 4724 (CK3.8), NWA 4425 (CK3.8), NWA 4423 (CK3.9), NWA 4422 (CK4), Karoonda (CK4), Tnz 057 (CK4), NWA 765 (CK4/5), EET 90007 (CK5), EET 87860 (CK5/6), and LEW 87009 (CK6).  SEM-BSE imaging was performed using a JEOL JSM-5910LV electron microscope, while quantitative analyses were obtained on a CAMECA SX100 electron microprobe. We characterized the microsctructure of plagioclase grains in the matrix of Tanezrouft 057 using an analytical transmission electron microscope (ATEM) Philips CM20 operating at 200 kV. Crystallographic orientation of zoned plagioclases was determined by electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) using a Bruker's QUANTAX CrystaAlign EBSD analysis system. In order to fit EBSD patterns, we used bytownite (An70-An90) and oligoclase (An10-An30) using the P1 as the space group. Results: Texture. All CK matrices studied here contain plagioclases, with sizes increasing from ∼10 µm in CK3 to a few hundred microns in CK6. Among all CKs investigated, NWA 1559 is the unique meteorite with a matrix containing more pyroxene than plagioclase. As described for olivine in CK matrices [e.g., 2,3,5-7], plagioclases contain numerous vesicles and inclusions of opaque phases (Fig. 1a) largely dominated by magnetite and pentlandite. Mineralogy and petrology. Although NWA 1559, which is the most primitive CK chondrite studied in term of grain size (∼15 µm) and mean Fa content (∼Fa36.1), contains only a few grains of plagioclase which are never chemically zoned, most of plagioclases in the matrices of CK3-4 are chemically zoned, with calcic cores and sodic borders (Fig. 1). These chemical zonations are not continuous, the limits between cores and borders being well-defined. Plagioclase grains observed in CK5-6 matrices are not chemically zoned, but the variation of compositions measured is similar to the range obtained between the cores and borders of zoned plagioclases from types 3-4. The ranges of compositions are An15.4-An99.9 in CK3, An18.4-An100.0 in CK4, An18.6-An73.6 in CK5, and An11.1-An90.2 in CK6. In addition, all plagioclases analyzed contain a significant amount of FeOtot (probably as Fe3+), from an average of 0.44 to 0.78 wt% in EET 87860 and NWA 765, respectively. Crystallographic orientation. Even if the limit between the calcic cores and sodic borders is welldefined, EBSD analyses indicate that the core and associated rim of each zoned plagioclase have a similar crystallographic orientation (Fig. 1c,d). In some cases, the contacts between matrix olivines and zoned plagioclase crystals crosscut the core of the latter (Fig. 1a,b). No deformation was observed in such crystals. Discussion: It has been suggested that heterogeneities in plagioclase compositions could reflect a chemical fractionation caused by the crystallization of a melt produced by shock [1-3,6], as proposed for ordinary chondrite (OC) breccias in which feldspars display a compositional trend from oligoclase to orthoclase [e.g., 8]. These compositions in OCs are interpreted as the witnesses of a crystallization sequence starting with the formation of plagioclase feldspar (calcic then sodic) followed by the cotectic crystallization of sodic plagioclase and K-feldspar. Even if the presence of fragments of former zoned plagioclase crystals appears to be poorly consistent with such a mode of formation, our observations cannot rule out this process as the origin of zoned plagioclases in CKs. However, and as noted by [9] for Maralinga (CK4), this origin of matrix plagioclases by shock-induced metamorphism is not consistent with the shock effects observed in the samples.  In contrast to what we observed in all CK samples investigated here, [9] and [4] reported reverse zoning (sodic cores and calcic borders) for plagioclases in CK matrices. Based on these observations, [9] suggested that chemical compositions measured in feldspars are consistent with the subsolidus relations proposed by [10] in the plagioclase solid solution series. At equilibrium, a miscibility gap occurs from ca. An40 to An90 between 400 and 575°C. As described by [10] and discussed by [9] for feldspars from Maralinga, intermediate plagioclase compositions within this gap may result from metastable spinodal decomposition.

(c) IPF-Y (colorcoded EBSD orientation map) and (d) IPF-Z showing the crystallographic orientation relative to the Y- and Z-axis of the sample, respectively. Then, calcic rims of plagioclases would have been produced by prograde reactions during parent body metamorphism [9]. Since plagioclase exsolution is a very slow process, rare, and only observed in highgrade terrestrial metamorphic rocks, we suggest that this origin cannot be invoked in CK matrices, which are largely texturally unequilibrated. [4] proposed that calcic borders of plagioclases were formed during a thermal metamorphic event while sodic cores were inherited from the nebula. This mode of formation is not in agreement with the chemical zonations and crystallographic orientations observed in this study.  The observation, in CK matrices, of numerous vesicles and inclusions of magnetite in olivines and plagioclases, support formation of both these minerals during a common thermal event. Based on the scarcity of plagioclase in NWA 1559 relative to pyroxene, the calcic cores/sodic borders, and the presence of pyroxene in inclusions [4] or in contact with plagioclase (Fig. 1), we suggest that the calcic cores could have been produced during the CK thermal metamorphic event by the reaction between pyroxene (initially present in matrices) and spinel, as described in terrestrial lherzolites [e.g., 11]. Then, we believe that the sudden modification of the composition of plagioclases can be explained by the addition of Na during metamorphism. The matrices themselves can provide the Na necessary for the formation of Na-plagioclase. Na in matrices of CCs could have been mostly present in hydrated phases [12] and to a lesser extent in organic matter [13].  Conclusion: We suggest that zoned plagioclases (calcic cores and sodic borders) in the matrices of CK chondrites were formed during parent body metamorphism, by reaction between pyroxene and spinel (calcic cores), then by addition of Na possibly due to the destabilization of hydrated phases (sodic borders).
