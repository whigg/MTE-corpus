Introduction:  The mixing ratio of O in the Martian thermosphere was unknown prior to MAVEN except for that inferred from the Viking Retarding Potential Analyzer ion density measurements [1] and the remote sensing of O emissions from the Mariner 6, 7, and 9 [2]. The Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS) on the MAVEN spacecraft has sampled the ion and neutral densities in both open and closed source modes. The NGIMS in open source mode has measured the densities of O and CO2 directly, and in closed source mode, the CO2 is also measured directly, along with the products of recombination of O as O2 and other molecules or molecular fragments. Usually the measurements range from periapsis at about 150 km to very high altitudes where chemistry no longer determines the ion densities. Periapsis was at a lower altitude for the deep dip that occurred in February.  Chemistry of ions: The major ion produced by photons and photoelectrons in the lower ionosphere is CO2+. This ion is converted to O2+ by reaction with O. O+ also reacts with CO2 to produce O2+. Although dissociative ionization of CO2 produces O+ + CO with probabilities that range from 5% to 10% by solar photons and photoelectrons with energies greater than  about 19 eV, the major source of O+ is direct ionization of O at altitudes where O is the major neutral. Thus the major ion over most of the ionosphere is O2+; the O+ densities become comparable to those of O2+ at altitudes of 250 to 300 km. We here present some of the dayside measured profiles of the major neutral species, and those of the major ions. Using ion and electron temperatures that have been measured by the STATIC and LPW instruments, and the measured neutral densities in the range from periapsis to 300 km, we model the ion densities. We illustrate the chemical and physical processes that control the ionospheric density profiles.  References: [1] Hanson, W. B. et al. (1977) JGR, 82, 4351-4363.  [2] e.g., Stewart, A. I. F. et al.
