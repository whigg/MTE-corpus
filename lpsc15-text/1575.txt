Pluto is expected to exhibit seasonal transport of volatiles on its surface because of its high obliquity [1,2,3,4,5].  During the last 15 years, we have been  monitoring the rotational lightcurve of Pluto and combining these observations with historical measurements, to put the fast flyby of Pluto into a temporal context of decades.  During the past decade, Pluto has moved through the Milky Way, with crowded fields of stars and dust, rendering analysis of the data challenging (Figure 1). A low declination and opposition near athe summer solstice limit the observing time to 7 hours (in the northern hemisphere) at best. With a rotation period of 6.4 days, more than 20 nights of observing are required to obtain a dense lightcurve. We obtained such a curve in 2013 with the 24-inch telescope at JPL's Table Mountain Observatory in the broadband BVR filters, with rudimentary lightcurves and photometric measurements in 2008, 2012, and 2014. We also obtained the first observations of Pluto at very small phase angles (<0.1°) to search for the large opposition surge that is seen on most icy bodies, including Pluto's twin Triton [6].   Figure 1 :The field for Pluto on July 15, 2012, showing the dense distribution of stars (and dust, which is not visible) that render analysis so challenging.  The lightcurve of Pluto: A dedicated observing run in 2013 produced complete lightcurves in the BVR filters (Figure 2).  Observations in 2008 were obtained intermittedly as part of other observing programs. Twenty partial nights in the R filter spanned the full range of rotational phase with one major gap in the 260°-320° range. Measurements in the B and V filters were obtained on 10 nights, enabling the collection of rudimentary photometric parameters, including lightcurve amplitues, albedo, and color.  It is obvious that the lightcurve of Pluto is changging. However, this change is not necessarily indiciative of volatile transport, as Pluto's large obliquity also causes the portion of its surface observed from Earth to change with time. Thus we have modeled the expected lightcurve with time with a static frost model based on HST maps [7,8]. Deviations from this model  indicate volatile transport.    Figure 2: Preliminary reductions of observations of the rotational lighturve of Pluto for the period 2008-2104. The most dedicated observing season was 2013, for which we obtained  26 nights of observations, including the first observation at solar phase angles below 0.1° (open circles). Pluto exhibits a "super surge" in brightness at very small solar phase angles, as most icy bodies do. The bottom two curves are the colors of Pluto as a function of rotational phase.    Perhaps the most basic measure of the lightcurve is its amplitude. Figure 3 shows the preliminary amplitudes for 2008-2013 with predictions of the static frost model and the historical data. (Note that the HST observations were obtained at a wavelength close to the B-filter, while the lightcurve observations between 1950 and 1990 were obtained with the V-filter.) The 2013 observations, for which we have the most extensive data, show that the amplitude has clearly changed beyond what is predicted by a static model. Observations from 2008, while not as dense, also suggest a change in Pluto's frost pattern.    Figure 3. Historical observations of the amplitude of Pluto's lightcurve compared with a static frost model (solid line) and preliminary reductions of our observations 2008-2013. Data prior to 1990 were obtained in the V-filter, so a direct comparison with the model is not accurate. Earlier version in [7].  Albedo and color:  Pluto showed a gradual decrease in its visible albedo between 1930 and 2000 [7]. Its albedo has been fairly constant since then, except its albedo in the R-filter has been slightly increasing, especially on its low-albedo hemisphere, leading to a  general reddening of Pluto's surface.        Opposition surge: The first observations of Pluto below 0.1° show that it exhibits a huge surge in brightness beyond that predicted by extrapolation from larger phase angles (open circles in Figure 2). The canonical explanation of this phenomenon is the effects of coherent backscatter, which occurs in multiply scattered photons [9].  Conclusions: Pluto seemed to have been stable for the decades since it was observed with photometric techniques [7], but recent changes detected by HST [10,11]coupled with increases in its atmospheric pressure by a factor of two in the last decade and changes in the absorption bands of surface volatiles [12] suggest seasonal volatile transport on its surface.  Our observations show evidence for continued volatile transport for the 2008-2014 period. It is likely that a view similar to that seen by Voyager 2 of Triton will greet New Horizons during its passage of Pluto: a sublimating polar cap with plume deposits from escaping volatiles. Similar plumes, known as spiders, appear at the martian polar cap. The reddening of Pluto's surface in the past few years can be explained by the  release of nitrogen from the polar caps to reveal reddish photolyzed methane underneath. The plume deposits could also contribute to the reddening.     Figure 4: An image of Triton's polar caps showing plume deposits that may be associated with release of volatiles.   Ground-based observations will continue to be an essential complement to spacecraft data. The opposition surge discovered with our program would not have been seen by New Horizons, as it will never attain small solar phase angles. Pluto reaches a minimum solar phase angle of 0.006° in 2018; groundbased observers will continue to obtain observations as this minimum is reached to provide a complementary data set.
