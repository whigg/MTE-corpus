Introduction:  The determination of the effective permittivity of the lunar surface material is useful for discussion of their composition and porosity. Assuming the Maxwell-Garnett mixing relation and parameters based on Apollo samples [1], the bulk density bulk of the lunar surface materials can be derived from their effective permittivity r by using the following equation:    217.021/m13rrbulk g . (1)  Bulk density of the lunar surface material depends on the abundances of voids and heavy components such as ilmenite. The dataset obtained by Lunar Radar Sounder (LRS) onboard SELENE (Kaguya) [2] enables us to perform global high-resolution mapping of the lunar surface permittivity because (a) the observation was performed from the polar orbiter at an altitude of about 100 km, and (b) the operation frequency was 4 - 6 MHz in which thermal emissions is negligible. We should note that the echo powers from the lunar surface depends not only on the permittivity but also on the roughness of the lunar surface. As for the roughness, we can use SELENE Digital Terrain Model (DTM) based on Terrain Camera (TC) observation [3]. We can therefore calculate expected echo powers by applying Kirchhoff Approximation (KA), and compare them with observed echo powers in order to determine the effective permittivity. Also in another analysis [4], we have determined the effective permittivity of the lunar uppermost basalt layers in several regions by using delay time of the subsurface echoes and actual depth of the subsurface boundary estimated by multiband images [5] around the craters excavating the uppermost basalt layers. The derived dielectric constant was less than that of the Apollo samples, which suggested that there were macro cracks made by the meteorite impacts. Analysis method used in this study can be applicable in determination of the effective permittivity in wider area on the moon because it does not need craters. Analyses Method:  The global distributions of the echo powers in a frequency range of 4 - 6 MHz were derived from the SELENE/LRS dataset. In this study, we have used the intensity of off-nadir surface echoes in an incident angle from 10 to 20, which are measured after the arrival of the nadir surface echo. We should note that the echoes measured after the nadir surface echo consist of various components such as offnadir surface echoes, volume scatters from the subsurface layers, and echoes from the subsurface reflectors. In this study, we assumed that most of them was offnadir surface echoes. The median of off-nadir echo intensities were derived in 360 x 180 areas of 1 (longitude) x 1 (latitude). In addition, we have derived the global distribution of the surface roughness parameters. The RMS height , or Allan deviation of the surface height, can be obtained by          22 xzxxzx  , (2) where z(x) is height of the surface derived from the SELENE TC/DTM, x is baseline length, and <> denotes the average. If we assume the self-affine surface model, the roughness parameters H and s can be obtained by the least square fitting of the RMS heights to    Hxsx   ,   (3) in a baseline length range from 30 m to 3 km. The roughness parameters were derived in 360 x 180 areas of 1 (longitude) x 1 (latitude).      The off-nadir surface echo power can be calculated based on the radar equation. Assuming Kirchhoff Approximation (KA), the backscattering coefficient in the radar equation can be obtained from the roughness parameters H, s, and the permittivity [6, 7, 8]. Using the roughness parameters H and s obtained by SELENE TC/DTM and assumed permittivity, we can calculate the expected off-nadir surface echo powers and compare them with observed off-nadir surface echo power. Based on the comparison, we can determine the most plausible effective permittivity. Results:  The global distributions of roughness parameters, H and s, were obtained based on SELENE TC/DTM. The Hurst exponent H is <0.5 in the maria, and >0.7 in the highlands. The parameter s is >1 m(1-H) in the maria, and <0.3 m(1-H) in the highlands. The global distribution of H is similar with that based on LRO [9]. By applying the analysis method mentioned above, we could obtain the observed and calculated off-nadir surface echo powers. Based on them, we could estimate the effective permittivity of the lunar surface materials in 360 x 180 areas of 1 (longitude) x 1 (latitude) as shown in Figure 1. The estimated effective permittivity is 2 - 3 in the highland, 3 - 4 in the 1316.pdf

maria. In addition, it was found that there areas whose effective permittivity reaching ~ 5 in the eastern part of Oceanus Procellarum and the western part of Mare Imbrium. Discussion:  By applying Equation (1) to the estimated effective permittivity of the lunar surface, we can derive the bulk density of the lunar surface materials. The derived bulk density is 1.2 - 1.8 g cm-3 in the highlands, 1.8 - 2.3 g cm-3 in the maria, and approximately 2.6 g cm-3 in the high-permittivity areas in Oceanus Procellarum and Mare Imbrium. Some previous studies have reported the bulk densities of lunar surface materials. The average density of the Moon is 3.34 g cm-3 [10]. We can expect that the bulk density of the surface material is lower than the average density. Based on gravity-field observations performed by the GRAIL satellites, the bulk density up to a depth of several km in the highlands was estimated to be 2.55 g cm3 [11]. Based on measurements of Apollo drill-core samples, the bulk density to a depth of 3 m was estimated to be 1.3 - 1.9 g cm-3 [12]. The reason why the bulk densities estimated in the previous studies are different is probably because the bulk density of the soil and rocks increases with depth, and the effective depth range for estimation of the bulk density depends on the methods.  The areas of high permittivity and the high bulk density in the eastern part of Oceanus Procellarum and western part of Mare Imbrium coincide with young lava flow units in Procellarum KREEP Terrain (PKT) region. We can consider two possible reasons: (i) The regolith layer is thinner than other mare regions due to short exposure to the meteorite impacts. (ii) The bulk density is higher than other mare regions due to high abundance of the ilmenite.
