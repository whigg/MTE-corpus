The highest temperature might be 750K at the core of Ceres [2]. Composition of the fluid involving the early Ceres is estimated from the solar nebula composition, distance from the sun and growing history of the Ceres [3].  Infrared spectra of the current Ceres correspond to carbonates [4], brucite [5], silicates [6], and magnetite [7]. In this study, hydrothermal alteration experiments representing the alteration process occurred in the early Ceres were carried out. Experimental: Experimental fluid is presumed based on [3] for H2O 49.14%, CO2 44.23%, CH4 4.42% and H2S 2.21%. For the practical experimental fluid, CH3OH 18.6% solution and appropriate mass of silver oxalate are used to provide hydrocarbon and CO2, respectively. The starting material is powdered Allende meteorite, which is typical anhydrous carbonaceous chondrite. The ratio of a solid to a liquid is 1:1.8. Experimental temperature, run durations and pressure are as follows.

Detailed descriptions of run product phases of each temperature are as follows.  100°C; Mg-Fe carbonates generally occur. Crystal size of Mg-Fe carbonate is approximately 10 µm and growing with run durations up to 20 µm. Amorphous silica is observed in a run product of 24 weeks. 110°C; Mg-Fe carbonates and amorphous silica generally occur. Polycrystalline Mg-Fe carbonates of 10 µm in diameter with single crystals of 1 µm in diameter can be seen. In 110°C-24weeks, Mg-Fe carbonates is the most abundant than any other run product. Phyllosilicates is observed only in the run product of 24 weeks.  120°C and 125°C; Mg-Fe carbonates and amorphous silica generally occur. Amorphous silica occurs filling interstices of residual particles. Crystal size of Mg-Fe carbonates is almost identical to 110°C. 150°C; Mg-Fe carbonates, amorphous silica and phyllosilicates generally occur. Amorphous silica and phyllosilicates occurs as a filling in the interstices of residual particles. Polycrystalline Mg-Fe carbonates of 10 µm in diameter with single crystals of 1 µm in diameter can be seen. A part of carbonate crystals show dissolving texture and less crystalline.  175°C; Mg-Fe carbonates, amorphous silica and phyllosilicates occur. These are almost identical to 150°C. But phyllosilicates in 175°C is more abundant than 150°C. 180°C and 190°C; Mg-Fe carbonates and phyllosilicates generally occur. Amorphous silica doesn’t occur. A part of carbonate crystals show dissolving texture and less crystalline.   110~190°C; we can see carbonate crust on clusters of residual starting material grains packed with interstitial amorphous silica and phyllosilicates. 200°C, 300°C, 400°C and 450°C. In short duration, Fe-bearing phyllosilicates and Ca-rich dolomite generally occur. Polycrystalline carbonates with single crystals of 1 µm in diameter can be seen. In longer duration, well crystalline calcite generally occurs.  Discussion: The results of the experiments show that the composition of carbonates and phyllosilicates depend on temperatures and run durations (Figs. 1, 2). In 100°C, the Mg/Fe ratio in carbonate increases with run durations up to 12 weeks. Then, the compositional range approaches to Mg:Fe=1:1 in 24 weeks. In 110190°C, compositional range of Mg-Fe carbonates scattered to Mg:Fe=7:3~3:7 at the beginning of the reaction, but it converges to Mg:Fe=1:1 with run durations, Reactivity of Fe- and Mg-bearing minerals in primitive planetary materials may be variable at the beginning of hydrothermal reactions below 190°C. Magnesitesiderite series carbonate only occurs below 200°C. At 200°C, Fe-bearing dolomite is typical carbonate. At 300°C and higher temperature, initially occurred dolo 1703.pdf

mites decompose to form pure calcite at longer run durations. Below 200°C, phyllosilicates have Fe- and Si+Alrich compositions. At temperatures above 300°C, phyllosilicates converge to Fe-poor talc-serpentine compositions. Occurrence of magnesite-siderite series carbonate on the surface of the Ceres may show hydrothermal alteration temperature of the surface materials did not exceed 200°C. This temperature may correspond to the layer at depth of approximately 80km with thickness of approximately 20km in the thermal evolution model of the Ceres [1]. The surface of the Ceres may be mixture of aqueous alteration products exposed by impacts and low temperature components. References: [1] McCord T. B. and Sotin C. (2005) J. Geophys.
