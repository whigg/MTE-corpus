OLIVINE - MELT EQUILIBRIA IN LUNAR ULTRAMAFIC MAGMAS: INSIGHTS INTO MELT THERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES Stephanie M. Brown1 and Timothy L. Grove1, 1 Department of Earth, Atmospheric,and Planetary Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02139(brownsm@mit.edu, tlgrove@mit.edu)Experiments on lunar high-Ti melts revealed unusual variability of Fe-Mg partitioning between olivineand melt (KFe−MgD ). [1], and more recently [2], haveshown that is it not clear what causes the non-idealbehavior that leads to the observed KFe−MgD variability. The lunar high-Ti experimental dataset, supplemented by new experiments on the intermediate-Ti ultramafic glasses, isolates the influence of silica activityand suggests that neither silica activity nor NBO/T (#of non-bridging oxygens per # of tetrahedrally coordinated cations) can sufficiently predict KFe−MgD . Rather,KFe−MgD variation is due to the complex solution behavior of network modifying Fe-Mg melt components.The relation between melt components, variablefO2, and the olivine-melt KFe−MgD The observed decrease at low fO2 of the olivine KFe−MgD in high-Ti lunar ultramafic glass experiments means that either theolivine is more forsteritic or the silicate melt has higher(FeO/MgO) [2]. This can be expressed as a reductionin the activity coefficient ratio of the Fe-Mg melt components, ( γFeOγMgO )melt. Because olivine is a nearly pureFe-Mg solid solution with well known thermodynamicproperties (i.e. there is a wide range in KFe−MgD fora given olivine composition), the culprit must be themelt.Thus there must be a change in the speciation ofolivine forming silicate melt components under lowfO2 and high TiO2 conditions, resulting in low KFe−MgDand low ( γFeOγMgO )melt values. When KFe−MgD corrected to1 atm is compared to the ( γFeOγMgO )melt corrected to 1 atm[3], the ( γFeOγMgO )melt ratio decreases with decreasing fO2.The ( γFeOγMgO )melt ratio is directly dependent on melt speciation; if either component is bonding preferentiallywith other components in the melt, its activity will bereduced because the formation of such complexes stabilizes these components in the melt phase, reducingtheir availability for olivine formation. Thermodynamically, this occurs when there is a negative non-idealfree energy excess (-T∆Sexcessmix ) to form the melt complexes.The valence state of titanium is dependent on thefO2 conditions of the experiments: Ti4+ is likely being reduced to Ti3+ in the low-fO2 Fe capsule experiments [2]. Combining this with the above observationthat there are fO2-dependent changes in melt speciation strongly suggests that Fe and Ti3+ are complexing more efficiently together at low fO2 to reduce theFe activity in the melt. An enticing solution is thatFe2+, at the expense of Mg, is more efficiently complexing with Ti3+ than it did with Ti4+ in the melt, effectively increasing the amount of magnesium available for olivine. This type of reaction also predicts thatthe melt would become more olivine normative, whichis observed experimentally by the expanding of theolivine primary phase volume (i.e., deepening of themultiple saturation point): the silicate-forming meltbecomes more olivine normative as the Ti/(Fe+Mg) ratio of (Fe,Mg)-Ti melt components increases, therebyincreasing the (FeO+MgO)/SiO2 ratio of the remaining liquid [2].A pair of melt component reactions, similar to theone proposed by [2], can explain all the observed behavior. Reaction 1 is an oxidation-reduction reaction that describes the reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+ bydissociation of a preexisting ilmenite (Fe,Mg)Ti4+O3melt component. The titanium in the ilmenite-likemelt component is donated to the armalcolite-like meltcomponent also present in the melt, forming a newmore Ti-rich armalcolite melt component and releasing (Fe,Mg)O into the melt, causing the melt to become more olivine normative. In the limit of low fO2,where x = 1, the new melt component becomes "anosovite" Ti4+Ti3+2 O5:(Fe,Mg)Ti4+2 O5 +x(Fe,Mg)Ti4+O3 ⇀↽(Fe,Mg)1−xTi4+2−xTi3+2xO5 +2x(Fe,Mg)O+xO2.(1)Reaction 2 describes the Fe-Mg exchange in the Tirich modified armalcolite melt component, setting x =0.5:Mg0.5Ti4+1.5Ti3+O5 +FeO ⇀↽Fe0.5Ti4+1.5Ti3+O5 +MgO.(2)Reaction 2 proceeds to the right as the amount of titanium in the bulk composition increases causing preferential release of MgO into the melt, successfully predicting the decrease in ( γFeOγMgO )melt and KFe−MgD . In summary, this behavior suggests that the more Fe,Ti-richmodified armalcolite melt component is stable becauseit has a large excess non-ideal contribution to ∆Smix atlow fO2.2737.pdf

Data is from this work and [11, 6, 7, 12, 8, 9, 2]Predicting KFe−MgD Many models exist for predicting KFe−MgD [4, 1, 5, 3, etc.]; however, these models cannot account for the range in KFe−MgD observedfrom lunar ultramafic experiments. For example, experiments on the low titanium lunar ultramafic glassesand mare basalts consistently record high olivine FeMg KFe−MgD > 0.35 [1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] than comparedto terrestrial rocks [3]. The cause of the KFe−MgD variation must also be related to melt speciation. But unlikethe lower ( γFeOγMgO )melt of the intermediate - high TiO2liquids, the low-titanium ultramafic lunar glasses exhibit elevated ( γFeOγMgO )melt. Such high values typicallycorrelate with terrestrial liquids that are 8-12 mol%more SiO2 rich [3] than the SiO2 content of the lowtitanium lunar ultramafic glasses. Therefore, the highKFe−MgD of these low SiO2 melts cannot be explainedby a change in silica activity (Figure 1).Additionally, [5] suggested that the melt polymerization proxy FeO + MgO (wt%), or the equivalentNBO/T, of an ultramafic liquid controlled KFe−MgD .They found that the KFe−MgD reached a maximum atNBO/T = 2, or FeO + MgO ≈ 36 wt%. When wesuperimpose the lunar dataset on top of the [5] data(Figure 2), we find that the lunar data crosscuts thiscorrelation. The true cause of KFe−MgD variation in ultramafic glasses is more complex than silica activity orNBO/T.As an alternative model, we are working on quantifying the role of network modifiers and network formers for predicting KFe−MgD as a function of temperature,pressure, fO2, and composition.0 10 20 30 40 50 60 700.250.20.30.350.40.45FeO + MgO (wt%)Pressure corrected K DFeMgFigure 2: Fe-Mg olivine partitioning is not a quadraticfunction of FeO + MgO (wt%) or NBO/T.
