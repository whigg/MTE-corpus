Introduction:  The planetary science community is dependent on the availability of pure, wellcharacterized mineral separates with known optical constants for reference spectral libraries across a wide range of wavelengths. These data form the basis for all quantitative models of mineral abundances derived from remote sensing data. In the absence of targeted sample return, such data place critically-important constraints on past fluid compositions, atmospheric conditions, weathering timelines, and subsurface processes. Reference spectra provide one of the cornerstones of interpretations of surface geology on terrestrial planets. However, variations among data in the existing libraries remain. Reflectance geometries (biconical vs. bidirectional) are highly variable [1]. Sample purity and phase identification are often problematic. Chemical compositions are rarely known or recorded. Although grain size ranges are generally reported, the increments used vary and are often too broad. Exact particle size distributions are rarely provided, complicating analysis using physical models of reflectance. Furthermore, while many studies emphasize the importance of quantities such as optical constants, porosity, and particle shapes for the correct interpretation of reflectance spectra of particulate media [2-4], such measurements are rarely performed. Existing databases focus primarily on characterizing spectral details of individual minerals. Spectra of well-characterized mineral mixtures are thus poorly represented in the available spectral libraries. In response to this need, we describe here six pure mineral separates prepared in kg-mass quantities and characterized for subsequent use in creating mineral mixtures for reflectance spectral measurements. Once completed, this project will provide a set of criticallyneeded reference samples and data needed to improve the accuracy of models of planetary surfaces based on spectroscopic data. Motivation for this Work: Early empirical studies suggested that spectra of mineral mixtures are simply linear combinations of end-members for coarser size fractions [5] and non-linear mixtures for microscopic (intimate) mixtures [6]. For intimate mixtures, which make up the majority of planetary regoliths, light interacts with particles from multiple phases as it is scattered by the mixture before it is captured by the sensor. As a result, the reflectance spectrum of the mixture is a nonlinear combination of the reflectance spectra of the individual components [7]. The function describing those combinations depends critically on the optical properties of the minerals themselves, the particles size (and shape) distributions of each mineral in the mixture and the geometry of sensing. Because these data are available only from a handful of studies of a few mineral groups, this project was concieved to begin to provide a ewll-characterized data set for such models. Samples: We purchased 20 kg lots of each of six phases, in most cases dealing directly with mine owners or their representatives. We obtained two olivines, one from the classic locality at San Carlos (obtained from Bill Barker), NM and one from Globe AZ (Mineral Search Inc.). To represent the clinopyroxene subgroup, we have augite from the Harcourt Graphite Mine, Cardiff Township, Haliburton Co., Ontario, and diopside from Hershel Ontario (Canada), both from Wards Scientific. For feldspar, we have bytownite 1499.pdf

 Figure 2. Handpicking of individual mineral grains to confirm purity - a very time-consuming practice! from Crystal Bay, Minnesota (Wards Scientific) and labradorite from Chihuahua, Mexico (Bill Barker).  Bytownite, diopside, and augite were provided as fist-sized samples, so crushing was required to allow for inspection and removel of impurities (Figure 1). After all samples had been reduced to <5 mm grain sizes, every individual mineral grain was handpicked and visually inspected (Figure 2). Any grain with visible impurities was discarded; roughly half of the obtained sample mass was removed in this process. In the future, we will crush these samples further to create smaller grain sizes, enabling us to extract additional pure sample from each mineral. Following handpicking, each grain was treated using oxalic acid (2 teaspoons in 2 gallons of water) for 1 hour to remove surface weathering, followed by three cycles of washing and rinsing with clean water. Samples were then crushed in a tungsten shatterbox in the rock room facility at UMass (Figure 1) run by Mike Rhodes. Aliquots of each sample weighing roughly 50 g were run in the shatterbox for varying lengths of time to provide a range of grain sizes. Samples were then sieved using both a mechanical shaker and handshaking along with a 10-sieve set with sizes 1000, 710, 500, 300, 180, 150, 106, 63, 38, and 25 µm. At least 50 g of each size fraction were created from each of the six minerals. Characterization: Aliquots from the 63-106 µm size fraction of each sample were sent to Franklin and Marshall College for x-ray diffraction analyses; all samples were 100% pure phase with no impurities above their 1 volume % detection level. Electron microprobe analyses of 10 spots on various grains of each samples were acquired at Brown University by Joe Boesenberg using standard operation conditions. Compositions are given in Table 1. We note that a few impurities were visible in the backscattered images during these analyses but they were microscopic in size and <<1% by volume. Such impurities are (unfortunately) unavoidable in naturally-occurring samples. We are currently obtaining variable-angle reflectance spectra for all samples from which we will determine optical constants over a range from the visible into the mid-IR [9].  Further Work: When funding permits, we plan to measure the grain size distribution in each mineral separate in each size fraction using a Mastersizer 2000 laser diffractometer. We also intend to measure porosity of each separate and use micro-tomography [8] to make three-dimensional images of grains of each mineral in each size fraction, in order to better understand the influence of shape on scattering properties. We will then mix these samples in known volume percent mixtures and acquire their reflectance spectra in MP's lab at UMass.
