Castillo-Rogez2. 1School of Earth and Space Exploration,Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287, USA. 2Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91109, USA. (mneveu@asu.edu).Dwarf Planets in the Spotlight: 2015 willsee the first exploration of dwarf planets by spacecraft, withDawn scheduled to enter Ceres' orbit inApril and New Horizons to fly through the Plutosystem in July. Motivated by these imminent visits,we have previously modeled the possible thermaland geophysical evolution of these worlds. We havefound their interiors likely to be differentiated intoa rocky core and hydrosphere, possibly harboringsubsurface liquid water over geological timescales[1-4]. These findings concur with observations ofhydrated minerals on Ceres' surface [5] and raisethe possibility of cryovolcanism on dwarf planets,compatible with detections of water vapor at Ceres[6] and ammonia dihydrate, seemingly recently emplaced, on Pluto's moon Charon [7].The long-term presence of liquid water in contact with a rocky core suggests that water-rock interactions may occur. These seem necessary toexplain Ceres' surface minerals, and can producespecies such as H2 or N2 whose exsolution may driveexplosive cryovolcanism [8]. Interactions may befavored by extensive core fracturing: our modelshave shown that Ceres' core could be cracked to atleast 10% by volume, up to 100%. Thus, aqueousalteration of the core may have taken place at awater:rock ratio near Ceres' bulk ratio.Geochemistry Matters: Water-rock reactionscan feed back on the thermal evolution of dwarfplanets in several ways. Rock hydration may resultin a ten-fold change in its thermal conductivity ata given T , and cause a 30% increase in core volume [2,4]. Here, we investigate two other prominent geochemical feedbacks not yet captured in ourevolution models:Fate of antifreezes. The extent and durationthrough which liquid persists depends strongly onthe presence of volatiles (NH3, CH3OH) and salts,which depress its melting temperature. Volatile antifreezes, likely accreted by dwarf planets [1,2,8],may be oxidized to N2 or carbonates, removing allor part of antifreeze capabilities. Conversely, saltsmay be leached from the core.Fate of radionuclides. The long-lived heat producing elements K, Th, and U, present in the rockycore, may be leached into the fluid, taking awaypart of the core's radiogenic fuel [9-11].# Rock W:R T(oC) P(bar) pH pe1 OC 0.42 50 1000 10 FMQ2 OC 1.46 50 1000 10 FMQ3 OC 1.46 50 1000 10 FMQ-14 CM 0.18 300 500 12 FMQ5 CM 0.18 50 1000 10 FMQ6 CM 0.18 50 1000 13 FMQ7 CM 0.18 175 1000 12 FMQ8 CM 0.05 175 1000 12 FMQTable 1: Parameter sets for the eight equilibriumgeochemical simulations performed.Models: We modeled the aqueous alterationof core rock, constrained by six parameters: starting rock composition (ordinary ("OC") [12,13] orCM carbonaceous chondrite ("CM") [13,14]), water:rock ratio (bulk W:R ≈ 0.18 by mass for a hydrated core; 0.42 for a dry core on Ceres and Pluto,both of density ∼2 g cm−3), temperature T , pressure P , pH, and redox (given as the departure inelectron potential, pe, from the mineral buffer fayalitemagnetite-quartz or FMQ). The initial solution composition (35% C as CO, 2% N as NH3, 0.5% S asSO2 by mass) was chosen to approximate cometaryice [8]. We used the geochemical modeling softwarePHREEQC v3 [15] to determine equilibrium solution compositions and mineral assemblages. OnlyT and P were fixed in a given simulation. We usedthe thermodynamic data included in the llnl.datdatabase [15], which we expanded to add molar volumes converted from the CHNOSZ OBIGT database[16] for most minerals and solutes, as well as datafor salts [17], NH4-bearing minerals [18-20], andorganics [21]. Simulation conditions, summarizedin Table 1, were chosen to favor the formation ofbrucite Mg(OH)2 and Mg-bearing carbonates observed at Ceres' surface [6,22].Results: In all runs starting with an OC rockcomposition (#1-#3), as well as run #4, the final pH (11.9 to 13.6) was higher than the initialvalue due to serpentinization. The pH remainedrelatively unchanged in all other CM runs.Forming Ceres' surface minerals. Despite initial conditions chosen to favor brucite formation,brucite was never formed.

Figure 1: Stability of C and N solutes at 300oCand 1000 bar. At the FMQ buffer, both carbonatesand NH3 are stable. Thus, the persistence of NH3antifreeze is not incompatible with the formation ofCeres' carbonates. However, the overlapping rangeis narrow: at other common mineral buffers suchas hematite-magnetite (HM) or iron-wustite (IW),NH3 and carbonate cannot coexist at equilibrium.Most of our simulations seem to end near the HMbuffer.impeded by the formation of phyllosilicates bearing both Mg and Si (antigorite, saponites, biotite,and chlorites), as well as Mg-carbonates. However, in runs #3 and 5, the final concentration ofMg was ∼10−2 molal, mostly as MgOH+, suggesting that brucite might precipitate should solutes beconcentrated further by, e.g., freezing. DolomiteCaMg(CO3)2 was formed in simulations #5, 6, and8. In run #7, CaCO3 was the preferred carbonate. In the reducing run #3, carbon was massively outgassed as C2H6, depleting carbonate solutes; this discouraged us from simulating more reducing conditions. In the remaining runs, carbonates remained in solution. In all simulations, minor to massive C2H6 outgassing seems to have leftthe equilibrium solution and rock oxidized (Fig. 1).Among other minerals possibly present on Ceres [5],magnetite formed in runs #1, 3, 4, and 8 (hematitewas the dominant Fe oxide in the other runs). Wedid not obtain any cronstedtite [5].Fate of antifreezes. N2 outgassing was alwayssignificant, whereas NH3 persisted only in run #3at conditions too reducing for carbonates. However, the stability fields of NH3 and CO2−3 overlapover a small redox range (Fig. 1) and NH3 persistence cannot be excluded. In our high-pH simulations, no NH4-bearing species formed. CH3OHbeing metastable with respect to CH4 or carbonates, its equilibrium abundance in solution was always negligible. MgCl2 and H2SO4 hydrates wereproduced in our runs; although likely unstable atthe T of our simulations, these salts could preventfreezing down to 240 K and 213 K, respectively.Fate of radionuclides. Since our models trackedelements with a chondritic abundance above 500ppm; K was the only radiogenic element included.In all runs, less than 0.02% K ended up in solution (either as KSO−4 or K+); the remainder beingprecipitated as biotite (KAl(Fe,Mg)3Si3O10(OH)2).Conclusions: We have explored the role ofwater-rock reactions in shaping the composition andinternal evolution of dwarf planets, at conditions facilitating the formation of the minerals observed onCeres' surface. These reactions may make volatileantifreeze persistence unlikely, although their lossmight be partially offset by salt formation in a freezing ocean. Radionuclide leaching was negligibleunder the conditions simulated. All simulationsyielded significant C2H2 and N2 outgassing, whichcould drive explosive cryovolcanism. Runs coveringa broader range of conditions, as well as simulations of freezing of the output solutions (e.g., usingFREZCHEM [17]) will assess the validity of thesefindings.Acknowledgements: This study was fundedby a NASA Earth & Space Science Fellowship andthe Outer Planets Research program.References: [1] Desch S.
