Introduction:  Understanding the occurrences and compositions of feldspar in ordinary chondrites (OCs) is important for tracing the effects of thermal metamorphism, as well as alkali metasomatism, on the OC parent bodies [1-10]. Feldspar in OCs is commonly considered to be a secondary phase which forms from the recrystallization of glassy chondrule mesostasis during thermal metamorphism [1-4]. Devitrification of glass occurs through the petrologic type 3 sequence, resulting in crystallization of fine-grained albite by type 4. However, coarse patches of albite are known to exist in type 3 OCs [4]. A range of calcic plagioclase compositions is also known to exist in type 3 and 4 L and LL OCs, and these equilibrate to albite by petrologic type 6 as the result of reactions with Na-bearing fluids [5-8]. Anorthitic compositions could arise either by recrystallization of Ca-rich feldspathic mesostasis, or anorthite may be a primary igneous mineral that grew from chondrule melts upon cooling. Primary anorthite is recognized in chondrules within carbonaceous chondrites but is not expected in OCs [9]. However, the primary nature of anorthite in some OCs has been inferred from alteration textures in which alteration to nepheline or albite is crystallographically controlled [6,7,10]. Semarkona is considered to be the least thermally metamorphosed ordinary chondrite and is assigned a petrologic type of 3.00 [4]. The presence of hydrated minerals such as phyllosilicates indicates minor aqueous alteration [11]. Here we report our investigations into the occurrences and compositions of what we consider to be primary feldspar in Semarkona chondrules, as a baseline for understanding feldspar development in OCs during metamorphism and metasomatism. Analytical Methods:  We examined a single thin section (UNM 549) of Semarkona. Feldspar in chondrules was identified using BSE imaging and EDS analysis on an FEI Quanta 3D FEG-SEM at 10 kV and 16 nA. Broad spectrum cathodoluminescence (CL) images were captured on a JEOL 5800LV SEM. Quantitative WDS analysis was conducted on a JEOL 8200 electron microprobe using a 1 μm beam diameter, due to the fine scale nature of the feldspar. Analyses were conducted at 10 kV and 10 nA to reduce migration of Na. In addition, we used time dependent integration (TDI) corrections for Na to compensate for any migration that may be occurring. K was a minor constituent so a TDI correction was not applied to this element.  Results:  Feldspar was observed in ~18% of chondrules in the Semarkona thin section. Texturally, much of the feldspar appears to be primary igneous mineral grains, grown from residual melt during the initial crystallization of the chondrule. In some FeO-poor chondrules (Fig. 1a, Ch36), primary end-member anorthite (Fig. 1b) is found as 2-10 µm wide laths interstitial to Figure 1: BSE images showing (a) FeO-poor, BO chondrule (Ch36) with (b) primary anorthite (An99) and (c) FeO-rich, POP chondrule (Ch3) with (d) primary albite (An2), inset showing CL image of the same region. 2067.pdf

the primary olivine and/or pyroxene crystals. Commonly, clinopyroxene, oxides, and sulfides are found interstitial to the anorthite laths in addition to mesostasis. FeO-rich chondrules (Fig. 1c, Ch3) can contain primary end-member albite (Fig. 1d) that is typically found in long, 1-5 µm wide laths growing in bundles into the mesostasis from chondrule edges. These long laths are commonly curved with convex terminations indicating rapid growth. Primary albite shows bright CL (Fig. 1d, inset) which easily distinguishes it from the surrounding mesostasis. Plagioclase with intermediate compositions includes what appear to be primary igneous laths as well as feldspar that may have been altered by fluids. Figure 2a shows zoned albitic plagioclase (Ch28, An11) with interstitial phyllosilicates replacing residual mesostasis. This texture appears to indicate fluid alteration of albite and replacement of the residual mesostasis with phyllosilicates. Similarly, Fig. 2b shows zoned intermediate plagioclase (Ch23, An40) in a chondrule in which the mesostasis appears to have been dissolved. WDS analysis (Fig. 3) reveals a wide range of plagioclase compositions from end-member anorthite through end-member albite, and a range of intermediate compositions. Compositional variation within each chondrule is limited and typically less than 10% An content. In general, chondrules that show a wider range of compositions tend to be those in which it appears that mesostasis has either been dissolved or replaced by phyllosilicates (e.g. Ch28, Fig. 2a). Or contents are less than 1% for all analyses. Discussion:  Based on textural observations and plagioclase compositions, it appears that primary igneous feldspar is common in Semarkona chondrules.  The occurrence of primary anorthitic feldspar in OC chondrules has been inferred but not confirmed previously [5-9]. However, the occurrence of primary igneous albite has not been recorded or inferred. Primary albite appears to record rapid growth, possibly nucleating as a result of dust particles impinging on the edge of the chondrule during cooling. The presence of primary albitic plagioclase means that albite in relict chondrules in higher petrologic types is not necessarily derived purely from recrystallized mesostasis.  The effects of aqueous alteration in Semarkona noted by [11] and others also extends to feldspar. Regions within chondrules which show signs of alteration, such as dissolved mesostasis or the replacement of mesostasis by phyllosilicates (Fig. 2), typically have wider ranges of feldspar compositions than those without alteration features (Fig. 1). Also, altered chondrules show zoning of plagioclase which is likely caused by fluid alteration as non-altered chondrules do not display this zoning. An understanding of primary feldspar in Semarkona is important for interpreting the textures and compositions of feldspar in type 3 OCs of higher subtype that have been subjected to mild metamorphism and metasomatism [6,10].
