Introduction: The Near-Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) mission landed on 433 Eros in February of 2001 [1]. It then performed the first in-situ science from the surface of an asteroid, including ~2 weeks of geochemical measurements by the NEAR Gamma-Ray Spectrometer (GRS) [2]. The GRS data were used to derive bulk Fe/Si, Fe/Si, Mg/Si, Si/O, and K abundances. In general, the results supported prior indications that the surface composition of Eros was similar to the ordinary chondrites (OCs), in particular the L and LL chondrites. Curiously, the Fe/O weight ratio did not support that conclusion, suggesting that either the NEAR landing site – a ponded regolith deposit – was compositionally usual, or that some systematic effect in the GRS data was not properly addressed. NEAR GRS Measurements: The NEAR GRS consisted of an inner NaI sensor surrounded by a BGO sensor anti-coincidence shield (ACS). Prior analyses of GRS data focused on the NaI measurements [3], however in the landed geometry the ACS provided higherstatistics measurements. Because the ACS data are largely unexamined, we chose to focus on those measurements for this analysis. Figure 1 shows the summed ACS spectrum acquired at the NEAR landing site.   Figure 1. NEAR GRS Anti-coincidence Shield (ACS) gamma-ray measurements, summed over ~7 days of operation on the surface of asteroid 433 Eros. Major gamma-ray peaks of interest are labeled.  Revised Analysis: The major complications in analyzing the ACS measurements are 1) overlapping/unresolved gamma-ray peaks (Figure 1), 2) significant spacecraft-originating backgrounds, and 3) uncertain detector response in the landed measurement geometry. We have addressed the first two issues using lessons learned from the analysis of MESSENGER GRS data, including new peak fitting routines [4] and background estimation techniques [5] scaled to altitude-dependent measurements from the MESSENGER Neutron Spectrometer [e.g. 6]. The third issue was addressed through a new calibration of the NEAR GRS engineering model that fully characterized the energy and orientation-dependent response of the system. We converted the background- and detectorresponse-corrected ACS-measured photon ratios for the elements of interest to weight ratios using new radiation transport models. The resulting elemental weight ratios are Fe/Si = 1.19±0.30; Mg/Si = 0.84±0.30; Mg/O = 0.36±0.14; Si/O = 0.43±0.30; Fe/O 0.34±0.15. Quoted errors are two-standard-deviation statistical plus systematic values. We find general agreement with prior analyses [3] for Fe/Si and Mg/Si. Fe/O values differ, primarily due to an improved estimate of O spacecraft background levels. Neither Mg/O nor Si/O values were reported by [3].   Figure 2. NEAR GRS-derived Fe/Si and Fe/O weight ratios as compared to the meteorite-derived values of [8]. The size of the measurement ellipses includes the two-sigma statistical plus systematic uncertainties of the measurements.  Our measurements indicate that the surface composition of Eros, at least at the NEAR landing site, is consistent with the OCs. For example, the Fe/Si and Fe/O weight ratios, shown in Figure 2 as compared to meteorite-derived values [8], show excellent agreement with the L and LL chondrites and rule out an Hchondrite-like composition. Similar conclusions have been drawn from multispectral data [9-12] and NEAR minor-element measurements [13].  However XRS 2283.pdf

Fe/Si measurements suggest an H-chondrite-like surface [14], which we have ruled out using the ACS measurements. X-Ray Measurements: The discrepancy between the GRS-derived Fe/Si weight ratio (1.19±0.30) and the XRS-derived value (1.68±0.33) can be understood in light of recent MESSENGER XRS Fe/Si measurements from Mercury [15]. Those values were shown to be highly sensitive to the phase angle of the observations, an effect that was not corrected in the NEAR XRS data [14, 16]. As a result, the XRS-derived Fe/Si ratio for Eros is suspect. Other elements are not sensitive to this effect, and the XRS minor-element measurements [13] provide the best constraints. Hydrogen Concentration: Hydrogen concentrations for OCs are typically <2000 ppm [8], which is below the threshold for directly measuring via gammaray spectroscopy. Fortunately, GRS measurements can be used as a form on indirect neutron spectroscopy [17] to provide sensitivity to hydrogen at the <10,000 ppm level. This technique leverages measurements of multiple gamma-ray emissions from the same element to infer the gamma-ray producing neutron flux, which is highly sensitive to H concentrations.    Figure 3. MCNPX models (black diamonds) of Fe photon ratios for meteorite samples [8] with artificially varying hydrogen concentrations. The red ellipse shows the twostandard-deviation ACS-measured Fe photon ratio, and adopted Σa values from L and LL chondrites. The ellipse is consistent with hydrogen concentrations of 400 to 2600 ppm.  The NEAR ACS provided measurements of Fe via the 847-keV line, produced via neutron inelastic scattering, and the 7639-keV doublet, produced via neutron inelastic scattering. The ratio of the 847 to 7639 keV lines therefore a proxy for the fast (neutron energy > ~1 MeV) to thermal (neutron energy < ~0.1 eV) neutron flux. This ratio is a function of both the hydrogen content and total neutron absorption capacity of the regolith. We modeled this relationship using meteorite samples with artificially varying hydrogen concentrations (Figure 3) for comparison to the ACS-measured Fe photon ratio (0.68±0.22). Adopting the mean plus standard deviation macroscopic neutron absorption cross section (Σa) for L- and LL-chondrites as a constraint (89±11 cm2/g), we calculate a hydrogen concentration on Eros of 1100−700+1600 ppm (Figure 3). This value is consistent with OC fall values (467±464 ppm for L chondrites; 734±754 ppm for H chondrites). Discussion: The GRS results all now conclusively point toward an L- or LL-chondrite-like surface composition for Eros. When considering the revised interpretation of the NEAR XRS orbital measurements, all NEAR geochemical and mineralogical measurements now agree. The agreement between the global (XRS, multispectral) measurements and regional (GRS landed) measurements indicate that the NEAR landing site, a ponded regolith deposit, is not compositional distinct relative to the mean surface.  The new hydrogen concentration measurements are within the range of hydrogen abundances in L and LL chondrite falls, and support the notion that the volatile content of Eros is consistent with the OCs. GRSderived K abundances likewise agree with the OCs, leaving S as the only moderately volatile element showing evidence for depletion [19]. These observations can be reconciled by noting that XRS samples to depths <100 µm, whereas GRS samples to tens of cm. Models of S depletion by space weathering on Eros suggest that it is expected to be a shallow (<10 µm) effect, meaning that the inferred volatile depletion on Eros is a surficial effect only. Other evidence suggests that the bulk volatile content of Eros is consistent with the OCs.  References: [1] Veverka et al. (2001), Nature 413, 390-393. [2] Goldsten et al. (1997), Space Sci.
