Introduction:  A large radius secondary ion mass spectrometer (SIMS) IMS 1280 at WiscSIMS is capable of high precision oxygen three-isotope analyses of extraterrestrial materials using primary beam sizes as small as 1-2 µm and has been applied to the analyses of comet particles from Stardust missions and IDPs  [1-4]. In these SIMS analyses, the accurate positioning of the ion beam on samples is critical, because the particles are often mixtures of multiple mineral phases that could have heterogeneous isotope signatures [e.g., 1]. The positioning capability of the IMS 1280 is limited by the optical resolution of the sample viewing microscope (originally ~3.5 µm but improved to 1.3µm using UV light optics [5]) and the step size of stage (1 µm).  In order to improve the ability to target small particles, Nakashima et al. [3] developed a protocol to mark the grains of interest prior to SIMS analysis, using a focused ion beam (FIB) to remove the carbon coat at the center of the target position. This absence of surface coating appears as a bright spot in the SIMS ion imaging. The sample stage is then moved to the location of the FIB mark for the oxygen isotope analysis. Using this protocol, the primary beam is positioned on the sample surface with the accuracy better than 1µm [3].  However, the average displacement of the center of primary beam to the center of FIB mark was ~0.4µm, because stage motion and primary beam deflection of the IMS1280 are limited to 1µm step. NanoDeflector: To improve positioning accuracy, we modified the IMS1280 scanning capability by adding a microcontroller board with X and Y D/A converters to the instrument’s Scan Generator.  The X and Y signals are added to the existing signal driving the last deflector of the primary column (DPRIM5).    Custom C and Labview code on the microcontroller and the remote PC allow for user control. This modification allows for deflection and rastering of the primary beam at a resolution of 0.1 µm with a maxium deflection of ±50µm, which is applied on top of the native deflection signal (1µm resolution and a maximum deflection ±2000µm.) FIB-marking and aiming: This protocol was first developed by Nakashima et al. [3]. 1 µm squares are traced on targeted grains using a 30 keV focused Ga+ beam set to 5 pA with a Zeiss FIB-FESEM Auriga, in order to remove gold or carbon coating. A series of FIB marks (Fig. 1a) were placed on a San Carlos olivine grain at various doses of exposure to the Ga+ beam, from 40 seconds (0.2 nC/µm²) to 130 seconds (0.6 nC/µm²) to determine the optimized dose appropriate for SIMS ion imaging.

SIMS pits would be centered to the marks. The Cs+ primary beam current intensity was set at 3pA. At these conditions, the beam spot on the sample surface is < 2 µm in size. The targeted grain was positioned as close as possible to the primary ion beam by moving the stage guided by the optical miscroscope (Fig. 1b). Using a 10 µm square raster, an ion image was then produced and the beam position was adjusted by moving the stage so that the FIB mark appears as close as possible to the center (Fig. 1c). The FIB mark appears bright on the image after 2 to 3 minutes of sputtering (due to the carbon coat removal). Imaging of different marks made at different doses show that for a dose of 0.4 nC/µm² (90 seconds) or higher, the FIB mark appears almost immediately, indicating that the dose of 0.4 nC/µm² is enough to completely remove the 20nm-thick carbon-coating.   Then, using the NanoDeflector, by applying an additional voltage on D5, the beam position is moved to the center of the ion image (Fig. 1d). Once the FIB mark is properly centered, the raster is stopped and the analysis is initiated. During testing, the “analysis” time was 5 minutes, while actual three-isotope analysis takes 20 minutes.    Fig. 2: SEM SE image of a SIMS pit after a 20 min analysis. At analytical conditions, the beam size is very small, resulting in fast sputtering and deep pits, which explains the slightly larger shift when compared to the 5 min analysis pits. This shift might be minimized by using a slightly larger beam (~2µm [1-4]) and/or subµm rastering controlled by the NanoDeflector (this remains to be tested).  After test analyses, SEM imaging of the SIMS pits verified the accuracy of aiming of the SIMS beam relative to the original position of the FIB marks. Imaging shows that the pits are charging, appearing as bright large spots (Fig. 1e). To avoid this artifact, the section was recoated, allowing the pits to be accurately imaged consistent with the size observed by ion imaging after the analysis (Fig. 1f, 2 and 3). For spots with 5 minutes of sputtering, the distance between the center of the original FIB mark and the center of the SIMS pit varies from 0 to 0.19 µm, with an average of 0.08 µm; for 20 minute-analysis pits, the distance increases to an average of 0.17 ±0.15 µm (2σ). This is a significant improvement from the aiming tests run by Nakashima et al. [3] where the beam position could only be adjusted by moving the stage.  Patterns: Another case where the precision of displacement is critical is when performing a traverse of equally distant spot analyses (for instance to map a grain, or to produce a diffusion profile [6]). To test the performance of stage displacement versus NanoDeflection, we performed respective spot traverses nominally spaced by 4 µm. Fig. 3 shows the respective patterns. Stage displacement reveals that the distance between spots deviates from the initial 4 µm, severely so when changing direction (Fig. 3a). In contrast the grid made with by NanoDeflection is more accurate, with spots being equally spaced regardless of the traverse direction (Fig. 3b).    Fig. 3: Comparison of the accuracy of displacement between the stage (left) and the NanoDeflector (right). Nominal spacing is 4 µm.  References: [1] Nakamura T. et al. (2008) Science, 321, 1664.
