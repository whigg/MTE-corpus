Introduction:  The science payload on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover [1] includes the Mars Descent Imager (MARDI) camera, which has been operated since touchdown on August 6, 2012 UTC in a nadir viewing geometry.  Since landing, MARDI observations have been used to support sedimentary geology by means of granulometry and inter-particle spacing analysis [2,3].  Here we focus on experimental MARDI stereo-overlap imaging data and derived digital elevation model (DEM) results acquired up to Sol 797 that permit analysis of the micro-topography of local surface areas (~ 1 m2 in area and larger). MARDI stereo-overlapping images used to produce DEMs have been acquired episodically since Sol 488 either as a part of the sequence of datasets acquired in the Full Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) Wheel Imaging (FMWI) campaigns, or as a result of MARDI Sidewalk Video Imaging mode (SVIM) experiments.  Terrain analysis of several preliminary DEM products permits investigation of geologic textures down to subcm levels as a parameter related to the geologic evolution of local surfaces and for geotechnical analysis.   MARDI Stereo Imaging: MARDI [3,4] permits mm-scale imaging of an 92 cm x 64 cm patch of the martian surface behind the left front wheel of Curiosity from a nadir viewing geometry ~66 cm above the surface.  Ongoing, systematic studies of local gravel surfaces since Sol 310 under twilight illumination have permitted [3] analysis of clast size, spacing, and surface cover at dozens of surfaces along the rover traverse from the Shaler outcrop near Yellowknife Bay to the basal member of Aeolis Mons (i.e., Mt. Sharp), the Pahrump Hills.  Ongoing efforts by the authors of this report to relate derived sedimentologic parameters from the MARDI twilight images have suggested that local terrain properties may serve as a geologicallysignificant index of surface complexity.  In order to quantify the micro-topography of patches of local martian surfaces, we have employed a MARDI under two different operational approaches that yield image overlaps sufficient to produce DEMs with cm-scale lateral resolution and mm-scale vertical resolution. First, during FMWI, Curiosity moves forward in a series of 4 to 5 "bumps" of ~30 cm each in order to image the complete surface of each wheel with MAHLI. MARDI images are acquired at each bump position, producing images with ~50% overlap with base-to-height ratios (b/h) well-suited for stereogrammetric analysis and DEM generation, depending on the character of surface features. DEMs have been generated from MARDI images acquired during FMWI activities on Sols 488, 546, 587, 646, 679, 708 and 744. Second, during SVIM experiments, MARDI acquires images at a constant rate during a drive while using on-board software to selectively save images to prevent unnecessary image duplication. The images acquired by this technique overlap by ~75-82%. DEMs for up to ~5 m long sections of drives on Sols 691, 739, 780, 790, 792, 794, and 797 have been generated from MARDI SVIM images. MARDI DEM's can be produced with grid cells as fine as ~1 cm with vertical sampling of ~ 1 mm, and with a measured vertical noise floor of ~2 mm.  Such very local area DEM's offer higher vertical precision than standard Mastcam stereo products because of favorable b/h values and finer horizontal resolution. Here we report on preliminary analysis of DEMs from Sols 546, 679, 691, 708, 739, 744, 780, and 792.   Figure 1:   Sol 488 DEM from MARDI stereo overlap imaging.  The DEM offers 1 cm grid cells (x,y) and ~ 3 mm vertical precision. Micro-topographic features not visible in the image mosaic can be observed and measured in the DEM.

during FMWI to evaluate the quality of the derived DEM (Fig. 1).  The terrain statistics derived for the Sol 488 gravel-covered surface indicate a mean local relief (relative) of 6.26 cm and a standard deviation (SD) of local topography of 1.87 cm, across a range of 13 cm within the ~ 1 m2 of surface area.  On Sol 792, a SVIM experiment was conducted during an 5.1 m long drive across the Pahrump Hills outcrop. Figure 2 shows initial results from a ~ 5 m long section of the Sol 792 drive, with multiple local stratigraphic elements (see Fig. 2 top part), and residual texture with intrinsic micro-relief at cm scales. MARDI DEM analysis:   Initial efforts have focused on statistical analysis of cm-scale surface texture from MARDI DEMs acquired over surface terrain units independently assessed and defined in analyses of MRO HiRISE and MSL rover drive data by the MSL Surface Properties team. The terrain units were defined as part of efforts to understand rover wheel wear and other geotechnical factors, and assigned colors based on their qualitative roughness (cooler colors = smoother, warmer colors = rougher). Using MARDI DEMs produced for surface terrain units across the roughness (color-coded) spectrum, we have computed robust statistical measures of texture at scales from 1 to 10's of cm (Table I).   The bedrock-dominated surfaces (Sols 691 (orange) and 739 (red)) are "roughest" at extremely local scales, with slope variability over ~20 degrees (StdDev{slope}).  Table I:  Statistical terrain parameters derived from MARDI DEMs for key surface units, color-coded using the MSL Project terrain designations (from Green for soil to Red for bedrock).   The most textured units in bedrock-dominated areas are "roughest" with more than 20 degrees (std. dev.) variation in local slopes.   Terrain Comparisons.  It is instructive to compare the DEMs from surfaces with distinctively different geologic cover types, as showcased in Table I using multi-scale methods, as illustrated in Figure 3 for bedrock versus soil surfaces..   Figure 2:  Sol 792 (Pahrump) "footpath" DEM from 50 overlapping MARDI sidewalk video frames covering 5.1 m of transect.  At top is the relative relief along the drive, while below is the residual topography after removing all longer-wavelength elements (detrending).  The intrinsic local "roughness" of such bedrock surfaces is ~ 1 cm (as a Std. Dev. of residual relief), with 18-20 degrees local slopes.   This is 2-3 times "rougher" than soil-dominated surfaces in Gale Crater, suggesting minimal regolith cover thickness.   Figure 3:  Variable Baseline Slope (VBS) analysis of bedrock surfaces (Sol 739, Sol 780) versus a soil-covered surface (Sol 708) showing how longer-baseline mean local slope properties decay relative to those at the scale of most of the clasts that litter such surfaces.  This approach allows surface texture classification and correlation with dominant wavelengths of specific geologic processes (i.e., from terrestrial experience).  Future Work:  Correlation of statistical terrain properties from longer "footpath" DEM's (> 3m) produced from MARDI sidewalk video imaging with stratigraphic and provenance analyses by the MSL science team is underway, with results anticipated by March 2015 (including statistical texture modelling).
