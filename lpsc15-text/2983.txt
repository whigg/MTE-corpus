SECONDARY-VOLATILES LINKED METALLIC IRON IN EUCRITES: THE COMPLEX CASE OFCAMEL DONGA. Paul H. Warren1 and Junko Isa1, 1Dept. Earth, Planetary & Space Sci., UCLA, Los Angeles,CA 90095-1567, USA; pwarren@ucla.edu.The recent discovery of enigmatic large, veinshaped masses of native Fe in NWA 5738, a eucritewith an extraordinarily diverse array of secondarymetasomatic alterations [1], has prompted interest inother Fe-metal rich eucrites. As described by Cleverlyet al. [2] and [3], Camel Donga contains about 2.1 wt%(1 vol%) metallic iron. For the most part, this metaloccurs as scattered small (<0.1 mm) grains of highpurity Fe composition: <0.05 wt% Ni according to [2],0.058 wt% according to an INAA study of aggregatedparticles [3]. In our own study, from a typical sample(CD1), out of 35 scattered points analysed, 24 yieldedresults below our detection limit of 0.012 wt% (usinghigh current and long count durations), and the other11 average 0.03 wt%; the only consistently detectableimpurity, Co, averages (N=35) 0.036 wt%.Palme et al. [3] developed an elegant model fororigin of these pure-Fe metals by reduction, with mostof the Fe deriving from reduction of the ferrosilitecomponent of the rock's pyroxene. These authors notedthat bulk-rock data [cf. 2, 4] show no increase in Feover the normal concentration (~ 144 mg/g) for a ferroan noncumulate eucrite, so they inferred that ironwas reduced in situ, not added, by the secondary processing of this rock. As reducing agent, they suggestedthat S2 gas formed by decomposition of troilite (FeS) ina reheating episode, and then after combining withpyroxene-derived O, left the rock as SO2 gas.However, this simple pyroxene-reduction, SO2-lossmodel does not fit so well with more recent observations on Camel Donga. Two bulk analyses by [5] foundhigher Fe, 150 and 177 mg/g, and the latter result (significantly enriched vs. most noncumulate eucrites)came from a powder produced from an exceptionallylarge (1.8 g) mass of the meteorite. Also in contrastwith earlier studies [2, 3], we have found that the compositional range for low-Ca pyroxene (again, using our"typical" sample CD1) extends up to mg = 51 mol%.This spread is somewhat enigmatic, because for themost part our results fall along a tie line betweenEn41Wo2 opx and En32Wo43 augite [cf. 2, 3]. Still, thehigher mg results imply that the rock's bulk-silicate Femust be slightly lower than previously supposed.We have also studied an additional sample of Camel Donga (CD2; unfortunately severely weathered) thatis atypical inasmuch as it contains an 11-mm, sharpbounded, ovoid or lens-shaped nodule with vastlyhigher original metal content than the surrounding material (Fig. 1; nodule is rust-colored; black is fusioncrust). The metal has mostly been altered to oxide, butthe other phases in the nodule were not so greatly affected by the weathering. The nodule's pyroxenes consistently have compositions along the aforementioned,typical-CD tie line (e.g., En41Wo2 opx); no extraordinary pyroxene reduction is evident in association withthe extraordinary-high metal content.The CD2 nodule's metal, and also the metals in asmaller tight cluster nearby (3 mm outside the nodule),have distinctively Ni-enriched compositions. For thenodule, 21 analyses avg. 0.525±0.009 wt% Ni and0.040±0.007 wt% Co. For the nearby cluster, 5 analyses give practically identical averages. For 9 analysesof metals in the same CD2 thin section but far from thenodule, the averages are 0.064 wt% Ni and 0.044 wt%Co; more similar, although still not quite so pure-Fe,compared to our CD1 results (see above). Also, one ofthe bulk-rock analyses [4] shows Ni enrichment (38µg/g). Such high Ni contents would be unprecedentedin a eucrite free of impactor-debris "contamination",and thus imply that not all of the Fe-metal in CamelDonga formed by simple in-situ reduction.The opaque oxides of Camel Donga (CD1) showsurprisingly little evidence for involvement in the insitu reduction process. Margins as well as interiors ofilmenites show Fe-metal no more abundant than in themeteorite as a whole, and no rutile has yet been found.The spinels also appear unaffected, including in termsof mg, even at their rims. None of the Mg- and Cr-richilmenite that can form when spinel is reduced [6] hasbeen found in Camel Donga. It seems mysterious that abrief, high-T redox episode would attack pyroxenewhile leaving FeO-rich oxides unmolested. Diffusion ismuch faster in oxides than in pyroxene [7-9].In CD1, an aspect of similarity to NWA 5738 [1]was found in the form of a discontinuous, curvy vein of2983.pdf

anomalously Na-poor (An96) plagioclase within one ofthe larger pyroxenes. We suspect that Camel Donga isa product of a complex sequence of alterations thatincluded, and may have begun with, localized mechanical admixture of impactor-debris "contamination". Inmodeling NWA 5738, [1] noted that Dawn results haveshown that the crust of Vesta (and by extension, forthat matter, any basalt-crusted belt asteroid) appears tobe remarkably rich in volatile-rich carbonaceouschrondritic matter that remains relatively intact throughthe accretion process (which is gentle, in this context,compared to more familiar Earth and Moon settings).Fluids emanating from such masses, when heated, arelikely to be diverse initially and then evolve to evengreater diversity, including redox diversity. CamelDonga may represent one, most highly reduced, end ofa spectrum of eucrite secondary alteration scenariosthat also includes extraordinarily oxidized materials, asfound from spinel (and olivine) analyses for the mostcommon variety of alteration veins in NWA 5738 [1].Meanwhile, we have also studied (again using thestoikiometric methodology of [1]) spinel-olivine couplings in alteration veins of the Haraiya [10] and NWA5073 [11] eucrites. Results indicate uncommonly highoxidation states (Fe3+ in spinel), by eucrite standards,although not so high as in NWA 5738. The link between such oxidized materials and sulfurized eucritessuch as NWA 2339 [12], and to the troilitedecomposition mechanism proposed by [2], should bethe subject of exciting further research.Aknowledgements: We thank the Smithsonian Institution and the University of Münster (Addi Bischoff) forthe loan of Haraiya and NWA 5073 samples, respectively.References: [1] Warren P.
