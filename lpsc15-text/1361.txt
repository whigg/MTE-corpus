Introduction:  We have analyzed the Duluth gabbro to further demonstrate the capabilities of our novel laser-ablation resonance ionization mass spectrometer, a prototype for an in-situ dating instrument.  Having recently reported [1] successful 87Rb-87Sr isochron dating of the Martian meteorite Zagami, we are continuing to analyze a suite of rocks that present many of the analytical challenges we would expect from planetary specimens from throughout the inner Solar System.  The Duluth gabbro has Rb and Sr in concentrations [2] somewhat lower than those of Apollo 15 KREEP basalts [3], and has a comaprably small range of Rb/Sr ratios.  These characteristics make the Duluth gabbro a useful analogue for dating lunar rocks by the 87Rb-87Sr isochron method.  Background:  Among the key advances we have made in the last year to enable our Zagami analyses was the use of ablation laser pulses with intensity of ~0.6 GW/cm, a tenfold increase over the ablation intensity we had used earlier (and the highest we are presently able to produce).  The higher ablation intensity led to much greater reproducibility, as has been found in several analytical chemistry experiments reviewed by [4].  With the higher intensity, we obtained isochron ages for Zagami that were broadly consistent with the (much more precise) age determinations of [5-7] in each of four runs that we attempted.  In both of the runs that were completed with >100 spot analyses, our precision met the NASA technology roadmap target of 200 Ma [8].   Unlike the careful selection of the most pristine mineral grains that typifies a conventional geochronology experiment, our procedure so far has been to analyze dozens to hundreds of spots in a simple raster pattern over the surface of the specimen, at ~200 µm intervals.  The precision with which we ultimately determine an age is limited primarily by the spread of Rb/Sr ratios in the spots we sample, and, of course, by the possibility that not all phases in the specimen have behaved as closed chemical systems since formation.  Figure 1 shows the isochron diagram from one of our runs on the Zagami meteorite.  In this run, the relatively few analyses with high 87Rb/86Sr ratios control the slope of the best fit line, and thus the isochron age.    Measurements: The principal change we have made to our instrument since our Zagami experiment was switching tasks for two nominally identical optical parametric oscillators, which drive the first resonant transitions in Sr (461 nm) and Rb (780 nm).  We found that both units produced more power when we switched the wavelengths of these tunable systems, so we now have pulse energies of 530 µJ and 20 µJ for the first Sr and Rb transitions, respectively.  The other lasers parameters we used in this experiment are as in [1].   !

We rastered 333 spots on a cm-sized slab of Duluth gabbro over 102 hours in November 2014.  The run included 85 hours of rastering spots chosen arbitarily from a rectangular grid several mm across, and 17 hours of repeat visits to spots with particularly high Rb/Sr ratios, with the aim of more precisely constraining the isochron age.  Of these spot analyses, 310 yielded >2σ detections of 86,87,88Sr and 85,87Rb.  We show isotopic data from these 310 spots in Figure 2; the best fit line through all these data (MSWD 2.1) corresponds to an age of 810 ± 180 Ma.  By comparison to our isochron analysis of ~1 cm2 of a single rock, Faure et al. [2] analyzed a suite of co-genetic rocks from a locality within the Duluth gabbro complex; their data, once corrected for the value of the 87Rb decay constant determined by [9], yield an isochron age of 1096 ± 14 Ma.  The Faure et al. isochron [2] includes two analyses with 87Rb/86Sr > 2; we have evidently not sampled this lithology, which would greatly improve our analytical precision.  Nevertheless, our precision exceeds the technology roadmap criterion [8], and our accuracy is such that our age is consistent with [2] at 1.6σ.  Moreover, our result demonstrates that the analytical uncertainty we are able to achieve does not scale with specimen age, which might otherwise have been a concern given the high fractional uncertainty in our Zagami date. Implications:  The importance of our work lies not in the fact that we have dated this particular specimen (which, after all, was dated with much greater precision by [2]), but rather in the fact that we have done so with a technique that can be miniaturized for spaceflight [e.g., 10].  We have already constructed a smaller instrument, 40 cm × 50 cm × 180 cm in size, with lasers reduced in size from the prototype used in this work by more than 100 times.  We also have developed engineering designs for Martian and lunar instruments.  The designs are for instruments of ~25 kg, with built-in sampling systems, power consumption <35 W, and volumes of ~15 L (i.e., reduced in scale by ~25 times from our smaller prototype).  Moreover, the repetition rate of the laser and electrode pulses would be increased from our current 20 Hz to 5 kHz.   Radioisotopic dating of lunar samples returned by the Apollo and Luna missions has underpinned the calibration of crater-count chronologies for all the terrestrial planets [e.g., 11-13].  However, the assignments of geologic context to some of the dated lunar samples are tenuous, which calls into question the validity of the inferred cratering chronologies for the planets, and thus too our understanding of the timescales and durations of processes in Solar System history [e.g., 14].  It would therefore be very desireable to date an additional suite of lunar samples, more closely tied to their geologic context.  In-situ dating has an important role to play in such an endeavor, whether as a standalone achievement, or to triage samples for ultimate return to Earth.  References:  [1] Anderson F. S. et al.
