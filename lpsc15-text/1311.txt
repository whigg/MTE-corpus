En  route  to  Mars, MSL's  RAD  was already operational and  observed  a number  of  solar particle  events.  These  were  also seen by an array of spacecraft  in  the heliosphere, including  SOHO,  ACE, MESSENGER, and STEREO A and B.. This  constellation provides  a  unique opportunity  to  investigate  particle propagation  in  the ecliptic  plane  and thus constrain particle propagation models models of the  inner  heliosphere  such  as  Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) ENLIL [2, 3] with particle propagation information.RAD nominally measures energetic ions up to approximately 100 MeV/nuc, but was buried deep inside the MSL cruise  stage.  Due  to  this  significant  shielding, RAD was sensitive to particles in a significantly higher and somewhat uncertain energy range. Even behind the aforementioned  shielding,  onset  times  of  particle events can be clearly identified. They are provided in this work.Data  Analysis: The  RAD  instrument  measures both charged and neutral particles through a combination of silicon solid-state detectors and a sensitive anticoincidence  which  surrounds  organic  and  inorganic scintillator materials [1].  Figure 1 shows a schematic view of RAD and explains its basic functions. Charged particles are measured with the multiple dE/dx vs. total E method, whereas neutrals (gammas and neutrons) are measured in detectors D and E only. The high-density calorimeter, D, is made of CsI (Tl), and scintillator E is made of proton-rich BC-432m plastic. To allow clean measurements of the neutral component, D and E are surrounded  by a  highly efficient  anti-coincidence,  F. The high-density CsI scintillator stops ~95 MeV protons.Displaying the energy measured in the solid-state detectors (A, B, C) and the total energy measured in A in the combinations shown in the plot shown in Fig. 2 allows us to discriminate stopping protons, i.e., protons for  which  we know the  total  energy.  During  cruise, RAD measured between 3.9 and 7.7 observations per hour.Once the Sun has released the accelerated particles, they stream freely along the interplanetary field where they can experience various transport  effects such as focusing,  scattering,  and  adiabatic  deceleration.  The particles that arrive first are the ones which have the highest  energy  and  experienced  the  least  scattering. Thus, when plotting energy deposited in D vs. time, we expect  particles  with  higher  energy  to  arrive  before those with less energy. It turns out that this remains true even  with  the  heavy  average  shielding  surrounding RAD of ~27 g/cm2 because of its very uneven distribution shown in the cumulative plot in Fig. 3. Thus, a significant  fraction  of  particles  stopping in  D had  only Figure 2: ESSD*Etot vs. ESSD/Etot . Black dots show all data including electrons and other minimally ionizing particles (MIPS), red and blue dots show protons stopping in RAD. A1 (red) and A2 (blue) denote different segments in detector A [1].Figure 1: RAD instrument schematic.

very little shielding to traverse and, consequently, lost only very little of their energy. Given the distance the particles at the onset of a particle event had to travel, we can now easily determine the solar release time, t0, as tm = t0 + d/v, where tm is the time it was measured, d is the distance, and v the particle velocity.Results:  Five solar particle events were seen by RAD during the 2012 cruise phase.  A time marker at the Sun related to particle release at the Sun, the time of maximum soft X-ray flaring activity at the Sun [4], flare magnitude as well as the ENLIL-derived length of the Parker spiral are given in Table 1 below.Date(DD/ MM/YY)SEP  Onset Time @ RAD (HH:MM)Soft  X-ray  Peak Time  @  Sun (HH:MM)Length  of Parker  spiral [AU]23/01/12 05:05 03:59 (M8.7) 1.3627/01/12 18:15 18:37 (X1.7) 1.3307/03/12 02:40 00:24 (X5.4) 1.5213/03/12 16:48 17:42 (M7.9) 1.6317/05/12 02:38 01:47 (M5.1) 1.99An example  of  a  dispersion  plot  is  given  in  Fig.  4 which shows the energy deposited in D vs. observation time for the May 17, 2012 event. Particles with higher energy arrive earlier than lower energy ones. The black line shows the expected arrival times for particles with that energy, no shielding, and the length of the Parker spiral  given in Table 1 above.  The latter was determined from the WSA-ENLIL models available at the Community  Coordinated  Modeling  Center  (CCMC) [5].  Discrepancies  between  the  onset  times  at  RAD (see Table 1) and the flaring times observed at the Sun are likely to be due to inaccurate modeling of the IMF or to transport effects between the Sun and MSL. The apparent discrepancies of observation and flare times on 01/27/2012 and 03/13/2012 are probably due to the long  duration  of  those  flares  which  began  about  an hour earlier. Obviously, particles were released before the maximum flare activity.Conclusions:  Five solar particle events were seen by MSL/RAD en route to Mars. Significant enhancements of low-energy particles (E < 130 MeV) were observed because the inhomogeneous shielding of RAD provided some nearly unshielded views of outer space.
