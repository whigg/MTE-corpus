VENUS967GT CATALOGUE OF IMPACT CRATERS AND COMPARISON WITH MARTIAN AND LUNAR CRATERS.  G. Salamunićcar1, 1Ivana Zajca 8, HR-47000 Karlovac, Croatia, gsc@ieee.org.   Summary: The result of this work is a catalogue of 967 Venusian craters, wherein each crater is registered with the used topography and optical images. Using a crater detection algorithm (CDA), these craters were compared with Martian and Lunar craters. Introduction: With each new lunar and planetary mission, the volume of acquired data increases significantly. This is a motivation for work on CDAs [1, 2], in order to be used as assisting tool during work on crater catalogues [3, 4, 5]. One of the challenges is availability of digital elevation maps (for DEM-based CDAs) and optical images (for optical-based CDAs), wherein the first are usually available only in lower resolutions, and the second are usually available only for some smaller segments of the surface. Hybrid [6] and Integrated [7] CDA have been proposed to overcome these issues. Another challenge is each crater from the catalogue to be registered with underlying DEM and optical global image mosaics. When this is satisfied, a CDA can be used for automatic extraction of morphological properties [8], such as depth/diameter ratio. Only one CDA (optical-based) has been used so far for the extraction of Venusian craters [9]. Datasets and Methods: Datasets and methods, used and developed, are as follows: Venus topography. The Magellan Global Topography Data Record (GTDR) archive contains global topographic data acquired by the Magellan spacecraft during its mission to Venus [10]. The highest available resolution of 1/22.767° has been used, upsampled to 1/32°. Crater detection algorithm. In the previous work, a topography-based CDA has been developed [1] and improved using the Crater Shape-based interpolation method [2]. The utilization of the improved CDA [2] and the available global topography [10] of Venus resulted with the initial VENUS345GT catalogue [11]. Venus optical images. The global mosaics of Magellan left-look and right-look optical images were recently assembled from the individual tiles [12]. The highest available resolution of 75 m/pixel has been used (506928x230948 pixels). Images were extended with 8449 extra empty lines at the top (North) and 14067 at the bottom (South), in order to have 506928x253464 pixels. Images were downsampled to 1/1024° and lower resolutions, wherein resolutions up to 1/512° (~206 m/pixel) were sufficient for this work. Manual verification of craters. Each crater from VENUS345GT [11] was manually verified using the previously manually assembled catalogue [13] in order to ensure that each crater from the resulting catalogue has double confirmation that it is a crater indeed. The remaining craters were verified in this work, using newly available optical images [12]. During this process, coordinates (longitude and latitude) and diameter of each crater were verified and when necessary adjusted according to the used global datasets. Results: The CDA [2] detected 345 craters (the initial VENUS345GT catalogue) using Venus topography. Each crater from this catalogue was confirmed as a crater using the catalogue with 967 craters [13]. The 622 remaining craters were manually verified, wherein 614 were confirmed as a crater using Venus optical images, as shown for example in Fig. 1. The only craters not covered by either of the used datasets were: Bickerdyke, Landowska, Deledda, Duse, Osipenko, Hua Mulan, Tatyana, and Janice. For the purpose of completeness, these 8 craters were added to the final catalogue after additional check of their coordinates/diameter using an independent source [14]. Conclusion: The registration of each crater with the used datasets made it possible to use the CDA for the automated extraction of depth/diameter ratio, as shown for the resulting VENUS967GT catalogue in Fig. 2. The catalogue is mostly complete for craters larger than ~10 km in diameter. References:  [1] Salamunićcar G. and Lončarić S. (2010) Trans. Geosci. Remote Sens., 48, 2317-2329.
