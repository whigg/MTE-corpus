These studiesare conducted based on the diagnostic absorption bandsof 1µm and 2µm. On the other hand, it has been reported that several sites on the Moon exhibit no absorption bands for 1µm and 2µm (hereafter featureless (FL)spectra) [e.g., 5,6]. For the interpretations for the origin of FL spectra, we need to understand the global occurrence trends of FL points on the Moon. Thus, weconducted the global survey using SP data to reveal theglobal distribution of FL points.RESULTSSP has obtained continuous spectral reflectance data forabout 70 million points (0.5 by 0.5 km footprint) on theMoon in wavelength λ = 0.5-2.6µm and a spectral resolution of 6-8 nm [7,8]. Analyzing the 70 million spectrawith the global survey algorithm used in [2-4], we identified the spectra whose absorption depths at wavelengthsλd are less than the critical depth dc. We used dc = 0.01for λd = 0.93, 0.98, 1.05, and 1.25µm and dc = 0.03for λd = 2.00µm. Applying the algorithm to all the SPdata, we found 244 points of FL spectra.Fig. 1 shows example of the FL spectra (A, B, and C).For a comparison, the spectra for olivine-rich site (F)[3],purest anorthosite (PAN) site (D)[2], and Mg-spinel-richsite (E)[8] are plotted. The FL spectra show a smoothfeature for λ > 0.7µm as compared to those of the otherlunar minerals. The typical spectra for the mixing layersin the highlands, which are affected by space weatheringand/or soil developments, are also plotted (G, H, and I),where we can see a discernible 1µm band in λ ∼ 0.91.0µm. Thus, the FL spectra are different from thoseof the mixing layers. Indeed, the discernible 1µm bandfeatures are used for the interpretation of LCP-dominantspectra for the mixing layers [9].Fig. 2 shows the global distribution of FL points.The detection points are clustered into several local areas.

Note that these impact basins are also PAN-bearing sites [1,2]. In addition, the FL spectra are found at large, prominent impactcraters: e.g., Debye, D’Alembert, and Fowler craters.These craters are also the PAN-bearing sites [1,2]. Thus,the occurrence of the FL points are always associatedwith the PAN. On the other hand, there is no FL pointinside the ProcellarumKREEP Terrain (PKT) and SouthPole Aitken (SPA) basin. Furthermore, we can also seein Fig. 2 that there is an asymmetric distribution of theFL points between the nearside and farside of the Moon.Even the highlands in the nearside (e.g. around Tychocrater) does not possess FL point.1285.pdf

For acomparison, the data of PAN points by [2] are plotted.The background is the total crustal thickness map [12].Fig. 3(a) shows the local distribution in the Orientalebasin. The FL points are distributed along the peak ringsof this basin. The PAN points are also distributed alongthe peak rings. We can also see that most of the FL pointsare distributed in the eastern half of the peak rings, whilemost of the PAN are found in the western half. On theother hand, there are no FL nor PAN points in its centralregion. Fig. 3(b) shows the FL and PAN points in theHertzsprung basin. They are distributed along the peakrings, while the center region of this basin does not possess FL and PAN points. The same distribution patternwas observed at the other basins.In a local scale, they are distributed around the rimsor ejecta deposits of fresh impact craters. Fig. 4(a) showsthe local distribution of FL points around Hayn crater located at the outer region of the Humboldtianum basin.The FL points are distributed on the rim and ejecta deposits of the Hayn crater, while they are not found insidethis crater. (Since the FL points are found at various observational timings, the lack of the FL points inside thecrater is not due to shadow.) The previous survey [2] alsofound the PAN points around the rim. Fig. 4(b) showsthe FL points in the Debye crater. There is a 10-km sizedfresh crater inside the Debye crater, where many PANpoints are distributed. On the other hand, FL points aredistributed around the fresh crater.DISCUSSIONWhat produced the FL points on the Moon? In general,the absorption depth would be affected by space weathering, the grain size in regoliths, and geometrical conditions (e.g., phase angle) [10]. In addition to these effects, PAN could be an important factor for the occurrence of the FL, because our data showed that most of 100 km (a)PANFL 50 km (b)PANFLFigure 3: The close-up images of the FL points in (a) Orientale and (b) Hertzsprung basins.

Thus, we propose three possible origins: shocked plagioclase [5,6],the PAN with small iron particles by space weathering[11], or the deposition of fine grains of PAN as seen inSwirl. Whatever the origin for the FL is, the excavation of the primordial PAN layer in the lunar crust by thebasin formations [2] could be related to the occurrence ofthe FL, because the FL points are limited to the concentric regions of the major impact basins in the highlands.Our new data may provide a new observational evidenceof eroded lunar primordial crust.REFERENCES[1] Ohtake, M. et al., Nature, 461, 236, 2009.
