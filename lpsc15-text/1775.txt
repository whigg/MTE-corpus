Introduction:  Asteroid taxonomic classifications are usually one of the first efforts to broadly constrain the characteristics of individual asteroids. Various taxonomic schemes have been devised and they can usually be applied to a relatively large number of asteroids [1,2]. While useful for broadly grouping asteroids with similar optical properties, they are not designed to provide rigorous compositional or mineralogic determinations [1], nor are they able to associate an asteroid with a specific meteorite type. This work is a continuing effort to better constrain the abundance of basaltic asteroids in the main asteroid belt. At least two discrete populations of basaltic asteroids probably exist: 1) those asteroids that originated from the surface of (4) Vesta that were ejected via collisions early in solar system history (i.e., Vestoids), and 2) those basaltic asteroids originating from unique, non-Vesta basaltic parent bodies. The Vestoid group has been primarily characterized via taxonomic classification (i.e., V-type), family identification, and spatial proximity to (4) Vesta [3,4]. A much smaller subset of Vestoids has been mineralogically characterized and associated with the HED meteorites [5,6,7].  In contrast, knowledge of the abundance of outer main belt basaltic asteroids is very poorly constrained, but suggested to be no greater than the mass of the Vestoid population [8]. Few candidate outer belt basaltic asteroids have been identified and include (1459) Magnya, (7472) Kumakiri, and (10537) 1991 RY16 [9,10]. Analysis of the distribution of V-type asteroids in the main belt suggests the existing basaltic asteroid population should dominate near (4) Vesta in the asteroid belt Sunward of the 3:1 mean-motion resonance at 2.5 AU [11].  Project Details: The original data set for this research includes 650 asteroids that are members of the Vp taxonomic class and have effective diameter (Deff) and albedo estimates derived from Wide Field Infrared Survey (WISE) data [12,13]. This project will attempt to more rigorously characterize ~125 Vp-type asteroids near (4) Vesta and ~14 Vp-type asteroids that are located in the outer main belt beyond 2.5 AU. Our primary efforts are to better constrain the basaltic asteroid population and determine the accuracy of the Vp taxonomy in identifying likely basaltic asteroids.  Past Work: [14] reported NIR spectra, pyroxene mineral chemistries, and potential HED meteorite analogs for eight Vp-type asteroids: (3867) Shiretoko, (5235) Jean-Loup, (5560) Amytis, (6331) 1992 FZ1, (6976) Kanatsu, (17469) 1991 BT, (29796) 1999 CW77, and (30872) 1992 EM17. The combination of existing evidence suggests that all eight of these asteroids are likely Vestoids and have analogs associated with the howardite or eucrite meteorites. This initial work showed that these eight asteroids are likely derived from the surface of (4) Vesta. Observations and Methodology: All observations for the 12 asteroids reported here were taken at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) on the nights of August 25 and 26, and September 3 and 4, 2014 (UT). Near-infrared (NIR) spectra were obtained using the upgraded SpeX spectrograph utilizing the prism mode (~0.7-2.5 microns), the 0.8" wide slit, and with the dichroic open. Weather conditions were clear with low relative humidity for all four nights.  The Vp-type asteroids in this work include (2011) Veteraniya, (3648) Raffinetti, (5875) Kuga, (9147) Kourakuen, (9553) Colas, (8149) Ruff, (11699) 1998 FL105, (12073) Larimer, (15237) 1988 RL6, (31414) Rotaryusa, (32940) 1995 UW4, and (40733) 1999 SM17.  See Table 1 for details of the observing circumstances. See Table 2 for orbital element information for each asteroid.   Data reduction took place utilizing a new version of Spextool to support the upgraded SpeX spectrograph and array [15]. Spextool allows spectral background sky subtraction, sub-channel pixel shifting to align spectra, telluric corrections, and spectral averaging and display. Telluric corrections of the water vapor bands at ~1.4- and ~1.9-microns are the most critical to deriving a high-quality average asteroid NIR reflectance spectrum. Each asteroid is typically paired with a G-type main sequence star that is within ~5 degrees of the asteroid on the sky to empirically model the atmosphere. A solar analog star is also observed to correct the overall asteroid NIR spectral slope when non-G2V stars are used for telluric corrections. The result is the creation of an average asteroid NIR spectrum that mimics an asteroid's actual reflectance of sunlight. The data reduction process is summarized as follows: Asteroid/Sun = (Asteroid/Extinction Star) / (Solar Analog/Extinction Star).   Two analysis methods were utilized to isolate absorption features, derive continuum-removed features through the use of linear continua, to determine absorption band centers and band areas, and calculate  Band Area Ratios (BAR) [16,17,18]. These tools are most applicable to asteroids exhibiting absorption features caused by the presence of surficial pyroxene and/or olivine group minerals. Basalt is spectrally dominated by pyroxene and mineralogically includes pyroxene and plagioclase feldspar as the only major minerals. Temperature corrections to continuumremoved absorption band centers were applied using the techniques from [19,20]. Laboratory-based mineral and meteorite calibrations from [19,21] were used to constrain the average surface pyroxene chemistries for each asteroid, which were then compared to pyroxene chemistries for the HED meteorites to determine the mostly likely meteorite analog for each asteroid. Anticipated Results: We will present the average NIR reflectance spectra for the 12 asteroids, along with spectral mineral identifications, and associated band centers, areas, and BARs. Average pyroxene chemistries will also be determined for those asteroids exhibiting pyroxene-dominated features, which will then be compared to pyroxene chemistries of the HED meteorites. These results will: 1) likely determine an additional number of Vp-type asteroids that can be labeled as likely Vestoids derived from (4) Vesta, 2) continue testing the accuracy of the Vp taxonomy and its ability to identify basaltic asteroids, and 3) possibly identify any asteroids that are not-basaltic.
