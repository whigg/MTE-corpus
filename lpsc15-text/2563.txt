The origin of the radar anomalies found in the Venusian highlands remains unclear. Most explanations for these radar anomalies come from theoretical work [1, 7, 9, 10]. Previous studies suggest increased surface roughness or materials with higher dielectric constants as well as surfaceatmospheric interactions [1, 7]. Several possible candidates of high-dielectric materials are tellurium, ferroelectric materials, and lead or bismuth sulfides.  This work intends to constrain the source of the radar anomalies on Venus by experimental means. Possible materials that could potentially cause the high reflectivities on the surface of Venus are investigated and their behavior tested under simulated Venusian conditions, with special emphasize on the combined effect of pressure and temperature.   Methods: Stability experiments were conducted in the Venus simulation chamber at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center. Several compounds thought to exist on Venus were tested. These include tellurium (Te), bismuthinite (Bi2S3), tellurobismuthite (Bi2Te3), coloradoite (HgTe), and pyrite (FeS2). One gram of each sample was heated in the chamber to average Venusian surface conditions, and separately to highland conditions (460°C and 90 bar, 380°C and 55 bar, respectively) under a simulated Venusian atmosphere of 96.5% CO2, 3.5% N2 and 150 ppm SO2. The latter conditions are those at 10 km of elevation, thus encompassing the altitude range at which the anomalies exist. This was accomplished by filling the chamber with the atmospheric mixture at room temperature and then heating to the desired temperature thus reaching the desired pressure. After each run, the samples were weighed and analyzed using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD).  Each compound was also individually tested in an oven at the University of Arkansas in order to further isolate possible candidates. The samples were placed in a Lindberg tube oven and heated at 380°C and 460°C while under a steady flow of the same simulated Venusian atmosphere mixture at ambient pressure. This experiment isolated effects of temperature without pressure being a factor. The heated samples were then analyzed using XRD.  Results: The two tellurium samples tested in the oven decreased in mass. The sample at 380°C showed a small amount of light colored discoloration. The sample at 460°C showed significant discoloration. Both samples showed oxidation when analyzed by XRD (Table 1). The bismuth sulfide sample heated to 460°C in the chamber, decreased in mass and showed no noticeable discoloration. At 380°C the sample mass decreased and there was a small amount of dark discoloration. XRD analysis showed no phase change. Pyrite at 380°C, in the chamber, showed a decrease in mass and its appearance remained unchanged. XRD analysis identified the sample as pyrite but also indicated elemental sulfur.

It showed no remarkable change in appearance at 380°C and showed a light discoloration at 460°C. Coloradoite decreased in mass at both temperatures and showed some discoloration. XRD analysis revealed the samples as mercury telluride but also indicated elemental tellurium. Discussion: Several of the compounds show promising results when tested under Venusian surface conditions. Tellurium has been suggested many times as a source for the radar anomalies, however, our experiments show that it readily oxidizes. The fact that it is unstable at the anomaly conditions indicates it is not an ideal candidate. The XRD analysis for bismuthinite indicates a complex structure although no major phase change occurred in the chamber. Preliminary data suggests 2563.pdf

that bismuthinite would be stable under all Venusian conditions. Pyrite was previously suggested as a potential source for the anomalies [2]. The existence of pyrite would explain the high reflectivities as iron sulfides have high conductivities. When analyzed by XRD the 380°C sample showed evidence of elemental sulfur. Further analysis on the 460°C sample needs to be completed to determine candidate status. While pyrite itself may be thermodynamically unstable under Venusian conditions, iron sulfides may still be a potential candidate for the anomalies. Tellurobismuthite was chosen for this project because bismuth sulfide and tellurium have been suggested as potential candidates in the literature and tellurobismuthite is a likely product between both [8, 11]. In these investigations, the compound showed insignificant mass change, suggesting stability, however, when analyzed using XRD the sample at 460°C showed a structural change. Approximately 9% of the sample transformed into BiTe (Fig. 1).  Figure 1. XRD results of tellurobismuthite untreated (bottom), 380°C (middle) and 460°C (top). Under Venusian conditions, coloradoite would likely form and would have a higher reflectivity than the surrounding basalt. XRD analysis on the samples at both temperatures showed that while the majority of the sample was stable, some residual tellurium remained while mercury vaporized (Fig. 2). This resulted in a deficit in mass. While elemental tellurium was evident in the sample at 380°C, the majority of the sample (61%) remained as coloradoite. At 460°C, only 41% of the sample remained in its original form. Therefore, coloradoite showed to be more stable under Venusian high altitude conditions.  Figure 2.

Conclusion: Several compounds theoretically existent on Venus were tested under both surface and highland conditions in a Venus simulation chamber, as well as a tube oven at the University of Arkansas. Two samples, bismuthinite, and tellurobismuthite can be ruled out because they are stable under all Venusian conditions. Tellurium was found not to be an ideal candidate because it oxidizes very readily under all conditions. Two potential candidates are coloradoite and pyrite because they show stability at high altitude conditions. Both of these would exhibit a higher dielectric value than the surrounding and low-lying basalt, creating a different radar signature. More research needs to be done to determine candidate status for these two. References: [1] Rogers, A. and Ingalls, R., (1970) Radio Science, 5, 425-433.
