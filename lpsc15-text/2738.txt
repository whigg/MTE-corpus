Impact Melt Deposits at the Antipodes of Tycho and Copernicus CratersJ.-P. Williams1, D. A. Paige1, P. Jo¨gi1, 1Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences, University of California, LosAngeles, CA, 90095, USA (jpierre@mars.ucla.edu)Introduction: A region on the lunar farside hasbeen identified as unusually rocky in Diviner rockabundance maps and MiniRF CPR and backscatterimages [1][2]. LROC images show the region contains remarkable deposits of material that appear tohave been originally fluid in nature when emplacedas the deposits consists of flat, ponded materialin topographic depressions and veneers on slopedsurfaces with evidence for down-slope movement.Rocky surfaces typically are associated with youngcraters and their ejecta and the ponded nature ofthese deposits is similar to impact melts commonlyobserved around many craters. The elevated rockabundance of this area indicates these deposits arerelatively young as rocks are broken down on relatively rapid time scales [3]. No obvious adjacentsource crater can be identified and two distinct azimuth angles for the delivery of materials have beenidentified in the Diviner rock abundance [1].The proximity of the region to the antipode ofthe crater Tycho, has led to the suggestion that thedeposits result from the focusing of material ejectedduring the Tycho impact event. Tychos antipode ison the eastern edge of the region with the centerof the deposits offset to the west. Modeling of ballistic trajectories of debris launched by Tycho, accounting for rotation of the Moon during the timeof flight, predicts a consistent location for antipodaldeposition offset to the west of the true antipode [4].Jo¨gi and Paige [4] also found that frictional heatingof the accumulating antipodal material would impart enough energy to melt accumulating deposits.If these deposits are the result of an antipodalaccumulation of material from the Tycho impactevent, then other similar deposits should exist atthe antipodes of other large, young craters. Sucha candidate deposit has been identified near the antipode of Copernicus with an offset to the west, consistent with the modeling of Jo¨gi and Paige [4].Copernicus antipode: Impact ponds and flowsnear Keeler crater were initially identified inMiniRF by Carter et al. [2]. This region does notshow a distinctly elevated rock abundance, however ponded material similar to the Tycho antipodalregion is evident in LROC images (Fig 1) and superposed impacts excavate blocky material beneathan apparent thin accumulation of regolith indicating the deposits are comprised of competent rockat shallow depths (Fig 2).Figure 1: Flat floored deposit near Copernicus antipode.Figure 2: Blocks of material excavated by impactnear Copernicus antipode.Crater counts: We have conducted crater countson the melt deposits on the ejecta blankets of Tychoand Copernicus craters and several of the antipodal flat-floored deposits (Fig 3 and 4). Both Tychoand Copernicus have substantial impact melt deposits near their rims. Using the Lunar cratering2738.pdf

[5], we obtain craterretention ages of 34.3 ± 11 Ma and 192 ± 39 Ma forTycho and Copernicus respectively, similar to agesderived by crater counts conducted by Heisenger etal. [6]. These ages are younger than the ages derived from crater counts conducted on the clasticejecta of the craters or the cosmic-ray exposure agesderived from Apollo samples of 109± 4 Ma for Tycho and 800 ± 15 Ma for Copernicus [7]. This discrepancy may reflect differences in target materialproperties with the impact melt presenting a morecompetent target with higher yield strength resulting in smaller crater diameters for a given impactenergy [8].Crater counts on the antipodal deposits yieldsimilar ages to the counts conducted on the meltdeposits near the rims of Tycho and Copernicuscraters with ages 31.2 ± 5.1 Ma and 35.4 ± 5.3 Maobtained for two of the melt ponds at the Tycho antipode and 253±140 Ma and 269±61 Ma for countson two melt ponds at the Copernicus antipode.Discussion: With the recognition that both Tycho and Copernicus possess possible antipodal impact melt deposits at locations predicted by ballisticmodeling [4], and that crater counts indicate similarformation ages to impact melt deposits proximal tothe craters, an antipodal origin for these depositsFigure 4: Crater counts and absolute model ages [5]for a melt deposit near the rim of Copernicus andtwo melt ponds near the Copernicus antipode.becomes appealing and would imply that materialejected by large impact events may preferentiallyaccumulate near their antipodes.References[1] J.
