PHLEGRA MONTES, MARS: CHRONOLOGY AND DENUDATION RATESS. van Gasselt1, A.-P. Rossi2, C. Orgel1,3, J. Schulz1. 1Freie Universität Berlin, Department of Earth Sciences,D–12249 Berlin, Germany (Stephan.vanGasselt@fu-berlin.de); 2Jacobs University Bremen, Earth and Space Sciences,D–28759 Bremen, Germany; 3Eötvös Loránd University, Department of Geology, Budapest, 1053 Hungary.Background: The Phlegra Montes are located north–east of the Elysium rise (165◦E, 29.5–51.0◦N) and forma 1,250 km long topographically well-pronounced arcuate ridge composed of Hesperian to Noachian–agedremnant massifs [1] with associated debris aprons andlineated valley fill features (fig. 1). Considered to be ofendogenic tectonic origin in earlier work [2], the PhlegraMontes have recently been interpreted as unit composedof degraded Hesperian–aged (3.650.040.06 Gyr (eHt) and3.710.060.10 Gyr (lHt)), and Noachian- to Hesperian–aged(3.770.050.07–3.910.080.18 Gyr HNt) material of potentially volcanic origin pre–dating the Hesperian plains–forminglowland material [1]. Younger mass–wasting materialcovering these remnants is considered to be of Hesperianage[1].The Phlegra Montes cover more than twenty degreesin latitude and form a complex system of isolated hills,ridges and small basins that provide insight into largeclimate-controlled geomorphologic settings and processes on Mars. The Phlegra Montes form a longitudinally confined traverse through climatic zones that areknown to host features indicative of ground ice and/oreven glacial ice [3, 4]. Despite such value, the region hasreceived little attention and has been revisited only relatively recently when radar–data interpretations providednew arguments in favour of extensive glaciation [5, 6, 7],and local geomorphologic studies provided reasons tobelieve that the region was once covered by extensiveice sheets [8, 9] several hundred Myr ago. Our study isconcentrated on a systematic survey covering detailedage distributions of surface units as function of latitude in order (a) to obtain statistically representative andlatitudinally dependent age estimates—in particular asthere are discrepancies with respect to the youthfulnessof local surface–ages [9, 1]. Furthermore, the surveyis carried out (b) to derive upper denudation–rate estimates for mass–wasting units under the assumptionof hyper–arid climate conditions favouring periglacialdenudation. We expect that latitudinal trends will potentially be observable within the limits of accuracy ofmorphometric measurements and age determinations ifyoung–Amazonian climate variations control formationof icy aprons on Mars.Approach and Analysis: Data analysis is based onhigh–resolution image data obtained by the MRO Context Imager (CTX) [10] and MGS Mars Observer Camera (MOC) [11] instruments and is complemented bymed- to high–resolution context images from the MExHigh Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) [12, 13] and theMO THEMIS (VIS/IR) instruments [14]. Topography isderived using (a) gridded MGS Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) data [15, 16], (b) photogrammetrically–derived stereo information from HRSC [17, 18] (absolute and regional scales) and (c) photoclinometricallyderived information using observation– and illumination–geometries (relative and local scales).Our primary aim is the systematic assessment of representative surface ages using impact–crater size–frequencystatistics with recent chronology models and definition ofthe Martian impact-crater production function describedin [19]. Crater–based age determinations are based onareas that we considered as geologically distinct and homogeneous, and that were formed by a distinct process.Diameter–sizes are determined using the ArcGIS CraterTools extension by [20]. Analysis of impact–crater size–frequency statistics and derivation of model ages werecarried out using Craterstats II [21] using recently summarised, updated and refined methodological approachesdescribed by [22, 19, 23]. Data on systematic age determinations are supplemented by selected morphometricFigure 1: Hillshade topography (MOLA) and geologicunits as published by[1].

measurements in order to estimate denudation ages andrates, according to the methodological framework described in [24], allowing comparison with rover–basedestimates [25, 26]. However, rates are difficult to assessowing to considerable uncertainties regarding the formation age of remnant massifs and limited knowledge anddata on extents of aprons.Results: Ages have been measured for 36 areas overthe study region (fig. 2). Ages of volcanic units in thesouth are comparable to recent published measurementsand are in the range of 3.430.120.57 Gyr to 3.540.070.19 Gyr afterresurfacing correction. A younger signal might refer toFigure 2: Main geomorphic and geologic units superimposed by remnant distribution (white boxes + densityplot in red and 1–σ distribution (hachured)). Two selected areas with associated age measurements are markedin bright red.new resurfacing events, e.g. new volcanic emplacementsas subdued impact crater suggest. It remains noteworthythat resurfacing has been a continuing process indicatedby flattened crater–size frequency distributions. Significant resurfacing events took place around 2.090.190.19 for thesouthern basin unit and at 1.060.170.17 Gyr for intra-ridgeunits. Lineated valley fill areas in the central study region(fig. 2) show several age signals, as old as 3.5 Gyr for theunderlying terrain and as young as 71 Myr for youngestsurface (comparable to previously published ages).Measurements of denudation rates of aprons across theoverall study area indicate values of 0.01–0.02 mm ±10−3 mm a−1 since the Hesperian–Noachian transitionwhich is – partially due to relief – at least one order ofmagnitude higher than conventional estimates for areason Mars, e.g., [26]. It is conceivable that high rates indicate an interplay of (a) atmospheric deposition of ice andflow (glacial context), and (b) denudation of hillslopesand gravitational creep of ice and debris (periglacial context).Acknowledgement: This work is partially supported by theNational Space Administration with means of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (grant 50QM1301).References: [1] K.
