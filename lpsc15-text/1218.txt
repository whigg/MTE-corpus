Introduction: The Argyre basin and associated rim materials were formed by the impact of a large body ~3.9 Gya, with subsequent landscape modifications by fluvial [2-4], aeolian [5], glacial [6-9] and periglacialprocesses [10-11] through to the present day. Here, we present three new findings consistent with periglacialism in Argyre Planitia (AP) (Fig. 1):    Fig. 1: Adapted from [10], a regional geological-unit map of the Argyre impact-basin and associated structures; map units based on [1]. "Sorted-polygon" sites "   "are located in H1 (Highlands member 1, EN-MA) and Hb (Highlands basins material LN-MA).  (1) small-sized (~15-25m in diam.) and sortedpolygons (Fig. 2). The morphology of these polygons is consistent with the work of clastic sorting, cryoturbation and mobile liquid-water that has undergone freezethaw cycling. Heretofore, there have been no reports of sorted polygons in the southern hemisphere. (2) the collateral presence of gelifluction-like lobes,    Fig. 2: Sorted (partially-enclosed) polygons on inter-crater terrain (HiRISE PSP_005597_1250; 54.7970S, 291.4890E; res. 25cm/pixel, site 1 in Fig. 1).  gullies putatively incised by the flow of water, and small-sized non-sorted polygons (perhaps formed by thermal-contraction cracking) in the general area where the sorted polygons are located. (3) stratigraphy showing that the sorted polygons have been exhumed from a light-toned and possibly ice-rich mantle that, in turn, is incised by non-sorted polygons. This underlines the possibility of pre- and post-mantle periglaciation. Sorted & non-sorted polygons: The sorted poly- gons are observed at several locations in eastern Aonia Terra (AT), immediately to the southwest of the Argyre impact-basin (Fig. 2). They comprise relatively-dark metre to multi-metre boulders that encircle, often incompletely, zones that are lighter of tone and without resolvable clasts (Fig. 1). Polygon margins or walls, composed of similarly-sized boulders, vary in their lateral thickness. A few polygons show margins comprised of individual boulders; most margins, regardless of their radial symmetry or completeness, display multiple boulders. Some boulder margins are imbricated. The distribution of the sorted polygons is irregular. Sometimes, the polygons appear in the midst of denseboulder-fields and are contiguous; elsewhere, the polygons are relatively isolated and in the midst of sparse boulders. Typically, the density of polygon distribution decreases proportionately as the boulder coverage of the terrain lessens and the surface coverage of the lighttoned mantle increases (Fig. 1).   Fig. 3: Non-sorted polygons on inter-crater terrain (HiRISE PSP_005597_1250; site 1 in Fig. 1).  Distinctly, clusters of small-sized (~5-10m in diam.) and non-sorted polygons (Fig. 3) are ubiquitous in the light-toned terrain where the sorted polygons are not observed and in transitional terrain where the distribution of sorted polygons is increasingly sparse. Polygon margins measure ~25-50cm in diameter and polygon centres are slightly elevated (relative to their margins. Nearby crater-wall lobes & gullies: (a) Immediately to the east of the sorted-polygons sites, lobe-like features are observed on the north (equator)-facing inner-wall of an impact crater (Fig. 4). From a plan view, the lobes display long and short axes parallel and normal to the slope wall, respectively, with downslope segments being wider than the upslope ones. This gives them a tadpole-like morphology. The lobes also display lateral coalescence, forming crenulate terrace-fronts. The apexes of these assemblages are synonymous with their long-axes and the side by side distribution of the two lobe assemblages gives them a saw-tooth appearance. Lobe run-out or reach dissipates as the acuity of the crater-wall slope decreases. The slope-side lobes and lobe assemblages also drape non-sorted polygons,of the type described above.  Aonia Terra ~50m N ~50m N   Fig. 4: Possible gelifluction lobes. (HiRise ESP_028857_1255, 295.2170E, 54.2450S; res. 50cm/pixel, site 6 in Fig. 1).  (b) There are locations in our study region where gullies are observed within impact craters; typically, they are ~4km in length and originate from rocky outcrops ~50m below the crater rim. They occur on north/northeast-facing slopes and incise a polygonallypatterned mantle that covers the rest of the crater wall. The alcoves are up to 1km wide, narrowing downslope, and are bounded laterally by steep incisions. The channel portion of these gullies often is braided and/or leveed. The depositional fans show multiple superpositions and often are incised by channels or channel segments. The light-toned mantle: The lighter-toned material encircled by the sorted polygons also forms a wideranging, relatively uniform and ~metre-thick mantle that blankets the terrain wherever the sorted polygons and associated boulder-fields are not observed (Fig. 2). When mantle patches and the sorted polygons are contiguous, the former show a slightly higher-elevation than the latter. Freeze-thaw cycling & a "wet" periglacial environment: Absent of boots on the ground and the ability to dig a soil pit or trench, validating a periglacial hypothesis that assumes the vertical and highly localized displacement of clasts to metres of depth must be indirect. Towards this end, we have identified a threefeature landform assemblage in AT that is spatially collateral with the sorted polygons. Collectively, the assemblage points to periglacialism, freeze-thaw cycling and the availability of mobile liquid water. (1) The key morphological characteristics of the crater-wall lobes are consistent with slope-side gelifluction on Earth (Fig. 5). Gelifluction is a type of mass-wasting induced by three key variables: (a) the availability of liquid water at or near the surface; (b) the presence of a near-surface permafrost-table that prevents the downward movement of moisture and promotes soil saturation; (c) soil composed of finegrained and silty material that can remain wet longer than coarse-grained material and facilitate the downhill  creep of slope masses [12]. (2) A number of key traits point to the possibility of the gullies in our study region having been formed by "water-rich" debris flows, e.g. levees, discontinuous channel segments and cutoffs, channel sinuousity, steep incisions and multiple small fan-shaped deposits. More  Fig. 5: Solifluction lobes near Chicken Creek, Alaska (http://perma frosttunnel.crrel.usace.army.mil/permafrost/patterned_ground.html).  over, the equatorial orientation of the observed gullies and crater-wall lobes could be a marker of insolationdriven mobilisation of near-surface water-ice in AT.. (3) The light tone of the mantle in AT, the uniformity of its distribution and its mid-latitudinal location, are characteristics shared with the widely reported and possibly "ice-rich" latitude-dependent mantle; the latter is thought to have formed by means of atmospheric precipitation and surface accumulation in response to a period of high obliquity in the very recent past [e.g. 1314]. Thermal-contraction polygons do not require an ice-rich medium to form. However, mantle incision by these non-sorted polygons does point to the possibility of cryotic processes having been at work in their formation subsequent to the emplacement of the mantle. The slightly higher elevation of the mantle than the sorted polygons, along with the similarity of tone between the mantled terrain and the polygon centres (possible mantle-remnant material), suggests that clastic polygon-formation could have predated that of the mantle. Conclusion: We have identified a multi-featurelandscape assemblage that possibly benchmarks the relatively-recent presence of mobile liquid-water (gelifluction lobes and gullies) and of ice-rich terrain (mantle and thermal-contraction polygons). Against this backdrop we infer that the sorted polygons in AT are the work of periglacialism. We also report that the newly identified sorted and non-sorted polygons are separated, stratigraphically and geochronologically, by the mantle. This suggests, contrary to the dominant paradigm  in the discipline, that Late Amazonian periglaciation on Mars is not synonymous with the accumulation or susbsequent ablation of mantle material.
