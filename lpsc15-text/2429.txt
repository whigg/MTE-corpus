To understand the implications for the small-scale structure and evolution of Europa, we mosaicked these frames (observations 12ESMOTTLE01 and 02, incidence ≈18°, emission ≈77°) into their regional context (part of observation 11ESREGMAP01, 220 m/pixel, incidence ≈74°, emission ≈23°), despite their very different viewing and lighting conditions (Fig. 1). In order to gain a better understanding of Europa's resurfacing processes, we created both a geological map and a structural map of the region.  Geological Map:  We created a map of geological units based on morphology, structure, and albedo. The units and nomenclature are generally based on regional geological mapping performed previously [1] but our units differ in detail considering our focus on the highresolution image mosaic. Our geological map of the high-resolution mosaic contains a variety of units based on their morphology, texture and albedo (Fig. 2). The highly diverse units range from: high albedo subparallel ridge and grooved terrain; to variegated-albedo hummocky terrain; to low albedo and relatively smooth terrain. We have classified and analyzed the diverse units solely based on the high-resolution image mosaic, prior to comparison to the contextual image, to emphasize an in-depth look at possible surface evolution and underlying formational processes at the smallest available scale (Fig. 3).  We infer that some of these identified units represent different stages and forms of resurfacing, including cryovolcanic and tectonic resurfacing. However, significant morphological variation among units in the region suggests that there are different degrees of resurfacing at work. We have created candidate morphological sequences that provide insight into the conversion of ridged plains to chaotic terrain—generally, a process of subduing formerly sharp features through tectonic modification and/or cryovolcanism.  Structure Map:  In order to further understand Europa's small-scale resurfacing processes, we are creating a structural map of the same high-resolution region. Some structural mapping of this region has been performed previously [2], but these results have yet to be expanded upon. We started with a region identified in our geological map as transitional from ridged plains material to chaos material which occurs near the middle of the high-resolution mosaic (images 2411r, 2414r, and 2418r). We analyzed this region first because it displays a large variety of geological units and structures that could help further define a sequence of events which led to its current appearence (Fig. 4). This region contains a large variety of structures, from an apparent normal fault and associated scarps to low albedo lineations in its hanging wall to apparent tensile cracks. Based on crosscutting relationships identified from our structure map, we developed a candidate evolutionary sequence for this region. Generally, we propose that the region has undergone a few stages of formation: contraction (formation of folded low albedo lineations), extension (normal fault zone), and tensile stress (surficial cracks). Topography.  In addition to structural maps, we also used topographic data derived from image overlaps that provide stereo. Because of the high emission angle of the images and because they overlap only in small regions, we have topography for just ~10% of the high resolution mosaic. There is also regional resolution topography data derived from photoclinometry. The topographic data helps to verify crosscutting relationships. Implications:  By further refining the classification of Europa's structures at high-resolution we can continue to refine the inferred stages of surface evolution on the icy satellite. Resurfacing processes and the surface evolution in this region have possible implications for the different suggested models for chaos formation [e.g. 3,4 and 5] and thus implications for the intereaction of the surface and the ocean.
