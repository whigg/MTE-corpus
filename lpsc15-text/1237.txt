Introduction:  The formation of Valles Marineris(VM) is known to involve a process of collapse combined with slight amounts of extension [1], followed byerosion. Isolated ancestral basins [2] were later linkedby further extension [3]. Hebes Chasma (314 km long,126 km wide, and >8 km deep) is unique to VM in thatunlike  other  chasmata,  it  has  remained  isolated  andlacks  an  outwash channel.  Interior  Layered  Deposits(ILDs) are widespread within VM and several processes have been proposed for their deposition [refs in 4].Examination of layer  thickness and attitudes of ILDswithin Hebes Chasma help to define their history.  Thisstudy focuses on the contact between the central ILDmound and a separate ILD located in the eastern portion of the chasm, referred to as the Upper and LowerILD formations respectively.      Hebes Chasma ILD:  Hebes Chasma (Fig. 1A)contains an ILD mound that is 120 km long and 43 kmwide.  It ranges in elevation from -2,011 m to 3,822 mwhen measured from the northern floor.   A separateILD located east of the main mound ranges in elevationfrom -3,925 m to -1,302 m.  Its shape is less definedthan the mound and measures 40 km across.        Methodology:   A CTX mosaic registered to aHRSC  composite  DTM  (orbits  5142,  5160,  5178)formed the base data for the study. Multiple HiRISEand CTX DTMs were calculated with the NASA AmesStereo Pipeline [4, 5].  Layer attitudes and thicknesseswere measured using four HiRISE stereo pairs and seven  other  HiRISE  images  registered  to  a  CTX DTM(Fig. 1B).  Layer thicknesses were obtained measuringthe number of layers along transects and calculating themedian thickness for each transect.  CRISM data setswithin the Upper and Lower ILD formations were analyzed, adding mineralogical information.      Results: The horizontal contact between the Upperand Lower ILD is interpreted as an unconformity (Fig.1E). Layers within the Upper ILD dip outward aroundthe mound with dips < 10˚.  Layer attitudes measuredin the Lower  ILD display complicated  layer  orientations with multiple changes in dip direction throughoutthe formation.  The Lower ILD also displays deformation features including faults and open folds.      Layer  thickness  measurements  within  the  11HiRISE images cover a significant range of elevations(Fig.  1F).   HiRISE images H1-H7 of the Upper ILD(Fig. 1B) cover a nearly continuous range of elevationsfrom -1,140 m to 3,680 m.  HiRISE images H8-H11 ofthe  Lower  ILD  (Fig.  1B)  cover  elevations  from-1,552 m -3,302 m.      658 layer thicknesses were measured along 82 transects.  Elevations of measured layers within the centralmound overlap frequently (Fig. 1F).  Upper ILD layersrange in thicknesses from 0.13 m to 13.39 m with anaverage of 2.38 m.  Lower ILD layers range in thickness  from  100.12 m  to  0.76 m  with  an  average  of28.09 m.      Analysis of CRISM data shows differing mineralcompositions between the Upper and Lower ILD.  TheUpper  ILD  contains  large  amounts of  both  monohydrated and polyhydrated sulfates, partially covered bymafic minerals (Fig. 1E).  The composition of the Lower ILD is more complicated and additional signaturesof Fe:Mg-rich phyllosilicates and gypsum are also observed (Fig. 1E).      Discussion:  The layer thickness data covers approximately 8 km of stratigraphy.  Layer thickness between the Upper and Lower ILD varies significantly.       The layers measured in the Lower ILD are approximately 3 km lower in absolute elevation than the UpperILD  and  are  significantly thicker  than  layers  of  themain mound. Their attitudes do not follow the generalpattern of dipping in the direction of slope.  Instead theILD contains open folds, likely as a result of sedimentdraping upon pre-existing topographical  relief on thechasma floor region.  Some areas also display faulting.Layer attitudes taken above and below the contact differ.  Layers below the unconformity dip due east (Fig.1D).  Layers above the contact dip to the south (Fig.1C).      Differences in layer attitudes, layer thickness, andmineralogy above and below the unconformity are evidence of two separate and distinct deposition episodesof ILD within Hebes Chasma.
