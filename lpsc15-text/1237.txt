Introduction:  The formation of Valles Marineris (VM) is known to involve a process of collapse combined with slight amounts of extension [1], followed by erosion. Isolated ancestral basins [2] were later linked by further extension [3]. Hebes Chasma (314 km long, 126 km wide, and >8 km deep) is unique to VM in that unlike  other  chasmata,  it  has  remained  isolated  and lacks  an  outwash channel.  Interior  Layered  Deposits (ILDs) are widespread within VM and several processes have been proposed for their deposition [refs in 4]. Examination of layer  thickness and attitudes of ILDs within Hebes Chasma help to define their history.  This study focuses on the contact between the central ILD mound and a separate ILD located in the eastern portion of the chasm, referred to as the Upper and Lower ILD formations respectively.      Hebes Chasma ILD:  Hebes Chasma (Fig. 1A) contains an ILD mound that is 120 km long and 43 km wide.  It ranges in elevation from -2,011 m to 3,822 m when measured from the northern floor.   A separate ILD located east of the main mound ranges in elevation from -3,925 m to -1,302 m.  Its shape is less defined than the mound and measures 40 km across.        Methodology:   A CTX mosaic registered to a HRSC  composite  DTM  (orbits  5142,  5160,  5178) formed the base data for the study. Multiple HiRISE and CTX DTMs were calculated with the NASA Ames Stereo Pipeline [4, 5].  Layer attitudes and thicknesses were measured using four HiRISE stereo pairs and seven  other  HiRISE  images  registered  to  a  CTX DTM (Fig. 1B).  Layer thicknesses were obtained measuring the number of layers along transects and calculating the median thickness for each transect.  CRISM data sets within the Upper and Lower ILD formations were analyzed, adding mineralogical information.      Results: The horizontal contact between the Upper and Lower ILD is interpreted as an unconformity (Fig. 1E). Layers within the Upper ILD dip outward around the mound with dips < 10Ëš.  Layer attitudes measured in the Lower  ILD display complicated  layer  orientations with multiple changes in dip direction throughout the formation.  The Lower ILD also displays deformation features including faults and open folds.      Layer  thickness  measurements  within  the  11 HiRISE images cover a significant range of elevations (Fig.  1F).   HiRISE images H1-H7 of the Upper ILD (Fig. 1B) cover a nearly continuous range of elevations from -1,140 m to 3,680 m.  HiRISE images H8-H11 of the  Lower  ILD  (Fig.  1B)  cover  elevations  from -1,552 m -3,302 m.      658 layer thicknesses were measured along 82 transects.  Elevations of measured layers within the central mound overlap frequently (Fig. 1F).  Upper ILD layers range in thicknesses from 0.13 m to 13.39 m with an average of 2.38 m.  Lower ILD layers range in thickness  from  100.12 m  to  0.76 m  with  an  average  of 28.09 m.      Analysis of CRISM data shows differing mineral compositions between the Upper and Lower ILD.  The Upper  ILD  contains  large  amounts of  both  monohydrated and polyhydrated sulfates, partially covered by mafic minerals (Fig. 1E).  The composition of the Lower ILD is more complicated and additional signatures of Fe:Mg-rich phyllosilicates and gypsum are also observed (Fig. 1E).      Discussion:  The layer thickness data covers approximately 8 km of stratigraphy.  Layer thickness between the Upper and Lower ILD varies significantly.       The layers measured in the Lower ILD are approximately 3 km lower in absolute elevation than the Upper ILD  and  are  significantly thicker  than  layers  of  the main mound. Their attitudes do not follow the general pattern of dipping in the direction of slope.  Instead the ILD contains open folds, likely as a result of sediment draping upon pre-existing topographical  relief on the chasma floor region.  Some areas also display faulting. Layer attitudes taken above and below the contact differ.  Layers below the unconformity dip due east (Fig. 1D).  Layers above the contact dip to the south (Fig.1 C).      Differences in layer attitudes, layer thickness, and mineralogy above and below the unconformity are evidence of two separate and distinct deposition episodes of ILD within Hebes Chasma.
