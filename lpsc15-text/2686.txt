Introduction:  The Chelyabinsk meteorite fall on February 15, 2013 attracted much more attention worldwide than do most falls [1-3].  A consortium led by JSC received 3 masses of Chelyabinsk (Chel-101, -102, -103) that were collected shortly after the fall and handled with care to minimize contamination.  Initial studies were reported in 2013 [4]; we have studied these samples with a wide range of analytical techniques to better understand the mineralogy, petrology, chronology and exposure history of the Chelyabinsk parent body.   Oxidation and weathering: The samples exhibit little to no oxidation: Mössbauer and Raman spectrometry indicate their fresh character.  Mass spectrometry reveals a low but clearly detectable level of terrestrial organics indicating that despite the rapid collection and care of handling some terrestrial contamination is present.   Mineralogy and petrology: Mineralogy, petrology, bulk chemistry and magnetic susceptibility measurements all indicate these masses are LL chondrite material  [4].  However, detailed studies show that the masses contain three distinct lithologies (Figure 1).  A light colored lithology is LL5 material that has experienced shock at levels near S4, based on mineralogy and textures.  A second lithology consisted of shock darkened LL5 material in which the darkening is caused by melt veins, and metal-troilite veins distributed along grain boundaries.  A third lithology is an impact melt breccia that formed at high temperatures (~1600 ºC), and experienced rapid cooling and degassing of S2 gas.  Shock level S4 was experienced by the LL5 lithology (<20 to 30 GPa) but slightly higher pressures (up to 38 GPa) are suggested by high resolution imaging of textures in impact melt veins (Figure 2), as compared to results of shock experiments [20]. Chronology: Portions of light and dark lithologies from Chel-101, and the impact melt breccias (Chel-102 and Chel-103) were prepared and analyzed for Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, and Ar-Ar dating.  Results yielded ages that cluster at ~264-312 Ma, 716-1014 Ma, and 1112-1464 Ma thus indicating a complex history of impacts and heating events (Figure 3); these ages are consistent with other studies of Chelyabinsk [1, 5-10].  The wide range of ages indicates the Chelyabinsk parent body did not experience post-shock annealing that other ordinary and R chondrites have experienced [1114].  In addition, the specific ages do not include a 4.2-4.3 Ga impact event identified in other LL chondrites [15].   Exposure history: Finally, noble gases and Sm isotopic compositions were measured on these same aliquots to determine space exposure history.  Most LL chondrites have yielded CRE ages of 6 to 50 Ma [16], but Chelyabinsk yields 1 Ma (also [17-19]). This young age, together with the absence of measurable cosmogenic derived Cr, and a barely detectable neutron capture effect in Sm for Chel-101, indicate that Chelyabinsk may have been derived from a recent breakup event on an NEO of LL chondrite composition.

Figure 3: Impact age probability distribution for Chelyabinsk. Red curve represents the summation of the Gaussian distribution of each individual age analysis The age data of Pb-Pb, U-Pb, Ar-Ar (plateau and "integrated" ages), K-Ar, and U-He [1, 5-8, this study] are more precise and are shown by sharp peaks. The less precise Sm-Nd and Rb-Sr isochron [9,10, this study] are shown by broad humps. At least eight impact events (e.g. ~4.53 Ga, ~4.45 Ga, ~3.7 Ga, ~2.8 Ga, ~1.4 Ga, ~312 Ma, and ~27 Ma) are identified for Chelyabinsk. The Sm-Nd and Rb-Sr isotopic systems in Chelyabinsk are very complex and are highly disturbed which is consistent with its having experienced many events of thermal metamorphism and impact resetting after its accretion.
