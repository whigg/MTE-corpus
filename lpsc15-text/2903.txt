Introduction:  Orbital spectroscopic observations of the Martian surface show global detections of minerals associated with past aqueous alteration [1,2]. These detections of secondary minerals occur in a diverse set of environments and likely occur due to a variety of mechanisms. A significant fraction of detections show evidence of having originally formed in the subsurface as  part  of  hydrothermal  systems [3,4].  Alteration  in these hydrothermal settings may have been isochemical [5,6]. Thermodynamic models predict that isochemical alteration of basaltic crust in low-O2 conditions results in the formation of Fe2+ and Mg bearing trioctahedral smectites [7,8,9]. Recent  observations  of  smectite-bearing  units  at Endeavor Crater by MER Opportunity suggested trace element repartitioning in some units [10].  Terrestrial studies  of  aqueous alteration of   oceanic  crust  show substantial  mobilization  of  trace  metals  [11].  It  has been  shown that  the  ultimate  fate  of  mobilized  elements is strongly affected by formation of secondary minerals  such  as  phyllosilicates  [12].  Trace  element data  may thus  yield  information  on  the  degree  and character of rock alteration to phyllosilicates on Mars. As iron is highly redox active, its speciation in altered materials can provide further information on the nature of altering fluids on early Mars. Additionally, a general understanding of the process of elemental repartitioning may allow us to make predictions for areas where observational data is limited. Methods:  This study investigates the alteration of whole-rock assemblages under isochemical hydrothermal conditions. Two mafic USGS rock standards were selected for their chemical similarity to basalts studied at Gusev Crater [13] (BIR-1a, Icelandic basalt; DNC1a, North Carolina dolerite). In order to study iron and trace  metal  repartitioning  during  serpentinization,  a dunite (DTS-2b, Twin Sisters dunite) was also used. All rock powders were ground in a micronizing mill to a uniform 1-5 μm particle size prior  to alteration. All  preparation  occurred  in  an  oxygen free  environment. The samples were then sealed in PTFE-lined reaction vessels and heated at 200oC for 21 days in an oxygen-free nitrogen atmosphere. After reaction excess fluid was decanted and samples were dried for analysis. Unground replicates were prepared for imaging analysis to more clearly investigate the spatial relationship of primary and secondary phases. Major mineralogy was investigated by spot analysis with a JEOL JXA-8200 electron microprobe (EPMA) and powder  XRD on a  Bruker  D8 Advance  diffractometer.  Mineral  abundances  were  quantified  by Rietveld analysis using TOPAS. Trace metal and iron partitioning was studied by Xray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy. Fe, Mn, Ni, and Zn K-edge spectra were collected on Advanced Photon Source beamlines 5-BM, 12-BM, and 13-BM  for  both  unaltered  and  altered  samples.  Fe spectra were collected in transmission mode and trace metal  spectra  were  collected  in  fluorescence  mode. XAFS spectra provide information on oxidation state and local  coordination environment (within ~5 Å) of the target atom. For a spectral standard, ferrous trioctahedral  smectite doped with 1 mol% each of Mn, Zn, and Ni and matching the major element composition of an alteration rind measured by EPMA was synthesized [14]. Elemental  mapping was done on  epoxy mounted slides by both electron microprobe and X-ray microprobe (APS beamline 20-ID). Imaging was performed on a JEOL 7001LVF SEM. Results:  The unaltered basalt standards, BIR and DNC have similar chemical compositions but differ in their relative mineral abundances. They contain similar amounts of forsterite (12.7 wt% and 15.1 wt% respectively) but differ in amounts of plagioclase and pyroxene (plag: 47.6 wt% and 60.0 wt%; pyx: 36.9 wt% and 20.3 wt%). The BIR also has more opaques than the DNC though  these  are  minor  phases  in  both  rocks. DNC contains minor chlorite while secondary mineralization is not detectable in BIR by XRD. DTS is dominantly forsterite (91.3 wt%) with minor chlorite, diopside and lizardite (all 2-3.5 wt%). In all unaltered samples, XAFS spectroscopy shows that Fe is primarily located in olivine. This is especially pronounced in DTS where  the  Fe  spectrum is  nearly identical  to  that  of pure olivine. Altered  samples  all  contain neoformed phyllosilicates (Figure 1). BIR and DNC produced a trioctahedral  smectite  clay,  with  greater  alteration  seen  for DNC. In the DTS experiment, 22% of the forsterite reacted to roughly equal parts serpentine and brucite by weight. XAFS spectroscopy shows that Fe is liberated from olivine upon alteration and is taken up by secondary minerals. BIR and DNC have Fe XAFS spectra which resemble that of a synthetic trioctahedral Fe-Mg  smectite  and  have  15.2-15.8  Å  basal  reflections  in XRD [14]. (Figure 2) The XAFS spectra of DTS indicates that partial Fe oxidation occurs during alteration. Magnetite was not detectable  produced it is unclear what phase hosts the oxidized Fe. DTS has the lowest total amount of iron of any of the rock standards so it's possible that a small amount of magnetite produced could have a disproportionately large effect on the Fe XAFS while being difficult to distinguish from chromite in XRD. Mn appears to follow Fe during alteration in most samples. (Figure 3)  Before alteration, the Mn XAFS spectra  of  all  samples  are  nearly identical  to  that  of pure olivine.  Spectra of the altered samples are very similar to that of Mn in the doped trioctahedral smectite standard. The changes in the Mn XAFS spectra in the altered samples are proportional to the relative degree of alteration, with the spectrum of BIR changing the least and of DTS changing the most. Ni also appears  to  follow  Fe  during  alteration  but  the  XAFS spectra for BIR and DNC suffer from high noise levels, making quantitative comparison to the Mn data difficult.  In  DTS  Ni  is  originally  located  in  olivine  and upon alteration  is  repartitioned  into  a  new phase.  In contrast to Mn and Ni, Zn experiences no change in its XAFS spectra upon alteration. Zn is primarily housed in refractory oxide minerals and not mobilized during hydrothermal alteration. These results show that even small changes in mineralogy produce large differences in the character of alteration. Additionally comparing mobile and immobile trace  metals  shows  promise  for  being  an  additional marker for degree of alteration. These studies predict that  hydrothermally  altered  basalts  on  Mars  should show Mn and Ni repartitioning behavior distinct from that of Zn.
