PARTITIONING  OF  IRON  AND  TRACE  METALS  DURING  ISOCHEMICAL  HYDROTHERMALBASALT ALTERATION: IMPLICATIONS FOR INTERPRETING CLAY OCCURRENCE ON MARS.   R.D. Nickerson1, S. M. Chemtob1, and J. G. Catalano1,  1Washington University, Dept. of Earth and Planetary Sciences,St. Louis, MO 63130 (rnickerson@levee.wustl.edu).Introduction:  Orbital spectroscopic observationsof the Martian surface show global detections of minerals associated with past aqueous alteration [1,2]. Thesedetections of secondary minerals occur in a diverse setof environments and likely occur due to a variety ofmechanisms. A significant fraction of detections showevidence of having originally formed in the subsurfaceas  part  of  hydrothermal  systems [3,4].  Alteration  inthese hydrothermal settings may have been isochemical[5,6]. Thermodynamic models predict that isochemicalalteration of basaltic crust in low-O2 conditions resultsin the formation of Fe2+ and Mg bearing trioctahedralsmectites [7,8,9].Recent  observations  of  smectite-bearing  units  atEndeavor Crater by MER Opportunity suggested traceelement repartitioning in some units [10].  Terrestrialstudies  of  aqueous alteration of   oceanic  crust  showsubstantial  mobilization  of  trace  metals  [11].  It  hasbeen  shown that  the  ultimate  fate  of  mobilized  elements is strongly affected by formation of secondaryminerals  such  as  phyllosilicates  [12].  Trace  elementdata  may thus  yield  information  on  the  degree  andcharacter of rock alteration to phyllosilicates on Mars.As iron is highly redox active, its speciation in alteredmaterials can provide further information on the natureof altering fluids on early Mars. Additionally, a generalunderstanding of the process of elemental repartitioning may allow us to make predictions for areas whereobservational data is limited.Methods:  This study investigates the alteration ofwhole-rock assemblages under isochemical hydrothermal conditions. Two mafic USGS rock standards wereselected for their chemical similarity to basalts studiedat Gusev Crater [13] (BIR-1a, Icelandic basalt; DNC1a, North Carolina dolerite). In order to study iron andtrace  metal  repartitioning  during  serpentinization,  adunite (DTS-2b, Twin Sisters dunite) was also used.All rock powders were ground in a micronizing millto a uniform 1-5 μm particle size prior  to alteration.All  preparation  occurred  in  an  oxygen free  environment. The samples were then sealed in PTFE-lined reaction vessels and heated at 200oC for 21 days in anoxygen-free nitrogen atmosphere. After reaction excessfluid was decanted and samples were dried for analysis.Unground replicates were prepared for imaging analysis to more clearly investigate the spatial relationshipof primary and secondary phases.Major mineralogy was investigated by spot analysiswith a JEOL JXA-8200 electron microprobe (EPMA)and powder  XRD on a  Bruker  D8 Advance  diffractometer.  Mineral  abundances  were  quantified  by Rietveld analysis using TOPAS.Trace metal and iron partitioning was studied by Xray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy. Fe,Mn, Ni, and Zn K-edge spectra were collected on Advanced Photon Source beamlines 5-BM, 12-BM, and13-BM  for  both  unaltered  and  altered  samples.  Fespectra were collected in transmission mode and tracemetal  spectra  were  collected  in  fluorescence  mode.XAFS spectra provide information on oxidation stateand local  coordination environment (within ~5 Å) ofthe target atom. For a spectral standard, ferrous trioctahedral  smectite doped with 1 mol% each of Mn, Zn,and Ni and matching the major element composition ofan alteration rind measured by EPMA was synthesized[14].Elemental  mapping was done on  epoxy mountedslides by both electron microprobe and X-ray microprobe (APS beamline 20-ID). Imaging was performedon a JEOL 7001LVF SEM.Results:  The unaltered basalt standards, BIR andDNC have similar chemical compositions but differ intheir relative mineral abundances. They contain similaramounts of forsterite (12.7 wt% and 15.1 wt% respectively) but differ in amounts of plagioclase and pyroxene (plag: 47.6 wt% and 60.0 wt%; pyx: 36.9 wt% and20.3 wt%). The BIR also has more opaques than theDNC though  these  are  minor  phases  in  both  rocks.DNC contains minor chlorite while secondary mineralization is not detectable in BIR by XRD. DTS is dominantly forsterite (91.3 wt%) with minor chlorite, diopside and lizardite (all 2-3.5 wt%). In all unaltered samples, XAFS spectroscopy shows that Fe is primarily located in olivine. This is especially pronounced in DTSwhere  the  Fe  spectrum is  nearly identical  to  that  ofpure olivine.Altered  samples  all  contain neoformed phyllosilicates (Figure 1). BIR and DNC produced a trioctahedral  smectite  clay,  with  greater  alteration  seen  forDNC. In the DTS experiment, 22% of the forsterite reacted to roughly equal parts serpentine and brucite byweight. XAFS spectroscopy shows that Fe is liberatedfrom olivine upon alteration and is taken up by secondary minerals. BIR and DNC have Fe XAFS spectrawhich resemble that of a synthetic trioctahedral Fe-Mg2903.pdf

smectite  and  have  15.2-15.8  Å  basal  reflections  inXRD [14]. (Figure 2) The XAFS spectra of DTS indicates that partial Feoxidation occurs during alteration. Magnetite was notdetectable  produced it is unclear what phase hosts theoxidized Fe. DTS has the lowest total amount of ironof any of the rock standards so it's possible that a smallamount of magnetite produced could have a disproportionately large effect on the Fe XAFS while being difficult to distinguish from chromite in XRD.Mn appears to follow Fe during alteration in mostsamples. (Figure 3)  Before alteration, the Mn XAFSspectra  of  all  samples  are  nearly identical  to  that  ofpure olivine.  Spectra of the altered samples are verysimilar to that of Mn in the doped trioctahedral smectite standard. The changes in the Mn XAFS spectra inthe altered samples are proportional to the relative degree of alteration, with the spectrum of BIR changingthe least and of DTS changing the most. Ni also appears  to  follow  Fe  during  alteration  but  the  XAFSspectra for BIR and DNC suffer from high noise levels,making quantitative comparison to the Mn data difficult.  In  DTS  Ni  is  originally  located  in  olivine  andupon alteration  is  repartitioned  into  a  new phase.  Incontrast to Mn and Ni, Zn experiences no change in itsXAFS spectra upon alteration. Zn is primarily housedin refractory oxide minerals and not mobilized duringhydrothermal alteration.These results show that even small changes in mineralogy produce large differences in the character of alteration. Additionally comparing mobile and immobiletrace  metals  shows  promise  for  being  an  additionalmarker for degree of alteration. These studies predictthat  hydrothermally  altered  basalts  on  Mars  shouldshow Mn and Ni repartitioning behavior distinct fromthat of Zn.References: [1]  Murchie  et   al.,   (2009)   JGR,114, E00D06.
