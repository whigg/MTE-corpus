During last year’s LPSC we have already presented size-frequency distributions (SFDs) ofsub-kilometer impact craters measured on few fresh surface units on Vesta and compared them with the twocurrently published production functions (PFs) of [1]and [2]. Since results of the analyses of these few andoften very small surface units do not allow for a universally valid conclusion, we expanded our crater catalogue of investigated fresh <40 km primary craters respectively their ejecta blankets, which represent someof the youngest surface units on Vesta.Methodology: SFDs of small craters, under somecircumstances, can be very susceptible because smallcraters are the first ones to be affected by subsequentmodification ([3], [4] and [5]). This includes (amongother processes) an admixture of secondary craterswhich, due to the specific shape of the SFD of ejectedprojectiles and the inverse relation between the spallsize and ejection velocity ([6], [7] and [8]), can considerably increase the numbers of small craters. Onthe other hand, degradation processes on Vesta, primarily caused by impact-induced seismic shaking, whichdestabilizes slopes and triggers mass wastings, will reduce the numbers of small craters when compared tolarger ones. Since the influence of both processeslargely depends on the age (the older a surface, thehigher the probability that modification has occurred),we investigate especially young or fresh surface unitswhose superposed CSFDs should most likely reflect themass-velocity distribution of impacting meteorites.Till now, we have investigated CSFDs superposed onejecta blankets and sometimes also on the interior deposits of 42 fresh craters on Vesta. Primary craters havebeen classified as fresh provided that they exhibit twoof the following properties: (1) a distinct, sharp craterrim and/or fresh exposed crater walls with “spur-andgully” morphology, (2) a relatively low density of smallcraters superposed on the corresponding surface units(ejecta blankets) and (3) a conspicuous spectral signature in Framing Camera (FC) color ratio data.In order to measure CSFDs we performed cratercounts within ESRI’s ArcGIS by using the CraterTools[9] extension which allows comfortable and most accurate measuring of areas and impact crater diameters byautomatically solving the problem of map-projection related distortions. Additionally, its newer version [10]also allows for automated correction of topographyrelated crater and area distortions, which occur whenthe actual shape of the investigated body highly deviatesfrom the used reference ellipsoid used for the map projection. For the analyses of CSFDs and the derivationof absolute model formation ages, we used the softwareCraterstats by [11], [12]. Additionally, we have estimated the amount of mass ejected for certain crater sizeson Vesta in comparison to Mars and the Moon usingthe most recent version of the widely accepted crateringmodel of [13]. In this way, under consideration of spallation models of [6], [14], [8] and [15] and impactorcrater scaling laws by [16], [17], we are able to make atleast a rough estimate of the SFD of ejected fragmentsthat are capable of forming secondary craters.Results: As Fig 1 shows, the relation between theejected mass and the corresponding ejection velocity isquite different for an impact that produces a crater of thesame size on our three target bodies. The velocity vsec atFigure 1: Cumulative Mass Mv (%) ejected faster than vej plottedversus the ejection velocity vej (ms-1) for a Vibidia sized impact (rimdiameter Dr = 6.39 km) on various planetary bodies (Vesta, Mars andthe Moon). Note that different sized impactors are necessary to formcraters of the same size on our three bodies primarily due to differences in impactor velocity, target density and gravitational conditions.2814.pdf

which traditional secondary craters might form is limited by a minimum velocity vmin and the escape velocityvesc (vmin < vsec < vesc). Regardless of vmin (∼150 - 250ms-1 on Jupiter’s moon Europa [18]), vsec is way muchsmaller on Vesta than on Mars or the Moon as a consequence of low vesc values. According to our Vibidiaejecta modeling results, only a very small fraction (∼0.5%) of the mass is ejected at vsec provided that vmin = 150ms-1, while ∼0.1 % ecapes from Vesta. In summary, wewould expect fewer secondary craters on Vesta that potentially contaminate CSFD measurements when compared to larger bodies with higher gravitational acceleration and/or higher impact velocities.The smallest of the investigated primaries, anunnnamed 1.13 km crater at 26.16◦S/14.63◦E exhibitsan ejecta blanket, which is too small to obtain reliablestatistics. As a general rule, all investigated primaries.3 km in diameter have ejecta blankets with exeedinglylow numbers of superposed small craters due to smallareal extent and/or a very young formation age and thusdo not allow any reliable statement.CSFDs over a limited diameter range generally followa power-law of the form N∼Da with N as the numberof craters of diameter D and a as the power-law exponent. It appears from the various analyses, which weperformed that SFDs of craters between D(80 m, 1 km)Figure 2: CFSDs obtained on ejecta blankets of one of the youngest(Vibidia) and one of the oldest (Pinaria) investigated craters in differential presentation. The upper plot shows the results of two individual randomness analyses methods namely a standard deviationof adjacent area (SDAA) and a mean 2nd closest neighbor distance(M2CND) [11], [12] to gain an insight into the spatial distribution ofcraters within the measurement area.exhibit power-law exponents between -4.0 to -4.2 (differential), (see Fig 2) or -3.0 to -3.2 (cumulative), whichalmost exactly describes the course of the lunar-like PFof [2] within the same diameter range. The consequencethat arises from this is that all CSFDs investigated onrelatively fresh surface units run significantly steeperthan the asteroid-flux derived model PF (MPF) of [1],which has an average power-law exponent of approx.-3.54 (differential) between D(80 m, 1 km). SFDs ofcraters below 80 m measured on ejecta blankets oftenexhibit power-law exponents between -4.8 to -5.3 (differential) or -3.8 to -4.3 (cumulative), which indicate acertain amount of self-secondaries.Fig. 2 shows fits (dashed lines) of the lunar-like PF[2] to data bins and derived absolute model formationages of Vibidia and Pinaria crater and power-law functions modeled using least squares simple linear regression with coefficient of determination R2 values. Thederived power-law function for Vibidia data bins N(D)= 1.504x10-4D-4.043 between D(47.3, 118.8 m) exhibitsa lower R2 value due to data scattering as a consequenceof low statistics for craters with D&100 m when compared to those of Pinaria with N(D) = 8.754x10-3D-4.175and R2 = 0.991 between D(66.6, 749.9 m). For comparison, the differential form of the lunar-like PF [2] andthe asteroid-flux derived MPF [1] can be approximatedby N(D) = D-4.043 and N(D) = D-3.439 respectively forD(47.3, 118.8 m) and N(D) = D-4.209 and N(D) = D-3.542respectively for D(66.8, 749.9 m). If our assumptionsabout the pristine and undisturbed condition of CSFDsmeasured on the investigated young surface units arecorrect, the lunar-like PF [2], which best approximatesthe data should be a good reflection of the impactor population from a few to several hundred meters in size.References: [1] Marchi et al.
