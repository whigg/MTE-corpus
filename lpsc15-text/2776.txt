Introduction:  A soil pit from the Prospect Mesa Formation (PMF) near Wright Valley, Antarctica, was investigated using sequential sulfur extraction, stable isotope analysis, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The Antarctic Dry Valleys (ADV) have previously been used as a potential Mars analog due to their cold and dry environment. The PMF exhibits a varied stratigraphy with layers ranging from morainal gravel deposits, lodgement till, and fossil-rich marine sediments [1]. Seven samples, from the Pit #1, Core 72 Site in the PMF and collected during a 1979/1980 Antarctic campaign [2], were analyzed. Samples were taken at 2-4 cm intervals from the surface sediment layer down to 12-16 cm in depth (Table 1). These samples have high sulfate and evaporite mineral abundances, and their sulfur isotopic compositions were analyzed to assess the origin of the sulfate and potential sources of depletion of δ34S. We present a potential depletion process that supports the hypothesis that the sulfate was deposited from atmospheric sources that have experienced microbial interactions.  Table 1.

No other preparation procedures were performed.  X-ray diffraction.  Prior to sequential sulfur extraction, samples were analyzed using a Bruker AXS D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation) to determine mineralogy. XRD was also used to analyze the samples after each sulfur extraction step. Each sample was measured from 2° to 70° 2θ, counting for 2 s. each 0.02°. XRD patterns were evaluated using Bruker's EVA® software, and quantitative phase abundances were obtained via Rietveld refinement with the Bruker TOPAS® software. Sequential sulfur extraction.  Sequential sulfur extraction was performed on the samples based on previous laboratory methods [3-4] in the following five steps:  1. Elemental and organic sulfur extraction 2. Water-soluble sulfate (WSS) 3. Acid-volatile sulfide (AVS) 4. Acid-soluble sulfate (ASSO4) 5. Chromium-reduced sulfide (CRS)  Elemental sulfur extraction.  Samples were measured and transferred onto Whatman® GF/C filter paper inside a glass thimble. The thimble was then fitted at the bottom with a glass flask filled with granular Cu and ~60-70 mL of dichloromethane (DCM). The round-bottom collection flasks were positioned on top of heating mantles and the DCM solvent was then circulated through the system via a condensing tube and dripped onto the sample. The system ran for 24 hours. Water-soluble sulfate.  The extraction of watersoluble sulfate (WSS) was completed by placing ~10 g of sample into individual centrifuge tubes. Approximately 45 mL of milli-Q water was added to each vial and the vials were placed in an orbital shaker for multiple days. These vials were then centrifuged at 5000 RPM for 15 min. The separated liquid was then poured off and filtered with a 0.2 µm filter. The filtered solution was then mixed with 2 M HCl and BaCl2 to precipitate BaSO4. The process was repeated until BaSO4 no longer precipitated, typically for 24 hours. The excess water was suctioned out of the beakers and transferred to new centrifuge vials. BaSO4 was then repeatedly rinsed (3X), centrifuged, and suctioned, and the precipitates were then placed in an oven at 60° C overnight. Acid-volatile sulfur.  Acid-volatile sulfur (AVS) was extracted following the procedure described by [3]. No detectible AVS (in the form of Ag2S) was retrieved from the extractions. Chromium-reduced sulfide.  The CRS extraction was modeled after the method presented in [4]. The method is particularly useful in extracting reduced mono-sulfide phases, while leaving other sulfur species  unaltered. Only a trace amount of Ag2S precipitated from all samples, and quantitative and isotopic measurements could therefore not be completed. S isotope analysis (δ34S).  The water-soluble sulfate in the precipitated BaSO4 was the only sulfur yield that could be recovered and analyzed for sulfur isotopic composition. Between 0.36 and 0.44 mg of BaSO4 was mixed with 1 to 2 mg of V2O5 in a tin capsule. Sulfur isotope ratios in the BaSO4 were measured using a Costech ECS4010 elemental analyzer coupled to a Delta V Advantage isotope ratio mass spectrometer. The isotope data are presented with respect to the VCDT (Vienna Cañon Diablo Troilite) reference scale. Analytical reproducibility was better than ±0.3‰ for standards and duplicate samples. Results:  All samples contained a significant amount of water-soluble sulfate, with some samples requiring six leaches to fully dissolve all of the sulfate. The sequential sulfur extraction yielded mostly watersoluble sulfate through the leaching process. Yields were detected, but not quantitatively recoverable for chromium-reduced sulfide extraction steps. Yields were not detected for the acid-soluble sulfate or acidvolatile sulfide steps.  Table 2.

XRD analysis showed that the samples consist of major pyroxenes, feldspars, and quartz as in previous studies [e.g. 7,8]. Minor phases include sulfates, clays, and zeolites. Halite represents a large proportion of some of the samples (as much as 26%). Water-soluble sulfate minerals gypsum and glauberite ( Na2Ca(SO4)2 ) were detected (~2-3 wt%). Subsequent XRD analysis after the initial WSS leaching demonstrated that the sulfates were removed; the peaks for gypsum and glauberite vanished. Rietveld analysis was performed to obtain more detailed mineralogical information for two samples (Table 2).  Sulfur isotopes.  Isotopic analysis of each of the leachates revealed a depletion from ~21‰ (value for ocean sulfate) to ~17‰ in the top layers (JB1087 / JB1088). Lower depth samples were consistently ~15-16‰. Discussion:  The depletion in 34S rules out purely oceanic to atmospheric transfer mechanisms. An intermediary mechanism must be contributing to the depletion in 34S. We  propose that the DMSP/DMS            Figure 1. Sulfur isotope  pathway (Fig. 2) is partially         δ34S (SO42-) depth profile. responsible for the depletion in 34S compared with that of ocean sulfate. In this scenario, seawater sulfate is initially taken up by macroalgae, reduced, and used to synthesize dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP).   Figure 2. DMSP/DMS formation of non-seawater sulfate [5].  This pathway ultimately synthesizes dimethylsulfide (DMS), which is released into the atmosphere and oxidized into non-seawater sulfate [5]. The DMSP/DMS process has been shown to account for a depletion from ~21‰ to ~17-19‰ in DMSP and in subsequent degradation products DMS and NSS-SO42- [5]. High concentrations of DMSP and DMS have been documented in the Antarctic and can be correlated to algal blooms [6]. The DMSP/DMS process does not fully account for an additional depletion in 34S shown at lower depths. Conclusions:  Preliminary analysis of the PMF sediments is consistent with previously observed depletion of 34S in sediment from the Antarctic Dry Valleys compared to marine sulfate in the Antarctic Ocean. Our data are consistent with a microbial process in which volatile  products from marine algae, such as DMSP and DMS, may be responsible for the observed depletion in 34S with sulfur oxidized and transferred via atmospheric processes.
