DIRECTED CRATERING EJECTA BALLISTIC MODEL FOR ANTIPODAL IMPACT, FRICTIONALLY HEATED, MELT DEPOSITS ON THE MOON.  P. M. Jögi and D. A. Paige1, 1Department of Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences, University of California at Los Angeles, CA 90095, jogi@physics.ucla.edu    Introduction:  Potential antipodal ejecta deposits have been identified on the moon associated with Tycho Crater [1-2] and Copernicus Crater [3]. LRO Diviner data also reveal the presence of rocky strewn fields at the Tycho antipode, and in the nearside highlands [4]. We have developed a ballistic model for the emplacement and melting of gravitationally focused antipodal ejecta [5] that can quantitatively explain many of the observed properties of lunar antipodal deposits. Here, we examine the predictions of the model in light of recently reported LRO observations. Model Description:  Ejecta debris flight path from the primary crater is assumed to be equal to the trajectory of the secondary particle executing a simple 2body dynamics. This results in a natural focusing of impact ejecta at the antipode, but offset to the west due to the rotation of the moon during the ~1 hour duration of the ejecta flight (See Figs. 1-2). Ejecta with a range of initial flight path angles and velocities rain down on the antipode for a period of ~1 hour, which results in substantial frictional heating, which we calculate is sufficient to cause remelting and flow of the deposited ejecta. Our model successfully explains the concentration of ejecta near the antipode of the original crater, as well as the presence of a thin veneer of lowviscosity melt [5]. Directionality of Ejecta Deposits: Diviner rock abundance maps show that antipodal deposits appear to have preferential slope orientations and are distributed in a manner consistent with topographic shadowing [4]. The Tycho antipodal deposits appear to have been emplaced at angles of less than 20 degrees from horizontal, and from two primary azimuthal directions [2,4]. Implications for the Ballistic Ejecta Model:  We believe that the apparent directionality of the antipodal deposits from Tycho can be traced to the directionaly of the original Tycho impactor. Studes of azimuthal asymmetries in the topography, composition, and secondary impact crater densities all indicate that the Tycho impactor hit the moon obliquely from a generally westerly direction [6-8]. Our dynamical calculations require that all ejectra trajectories with flight path angles of greater than 45 degrees relative to horizontal cannot impact the antipode.  Therefore, the antipodal deposits would be predicted to be formed by low-angle ejecta. Because of the symmetry of the two-body problem, the initial and final flight path angles of antipodal ejecta are equal. Impact dynamical models show that low angle ejecta is produced preferentially in the forward direction, i.e. towards  the flight direction of the original impactor [9].    Fig. 1.

We have traced the flight path angles of the Tycho antipodal deposits back to their source(s), and find that they are consistent with expectations for low-angle Tycho ejecta. The gravitational focusing mechanism does not require that ejecta reach the antipode necessarily from all azimuths, so the absence of antipodal ejecta at certain azimuths is not inconsistent with gravitational focusing. We have also examined the range of flight times implied by the ejecta emplacement angles observed at Tycho and estimate that the antipodal ejecta would have rained down for a period of ~30 minutes. We calculate that this prolonged bombardment should be sufficient to result in substantial frictional heating and melting of the emplaced deposits, which is bourne out by observations [1].
