Introduction: There was a time when evidence for short-lived chronometers in the early solar system was limited to 129 I and 244 Pu. We developed an additional relative chronology based on the evolution of initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr in achondrites and chondrites. For chondrites we used meteorites with phosphates, which would exhibit low Rb/Sr (e. g., Guareña [1], Peace River [2], and a silicate inclusion from the iron meteorite Colomera [3]). Relative time intervals were identified effectively as model ages, depending on the reservoirs where the initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr may have evolved, e. g., solar Rb/Sr or chondritic Rb/Sr reservoirs (cf Fig. 1, obtained from [2]). The high precision determinations of 87 Sr/ 86 Sr were enabled by a then revolutionary increase in precision through a digitally controlled mass spectrometer, the Lunatic I, with digitized magnet control and data collection, on line to a central computer [4, 5] and a fast electrometer (Cary 36). It is also important to recognize that the studies on achondrites and chondrites were a prelude to high precision Rb-Sr dating of Apollo samples, which were extremely depleted in volatile elements and specifically highly depleted in K and Rb. The design of the Lunatic I has been effectively adopted by commercial mass spectrometer builders, starting in the late 1970s. Based on the overriding importance of Apollo sample dating, the Lunatic I mass spectrometer was calibrated by the frequent measurements of what where chosen as standards, namely Sr separated from seawater and from Moore County plagioclase. While working extensively on Apollo samples, as each mission returned samples to Earth, we started a detailed Rb-Sr investigation of Allende (1969 fall) CaAl-rich, refractory inclusions, with Prof. Chris Gray, then a post-doc at Caltech, as the driver. The seminal Rb-Sr study of CAIs [2] established that the Rb-Sr systems in these inclusions were disturbed. But the major conclusions were: (a) the higher Rb/Sr, fine grained, refractory aggregates yielded a variety of model ages with an upper age for the Rb-Sr disturbances of 3.6 Ga (the youngest model age); (b) some low Rb/Sr, coarse grained inclusions provided a range of initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, well below the BABI (Basaltic Achondrite Best Initial) ratio [5], if calculated assuming undisturbed systems for 4.5 Ga.  From these disturbed Rb-Sr systematics, it became very clear, that the determination of primitive 87 Sr/ 86 Sr for Allende CAIs needed to be based on measured values of 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and not on extrapolated, initial values. This conclusion guided our extensive search for CAIs with very low, primitive, measured 87 Sr/ 86 Sr. This very important consideration has apparently not been appreciated or adopted by more recent and by very recent work. For the work on CAIs we found only one CAI with measured 87 Sr/ 86 Sr well below BABI, by 3 εu (parts in 10 4) (Fig. 1), the ALL value [2]. This was a Type A CAI, USNM3898, which we re-labeled as D7, based on the CAI numbering scheme for that paper. This Rb-Sr work on Allende was contemporaneous with our extensive work on Apollo 15 basalts, which was also published in 1973 [6] and included an extensive and detailed discussion of the calibrations for 87 Sr/ 86 Sr. This includes the effect of a modification of the Lunatic I and of the shift in calibration for 87 Sr/ 86 Sr by -0.00005, after the modification. On page 221 of the report by Gray et al. [2], it is stated that +0.00005 was added to 87 Sr/ 86 Sr measurements after the modification. This correction (Footnote j, Table 3) applies to CAIs D-7, D-8, and C-1. Our conclusion is that extensive calibrations, using Sr from seawater and from Moore County plagioclase support the difference of 3 εu between BABI and the measured value ALL, for D-7 (USNM 3898). These data cannot be lightly dismissed.  In Table 1, in DAP and GJW (1973) [6] we note that our "preferred" value for NBS 987 87 Sr/ 86 Sr was 0.71015 ± 5. NBS 987 (SrCO3) and NBS 984 (RbCl)  were used to calibrate the Rb and Sr spike concentrations (as shown in Table 1 and not in Table 3 with the precise Apollo 15 measurements [6]), and not as isotopic standards. Hence only a cursory measurement of NBS 987 was made. The "preferred" value we reported happened to agree with the Provisional NBS Certificate of Analysis, for SRM 987, issued 11/8/1971 and revised 3/6/1972. Hence, we paid little attention to the measurement of 87 Sr/ 86 Sr in NBS 987. Based on these considerations, it is not valid to use our "preferred" value for NBS 987 in 1973 "to correct" our CAI data [7]. Podosek et al. [8] reviewed our data and noted that a valid comparison could be made for 87 Sr/ 86 Sr in Moore County plagioclase and that the results for the Caltech and Wustl labs were in agreement. This approach should have been adopted by [7]. That left the unresolved problem that the USNM 3898 87 Sr/ 86 Sr  measurement at Wustl fell midway between the Caltech values for BABI and ALL, with no obvious explanation, except based on artifacts due to sample leaching or due to the disturbed Rb-Sr systematics in CAIs. There is no resolution of this issue, but this is not an excuse to summarily discard the data by Caltech    and Wustl on Allende inclusions, as proposed by Hans et al. [7], who then reached the conclusion that the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values BABI, ADOR, and ALL are identical.  Samples have been prepared for a redetermination of ( 87 Sr/ 86 Sr)ALL (in D7/USNM3898) and in ADOR, using the Triton at the JPL Cosmochemistry labs. The measurements will be reported at the conference.  We now turn attention to the 84 Sr/ 88 Sr measurements by Hans et al. (2013) [7] on many CAIs and at Caltech, on FUN and non-FUN inclusions (1978) [9]. Hans et al. [7] obtained very high precision measurements of 84 Sr/ 88 Sr by thermal ionization (Triton). The work is of high quality, and includes, in particular the multidynamic mode of 84 Sr/ 88 Sr measurements, by measuring masses 88 and 86 and then 86 and 84 in the same corresponding cups (and amplifiers, carefully without rotation of amplifiers). This is a technique we have used also at Caltech (Finnigan 262) and at JPL (Triton) for Ca (40, 42 and 42, 44) and for Cr (50, 52 and 52-53-54) and has clear advantages for amplifier gain calibrations. Hans et al. [7] determined an endemic excess in CAIs in 84 Sr/ 88 Sr of 1.2 εu, with exquisite precision. There is no argument about the quality and precision of the data, although it is somewhat surprising that a uniform excess exists for their CAIs. The authors also proposed that the uniform excesses in 84 Sr might not be a reflection of p-process excesses but of equivalent (and equal) r-process excesses in 88 Sr. They then proposed that an excess in 88 Sr would result in an apparent deficit in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr through the normalization for isotope fractionation using normal 86 Sr/ 88 Sr = 0.1194. By simple arithmetic, an excess in 84 Sr of γ is equivalent to an excess in 88 Sr of γ and a deficit in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr of γ/2. For an observed deficit in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr of 3 εu (the ALL value) one requires an excess in 84 Sr/ 88 Sr or in 88 Sr/ 86 Sr of 6 εu. This would be starkly different than the endemic value of 1.2 εu observed [7] for 84 Sr/ 88 Sr. Furthermore, we reported [9] directly on 84 Sr in FUN CAIs (EK1-4-1 and C1) and in non-FUN inclusions, including D7. We also reported on gravimetric standards we prepared with small excesses in 84 Sr [9]. The existence of 84 Sr data on D7 was not recognized by [7]. Our results for D7 (red points) are shown in Fig. 2. The data are clearly not nearly as precise as the measurements by Hans et al. [7]. However, the 84 Sr data from 1978, on D7 have more than enough precision to exclude completely the possibility that D 7 have an excess in 84 Sr/ 88 Sr or in 88 Sr/ 86 Sr of +6 εu, as hypothesized by [7] and represented by the open symbol and dashed line in Fig. 2. We conclude that the ALL value cannot be interpreted as an artifact due to a p-process ( 84 Sr/ 88 Sr)  or an r-process ( 88 Sr/ 86 Sr) excess. We note that it is possible to have p-process excesses by themselves. For the FUN CAI C1, McCulloch and Wasserburg [10] obtained for Sm an anomaly (excess) only in the pprocess  144 Sm and concluded that p-process and rprocess effects (e.g., for EK1-4-1) need not be coproduced.  We conclude that it is not reasonable to claim that the most primitive ALL value for the solar system, based on D7/USNM 3898 is incorrect or an artifact caused by large, unobserved excesses in 84 Sr/ 88 Sr. References: [1] Wasserburg GJ, Papanastassiou DA, Sanz HG (1969) EPSL 7, 33.
