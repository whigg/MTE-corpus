Introduction: A new generation of planetary instruments, such as the Planetary Instrument for Xray Lithochemistry (PIXL) [1] can generate hundreds or thousands of spectra per command.  These data exhibit complex structure with multiple endmembers, trends, borders and gradients along different spatial and compositional dimensions.  Characterizing this structure is an important first step to understand a new sample and identify candidate locations for further measurements.  This work analyzes several challenging specimens using statistically-motivated dimensionality reduction.  Such models appear in diverse fields such as molecular biology and dynamical systems analysis [2], but their use in planetary geology is understudied.  We acquire data from the breadboard version of the PIXL instrument slated for the proposed Mars 2020 rover, hypothesizing that nonlinear projections will capture compositional distinctions better than conventional linear methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Method: We analyzed three samples: "Troughite" (a living microbialite collected from standing water in the Mohave Desert) "Black Beauty" (a piece of NWA 7033; a Martian meteorite consisting of a sedimentary basaltic breccia and impact spherules), and a travertine (a carbonate precipitate) collected from Indonesia.  The PIXL instrument design emits a tightly-focused beam of x-rays onto the sample through a polycapillary. Fluorescence of the sample causes x-rays of characteristic energies to be emitted and detected by a silicon drift detector.  The beam is moved in 100 micron steps between integrations to acquire a raster grid of several thousand spectra.  We calculated descriptive intensity values for each spectrum using the energy channels of the dominant KÎ±1 peaks for Al, Si, Ca, S, P, Cl, Ti, K, Fe, Ba, Ce, Mn, Ga, Zr, Sr, and Y. We ratioed the resulting intensities to silicon and then projected the result to 2D using the following linear and nonlinear models. The linear methods were Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Factor Analysis (FA), and Probabilistic PCA (PPCA) [3].  Nonlinear projections included Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), Kernel PCA (KPCA), Laplacian Eigenmaps (LEM), and Fast Maximum Variance Unfolding (FMVU) [3], and t-distributed Stochastic Neighborhood Embedding (tSNE) [4], which finds a projection that best preserves local probability density relationships according to KL-divergence.   We evaluated performance using two methods.  First we used the Agreement Rate Metric (ARM) [5], a statistical score defined as the fraction of nearestneighbor relationships preserved in the lowdimensional representation.   We also compared the maps to a petrological classification of the "Troughite" dataset.  We co-registered an optical thin section image, and manually classified significant pixel categories: euhedral minerals, iron oxides, quartz, feldspars, and k-feldspars. We then evaluated class separation in each scatterplot using cross validated k-nearestneighbor classification [6]. Results: ARM scores were consistent across all samples, with t-SNE scoring consistently higher than other nonlinear and classical linear methods (Table 1). All methods scored well for supervised classification (at or above 98% with respect to petrological categories).  Figures 1-2 illustrate the t-SNE projection of the Troughite spectra as a point cloud.  We manually colored the scatterplot to highlight clusters corresponding to different compositional units. Grains with novel compositions are easy to overlook in a brute force inspection, but are immediately evident in the t-SNE projection since the spectra appear as isolated clusters. Conclusions: Planetary instrument operations demand rapid tactical analysis to keep pace with daily operations. Dimensionality reduction can be a valuable first step as a precursor to followup measurements and quantitative analysis.  We find that even for these complex samples, the simplest linear projections of PIXL data are extremely effective at capturing the main petrological classifications. For subtler structures, ARM Scores suggest that t-Stochastic Neighborhood Embedding may provide the best overall fidelity.  We have also found this representation helpful to find spectral artifacts such as rare diffraction peaks.

Agreement Rate Metric (ARM) scores can range from 0 (no relation to full-spectral dataset) to 1 (perfect fidelity).  Petrological classification accuracy is calculated using k-nearest neighbor method.  Performance trends were insensitive to the number of nearest neighbors (k-value); these scores use k=30.   Figure 1. Left: Semi-automated clustering of the Troughite specimen using t-SNE. The projection visualizes the spectral cube as a 2-dimensional map with one point per spectrum.  Similar spectra lie close together on the 2D plane. Axis units are arbitrary.  The scatterplot was created automatically, after which colors and numbers were added by hand to emphasize salient groups. Compositional units are: 1, Calcite cement; 2, Edges of feldspar grains; 3, Titanium-rich minerals and cement; 4-8, Edges of carbonate grains; 9, Quartz with diffraction peaks, 10-12, Iron oxides; 13-14, Iron-rich cement and edges; 15-17, Epoxy, in voids and along the edges of embedded grains; 18, Centers of iron oxide grains; 19-23, Feldspars; 24, Edges of calcite crystals.
