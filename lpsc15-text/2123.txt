Kiran  Kumar,  Space  Applications  Centre,  Indian  Space  Research  Organization,Ahmedabad, India, *arya_as@ sac.isro.gov.inThe  Mission  &  its  uniqueness: Mars  OrbiterMission  (MOM),  the  inter-planetary  mission  ofIndian  Space  Research  Organisation  (ISRO)  to  theplanet  Mars,  launched  on  November  5,  2013  is  amaiden  &  unique  Indian  attempt  towards  sendingorbiters to other planets in our solar system. It is themost  cost  effective inter-planetary  mission  evercarried  out  globally,   accomplished  in  record  timeand  inserted  in  the  Mars  orbit  in  its  first  attemptitself.  The mission has a unique and highly ellipticalMartian orbit of about 261 km (Periareion) to 78,000km  (Apoareion).   Among  contemporary,  MOM  isalso  credited  with  some  more  laurels  likeminiaturisation  of  five  heterogeneous  sciencepayloads and minimal path corrections during entirecruise phase. The Payload: Mars Color Camera (MCC) is amongthe  five  science  payloads  onboard  Mars  OrbiterMission. It operates in visible range (0.4 to 0.7 µm)and  uses  RGB bayer  pattern[1].  Its  IGFOV  variesfrom about  15 m to  4 km.  The detector  array  has2048x2048 elements  on a  pixel  pitch of  5.5µ.  Thesensor  is  driven  by  a  custom  built  electronicsdesigned around the detector [2].  Scientific  Objectives:  MCC has  been  designed  tomeet the following major objectives: 1)  To  image  the  surface  features  of  Mars  withvarying  resolution and scales  from highly ellipticalorbit.   2)  To  map  the  geological  setting  of  areaaround Methane sources  that  will  be picked up byMSM  (Methane  Sensor  for  Mars)  onboard  MOM.3) To monitor dynamic behaviour of the dust `devils’or  dust-storms,  cloud  patterns  etc.  4)  Imaging  ofPhobos/Deimos.  5)  To  provide  contextualInformation for other non-imaging science payloadsonboard MOM, mostly operating in non-visible rangeof electromagnetic spectrum.  Initial results: After Mars orbit insertion, MCC hasreturned  about  250  spectacular  images  of  Mars  inabout 3 months, including images of its two Moonsand  close  encounter  with  comet  siding  spring(October19, 2014). Some of the initial observations /results are presented herewith, as under.  The single-shot images of full Mars disc are an assetto view and monitor the dynamic processes, active atregional to global scale on Mars. The varying cloudpattern, crowning the top of northern hemisphere andthe  movement  of  the  dust  storm  in   southernhemisphere  could  be  clearly  seen  in  the  followingtwo images separated by a week’s time i.e between30th Sept & 7th Oct, 2014  (Fig. 1)Fig.  1:  Multi-temporal  variation  of  cloud and  dustpattern on Martian hemisphere separated by a week’stime        Similarly, activity of a major `dust devil’ couldbe seen prograding between Oct 20 & Oct 28, 2014in northern and equatorial  region.  The dust front isseen  spreading  eastward  along  Acidalia to  centralNoachies, to the Hellas, then swirling westward nearArgyre and  ultimately  fading  out  along  ValliesMarineris. (Fig. 2)Fig. 2: Major dust devil seen spreading in a week’stime     This information helps in interpretation of the datafrom  other  sensors  onboard  MOM,  like  MethaneSensor for Mars (MSM), by carrying out atmosphericcorrections using appropriate models.    Another interesting study was carried out around 50degrees northern latitude. There was a lofty isolatedpatch of cloud extending a clear shadow on Martiansurface.  The sun-elevation angle and the magnitudeof shadow displacement were used to determine the2123.pdf

cloud height that was estimated to be between 35-38km, which is the abode of carbon-dioxide ice clouds(Fig.  3).  It  is  worth  mentioning  that  unlike  Earth,there are two types of clouds in Martian atmosphereviz. water-ice clouds and CO2 ice clouds. The lateroccurs  mostly  20-25  km  above  the  Mars  surface.Differentiating  them  visually  is  otherwise  achallenging task and hence this technique. Fig. 3: Detection of CO2 ice cloudBesides, imaging the Martian surface, MCC has alsocaptured Phobos, one of the natural satellites of  theMars in motion, on Oct 14, 2014 between 11:25:35and  11:26:10  UT.  The  spatial  resolution  is  about550m.  Phobos  is  seen  moving  from  dark-spacebackground  into  the  Martian  backdrop  during  theimaging period (Fig. 4).Fig. 4: Phobos captured during its revolution aroundMarsSimilarly, the other natural satellite of the Moon i.e.the Deimos was also captured  on the same date at13:06:11 UT (Fig. 5).  The spatial resolution is300 m.                   Fig. 5: Deimos imaged in the Martian orbitOne of the most important task of MCC is to furnishcontextual  information  for  other  sensors  onboard,especially which are either non-imaging or operate inother  than  visible  electromagnetic  spectrum.  Theimage  below  (Fig.  6)  shows  the  track  of  MSM(yellow stripes) laid over the corresponding mosaicof  MCC  images,  acquired  simultaneously,  thushelping  the  MSM  to  orient  and  facilitate  itsmeaningful interpretation.Fig.  6:  Track  of MSM (yellow stripes) overlaid onthe mosaic of polygonal MCC images for contextualinformation.  It may be concluded that the Mars Colour Camerahas performed as expected and returned high qualityand  meaningful  images  which  have  been  used  formonitoring the dust/ cloud conditions in single-shotfor  entire  disc  of  Mars.   It  could  be  used  todifferentiate  the CO2 Ice-cloud from the rest. MCChas also captured the two Moons of the Mars, besidesreturning  amazing pictures  of  close  encounter  withcomet  C/2013 A1 (Siding  Spring).  MCC has  beensuccessfully catering to the contextual requirement ofother co-sensors onboard MOM. In totality, MCC hasmet  most  of  its  desired  objectives  so far,  and  willcontinue  to  return  meaningful  images  with  higherresolution  in  future  as  the  sun  moves  towardsperiareion.References: [1] Arya A.S. et.al (2014), LPS XXXXV,Abstract# 2449.
