Kiran  Kumar,  Space  Applications  Centre,  Indian  Space  Research  Organization, Ahmedabad, India, *arya_as@ sac.isro.gov.in The  Mission  &  its  uniqueness: Mars  Orbiter Mission  (MOM),  the  inter-planetary  mission  of Indian  Space  Research  Organisation  (ISRO)  to  the planet  Mars,  launched  on  November  5,  2013  is  a maiden  &  unique  Indian  attempt  towards  sending orbiters to other planets in our solar system. It is the most  cost  effective inter-planetary  mission  ever carried  out  globally,   accomplished  in  record  time and  inserted  in  the  Mars  orbit  in  its  first  attempt itself.  The mission has a unique and highly elliptical Martian orbit of about 261 km (Periareion) to 78,000 km  (Apoareion).   Among  contemporary,  MOM  is also  credited  with  some  more  laurels  like miniaturisation  of  five  heterogeneous  science payloads and minimal path corrections during entire cruise phase. The Payload: Mars Color Camera (MCC) is among the  five  science  payloads  onboard  Mars  Orbiter Mission. It operates in visible range (0.4 to 0.7 µm) and  uses  RGB bayer  pattern[1].  Its  IGFOV  varies from about  15 m to  4 km.  The detector  array  has 2048x2048 elements  on a  pixel  pitch of  5.5µ.  The sensor  is  driven  by  a  custom  built  electronics designed around the detector [2].  Scientific  Objectives:  MCC has  been  designed  to meet the following major objectives: 1)  To  image  the  surface  features  of  Mars  with varying  resolution and scales  from highly elliptical orbit.   2)  To  map  the  geological  setting  of  area around Methane sources  that  will  be picked up by MSM  (Methane  Sensor  for  Mars)  onboard  MOM. 3) To monitor dynamic behaviour of the dust `devils' or  dust-storms,  cloud  patterns  etc.  4)  Imaging  of Phobos/Deimos.  5)  To  provide  contextual Information for other non-imaging science payloads onboard MOM, mostly operating in non-visible range of electromagnetic spectrum.  Initial results: After Mars orbit insertion, MCC has returned  about  250  spectacular  images  of  Mars  in about 3 months, including images of its two Moons and  close  encounter  with  comet  siding  spring (October19, 2014). Some of the initial observations / results are presented herewith, as under.  The single-shot images of full Mars disc are an asset to view and monitor the dynamic processes, active at regional to global scale on Mars. The varying cloud pattern, crowning the top of northern hemisphere and the  movement  of  the  dust  storm  in   southern hemisphere  could  be  clearly  seen  in  the  following two images separated by a week's time i.e between 30th Sept & 7th Oct, 2014  (Fig. 1) Fig.  1:  Multi-temporal  variation  of  cloud and  dust pattern on Martian hemisphere separated by a week's time        Similarly, activity of a major `dust devil' could be seen prograding between Oct 20 & Oct 28, 2014 in northern and equatorial  region.  The dust front is seen  spreading  eastward  along  Acidalia to  central Noachies, to the Hellas, then swirling westward near Argyre and  ultimately  fading  out  along  Vallies Marineris. (Fig. 2) Fig. 2: Major dust devil seen spreading in a week's time     This information helps in interpretation of the data from  other  sensors  onboard  MOM,  like  Methane Sensor for Mars (MSM), by carrying out atmospheric corrections using appropriate models.    Another interesting study was carried out around 50 degrees northern latitude. There was a lofty isolated patch of cloud extending a clear shadow on Martian surface.  The sun-elevation angle and the magnitude of shadow displacement were used to determine the  cloud height that was estimated to be between 35-38 km, which is the abode of carbon-dioxide ice clouds (Fig.  3).  It  is  worth  mentioning  that  unlike  Earth, there are two types of clouds in Martian atmosphere viz. water-ice clouds and CO2 ice clouds. The later occurs  mostly  20-25  km  above  the  Mars  surface. Differentiating  them  visually  is  otherwise  a challenging task and hence this technique. Fig. 3: Detection of CO2 ice cloud Besides, imaging the Martian surface, MCC has also captured Phobos, one of the natural satellites of  the Mars in motion, on Oct 14, 2014 between 11:25:35 and  11:26:10  UT.  The  spatial  resolution  is  about 550m.  Phobos  is  seen  moving  from  dark-space background  into  the  Martian  backdrop  during  the imaging period (Fig. 4). Fig. 4: Phobos captured during its revolution around Mars Similarly, the other natural satellite of the Moon i.e. the Deimos was also captured  on the same date at 13:06:11 UT (Fig. 5).  The spatial resolution is 300 m.                   Fig. 5: Deimos imaged in the Martian orbit One of the most important task of MCC is to furnish contextual  information  for  other  sensors  onboard, especially which are either non-imaging or operate in other  than  visible  electromagnetic  spectrum.  The image  below  (Fig.  6)  shows  the  track  of  MSM (yellow stripes) laid over the corresponding mosaic of  MCC  images,  acquired  simultaneously,  thus helping  the  MSM  to  orient  and  facilitate  its meaningful interpretation. Fig.  6:  Track  of MSM (yellow stripes) overlaid on the mosaic of polygonal MCC images for contextual information.  It may be concluded that the Mars Colour Camera has performed as expected and returned high quality and  meaningful  images  which  have  been  used  for monitoring the dust/ cloud conditions in single-shot for  entire  disc  of  Mars.   It  could  be  used  to differentiate  the CO2 Ice-cloud from the rest. MCC has also captured the two Moons of the Mars, besides returning  amazing pictures  of  close  encounter  with comet  C/2013 A1 (Siding  Spring).  MCC has  been successfully catering to the contextual requirement of other co-sensors onboard MOM. In totality, MCC has met  most  of  its  desired  objectives  so far,  and  will continue  to  return  meaningful  images  with  higher resolution  in  future  as  the  sun  moves  towards periareion.
