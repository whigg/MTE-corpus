Introduction: In reflectance and emission models based on radiative transfer, the wavelength-dependent complex index of refraction (ñ=nλ+ikλ) is the only input related to mineral chemistry and structure. The values n and k are known as the optical constants of the material. There are only a few sets of published mid-IR optical constants for the monoclinic and triclinic crystal systems derived from single crystal samples [1-7]. The small number of measurements that do exist often use the assumption of normal incidence [1,3,5,6] to make the calculation easier. Here, we outline a method for calculating optical constants of minerals in the triclinic symmetry group. While other works have outlined this process [5,8] measurements have been carried out for only one geologically relevant triclinic material, CuSO4·5(H2O) [1,2]. Since not all experimental setups have incidence angles close to normal, we chose a model that can derive optical constants from oriented reflectance spectra of arbitrary incidence angle (α) [2,8,9]. Method: In the visible and near-infrared (VNIR), optical constants are typically derived from reflectance of powdered samples using a scattering model along with Kramers Kronig analysis. In the mid-IR, optical constants derived from single crystal spectra are preferable for materials that do not polish well in pellet form [10] or when k is large [11].  We use Lorentz-Lorenz dispersion theory, which models vibrational modes as classical oscillators. Each oscillator is described by a set of parameters that include the resonant frequency (νk), strength (sk), and damping (γk), as well as the angles (θk and φk) with respect to the crystal axes. The optical constants are related to the complex dielectric tensor (𝜀𝑥,𝑦,𝑧), which is described by the sum of N oscillators.  𝜀𝑥,𝑦,𝑧 = 𝜀𝑥,𝑦,𝑧 ∞+ ( 𝑠𝑖𝑛2𝜃𝑘𝑐𝑜𝑠 2𝜑𝑘 𝑠𝑖𝑛 2𝜃𝑘𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜑𝑘𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜑𝑘 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃𝑘𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃𝑘𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜑𝑘 𝑠𝑖𝑛2𝜃𝑘𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜑𝑘𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜑𝑘 𝑠𝑖𝑛 2𝜃𝑘𝑠𝑖𝑛 2𝜑𝑘 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃𝑘𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃𝑘𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜑𝑘 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃𝑘𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃𝑘𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜑𝑘 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃𝑘𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃𝑘𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜑𝑘 𝑐𝑜𝑠 2𝜃𝑘 )×∑ 𝑆𝑘 2(𝜈𝑘 2 − 𝜈2) − 𝑖𝛾𝜈 𝑁 𝑘=1 Here, 𝜀𝑥,𝑦,𝑧 ∞  are the values at high frequency. For monoclinic and triclinic minerals, reflectance can be calculated from 𝜀𝑥,𝑦,𝑧 using a generalized Fresnel equation [9]. The number of elements in the dielectric tensor depends on the symmetry of the crystal. An isotropic mineral can be described by three identical values along the diagonal, resulting in one set of optical constants; an orthorhombic mineral requires three different values, giving three sets of optical constants. Due to the fact that the transition moment orientations in a triclinic crystal are arbitrary, six different values (as εij=εji) are needed, again, resulting in three sets of optical constants.  Isotropic: 𝜀𝑥,𝑦,𝑧 = ( 𝜀 0 0 0 𝜀 0 0 0 𝜀 ) Orthorhombic: 𝜀𝑥,𝑦,𝑧 = ( 𝜀𝑥 0 0 0 𝜀𝑦 0 0 0 𝜀𝑧 ) Monoclinic: 𝜀𝑥,𝑦,𝑧 = ( 𝜀𝑥𝑥 𝜀𝑥𝑦 0 𝜀𝑦𝑥 𝜀𝑦𝑦 0 0 0 𝜀𝑧𝑧 ) Triclinic: 𝜀𝑥,𝑦,𝑧 = ( 𝜀𝑥𝑥 𝜀𝑥𝑦 𝜀𝑥𝑧 𝜀𝑦𝑥 𝜀𝑦𝑦 𝜀𝑦𝑧 𝜀𝑧𝑥 𝜀𝑧𝑦 𝜀𝑧𝑧 ) Sample preparation and reflectance measurements. The simplest way to prepare a triclinic sample is to cut the crystal into a cube as done in [1] to ensure that reflectance spectra can be collected in enough orientations to fit the orientations of the oscillators (θ, φ). To tie the values of θ, φ to the crystal axes, crystal face of easily recognizable orientation can be used as a starting point. Otherwise, a thick section of one of the faces can be used to carry out single crystal x-ray diffraction to orient the sample. To find all values in the dielectric tensor at least six spectra are required, two from each face of the cube with the incident beam polarized in orthogonal directions [1,5]. More spectra at various polarization angles will improve the fit. For a monoclinic sample, only two orthogonal faces are needed. One parallel to the monoclinic plane and the other perpendicular to it. Fitting procedure. The orientation of the sample relative to the polarization angle of the incoming beam is described by a set of angles (Θ,Ω,Ψ) with respect to laboratory coordinates. It is generally easier if one of the lab coordinate axes is set to a known crystallographic axis. The six (or more) spectra are fit simultaneously using a non-linear least squares fitting algorithm (Matlab's lsqcurvefit). The infinite frequency dielectric constants can be estimated from previously measured visible values or measured with a refractometer. Since it is difficult to obtain realistic estimates for all of the parameters simply based on the reflectance spectra, it is useful to first fit the spectra using the for mulas for normal incidence to obtain initial estimates for monoclinic and triclinic models [1]. When fitting the reflectance spectra, we place upper and lower bounds on the parameters for two reasons: 1) νk ,sk, γk must be positive and 2) limiting the number of possible values speeds up the fitting process. Results: We have tested a Matlab code for triclinic optical constants on a monoclinic sample to compare the results to optical constants calculated using simplified [7] monoclinic equations. The sample is an orthoclase crystal described in [4] and the reflectance spectra used are the same as in that reference. The initial estimates for the dispersion parameters are the same with the extra values of 𝜀𝑥,𝑦,𝑧 set to zero. Plots of the output of the monoclinic vs. triclinic Matlab codes are shown in Fig 1. We did not tightly restrict the values of   Fig 1. Comparison between monoclinic and triclinic model outputs for orthoclase's three sets of  n,k.    𝜀𝑥𝑧 , 𝜀𝑦𝑧, or θk, φk so this could account for the differences between the n ,k values for the two models. Next, we applied this model to recently acquired reflectance data of a labradorite crystal (see Rucks et al., this meeting). References: [1] Aronson et al. (1985) Ap. Opt., 24, 8, 1200-1203.
