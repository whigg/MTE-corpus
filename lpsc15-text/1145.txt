PLANETARY IMPACTS AND ATMOSPHERIC ESCAPE. D. G. Korycansky, CODEP, Department of Earth and PlanetarySciences, University of California, Santa Cruz CA 95064 , D. C. Catling, Department of Earth and Space Sciences, University ofWashington, K. J. Zahnle , Planetary Systems Branch, NASA Ames Research Center.One of the key features of Earth-sized planets in this andother systems is the presence or absence of an atmosphere.Among other things it is likely that an atmosphere is requiredfor habitablity, at least on the surface of the planet. Assumingthat an atmosphere forms on a planet, the next question iswhether the atmosphere is stable, or whether it will escape.Atmospheres may escape by thermal or non-thermal means, orthey may be eroded by impacts.Placing Solar System bodies on a diagram in which the typical impact velocity vimp onto that object is plotted against theescape velocity vesc from the object suggests that vimp/vesc ∼ 5marks a dividing line between bodies with atmospheres andthose without [1]. This suggests that there is a possible criterion for impact erosion to act as an effective means of removingan object's atmosphere. However, there is a degeneracy: in thesolar system vimp is roughly proportional to the orbital velocityvorb, so that high impact velocities are found for bodies orbitingclose to the Sun; such objects also suffer large radiative fluxes.Thus the correlation between impact velocity and presence ofan atmosphere may only reflect the outcome of other escapemechanisms that are dependent on radiative flux.We are investigating atmospheric escape with the aim ofdisentangling the possible degeneracy between the effects ofimpact erosion and the other mechanisms. This particular abstract reports on some preliminary results of the project toassess the effectiveness of impact erosion as a planetary lossmechanism. We are carrying out a suite of impact simulationsacross a range of parameters that will quantify this effect.Hydrodynamic modelingImpact simulations can be divided between "local" and "global"cases depending on the geometry of the impact, chiefly theimpactor size relative to the target planet and the depth of theatmosphere compared to the planet's radius. The calculationsdiscussed here are local: the curvature of the planet and theradial dependence of the gravitational field are neglected. Thecomputational domain is a cartesian box: the calculations arethree-dimensional.Physical parameters of the simulations include the targetplanet properties: three planetary environments will be used.Parameters include the gravitational field (vertical gravity g)and the escape velocity that characterize the target. Additionally the surface pressure of the atmosphere and its scale heightare set, the latter determined by the atmospheric compositionand temperature. This in turn sets the altitude of the exobase,above which material is assumed to move ballistically. The parameters of the impactor are its diameter and velocity (specifiedin terms of the assumed escape velocity); the impactor angle isset to θ = 45◦ from the vertical.We are carrying out the local-scale simulations using theFigure 1: Sample timestep of a local-scale impact modeledwith the CTH hydrocode. The figure shows density on a logarithmic scale (10−6 < ρ < 1 gm cm−3) at t = 60 s after theimpact of a d = 36.8 km object at 20 km s−1 (4×vesc) into the"Mars" target.CTH hydrocode from Sandia National Laboratory [2]. CTH isa highly advanced code widely used in the planetary sciencecommunity. It utilizes adaptive mesh refinement to concentratecomputational resources at locations of physical interest in thesimulation, such as shock fronts and material interfaces. Inaddition, it makes use of material strength models and advancedtabular equations of tabular such as ANEOS and the SESAMElibrary from Los Alamos National Laboratory.The full project will examine impacts into three targets:Mars-like (g = 370 cm s−2, vesc = 5.0 km s−1), Earth-like(g = 980 cm s−2, vesc = 11.0 km s−1), and a "super-Earth"(g = 2411 cm s−2, vesc = 23.5 km s−1) that matches conditions for an exoplanet of 8M⊕. The surface pressures arePsur f = 1, 10, and 100 bar. For these first set of calculations wealso assume an isothermal CO2 atmosphere at 300K, leadingto exobase altitudes Hx ∼ 400, 150, and 60 km for the "Mars","Earth", and "Super-Earth" cases, respectively. Impactor diameters will be di = 4.6, 17, and 36.8 km, and impact velocitiesare parameterized in terms of the escape velocity: vi/vesc = 2,4, 6, and 8. Computation domain sizes are based on the maximum of either the transient crater diameter from the impactor the exobase altitude. Likewise the simulation runtimes arebased on the maximum crater formation time or the time forimpact ejecta oving at vesc to reach the exobase altitude. Boththe impact and the target have made of basalt; a simple materialmodel ("geo") in CTH is applied, with a nominal yield strength1145.pdf

Although we track three kinds of material(impactor, target surface, atmosphere), here we report only onthe last (escaping atmosphere).Some Preliminary ResultsWe have carried out and analyzed about two dozen calculationsso far. A sample timestep from one the calculations is shownin Fig. 1. The figure shows the density on a logarithmic scale(10−6 < ρ < 1 gm cm−3) at t = 60 s after the impact of ad = 36.8 km object at 20 km s−1 (4× vesc) into the "Mars"target. Completed analysis of runs at the time of writing isshown in Fig. 2, where the ratio of escaping atmosphericmass me to the impactor mass mi = 7.5×1016 kg is shown forour "Mars" and "Earth" calculations as a function of impactorvelocity to escape velocity ratio vi/vesc for the three values ofsurface pressure Psur f , all for the impactor diameter di = 36.8km.Looking at Fig. 2, several results are evident, at least ata tentative level. 1) The ratio of escaping mass to impactormass (me/mi) decreases by approximately an order of magnitude between the "Mars" and "Earth" cases; it is not clearwhether this is due to the increased gravity or the increasedescape velocity between the two cases. 2) Escaping mass generally increases with surface pressure (which is equivalent toatmospheric density for these atmospheres which all have thesame temperature). Finally, 3) escaping mass does not appearto systematically increase with escape velocity, an unexpectedresult that contradicts some results in the literature [3-5]. Morework (simulations and analysis) will be required to assess therobustness of this result and check its correctness.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by NASA Planetary AtmospheresProgram award NNX14AJ45G.
