How Large are Present-Day Surface Heat Flow Variations across Mars' Surface?  A.-C. Plesa1, N. Tosi1,2, M.Grott1 and D. Breuer1, 1German Aerospace Center (DLR), Berlin, Germany, 2Technische Universität Berlin, Berlin Germany.  Introduction:  The upcoming InSight (Interior exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport) mission, to be launched in 2016, will carry out the first in-situ Martian heat flow measurement and provide an important baseline to constrain the present-day heat budget of the planet and, in turn, the thermal and chemical evolution of its interior. As InSight will provide a single measurement point, we need to estimate the magnitude of heat flow variations over the Martian surface in order to constrain the average heat flow of the planet. Currently, the Earth and the Moon are the only bodies on which in-situ surface heat flow measurements have been performed. On Earth, plate tectonics is the main agent causing strong spatial variations of the surface heat flow of up to 125 mW/m2 in volcanic regions or rift zones [1]. On the Moon, variations of the surface heat flow between 11 and 34 mW/m2 are attributed to the strong enrichment of heat producing elements (HPE) in the so-called Procellarum Kreep Terane on the lunar near-side [2].  On Mars the surface distribution of thorium observed in gamma-ray spectrometer data from Mars Odyssey shows only slight variations between 0.2 and 1 ppm [3], significantly less than over the lunar surface where this varies by about two orders of magnitude, i.e. between 0.1 and 12 ppm [4]. Thus, for Mars, the surface heat flow is expected to vary less with geological location, being mainly influenced by variations in the thickness and HPE content of the crust [5], and potentially by mantle plumes [6]. Model:  In this work, we investigate the spatial variations of the surface heat flow by running thermal evolution models for Mars in 3D spherical geometry [7]. Our models use cooling boundary conditions at the core-mantle boundary (CMB) and account for  the decay of radioactive elements. Additionally, all simulations consider a crust of fixed thickness with a northsouth dichotomy (i.e., 30 and 60 km over the northern and southern hemisphere, respectively). The thermal conductivity of the crust is set to either 2 or 3 W/m K, while for the mantle a value of 4 W/m K is assumed. Since crustal thickness variations are more significant than the variations in the HPE distribution within the crust [5], we neglect spatial variations of the HPE and use the average value obtained from gamma ray measurements instead [5, 3]. We vary the depth dependence of the viscosity (i.e., temperature- and depthdependent viscosity and, for some models, we also consider an additional viscosity jump in the mid mantle), include compressibility effects (extended Boussinesq approximation, EBA), phase transitions, and treat different core sizes in order to test the variability of the surface heat flow after 4.5 Ga of thermal evolution. Results:  Present-day surface heat flow.  In all our models, the present-day average surface heat flow is around 24.5±0.5 mW/m2. Our results show that surface heat flow variations are mainly dominated by the variations in crustal thickness, unless the mantle viscosity increases by more than three orders of magnitude with depth.    Figure 1: Surface heat flow map after 4.5 Ga of thermal evolution. Top: the simulation uses a thermal conductivity of the crust of 2 W/m K, EBA and an activation volume of 6 cm3/mol resulting in a viscosity increase with depth of about 2 orders of magnitude. Bottom: the simulation uses a thermal conductivity of the crust of 3 W/m K, EBA and an activation volume of 10 cm3/mol resulting in a viscosity increase with depth of about 4 orders of magnitude.  Cases using the Boussinesq approximation usually show higher variations of the surface heat flow coma b 2375.pdf

pared to cases using EBA which are characterized by small variations above mantle plumes of around 3 mW/m2 compared to the surface average (Figure 1a). This is due to the fact that simulations using EBA exhibit a smaller temperature drop across the lower thermal boundary layer which reduces the spatial variation of the surface heat flow compared to cases where the Boussinesq approximation is  used. A larger activation volume and thus a stronger increase of the viscosity with (e.g., 10 cm3/mol) or a viscosity jump of around 50 in the mid mantle, again result in well-defined mantle plumes. These are clearly visible in the surface heat flow distribution and heat flow variations due to mantle upwellings of about 5 mW/m2 relative to surface average (Figure 1b) are observed. Present-day elastic thickness.  A further constraint for the present-day Martian heat flow comes from estimates of the elastic thickness, which is ~300 km at the north pole today [8].     Figure 2: : Elastic thickness map corresponding to the simulations presented in Figure 1. To compute the elastic thickness we use a dry rheology for both the mantle and crust, and adopt a strain rate of 10-14 s-1. We calculate the elastic thickness from our models and test if such a high value can be reproduced. For the elastic thickness calculations, we employ the strength envelope formalism [9] for the two-layer system consisting of crust and mantle and use the lithospheric temperatures obtained in our models. The results of these calculations are shown in Figure 2. To compare our results to the reported present-day elastic thickness value of 300 km at the north pole, we use a strain rate of 10-14 s-1 [8] appropriate for deformation acting on the time scales of Martian obliquity variations [10], which are believed to drive polar cap deposition [8]. Independently of the parameters assumed, our models show values for the present-day elastic lithosphere thickness lower by 70 – 50 km than to the north pole estimate (Figure 2). Discussion and Conclusions: Our results show  that heat flow over Mars' surface above mantle plumes varies  between 3 and 5 mW/m2 compared to the surface average depending on the convection structure in the underlying mantle. And significant contribution is expected from crustal thickness variations. Since heat flow variations are confined to limited surface regions, a possible plume underneath Elysium is not likely to affect the Insight measurement. Further, the elastic thickness values obtained from our models are lower by about 50 – 70 km than the present-day north pole estimates [5]. This could imply the presence of a depleted region underneath the north pole or a subchondritic bulk content of heat producing elements. Both mechanisms necessarily alter the thermal gradient and would provide higher values for the elastic thickness. If Mars indeed is subchondritic, the variations of the surface heat flow and elastic thickness are expected to be smaller and the values obtained in this study should be considered upper bound estimates. Nevertheless, the heat flow measurement provided by InSight and the Urey ratio (i.e., the ratio between internal heat production and surface heat loss will) calculated from numerical models [11], will provide an independent test for the widely accepted compositional model of Wänke and Dreibus [12].
