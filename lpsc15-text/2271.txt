 POTENTIAL ALTERATION BY GROUNDWATER FLOW IN NW NOACHIS TERRA: GEOMORPHIC AND MINERALOGIC EVIDENCE IN NIRGAL AND HER DESHER VALLES.  D. L. Buczkowski1 , K. D. Seelos1, C. E. Beck1 and S. Murchie1, 1JHU/APL, Laurel MD 20723, Debra.Buczkowski@jhuapl.edu.   Summary: A widespread phyllosilicate-bearing layer has been identified in a distinct region in northwest Noachis Terra [1,2,3]. This layer is exposed along the length of two valley systems in the region, as well as crater rims/walls. It has been suggested that the phyllosili-cates were produced by pedogenic weathering fed by meteoric water or melted snow [2]. However, the geomorphology of the valley systems is consistent with formation due to groundwater sapping [4,5,6], opening the possibility that the phyllosilicates formed by interaction with groundwater, not surface water. Introduction:  Noachis Terra is a highland cratered plain on Mars, extending from 20º to 80ºS latitude and 55ºW to 30ºE longitude. Two small valley systems incise NW Noachis Terra: Her Desher and Nirgal Valles (Fig. 1). Nirgal Vallis is a tributary of Uzboi Vallis, joining the larger system to the south of Holden crater. Her Desher Vallis is an isolated valley that does not obviously connect to any outlet, e.g., craters or other valley system.  Figure 1. Northwest Noachis Terra.  Mosaicked CRISM multispectral mapping data (~230 m/pixel) suggest that a phyllosilicate-bearing layer outcrops along the length of both valley systems and in the interior rims of many craters in the region [1,3]. Further inspection of high resolution CRISM hyperspectral targeted observations (20-40 m/pixel) of the walls of Her Desher and Nirgal Valles confirm the presence of phyllosilicates [1,3]. Spectral analyses indicate that these phyllosilicates are iron-magnesium smectites; the shape and position of the absorptions at 2.3 and 2.4 microns is consistent with either a physical mixture of nontronite (Fe-smectite) and saponite (Mgsmectite) or perhaps an intermediate composition [1,3]. The mineralogy of the layer is generally consistent along the length of both valleys, a total distance of ~600 kilometers [1,3]. This distinct phyllosilicatebearing layer is located only a few meters below the surface cap material and is laterally contiguous with a uniform apparent thickness of ~10 meters. HiRISE observations of these layers show the smectite-bearing materials to be polygonally fractured, which is morphologically similar to other phyllosilicates identified on Mars [7]. Several high resolution hyperspectral CRISM observations of craters near the valley systems also show a phyllosilicate-bearing layer of similar composition.  As in the valleys, these phyllosilicates extend laterally and are located a comparable distance below the surface.  HiRISE data indicate that phyllosilicates exposed in craters have the same polygonal morphology as those in the valleys. Discussion:  A sequence of Al-smectites over Fe/Mg smectites was mapped as part of a formation named "Plateau Phyllosilicates" by [2], and extends from our study area to the north of Valles Marineris. This sequence was proposed to have formed by pedogenesis [2], a process of weathering volcanic soils by percolating water which usually results in accumulation of Fe/Mg smectites in the lower horizons while Alsmectites remain in the upper horizons [8,9]. The source of the water was proposed to have been derived from either precipitation or melted snow [2], both forms of overland flow. However, both Nirgal and Her Desher Valles are geomorphically more similar to valleys formed by groundwater sapping, not overland flow [4].  Nirgal Vallis has a uniform valley width [4,5], not an increasing valley width as is expected for a valley fed by overland flow. It also has U-shaped cross-sections (not Vshaped) and amphitheatre-headed source regions/tributaries [4,5,6]. There is also evidence of strong circum-Tharsis structural control of the networks [4,6], whereas a valley formed by overland flow would be controlled by topography.  It has been shown that tectonic events can result in pressurization of surrounding aquifers [10,11]. Source  regions for the circum-Chryse outflow channels high up on the Tharsis bulge [10] would likely also feed groundwater flow through fracture systems in northwest Noachis Terra, providing a source of water to form Her Desher and Nirgal Valles. It is important to distinguish between 1) the formation of the phyllosilicates and 2) the exposure of the phyllosilicates. One hypothesis could be that the Nirgal and Her Desher phyllosilicates formed pedogenically and then were exposed by valleys formed due to groundwater sapping. However, both Nirgal and Her Desher Valles present an immature pedogenic soil profile. Only Fe/Mg phyllosilicates are exposed in the Nirgal/Her Desher region, while mature pedogenic profile would find Al-phyllosilicates overlying Fe/Mg phyllosilicates [8,9].  It is true that immature soil profiles do not preclude phyllosilciate formation due to pedogenesis; this would be expected to occur in regions of lower water supply. However, the flow of groundwater through a pre-existing Fe/Mg phyllosilicate-bearing layer would presumably further weather the soils, suggesting that a Al-phyllosilicate layer should be observed instead. Meanwhile, the immature soil profile in Nirgal, Her Desher and nearby craters is not inconsistent with phyllosilicate formation due to groundwater flow [9]. Furthermore, the extent of phyllosilicate layer in NW Noachis Terra correlates directly to the extent of groundwater flow modeled by [5] for a Tharsis source region, in that the phyllosilicate layer in NW Noachis Terra does not extend to the east of Uzboi Valles [1,3,12]. Conclusions: In conclusion, a widespread Fe/Mgphyllosilicate-bearing layer has been identified in northwest Noachis Terra, exposed along the length of two valley systems in the region, Nirgal and Her Desher Valles, as well as in nearby crater rims and walls. It has been suggested that the phyllosilicates were produced by pedogenic weathering fed by meteoric water or melted snow [2]. However, the geomorphology of the valley systems is consistent with formation due to groundwater sapping, not overland flow. It is possible that the phyllosilicates were formed by pedogenesis and then were exposed some time later by the formation of the valleys due to groundwater sapping. We suggest that it may also be possible that the phyllosilicates themselves were formed by interaction with flowing groundwater, and then exposed by groundwater sapping of the valleys.
