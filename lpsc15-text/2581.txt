Introduction:  Solar extreme ultraviolet radiation deposits energy in the upper atmosphere of Mars supplying heat and creating an ionosphere by photoionization [1]. Instruments onboard the MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN) spacecraft started in late 2014 to characterize the upper atmosphere and ionosphere with the goal of determining escape rates of volatile species. One key element of this solar energy deposition is the production of photoelectrons, which contribute to ionization, heating, and airglow production. Solar wind ions and electrons that make it past the magnetic pileup region can also deposit energy in the upper atmosphere [2]. Photoelectron and solar wind transport depends on the magnetic topology and especially on whether or not crustal magnetic fields are present [3]. Evidence for the existence of very energetic (500 eV) electron production in the Martian atmosphere was provided by the Chandra X-Ray Observatory (CXO) [4]. A soft X-ray luminosity of several MW was observed on the disk of Mars, in addition to a more extended halo attributed to X-ray production by the solar wind interaction with the exosphere [4, 5]. The disk emission was attributed to Auger X-rays due to solar fluorescence and ionization from the K-shells of atoms contained in CO2 [4, 6].  Figure 1 shows a CXO X-ray image of Mars [4]. However, most K-shell ionization events lead to the production of Auger electrons rather than photon emission. Auger electrons were first detected at Mars by the Electron Reflectometer onboard the Mars Global Surveyor [7], but the SWEA (Solar Wind Electron Analyzer) instrument onboard MAVEN measured a high-resolution spectrum in October 2014. In this paper we will use a two-stream electron transport model that includes K-shell processes to interpret these observations.  Auger Electrons: The ions produced by the photoionization from the K-shell of carbon or oxygen atoms (contained mainly in CO2 molecules) by solar soft Xray radiation are electronically excited and can deexcite in two ways: (1) emission of an electron with energy of ≈ 500 eV (called Auger electrons) or (2) emission of a ≈ 530 eV photon. For oxygen this can be represented by:  hν  + O → O+*  + e-  O+* → O+ + hν (≈0.001 branching ratio)    Figure 1. Soft X-ray image of Mars made by the Chandra X-Ray Observatory [4].      → O++ +  e    (≈ 0.999 branching ratio)  Note that the energy of carbon Auger electrons is ≈ 280 eV and these should also be present. We used a two-stream transport code to model both "normal" photoelectrons and Auger electrons. Suitable photoionization and electron impact cross sections were used [8] as well as a neutral upper atmosphere model of Mars [9] and an input solar spectrum. Our current calculations are preliminary and all these inputs will need to be updated using MAVEN data. Results: Figure 2 shows an electron spectrum measured by the SWEA instrument in the Martian ionosphere. The "standard" photoelectron peaks near energies of 25 - 30 eV are present but so are oxygen Auger electrons near 500 eV and possible carbon Auger electrons near 250 eV. Model results are also shown for comparison and include Auger electrons. In addition, a Maxwellian electron flux was included as an upper boundary condition and was attributed to magnetosheath electrons. The measured spectrum also includes a possible peak near 1 keV, although future observations will be needed to confirm this peak. Charge Exchange Negative H Ions: One possible explanation for the narrow peak at 1 keV in Fig. 2 is energetic solar wind H- ions. Charge exchange (CX) of solar wind protons could produce neutral H beams at the solar wind speed (Hsw+ + H → Hfast + H+), which could then penetrate the magnetic barrier and charge 2581.pdf

transfer again in the ionosphere to produce fast H- ions, which SWEA detects (Hfast + CO2 → Hfast- + CO2+). SWIA has observed charge exchange from a similar CX process (a  paper  on this topic will also be presented at LPSC by Halekas et al.). Much work is needed to confirm or disprove this hypothesis. Summary: Auger electrons were detected at Mars by the SWEA (Solar Wind Electron Analyzer) instrument onboard MAVEN in October 2014. A two-stream electron transport model that includes K-shell processes was used to interpret these observations.  Possible observations of 1 keV H- ions in the ionosphere are also discussed.
