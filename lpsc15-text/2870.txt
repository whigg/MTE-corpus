Introduction:  Ridges, fractures, and relaxed topography on Saturn's icy moon Enceladus preserve a surprisingly complex history of tectonic and thermal activity [1-5] suggesting the surface experienced a variety of deformational events in its geologically recent past. The youngest region is the south polar terrain (SPT) where jets of water vapor have been observed to be erupting from the tiger stripes [1,6]. Beyond the SPT, north of ~ 55˚S, the surface of Enceladus can be broadly divided into cratered terrains on the Saturnian and anti-Saturnian hemispheres, and tectonic terrains on the leading and trailing hemispheres (the LHT and THT) [7-8]. We show that some ridged terrains preserve a history of compression resulting in brittle deformation. Other terrains appear to have experienced more ductile compressional deformation.    Methods:  We perform our analysis by identifying and mapping ridges visible on the Cassini ISS Enceladus basemap and higher resolution images using ArcGIS. We determine relative ages and catalog ridge lengths, widths, and orientations. We also identify morphological characteristics that can help determine formation mechanisms, such mass wasting, lobate morphologies, crenulations, and the geometry of the termination ends. These ridge characteristics can help to constrain formation mechanism [9], such as transpressional, compressional, or tensional stress inducing tectonics, or can help determine if the ridges are a product of extrusive or intrusive processes.  We measure ridge heights and slopes of ridge flanks using topography from both a lower resolution (but broader) global scale and a higher resolution (but narrow) local scale method. The broader scale topography is created using a combination of stereo imaging and photoclinometry. This is useful for determining regional context (e.g. to determine if the region is in a basin), and heights of specific features if they are large enough and image resolution is adequate. For higherprecision topographic analyses, we use limb profiles in targeted areas. In some places, we can determine topography to a resolution of 10s of meters, and ridge slopes and heights can be determined with better precision than through photoclinometry or shadow measurements. This method uses limb images of better resolution than previously analyzed for Enceladus [10-11].  Ridged Terrains: Ridges in each of the youngest ridged terrain regions on Enceladus are different from those in other regions,	  i.e.	  tiger	  stripes	  are	  found	  only	  in	  the	  SPT	  and	  dorsa	  are	  only	  observed	  in	  the	  THT.	  This suggests potentially unique formation conditions for each type of ridge. Here we explore the geometries, morphologies, relative ages, and potential formation mechanisms for each ridged terrain. South Polar Terrain Ridges: The SPT is dominated by numerous fractures and two types of ridges: double ridges ("tiger stripes"), and ridges of the ropey terrain (Fig. 1) [2,12-13]. Most of the previous work on the tiger stripes has explored their present-day activity but not the history of their development. Previous researchers have pointed out similarities between the tiger stripes and double ridges on Europa [14]; we expand on those studies to preform a more quantitative assessment. Double ridges on Europa have slopes of 323° [15], similar to those on Enceladus. Both types of double ridges have similar widths of 2-5 km, and similar heights of 100-200 m. However, the tiger stripes are less linear and uniform to their counterparts on Europa and display active jet activity. Additionally, the tiger stripes are the only observed double ridges on Enceladus making them much less common than Europa's. The ropey ridges in the SPT are largely located between the tiger stripes. Those ridges are curvilinear, relatively small (>10s m high and >10 km long), and display a short topographic wavelength (~800 m) [7,13]. Previous authors have attributed the creation of the ropey terrain to potential transpression due to spreading in the SPT [7,16] or contractional folding similar to terrestrial lava flows [13]. Instead, these could be regolith covered faults related to the deformation of the SPT.   Leading Hemisphere Terrain: The LHT is likely older than the SPT [2]; however, the region has still been heavily modified by recent tectonic activity [7]. In a preliminary map, [8] divided the leading hemisphere into 3 sub-terrains: northern and southern regions, surrounded by a curvilinear terrain. Each region contains different types of ridges. In the northern portion of the LHT are two ridge types, one smaller in amplitude and wavelength, and a second larger amplitude set (Fig. 2). Here we show that the smaller ridges have a spacing of 1-2 km, are ~10s m high, and 1-20 Fig	   1.	   Ropey	   terrain	   and	  tiger	   stripes.

The larger ridges are ~600 m high, 15-35 km long, show a lens-like shape in map view, and in crosssection are broad with flank slopes of 6-30°. The southern LHT is dominated by ridges that are similar in size and shape to the smaller ridges to the north; however, this region lacks a larger ridge set. The raised topography, sinuosity, and lack of lobate features strongly suggest the LHT ridges likely formed as a result of a compressional stress event. Others have made comparisons of the SPT to features observed in the LHT suggesting both regions are somewhat circular, contain a similar ropey terrain, and have ridges that appear to be potentially degraded tiger stripe-like features [17]. However, the LHT ridges can be approximately an order of magnitude taller and have steeper slope flanks than SPT ridges. Therefore, we suggest that the formation mechanisms for the SPT ridges are likely different from those in the LHT.  Trailing Hemisphere Terrain: The THT consists of diverse tectonic terrain types centered roughly along 285˚W [8]. The region is dominated by a striated plains unit which is composed of small amplitude (10s m), roughly N-S oriented ridges and troughs [4]. These ridges appear very similar to the "ropey terrain" of the SPT in their morphology and the geometry of their intersections with other ridges. However, they do not appear to be associated with any tiger-stripe-like structures. The other type of ridge in the THT stands up to ~1 km above their surroundings in a region of the trailing hemisphere that is slightly depressed, are several large ridges, or "dorsa." The dorsa are ~2.5 km wide, and in map view (Fig. 3) they can bifurcate in a branching manner with branches that intersect other dorsa at near right angles. They can reach lengths of ~50 km and heights of 600-800 m [7]. Our analysis shows that they have gentle sloping flanks of ~20° and appear rounded to trapezoidal in cross section. The dorsa appear to cut older ridges and troughs but also are cut by fractures associated with the Labtayt Sulci.  We suggest the dorsa could be the result of tectonic deformation, as opposed to a previously suggested cryovolcanic origin [7,18]. The dorsa are topographically high with respect to the immediately surrounding terrain, consistent with a contractional tectonic origin. The flanks of the dorsa are either smooth and fault scarp-like or covered by the older striated plains. Both of these flank types can be associated with tectonic deformation. Cross-sectional profiles are consistent with morphologies resulting from compression mechanisms [9]. Thrust blocks in cross-section commonly display a steeper slope on one side and a more gentle slope on the other, similar to observations at the dorsa.  Discussion: The tectonic history preserved in ridges can help determine if Enceladus experienced a near-global wide tectonic overturn [19], a polar wander event [20], regional downwarping [8], or other regional or global events. Different potential tectonic events would leave behind a different set of structures on local and global scales. Global tectonic overturn should result in similar structures found all over the surface that are similar in age. Polar wander would leave tensile-induced structures in the region leading the reorientation and compressionally induced structures on the trailing quadrant [21]. Regional downwarping would result in compressive structures confined to a localized region. Our analysis of the ridge terrains can help to constrain these possible tectonic histories.
