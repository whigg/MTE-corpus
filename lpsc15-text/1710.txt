THE EFFECT OF COMPOSITIONAL INHOMOGENEITY ON RADII OF HOT JUPITERS HiroyukiKurokawa1 and Shu-ichiro Inutsuka1, 1Dept. of Phys. Nagoya University, Furo-cho, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi464-8602, Japan (kurokawa@nagoya-u.jp).Introduction Masses and radii are fundamental quantities to constrain the compositions of exoplanets. However, observations have revealed that a significant number of close-in gaseous planets (hot Jupiters) haveanomalously large radii compared with the theoreticalmodel of planets composed of hydrogen and helium[1, 2]. Understanding of the mechanism of the anomalyis crucial for the estimate of their compositions, andhence, crucial for constraining their formation histories.Delayed contraction due to compositional inhomogeneity in their interiors has been proposed to explain theradius anomaly [3]. The compositional inhomogeneitypossibly inhibits large-scale-overturning convection andforms small-scale-layered convection which is separatedby diffusive interfaces [4, 5, 6]. Inefficient heat transportof the layered convection creates a super-adiabatic temperature gradient, which results in the delayed contraction. [3] assumed the presence of the layered convectionin the interiors of hot Jupiters, and demonstrated that itseffect is sufficient to reproduce the radius anomaly.However, the layer forms in a limited parameterrange described by the reciprocal of the density ratio,R�1� ���r��T (rT �rad) ; (1)where �T � �(@ ln �=@ lnT )p;�, �� �(@ ln �=@ ln�)p;T , rad � (@ lnT=@ ln p)S;�,rT � d lnT=d ln p, and r� � d ln�=d ln p. Thesystem is unstable for the overturning convection when0 < R�1� < 1. In this case, large scale convection wouldsmooth out the compositional inhomogeneity in a shorttime. The layered convection or turbulent diffusionoccurs when 1 < R�1� < (Pr + 1)=(Pr + �), where Pris the Prandtl number and � is the ratio of compositionalto heat diffusivities. The system is stable when R�1� < 0or (Pr + 1)=(Pr + �) < R�1� [4, 5, 6, 7]. Therefore,R� > 1 throughout the evolution history is requiredto create the observed radius anomaly by the delayedcontraction due to the compositional inhomogeneity.We perform an evolutionary calculation with a selfconsistent treatment of the convection regimes. Consequently, we show that the impact of the compositionalinhomogeneity is limited in the case of monotonic gradient of chemical composition and it is hard to explain theradius anomaly sorely by this mechanism in our setup.Model We calculate the thermal evolution of the interior structures of hot Jupiters with the Henyey method 0 1Enclosed mass [MJupiter]0Abundance of heavy elements, Z 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8inhomogeneous modelmetal-poor modelmetal-rich modelAge [yr]105Radius [RJupiter]1010106 107 108 109 (a) (b)1 Jupiter massequlibrium temperature 2000K 0.2  0.4  0.6  0.8  1 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2Figure 1: (a) Assumed heavy element profiles in the interiors. (b) Evolution of radii of hot Jupiters.[8]. The method solves the equations of the onedimensional interior structure in hydrostatic equilibrium.The convection regime is determined by the classification based on the density ratio R�1� [4, 5, 6, 7]. When0 < R�1� < 1, we use the heat transport model for theoverturning convection with the compositional gradient[9]. The transport model of the layered convection developed by [7] is adapted when 1 < R�1� < (Pr+1)=(Pr+�). When R�1� < 0 or (Pr + 1)=(Pr + �) < R�1� , heatis transported by radiative or conductive diffusion.We use the analytical model of the irradiated atmosphere [10] and the Rosseland mean opacity tabulated by[11]. In the deep interior (> 1 Mbar), the conductiveopacity calculated by [12] is used. The equation of state(EOS) of hydrogen and helium is taken from [13] andthe EOS of heavy elements (so-called “metals”) is represented by SESAME EOS for water [14].1710.pdf

The mean entropy of9:5 kB baryon�1 is assumed for the initial state [15].We calculate the evolution for three different models:the metal-poor model, metal-rich model, and inhomogeneous model (Fig. 1a). The metal-poor model has protosolar abundance (Z = 0:02, where Z is the abundanceof heavy elements) throughout the interior. The inhomogeneous model has r� = 1 within the inner 30 % bymass similar with the model of [3]. The metal-rich modelhas the same mass of heavy elements with the inhomogeneous model but assumes its homogeneous distribution.The compositional evolution is not considered.Results The evolution of the radii of planets is shownin Fig. 1b. They initially have large radii and contractwith time because of the cooling. The metal-poor modelhas a radius larger than 1 Jupiter radius because of thesmaller mass of heavy elements and the irradiation. Themetal-rich model has a smaller radius than the metalpoor model after � 10 Myr due to the larger amountof heavy elements. Because the compositional gradientdelays the contraction, the inhomogeneous model has alarger radius than the metal-rich model throughout theevolution. However, the effect of the increased mass ofheavy elements negates that of the compositional inhomogeneity on the radius anomaly. As a result, the compositional inhomogeneity cannot reproduce the observedlarge radius anomaly (up to � 2 Jupiter radius).The reason for the limited effect is the absence ofthe layered convection. The density ratio in the interior is shown in Fig. 2. The convection regime isthe overturning convection before 1Gyr. In the overturning convection regime, the efficient heat transportforces the temperature gradient to follow the neutrallystable state. Consequently, the super-adiabaticity is limited as rT � rad + ��=�Tr�. The layer forms onlywhen 1Gyr passes and the planet is already cooled, butthe temperature gradient in this regime never exceedsrT = rad + ��=�Tr�.Discussion Another difficulty to form the layered convection is the turbulent mixing of the compositional inhomogeneity by the overturning convection. The layeredconvection can preserve the inhomogeneity by the presence of the interfaces of limited diffusivity [3, 7], butthe overturning convection should smooth out the compositional structure. To form the layered convection,the compositional inhomogeneity should be formed after planet is cooled enough. Core erosion [16] is one ofthe possible mechanisms.Our result suggests that the simple layered convection cannot sorely explain the observed large radiusanomaly. As discussed in [1, 2], the solution could bea combination of various processes. Actually, if there isanother mechanism to delay the contraction, for instance,atmospheric enhanced opacities [17], it would help theformation of the layered convection by increasing thevalue of R�1� . Thus, it might be interesting to study thecombination of the layered convection with another process to explain the radius anomaly of hot Jupiters.References[1] Baraffe, I. et al. (2010) Rep. Prog.
