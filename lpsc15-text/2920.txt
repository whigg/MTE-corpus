Introduction: As the first-formed solids in the Solar System (SS), calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) can preserve evidence for the original isotopic heterogeneity of the solar nebula ([1] and references therein). Certain isotopic patterns are considered to reflect nucleosynthetic components [2]. In particular, isotopic anomalies in the vicinity of the Fe-peak are potentially highly diagnostic for constraining the nucleosynthetic components produced in an r-process environment (e.g., [3]). These anomalies may help elucidate how and when presolar components, and possibly late-injection supernova (SN; plural: SNe) materials, were homogenized in the early SS, providing constraints on SS formation models (e.g., [4, 5]). We report Ti and Cr isotopic data for six Allende CAIs to contribute to a growing, multi-element isotopic dataset that currently includes measurements of Mg, Sr, Zr, Mo, Te, Ba, Nd, Sm, Gd, Dy, and U on the same set of eleven CAIs [6-11].  Titanium has five stable isotopes (46Ti, 47Ti, 48Ti, 49Ti and 50Ti) while chromium has four stable isotopes (50Cr, 52Cr, 53Cr and 54Cr) that are synthesized by distinct processes during hydrostatic and explosive nucleosynthesis in stars [12]. Also, 53Cr is produced by radioactive decay of 53Mn (t1/2 = 3.7 Ma). Here we focus on the neutron-rich isotopes 50Ti and 54Cr, which are thought to be produced primarily by r-process nucleosynthesis in either: (1) Type Ia SNe of white dwarf stars near the Chandrasekhar mass that have neutronrich, low-entropy conditions (e.g., [12-14]), or (2) Type II SNe (which additionally provide O-rich environments for the condensation of refractory oxides that carry 54Cr [14-16]). Compared to younger SS objects, CAIs have positive r-process anomalies in nuclides with A < 140 (including 54Cr, [17-20]), and negative r-process anomalies in nuclides with A > 140 [7]. This implies that SS materials incorporated r-process nuclides from multiple stellar sources, and that SN material was injected into a reservoir that was unsampled by CAIs [7]. We explore how the Ti and Cr isotopic compositions of Allende CAIs can refine our understanding of nucleosynthetic components in the early SS.  Analytical Methods: Ti was purified by ionexchange chromatography following [21]. Ti isotopic data were acquired with a Thermo Finnigan Neptune MC-ICP-MS operated in high resolution mode (M/ΔM > 9000) at Arizona State University (ASU). The samples were introduced into the mass spectrometer using an Elemental Scientific Apex-Q with a 50 µL/min flow rate. A 2 ppm Ti solution yielded a 48Ti signal of ~16 V. We used a dynamic Faraday cup configuration to measure the intensities of 44Ca, 46Ti, 47Ti, 48Ti, and 49Ti before switching the magnet to measure 47Ti, 49Ti, 50Ti, 51V, and 52Cr. Signals for 44Ca, 51V, and 52Cr were used to correct for isobaric interferences. Ti isotopic data are reported relative to an in-house SPEX Ti standard after internal normalization to 49Ti/47Ti (=0.749766 [22]) using an exponential fractionation law. −0.4−0.20.00.20.4ε53Cr−0.4−0.20.00.20.40.60.81.0ε54CrNBS 979AllendeDTSSPEX CrNBS 979AllendeDTSSPEX Cr  Cr was purified by an ion-exchange chromatography procedure modified from [23]. Cr isotopic data were acquired with the Neptune at ASU using an ApexQ and 50 µL/min nebulizer. An 800 ppb Cr solution resulted in a 52Cr signal of ~30 V. Measurements were done in high resolution mode to avoid polyatomic interferences [24]. The intensities of 50Cr, 52Cr, 53Cr, and 54Cr were measured, along with 49Ti, 51V, and 56Fe to monitor and correct for isobaric interferences.

law. Our emperical external reproducibility is ±0.04 (2SD) for ε53Cr and ±0.08 (2SD) for ε54Cr from measurements of terrestrial synthetic Cr and whole-rock standards (Fig. 1), similar to theoretical limits of ±0.05 and ±0.10, respectively. Initial Results: We have measured the Ti and Cr isotopic compositions of 6 of the 11 Allende CAIs studied by [6-11], including CAIs 165, 166, 167, 168, 173, and 175. Values for ε53Cr range from -0.71 to 0.11, and ε54Cr ranges from 3.42 to 5.89 (blue symbols in Fig. 2). Some of the variation in ε53Cr is due to the presence of radiogenic 53Cr from the decay of 53Mn, so we have subtracted an estimated radiogenic 53Cr component using the initial SS 53Mn/55Mn value of (6.28 ± 0.66) × 10-6 [26] and the 55Mn/52Cr ratios measured in these samples (red symbols in Fig. 2). Values for ε50Ti range from 8.55 to 9.59 (Fig. 3).   Discussion: The Cr isotopic data presented here and reported previously for Allende CAIs [17-19, 26], demonstrate variations in ε53Cr and ε54Cr that significantly exceed the precision of the measurements, while ε50Ti values show a much more restricted range (Figs. 2 and 3). While it is possible that the observed variation in ε54Cr reflects CAI formation in an inhomogeneous reservoir, we cannot rule out other potential causes (especially since ε50Ti does not vary significantly). Interestingly, other stable isotope systems measured for this sample set (Sr, Zr, Mo, Ba, Nd, Sm, Gd, Dy) indicate the CAI reservoir was nearly homogeneous (within the precision of the analyses) [6-11]. Note that the concentration ratio [Cr]matrix/[Cr]CAI is ~10 (using CI chrondrites as a proxy for CAI-free matrix, [5]) for these samples, while other elements (e.g., Ti, Sr, Mo, Nd, Sm, Gd, Dy) tend to have much smaller matrix/CAI concentration ratios (e.g., 0.6–1). It is plausible that the variation that we observe in ε54Cr could be due to addition of Cr to the CAIs from their host matrix (either by diffusion exchange with, or physical addition of, the matrix). A simple two-component mixture model of these two materials (Fig. 3) is consistent with this possibility, and implies that up to ~10% of the Cr in our samples could have originated from the meteorite matrix. If this is the case, then the highest ε54Cr values in CAIs may only constrain the minimum ε54Cr composition of the reservoir from which CAIs formed. This possibility should be considered when relating ε54Cr excesses to potential nucleosynthetic components in the SS.   References: [1] MacPherson (2014), Treatise in Geochemsitry (2nd Ed.), p. 139.
