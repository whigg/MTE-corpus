Introduction:  The global FeO maps of the Moon have been produced using visible and near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (VNIR) [1-4] and gamma ray spectroscopy [5]. There is no high resolution global FeO abundances map based on mid-infrared bands until now. The FeO map from mid-infrared data could provide a good contrast with those products from other data. A better calculated result of iron contents will provide better understanding of compositions of lunar surface. Mid-infrared remote sensing has a long history in the field of lunar and planetary science, and plays an important role in the  classification and determination lunar minerals and element content [6]. Diviner data and a series of data products have been published on the Geosciences Node of NASA's Planetary Data System [7], which provides a good opportunity to study FeO content. The high correlation between Christiansen Feature (CF) wavelength and FeO abundances has the potential to provide an independent tool to derive FeO abundance [8]. The FeO abundances at serveral lunar pyroclastic deposits (LPDs) have been estimated by Allen based on CF [8]. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether high correlation exit at global scale and to produce global FeO map of the Moon using the mid-infrared remote sensing technology. Data:  Diviner, which is on board NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), is a multi-channel radiometer that maps the reflected solar radiation and emitted thermal radiation of lunar surface at a resolution of ~200m/pixel at lunar equator [9]. Channels 3-5 of Diviner have relatively narrow pass-bands near 8μm and sufficient signal-to-noise ratio to allow accurate spectral location of the emissivity maximum, which can characterize the CF for compositional information of silicates [10].  Methods:  Christiansen Feature. CF occurs at the wavelength near 8 μm just shorter than position of fundamental frequency vibration where the absorption is relatively weak. In this area, the index of refraction of mineral grain changes quickly and is comparable to the surrounding medium, resulting in backscatter minimum. Absorption and backscatter minimum hence result in the emission maximum. CF values were demonstrated to be sensitive to lunar minerals [6] and also to correlate to the major elements composing minerals. CF values shift to longer wavelength with increase in mafic content of the silicate minerals. Estimating FeO abundances. The FeO contents of returned soils [2, 11] and feldspathic lunar meteorites [12] are used as ground truth and correlated with the CF value of the landing site and lunar farside highland extracted from Diviner CF data. Staring with the latitude and longitude of each station, The CF values of 26 sampling stations from CF data were manually extracted by comparison with published traverse maps. A lunar farside highland (LFH) sample point was brought in order to break the limitation of all sample points being from nearside of lunar and the lack of plagioclase sample. The FeO abundance of LFH point adopts the average measurement of lunar highland meteorite samples. By contrasting FeO abundance and CF value of each points, a good correlation was established in this study. The linear fitting was proved to be the best approach to estimating FeO abundances (Fig. 1).  Fig. 1. The scatter plot of FeO abundances and CF.  Fig. 2. The histogram of FeO abundance for the Moon (±60°) derived from Diviner.   Results and Discussion:  The linear fitting result was shown in Fig. 1. The regression line is FeO = 65.47 × CF - 527.938. The correlation index is up to 0.89, which proves the high correlation between CF wavelength and FeO abundances. The statistical histogram in Fig. 2 shows the bimodal distribution, which corresponds to lunar highland and mare basalts. The first peak represents highland area and the other represents mare area. The convexity of second peak appears weak correspond to the less coverage of mare basalts comparing with highlands. The shape of the histogram of FeO derived from Diviner CF data is similar to those results from Clementine and IIM data [3, 5]. According to the regression equation, FeO abundance map of the Moon was produced using Diviner CF data between 60°N to 60°S (Fig. 3). The highland and mare are separately clearly seen in Fig. 3. The new FeO map shows that northwest Imbrium, south Procellarum, Mare Tranquillitatis and Fecunditatis (maximum FeO is 24.3 wt.%, 24.2 wt.%, 24.2 wt.%, 24.0 wt.% correspondingly) have relatively higher mafic contents. The average FeO abundance of Tsiolkovskii is 15.3 wt.%, closed to those mares on lunar nearside.  Table 1: The comparison with the results of Clementine, LP-GRS, and IIM data.

The average FeO abundances of the moon (±60°) is 8.2 wt.% in this study; the highland average is 4.7 wt.%; the modal abundance is 5.4 wt.%; and the mare mode is 15.7 wt.%. The maturity is defined as the optical properties of surface having been changed in systematic ways for space-weathering effect during the long exposure time [14], such as spectral darkening, reddening and subdued absorption bands [14]. The CF values shift to longer wavelengths with increasing maturity. In future work, we will build a modal (by comparison CF wavelength between nearest maturity soil and fresh soil at little crater ) to decrease the effect of maturity. Specific analysis using CF data at microcosmic area may be difficult for striping noise, but it is precise enough to study at large sacle.  Summary: This study obtained the high correlation between CF wavelength and FeO abundances at global sacle. New map of FeO abundances was produced using mid-infrared bands.  The results were feasible and enriched the iron study in mid-infrared bands. References: [1] Lucey P. G. et al. (1995) Science, 268, 1150-1153. [2] Lucey P. G. et al.
