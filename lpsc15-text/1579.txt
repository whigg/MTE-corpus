The method is based on the study of the vertical structure of cloud layers in the atmospheres of the giant planets for determination of the extent of deviation  them from a homogeneous condition (see, for example, [5,6,7,8,12,13]). The analysis is based here on determining the spectral values of eff  for build with them a dependence on the pressure of the aerosol scattering component  iaeff P . According to [1,10,16], the values eff are calculated on the values of the single scattering albedo   of the inspected environment. Values of  are determined by comparing the values of albedo )(A  or reflectivity ),,( 0  of the disk's parts with the model values, they are calculated for different values of  in case of  homogeneous gas-aerosol layer with semi-infinite optical thickness (where  ,,0  - cosines of the angles of incidence and reflection of light and the phase angle of the planet, respectively). With using  the values of eff  and   , we calculate:  - the sum scattering eff  seff and the sum absorption   eff1   effeffexteff components of eff (where eff - methane absorption component);  - the quantity of the absorbing gas in the line of sight                ,/]1[ eff  kNL eff  (1) where k  - monochromatic absorption coefficients of methane.  With taken the values of NL  we determine a gas scattering components                   ,/  ggeff NL  (2) atmospheric pressure on the studied levels                   ''24/ 234RgP geff  (3) (where   g  - gas volume scattering coefficient,   relative concentration of methane, R  - universal gas constant, g  - acceleration of gravity, '  - specific refraction,   '  - molecular weight of the atmosphere,  - Boltzmann constant) and aerosol scattering components                 .,,, iigeffiiseffiiaeff PPP    (4) Next we construct a graph of values  iiaeff P, , where they are reduce to one wavelength (for example, at   887.2 nm) and performed their analysis.  For determination of values  eff  in short (blue) and long (red) wavelength wings of methane's absorption band separately we make the next steps: 1. Calculations of values  iiaeff P,  are performed by the expressions (1) - (4) for a case .0 eff  As a result, due to neglect of aerosol absorption, the received dependence initially have an increase in values with increasing pressure, but after a certain level of pressure the values are changed on their decrease.  2. In expression (1) is chosen a such value of  eff , in which for the wavelength ' , corresponding to the smallest value of '', iaeff P , the newly obtained value of  "', iaeff P  is equal to the highest value of aeff  in the current wing of absorption band; 3. The spectral values of  ieff   will be calculated by the expression (neglecting the spectral dependence of the aerosol single scattering albedo a  inside the wing of the absorption band)                 ,]/[)( '' iaeffaeffeffieff     (5) where  iaeff   - the values which was been calculated from the previous iteration. Then, repeating of the calculation by the expressions (1) - (4), specifies the dependence of  iiaeff P, . 4. Steps 2-3 are repeated, until the disappearance of the effect of reducing for values of aeff  with increasing of atmospheric pressure.  Verification of the proposed method was carried out by us on the measurements of North Equatorial Band NEB of Jupiter [14] with the use of special software codes [11,12,13]. The following parameters for the simulated gas-aerosol environment was taken: -  the value of the real part of the refractive index rn 1.36 and the parameters of the modified gamma-function of particle size distribution effr  0.4 m  and effv  0.35, obtained from the analysis of polarization observations of the equatorial region of Jupiter in the model of spherical particles [2,3,4]; - the relative concentration of methane   0,0021 [15]; - the relative concentration of the main components of the planet's atmosphere gases hydrogen and helium were taken respectively 0.85 and 0.15; - the monochromatic absorption coefficients of methane k , which are correspond to the temperature profile of the Jovian atmosphere, they are taken from [9]. The values of aerosol single scattering albedo  ]/[ aeffeffaeffa    were calculated for the wavelength of .'Then they were compared with the same values of Miea  calculated by the theory of Lorentz-Mie for the simulated environment, which includes a polydisperse homogeneous spheres, for a different values of the imaginary part of the 1579.pdf
