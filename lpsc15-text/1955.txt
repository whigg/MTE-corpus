Introduction:  The MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft entered orbit about Mercury in March 2011 and is carrying out a comprehensive mapping of the planet. Measurements of Mercury’s topography have been made with laser altimetry [1,2], stereo imaging [3,4], limb profiling [5,6], and radio occultation [7].  In this paper, we use a combination of stereo photogrammetry and laser altimetry to produce a high-resolution gridded topographic model of Mercury’s northern hemisphere.  Accurate positioning of the model in a Mercury-fixed frame required updates to Mercury rotation parameters, reported separately [9,10]. Data:  The Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS) has acquired more than 200,000 images during more than three years of observations.  Those images provide multiple coverage for most areas on Mercury at a resolution better than 250 m/px. Altimetry data from the Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA) are constrained to the northern hemisphere, as a result of MESSENGER’s highly eccentric orbit and high northern periapsis [2], but MLA measurements are precisely referenced to the planet’s center of mass. In this study, we use data from three years of laser altimetry (2325 orbit tracks). Method:  We computed digital terrain models (DTMs) from stereo images following established procedures [3,4,8] that involve image correlation and least-squares block adjustment techniques.  Among the various possible combinations of stereo images, we produced 165 individual small models, covering approximately 50% of the planet’s northern hemisphere. Although the DTMs are internally rigid, we must correct for offsets and tilts with respect to the Mercury reference frame.  This step is accomplished by co-registering the DTMs to laser altimeter tracks.   As the individual laser altimeter tracks were taken at different times throughout the mission, accurate rotation parameters for Mercury are critical. Hence, we have carried out a joint inversion, in which we simultaneously solved for Mercury rotation parameters (orientation of the rotation axis, rotation rate, and the libration function) as well as the static transformation parameters for each of the 165 DTMs, i.e., offset, rotation angles, and scaling factors [9,10]. Results: The derived DTM covers approximately 50% of the northern hemisphere and has a grid spacing of 222 m.  Although the sampling of the DTM is comparable to MLA-derived models in the polar areas, the DTMs greatly improve on the sampling of the MLA model near the equator, where MLA tracks have a spacing of more than 50 km.  With the DTMs tied to MLA data, root mean square elevation differences for most areas are smaller than 50 m.  As the Mercury’s rotation and orbit are coupled through a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance, the dynamically based prime meridian is tied to the planet’s orbit geometry. That is, the prime dynamical meridian of the model points toward the Sun at alternating perihelion passes.  This meridian is offset from the current prime meridian as set by the International Astronomical Union by approximately 8.8 km at the equator. Other aspects of Mercury’s rotation parameters derived from the joint solution are reported separately [9,10].  References:  [1] Zuber, M.T. et al.
