Effusive Lunar Domes Near Aristoteles N, Plana G and Plana F: Morphometry and Mode of formation. P. Lazzarotti.1 and R. Lena2 - Geologic Lunar Research (GLR) Group. 1Via Pernice 71, 54100 Massa, Italy; paolo@lazzarottihires.com; 2Via Cartesio 144, sc. D, 00137 Rome, Italy; r.lena@sanita.it;.        Introduction: Lunar mare domes are smooth low features with gentle convex upward profiles. In this contribution we provide an analysis of three effusive domes located in the eastern lunar regions near crater Aristoteles N, Plana G and Plana F, which have previously not been examined in detail. The first examined dome is located at longitude 25.44º E and latitude 52.24º N with a base diameter of 6.0 km (Fig. 1). It is a previously unreported dome, which we named Aristoteles 1 (Aris1). Another dome, bisected by Rimae Daniell, located at 24.86° E and 38.45° N and having a diameter of 9 km, has been termed Plana G1 (P1). It displays three protrusions which probably are pre-existing non-volcanic hills. The third examined dome is situated to the north of P1 and to the east of Plana F, at longitude 39.32° E and latitude 13.50° N, and has a diameter of 7 km (Fig. 2, dome termed P2).       Spectral properties: For both domes, Clementine  UVVIS spectral data indicate a R415/R750 ratio of about  0.56-0.57 indicating basalts of low TiO2 content and furthermore reveal a 750 nm reflectance of R750 = 0.13 for P1-P2 and 0.16 for Aris1, and a weak mafic absorption for two domes in Lacus Somniorum with R950/R750 = 1.06, suggesting a high soil maturity. The dome Aris1 has a lower R950/R750 ratio of 1.01 (Fig. 3).   Fig. 1. Aristoteles 1 dome marked with arrows.

Morphometric dome properties: Based on the telescopic CCD images we obtained a DEM of the examined domes by applying the combined photoclinometry and shape from shading method described in [1-3].

The flank slopes, diameters, heights, and edifice volumes of these domes were extracted from the DEMs (Table 1). The dome Aris1 belongs to class B2, while the domes P1 and P2 are of subclass C2, as introduced in [1, 3]. ACT-REACT Quick Map tool 1007.pdf

was used to access to the GLD100 dataset [4], allowing to obtain the cross-sectional profiles and the corresponding 3D view (Fig. 5), in agreement with the results obtained with photoclinometry and sfs applied to telescopic image. dome η [Pa s] E [m3 s-1] Te [years] U  [m s-1] W [m] L [km] Aris1 1.5 x 105 75 0.6 2.0 x 10-5 20 90 P1 3.0 x 106 75 2.5 5.9 x 10-6 65 180 P2 1.5 x 106 61 1.4 6.8 x 10-6 60 180 Table 2: Rheologic properties and dike geometries inferred for the examined domes.      Rheologic properties: The rheologic model developed in [5], which depends on the morphometric dome properties, yields estimates of the lava viscosity η, the effusion rate E, and the duration T of the effusion process for a monogenetic lava dome. Using the morphometric values listed in Table 1, we obtained lava viscosities between 8.8 x 104 and 3.0 x 106 Pa s, effusion rates between 60 and 75 m3 s-1, and durations of the effusion process between 0.6 and 2.5 years (Table 2). Furthermore, we estimated the magma rise speed U and the dike geometry (width W and length L) according to the model developed in [6]. We found that the magma ascended at speeds between 2.0 x 10- 5 and 6.8 x 10-6 m s-1 through dikes of widths between about 20 and 65 m (Table 2). The dome Aris1 is a typical representative of rheologic group R1 as defined in [1], characterised by lava viscosities of 104-106 Pa s, magma rise speeds U of 10-5-10-3 m s-1, dike widths W around 10-20 m, and dike lengths L between about 30 and 150 km. Rheologic group R2 is characterised by low lava viscosities between 102 and 104 Pa s, fast magma ascent (U > 10-3 m s-1), narrow (W = 1-4 m) and short (L = 7-20 km) feeder dikes. The third group, R3, is made up of domes which formed from highly viscous lavas of 106-108 Pa s, ascending at very low speeds of 10-6-10-5 m s-1 through broad dikes of several tens to 200 m width and 100-200 km length. The domes P1 and P2 are typical representatives of rheologic group R3. Hence, for three examined domes the magma reservoirs are located well below the lunar crust regarding the thicknesses of the total crust of about 55 km [7].     References: [1] Wöhler et al.
