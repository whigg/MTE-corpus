INFRARED AND RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY OF BIOSIGNATURE PRESERVATION IN TERRESTRIAL CLAY-RICH SEDIMENTS: IMPLICATIONS FOR MARTIAN ASTROBIOLOGICAL EXPLORATION. C. Che1, S. Parvez1, and T. D. Glotch1, 1Department of Geosciences, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY11794 (Email: congcong.che@stonybrook.edu) Introduction:  Over the past few decades, observations performed by various orbiters and rovers have substantially increased our understanding of Mars and its climatic history. The physical and chemical features of the Martian atmosphere, surface, and subsurface have been systematically studied and well documented [e.g., 1-2]. However, the potential of formation and preservation of biosignatures on Mars is relatively unconstrained. Extensive studies of the Martian surface suggest that ancient Mars may have been warmer and wetter than the present, and the search for past habitable environments is a major focus of the Mars Exploration Program. Clay minerals have been observed to be abundant and varied on Mars and most of them are associated with ancient Noachian terrains [e.g., 3-4]. It has been suggested that on Earth, clays are considered very important for habitability and organic preservation [e.g., 5-6]. Studies of Earth’s carbon budget indicates ~68% of organics are stored in clays and shales of Earth’s crust [7].  Clays have high surface areas and as a result, organic carbon content in clay-rich rocks is relatively high due to adsorption processes [e.g., 6, 8]. It also has been suggested that if organics and clays form synchronously, the preservation of biosignatures may be more resistant to weathering processes, due to the chemical equilibration between organics and sedimentary rocks [e.g., 6, 9]. Previous studies suggested that long-term preservation of microbial biosignatures on Mars may occur in rapid burial processes in finegrained clay-rich sediments, as anaerobic conditions due to quickly reduced porosity and permeability may slow the degradation of organics [e.g., 5-6]. Geologic analysis of the clay mineral deposits near Mawrth Vallis indicates that they are early-to-mid Noachian in age and were likely deposited in a sedimentary environment [10]. The clay-bearing deposits are part of a kilometer-scale sequence of layered rocks (>600 m) that contain interbedded, buried craters. If life ever existed on Mars, its record is likely to be found in sedimentary rocks that achieved kilometerscale thicknesses and are rich in clay minerals. Because organics may be preserved and detectable in Martian clay deposits, it is important to build a spectral database of biosignatures preserved in clay-rich samples. Here we examine organic matter stored in terrestrial clay-rich sediments, to gain insights into the potential formation or preservation conditions of biosignatures and aid the search for biosignatures on Mars. Due to the age of any putative Martian life, the preservation of potential organisms may have been affected by extensive alteration processes, of which thermal alteration due to massive impacts and volcanism are primary examples. In this work, we also study of thermal stability of the organic matrix preserved in clay samples using IR and Raman spectroscopy.       Samples and Methods: For this work, a range of organic-rich clay-bearing samples, including oil shales, red, grey, and black shales were selected for analysis.  Sample analysis methods include visible and near infrared (VNIR) reflectance, attenuated total reflectance (ATR), thermal infrared (TIR) emissivity, and Raman spectroscopies. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microprobe (SEM) measurements will also be conducted in order to clarify the mineralogy of each sample. Of these measurements, VNIR reflectance, TIR emissivity and Raman spectral results can be used in future Mars data analysis studies.  Preliminary Results: Determination of total organic carbon (TOC) TOC analyses were conducted on powdered bulk samples using the loss on ignition method [11]. Generally, oil shales contain more organic carbon than grey and red shales [Table 1]. Table 1.

For oil shale sample with higher TOC value, we see evidence for organics in two peaks at ~2850 and ~2950 cm-1 that are assigned to aliphatic C-H stretching modes [12].

all, the spectral features are dominated by features of clay minerals [13].  Figure 1. Example ATR spectra of samples and their heated products disussed in this study.    Figure 2. Example Near IR reflectance spectra of samples and their heated products disussed  in this study. Raman spectra Figure 3 shows Raman spectra (532 nm excitation, wavenumber range 600-2000 cm-1) of oil shales. Carbon was identified by characteristic disordered (D) band at ~1350 cm-1 and ordered (G) band at ~1610 cm-1, that were also observed in the Raman spectra of MMC/graphitic carbon within carbonate globules of ALH 84001 samples [14].      Figure 3. Raman spectra of selected shale samples.   Effects of thermal alteration on IR spectra of selected sample In Figure 4, C-H stretching features near 2900 cm-1 disappear at ~150 °C. C=O stretching features near 1700-1800 cm-1 show distinct changes as heating. Figure 4. ATR spectra of oil shale 3 heated to various temperatures.  Discussion and Future work: The preliminary results indicate spectroscopy is a powerful tool for detection of organic features, and organic feature detection with spectroscopy may be dependent on TOC level. In the NIR spectral range, known organic features are usually present near 3.5 μm and additional measurements are ongoing to identify these features. Furthermore, detection of organic features on Mars may be difficult due to the consequences of impacts, such as extremely high temperatures.  References: [1] Christensen et al.
