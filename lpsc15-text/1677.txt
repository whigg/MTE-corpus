THE DEPTH-DIAMETER RELATIONSHIP FOR LARGE LUNAR IMPACT BASINS AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR MARE BASALT THICKNESS Steven D. Dibb1 and Walter S.

Past work has shown that these basins have a characteristic depth (d) versus diameter (D) ratio that varies with size [1]. Structures with anomalously low d/D ratios have experienced some type of post-impact degradation or modification. Williams and Zuber previously studied d/D ratios for lunar basins using low-resolution Clementine altimetry [2]. High resolution (~300 meters/pixel horizontal resolution and 15 meters vertical resolution) Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter topography data [3, 4] now permit much more detailed studies of large lunar impact structures. Kalynn et al. studied complex craters up to 167 kilometers in diameter [5]. Baker et al. studied 11 craters and lunar impact basins between 137 and 492 kilometers in diameter [6]. We report results for 29 lunar basins from 300 to 2200 kilometers in diameter, constituting a nearcomplete data set of basins in this size-range. The deepest basins in this database define a near-pristine d/D relationship that can now serve as a constraint on impact basin formation models. Our results also quantify the amount of post-impact modification experienced by some of these basins by impact bombardment, viscous relaxation, and mare basalt flooding. Method: Using the basin centers and diameters provided by Head et al. [7], orthographic map sections for each structure were extracted from the GLD100 basemap [4] and studied in ArcMap. Profiles were drawn overlapping the dominant topographic rim of each basin at every radial degree. Because of the highly overprinted nature of these basins, many of the rimcrest profiles had to be discarded, with most basins ending up with somewhere between 100-160 remaining profiles. Dozens of profiles were then drawn over the intact topographic basin floor. ArcMap allowed determination of elevation values every 100 meters along these profile. The difference between the median minimum value for the floor profiles and the median maximum value for the rim profiles was found, which represents the total depth of the basin.  We tested this procedure on a set of 8 complex craters between 20 and 167 kilometers in diameter. We compared our results with results from Kalynn et al. [5]. In all cases, our depth uncertainties are similar to those in [5] and the depth measurements overlap within the one-sigma uncertainties, validating both our measurement technique and uncertainty estimates.  We compiled a list of 29 impact basins with diameters 300 kilometers across and larger using previous catalogues [7, 8, 9]. Our list includes all of the basins defined as “definite” by Wilhelms, including the South-Pole Aitken basin, the largest structure on the moon. Our list excludes the highly degraded basins Planck, Keeler-Heaviside, Australe, FitzgeraldJackson, and Fecunditatis [9].  Uncertainties in our derived depths are due mainly to the geologic variability in rim heights with location around the basin. Naturally, basins of pre-Nectarian age (older than ~3.92 billion years) have had a substantial amount of degradation. For the young, relatively pristine basins Orientale and Schrodinger, an analysis was conducted about the accuracy of basin depth values derived from numerically reduced sets of profiles. The initial set contained 72 profiles, each separated by 5 degrees. We then constructed 9 subsets from these observations, each containing between 18 and 36 profiles. Repeating our procedure on these subsets, this sampling study showed that the median basin depth changes by at most 400 meters. Five of our basins had been previously measured by Baker et al., with an average difference of ~400 meters between the two data sets [6]. We therefore adopt 400 meters as the 2σ uncertainty for our basin depths. Results: After completing the analysis for each basin, a log-log plot of depth versus diameter was produced (Figure 1) and a power law was fit to the 9 deepest basins. Although several of these basins contain some post-impact mare volcanism, geologic mapping suggest that it is typically less than 200-300 meters in those basins [e.g. 10]. Thus we adopt this power law as appropriate for near-pristine large lunar impact basins. Discussion: Simple and complex craters on the Moon have a pronounced change in their depthdiameter relationship near a diameter of 15 kilometers, which reflects a major transition in the fundamental physical processes that create impact structures [1]. Fresh complex craters formed in the highlands, with diameters less than 167 kilometers, exhibit depths proportional to (diameter)0.25  [5]. Our results indicate that impact basins over 300 kilometers in diameter have a characteristic depth proportional to (diameter)0.21 . Given the uncertainty in each of our measured depths 1677.pdf

as well as the scatter about the best-fit power law, we cannot reliably distinguish our power-law for basins from the power-law for complex craters. Thus, it is possible that there are no more fundamental transitions in the physical processes associated with crater formation as one progresses from complex craters to peak-ring basins to multi-ring basins on the Moon. However, the South Pole-Aitken basin is substantially deeper than the power law extrapolated from smaller basins. As previously stated, young craters superimposed on older basins tend to degrade the topography of the underlying basin. Examples in our dataset include Poincaré  and Lorentz basins, as well as many others. Older basins formed at a time of higher thermal gradient in the target rock may have their topography partially relaxed by viscous flow in the crust [11]. Nubium possibly exhibits viscous relaxation, and future study should include this consideration for Keeler-Heaviside and Australe. Both of these processes should be most important for old impact basins, which is consistent with the large number of pre-Nectarian basins in our study, represented by green triangles in Figure 1. Finally, inferences can be made about the thickness of basalt in basins that feature visible surface mare emplacements. These basins are marked on Figure 1 with a black outline. By comparing the measured depth with the expected (power law) depth, we can estimate the depth of post-basin-formation mare basalt fill [2]. The basalt fill is up to 5 km thick (in Imbrium), and our estimates (Table 1) differ by an average of about 0.7 km relative to those made with Clementine LIDAR data [2]. In fact, the basins of Nectarian age with the highest depth deficit feature basalt fill on the surface, a strong indication that this is the primary shallowing process.    Table 1. Comparison of depth-deficits with Williams and Zuber. The second column indicates the difference between measured basin depth and the power-law expected value, or ‘depth deficit’. The third column is the difference between our depth deficit and the inferred mare fill found by Williams and Zuber. Finally, the percent difference between our depth deficit and their mare fill is represented in the fourth column [2].  References: [1] R. J. Pike (1974) Geophysical Research Letters, 1, 291-294.
