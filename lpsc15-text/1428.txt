Introduction:  Formation of large, young gypsum deposits within the Olympia Planum region (Figure 1) has been an unsolved riddle since its discovery [1]. It was proposed that gypsum was formed by precipitation of water emanating from polar layered deposits [2]. However, it is improbable that a large amount of bulk water could exist under current Martian low atmospheric pressure sufficiently long to form the observed deposits [3]. One of the proposed solutions to this problem is that gypsum is formed due to weathering in the ice [3, 4, 5, 6]. However none of the previous papers have described this process in detail, tested whether it is possible under current Martian conditions, and defined the environmental properties required for this process to occur.    Figure 1. Location of steep, south facing slopes within North Polar Cap (NPC), where ice melting due to radiant heating of dust laying on its surface may be taking place.  Slope inclination based on MOLA data with spatial resolution of 463 meters, dune fields with detected signal of gypsum (based on [7]); grey scale MOLA elevation in the background.  The aim of this paper is to determine if solar irradiation available currently at the NPC is sufficient to heat a basaltic dust grain enough to melt a thin layer of glacial ice located directly beneath it. The numerical model used here is based on a one dimensional, timedependent equation of heat transfer [8]. The model is applicable for grains exposed on the south-facing side of the NPC spiral troughs (Figure 1), during the warmest days of the year (with average or low amount of dust in the atmosphere), when surface temperature reaches 215 K and solar radiation delivers >260 W m-2 (on the inclined surface). Results:  Our calculations show that during the warmest days of summer, solar irradiation (S) is sufficient to melt pure water-ice located below a dark dust particle lying on the equatorial-facing slopes of the Martian NPC. Melting occurs over a wide range of values S (solar radiation), e (emissivity for infrared of the dust grain), a (albedo of the dust grain) and k (coefficient of thermal conductivity of porous-dusty firn) which shows that this phenomenon is relatively common (albeit localized).  Within the most plausible range of e (0.8-0.9), the minimum, S required for melting of ice is between 294 W m-2 and 330 W m-2 respectively. The duration of melting increases with increasing irradiation: from 47 minutes for S = 295 W m-2 up to 375 minutes for S = 400 W m-2 (values given for e = 0.8). At the same time, the duration of melting decreases with increasing e. For example, for the same S = 325 W m-2, the duration of melting increases from 95 minutes for e = 0.87, through 230 minutes for e = 0.8, up to 320 minutes for e = 0.72. Thermal conductivity influences the depth of melting, but not the duration of melting (Figure 2).   Figure 2. Modelled depth and duration of melting for the range of thermal conductivities used in this study for the same value of S = 350 W m-2 and e = 0.87. Depth of melting increases with thermal conductivity, while the duration of melting does not change. 1428.pdf

  Ephemeral liquid water stability:  Once formed by melting, liquid water may persist for an amount of time potentially sufficient to partially dissolve dust grains, comparable to the situation within Antarctic meteorites [9]. Liquid water can be metastable at the NPC because pressure during the summer season is ~760-650 Pa (Mars Climate Database [10]) which is above the triple point of water. The rate of liquid water evaporation under average Martian conditions was experimentally determined by [11] to be 0.1-0.2 g cm-2 hr-1 for water at 0-5°C and atmospheric pressure of 666 Pa from a free surface of water with semi-static atmosphere. This means that, in the case of evaporation from a free surface of water, ice has to melt with a rate of ~1 mm/hour in order to balance the evaporation rate. This requirement is fulfilled in most cases that we have considered, except the ones with the highest thermal conductivity. However, in the scenario modelled here, the evaporation would be suppressed by a dust grain present above the liquid water pool and thus limiting the diffusion of vapor [11, 12], allowing liquid water to persist metastably even if the rate of melting is lower than the measured evaporation rate. On the other hand, this evaporation rate would be higher if wind efficiently mixes the atmosphere directly above the surface, decreasing the water vapor pressure, in a manner similar to the situation in Antarctica [9]. This suggests that even though melting on the NPC depends mostly on the solar irradiation and the properties of a particular dust grain, the duration of the melt on the surface depends mostly on the thermal conductivity of porousdusty firn and wind speed at the surface.  Significance: Our research shows that on the Martian NPC there can be a sufficient amount of transient, metastable liquid water for evaporites such as gypsum to form, as was hypothesized by [3, 4, 5, 6].  Dusty ice is exposed in equator-facing slopes of the Mars’ spiral troughs by katabatic wind erosion [7]. Dust grains exposed at the surface or near the surface are radiantly heated which melts the adhering ice, as shown by our study. Some of this water vaporizes due to low atmospheric pressure, but some of it is preserved under the dust particle or ice. This water reacts with the dust grain, dissolving species adhering to the grain and the grain itself, and forming secondary minerals including evaporites like gypsum attached to the weathered dust grain. As seen at the terrestrial meteorites collected over the entire Antarctic ice sheet [13, 14, 15] even small amounts of liquid water, present once or twice a season, are sufficient to produce detectable amounts of secondary minerals within a few decades or less [16], even on meteorites that have not been exposed at the surface [17]. Bulk water surrounding dust grains near the surface and precipitating evaporitic minerals makes the NPC one of the most potentially habitable environments on Mars. This kind of environment is theoretically sufficient to sustain complex microbial communities [18, 19, 20] similar to the ones in the cryoconite holes at Antarctica [21].
