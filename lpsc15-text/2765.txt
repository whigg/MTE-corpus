Introduction: One of the most striking features of the Moon is the dichotomy between the farside highlands and nearside lowlands. In spite NASA’s Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) [1]  and Gravity and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) [2], which  provide an unprecedented view of the lunar surface and subsurface, explanation of this dichotomy remains elusive. Although early tidal heating, frozen tidal-rotational bulges [3], and polar wander [4] can explain the Moon’s degree-two topography, they do not explain the nearside farside dichotomy or more precisely the Moon’s offset of the center of figure and the center of mass by ~2 km [5,1]. Alternatively, the late accretion of a companion moon has been suggested [6], but has been shown unlikely by GRAIL [2]. We suggest that the massive impact that formed the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin also created the farside highlands, and offers a potentially superior hypothesis since we know the SPA impact occurred.  The South Pole-Aitkin basin, with a 2500 km diameter, is the oldest and largest observable lunar impact structure. The basin's elliptical shape is indicative of an oblique impact (30° to 60°) by an asteroid greater than 300 km in diameter traveling from South to North [7]. The impact of a 300 km to 460 km diameter impactor ejects sufficient material to blanket the lunar farside in several kilometers of crustal material. This loading of ejecta may partially or completely explain the Moon’s center of figure offset and larger crustal thickness of the lunar farside highlands [8]. In addition to ejection of crustal material, we predict that an impact of this scale also excavates the upper mantle of the Moon and ejects some mantle material beyond the crater rim [9]. Numerical Method:  We use the iSALE-3D shock physics hydrocode [10-13]. Our model Moon consists of a 680 km diameter iron core overlain by a 1400 km thick dunite mantle with a surface gravity of 1.62 m/s2. The cell size was 10 km throughout simulation space. The ANEOS equation of state is used to model the thermodynamic properties of dunite and iron [14,15]. The impactor, a homogeneous sphere of dunite, collides with the Moon at 15 km/s. We vary impact angle between 30° and 60°, and vary impactor diameter between 300 to 460 km. This range of impact scenarios is in agreement with previous studies of the SPA basin transient crater diameter [7]. Determining the Ejecta Thickness:  We place Lagrangian tracers, which track the motion of a parcel of material trough iSALEs Eulerian mesh, in the center of each cell of the simulation space. We treat these tracers as proxies for the ejected mass from the impact, with each tracer representing a volume of 1000 km3 (determined by the resolution of the simulation). We track the tracer trajectories and determine the locations where they are ballistically emplaced on the lunar surface relative to the current location of SPA.  We use the final tracer positions to create a map of ejecta thickness (Fig. 1), excluding any tracers within the final rim of the crater, inside of which crater collapse occurs. We assume a final crater rim 2500 km in diameter centered on the transient crater [7]. The final tracer positions are pooled into equal surface area bins along the lunar surface. We calculated the ejecta thickness in each bin by dividing the volume of ejecta by the surface area of the Moon within each bin. Then we plot these results in latitude and longitude so that the SPA basin is located between -60° and -90° latitude and centered at 180° longitude (Fig. 1). Results: Figure 1 shows the ejecta thickness of lunar material on the farside for a 420 km diameter impactor with an 11.5 km/s velocity and 30° impact angle. The ejected material originates from as deep as ~100 km. The ejecta thickness ranges from 0 km (white) to more than 7 km (red). The oblique impact angle creates an asymmetric ejecta distribution with the majority of ejecta mass in the downrange direction (lunar farside) and a zone of avoidance uprange (towards the current south pole and nearside). In other simulations, we find that the distribution of ejecta varies with impactor angle, diameter, and velocity.  The impact that creates the SPA basin likely excavates upper mantle material and deposits it beyond the final crater rim. The initial depth of the ejecta, primarily upper mantle material, is important to understanding the composition of the ejecta blanket on the farside and requires further consideration. The ejecta blanket produced by a 420 km diameter impactor (Fig. 1) includes material as deep as ~100 km. Limits on the size of impactor required to eject mantle material beyond a 2500 km diameter crater rim depends upon the crust 2765.pdf

thickness. For example, a 150 km diameter impactor at 15 km/s and 45° has a maximum excavation depth of 37.5 km, and 300 km or larger impactors result in excavation depths greater than 77.5 km (well below the Moon's crust) [9]. Because SPA is the largest basin on the Moon, it excavated most deeply and ejected the deepest material found on the surface of the Moon.  Although not included in these simulations, a realistic treatment SPA ejecta emplacement should include the horizontal velocity component of impacting ejecta [16]. Here we model 1012 m3 volumes ejected onto the lunar farside without considering subsequent spreading. The inclusion of a ballistic sedimentation model (with horizontal ejecta sliding) and loading of ejecta material on the farside is required to apply our results to the center of mass and center of figure offset. Further, a full exploration of the impact parameter space is required to find an impact that best agrees with the current day farside topography and the offset between the center of mass and center of figure of the Moon.

Results shown are for a 420 km diameter impactor traveling at 15 km/s striking at a 30° angle relative to the horizon. The farside is centered in longitude (between 90° to 270°) and the SPA crater lies between 30° S and 90° S latitude and centered at 180° longitude. Dashed lines show longitude every 30° and latitude every 15°.
