Scaling Rule Between Cohesive Forces and The Size of a Self-Gravitating Aggregate PaulSa´nchez and Daniel J. Scheeres, Colorado Center for Astrodynamics Research, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO80309-431 (diego.sanchez-lana@colorado.edu)This paper presents a series of physics modelsimplemented into a Soft-Sphere Discrete ElementMethod (SSDEM) code to study the evolution ofself-gravitating granular aggregates that are spun todisruption. We use these aggregates as a proxy forunderstanding "rubble-pile" asteroids that are spunup to high rotation rates under the influence of theYORP effect. The scaling properties of this modelare explored. When cohesion is added, the systemis no longer size and density independent, providinga means for simulating asteroids of different sizesthrough changing a single non-dimensional cohesionparameter.Introduction:A recent achievement in understanding the strengthof asteroids was the development of a theory for howcohesive forces could arise in rubble pile asteroids[1]. In this model dry cohesive forces (e.g., van derWaals forces) between fine grains of regolith can forma matrix within which larger boulders can be emplaced. The limiting strength of such loosely packed"cements" can be very weak, on the order of 25-100Pa, yet in the micro-gravity environment found on asteroids this can dramatically change the failure behavior of rubble piles [1].The current paper incorporates this cohesion modelinto an SSDEM simulation code to explore the effectof cohesion on the failure spin rates for rubble pilebodies. In addition, a theoretical analysis of the problem is made that indicates how a cohesive rubble pilesimulation can be scaled to describe a range of different rubble pile sizes without having to adjust the totalnumber of particles in the aggregate. The significanceof this result is in that it opens the door for more efficient simulations and analyses of size dependence onfailure modes in rubble pile asteroids.Theoretical Analysis:The interactions between grains in a rubble pileasteroid consist of gravitational attractions betweengrains, cohesive forces between grains in contact, andthe resulting normal and tangential contact forces. Theequation of motion for a single grain of radius Ri expressed in a body-fixed, rotating frame can then be expressed as:mi [r¨i + 2ω × r˙i + ω˙ × ri + ω × ω × ri] =migi +N i + T i +Ci(1)where mi is the mass of the grain, ri is the positionof the grain in the body frame, all time derivatives aretaken in the body-fixed, rotating frame, ω is the instantaneous angular velocity of the body, gi is the gravitational acceleration acting on the grain, N i is normalforce acting on the grain, T i is the tangential frictionalforce acting on it, andCi is the cohesive force betweenboulders connected by the matrix. In our model themagnitude of the cohesive force between two bouldersis expressed as the sum of multiple grains in proximityCi =∑j∈IiCij (2)where j ∈ Ii denotes all of the boulders in contact withboulder i.The gravitational acceleration acting on our grainwill be of the formgi = −GN∑j=1,j 6=imjr3ijrji (3)with the summation occuring over all boulders.If the rubble pile is uniformly rotating and the grainis stationary in the body frame then we have a balancebetween gravitational, cohesive, centripetal and restoring forces. Thus, when at rest each grain is subject tothe force balanceN i + T i = miω × ω × ri −migi −Ci (4)We note that the gravitational and centripetal accelerations can be made scale independent, but that the cohesive force will not be scale independent in general.The normal and tangential forces are just driven by theother forces, and thus will scale relative to the forcesthat hold the grains together.It is possible to normalize the equations of motion toexpose the fundamental scaling parameters of interestby introducing a mass scaling (total mass of the aggregate), a length scaling (radius of a grain), and a timescaling (orbit period at the surface of the aggregate).If there is no cohesion present, then the contactforces are completely driven by the scale invariantgravitational and rotational accelerations. Thus, without cohesion the behavior of a rubble pile asteroidis ideally independent of size. However, the presence of cohesive forces between larger grains throughour "matrix" model of regolith breaks this size anddensity scale independence. This introduces a nondimensional parameter (c) that enables us to evaluate different sized rubble pile asteroids through adjusting a single scaling parameter that defines the relativestrength of cohesion.2556.pdf

Thus, assuming a fixed boulder size Ri and matrixstrength σY Y (or a fixed ratio between them), the effect of changing the total rubble-pile asteroid size, R,changes the dimensionless cohesion as 1/R3. As anasteroid becomes larger, it is possible to show that theeffective cohesion becomes small, while as an asteroidbecomes smaller the cohesion grows. Specifically, ifall other cohesion quantities are kept fixed except forthe total body size R, then:cR3 = c′R′3 (5)where c is the dimensionless cohesion.Simulation:The simulation program that is used for this research applies a Soft-Sphere Discrete Element Method[2, 3, 4, 5] to simulate a self-gravitating granular aggregate. The particles, modelled as spheres that followa predetermined size distribution, interact through asoft-repulsive potential when in contact. This methodconsiders that two particles are in contact when theyoverlap. When this happens, normal and tangentialcontact forces are calculated [6]. The former is modelled by a linear spring-dashpot system and is alwaysrepulsive, keeping the particles apart; the latter is alsomodelled with a linear spring that satisfies the localCoulomb yield criterion.In addition, we have also implemented rolling friction [8]. For this, a winding spring provides a torqueto particles in contact. In form, it is very similar tosurface friction, but is related to the relative angulardisplacement. This type of friction allows us to obtainaggregates with angles of friction of up to ∼35o, typical of cohesionless aggregates on Earth, though anglesof ∼40o are not rare.The particles (initially cohesionless and frictionless) are left to coalesce in the desired shape so forming very homogeneous internal structures. The aggregates are spun up in small, discrete increments aroundtheir CM and the disruption process is observed.Fig. 1 shows the scaled results of the simulationsthat were carried out with perfectly spherical aggregates, ≈142 m in size.In spite of this, the results obtained here do agreewith our theoretical predictions for the spin rate limitof granular aggregates which cohesive strength originates in molecular Van der Waals forces existentamong the fine regolith that would form a matrix.Fig. 2 shows the disruption of some of the simulated aggregates that started as spheres. The differentdisruption modes are a direct result of the increasedstrength of the cohesive bonds. However, given thescaling relationship between cohesive forces and size,it is possible to see these simulations as of aggregateswith the same cohesive strength but different size.Figure 1: Spin rate versus size data, theoretical strengthcurve, and the simulation results.Figure 2: Disruption of the simulated aggregates. Size ratios: 27.2:2.2:1Conclusions: This analysis shows that asteroids ofsimilar size would behave differently if their cohesivestrength is different (which is exactly what we havedone in simulations). However, more importantly,asteroids with different size could behave differentlyeven if their make-up is the same. An additional benefit of this scaling relationship is that it allows us totranslate the results obtained in small granular systemsto larger ones without the increased computational costdue to the incremented number of particles or the unrealistically large particle size. This and other implications will be analyzed at the conference.References: [1] P. Sa´nchez, et al. (2014)Meteoritics & Planetary Science 49(5):788 ISSN1945-5100 doi. [2] P. Sa´nchez, et al.
