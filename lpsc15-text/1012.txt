PRELIMINARY ANALYSES OF MARTIAN-TERRESTRIAL ANALOG RIVERS TO EXAMINE THE INFLUENCE OF SEDIMENT IN FORM-DISCHARGE RELATIONSHIPS.  R. E. Jacobsen1 and D. M. Burr1, 1University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN USA 37996 (RJacobse@vols.utk.edu and dburr1@vols.utk.edu).  Background:  Empirical form-discharge relationships derived from terrestrial rivers [e.g., 1,2] and scaled for difference in gravity, are commonly used to estimate flow discharges (m3 s-1) of Martian paleochannels [e.g., 3-7]. Discharge estimates are used in various models with implications for ancient climate [8-9]. Regression analyses of terrestrial channel form (e.g., width, wavelength) and discharge records produce form-discharge relationships: Qn=aXb, where Q is the discharge of a flood with a recurrence interval of n number of years, a and b are constants, and X is a measurement of form [1-2]. Bankfull discharge is recognized as the most effective flow for moving channel sediment over time, controlling channel form, and may be approximated by the Q2yr [10]. Sediment size in the channel bed and banks has profound effect on the relationship between discharge and channel form [1]. Form-discharge relationships not specific to any category of sediment size (Table 1), refered to here as “non-specific” relationships, were derived from regression analysis of 252 channels with various sediment sizes (clays to cobbles) in the Missouri River Basin [1]. Equation 1 is the most commonly used relationship for estimating paleodischarge on Mars [3-7] because there is a dearth of information about fluvial channel sediments [11 & refs. therein]. Relationships derived from channels with specific sediment sizes, refered to here as “sediment-specific” relationships, are derived from analyses of 2 channels in the Sand Hills, NE (Eq. 2) and 15 mud-rich channels in the Missiour River Basin (Eq. 3) [1].  Table 1: Form-Discharge Relationships [from 1] Eq. Relationship Sediment Type Stand. Error 1 Q2yr=1.9W1.22 Non-specific 79% 2 Q2yr=0.031W1.86 Sand-dominated 26% 3 Q2yr=2.0W1.86 Mud-rich 52% Terrestrial analogs provide helpful opportunities to test the relationships in Table 1 among channel form, discharge, and sediment size. The Usuktuk River on the North Slope, Alaska and Quinn River in the Black Rock Desert, Nevada (Figure 1) [12] have been investigated as potential analogs for meandering channels in the Aeolis Dorsa region, Mars [5,12,13], based on their well-developed meanders in permafrost and lowvegetation floodplains, respectively. These channels in Alaska and Nevada are sand-dominated and muddominated, respectively. How well do form-discharge relationships predict discharge in these well-sorted and possible analog channels? Hypotheses:  Null: The influence of sediment size on channel width for a given discharge is irrelevant across all sediment sizes. If true, this hypothesis would validate the common use of non-specific relationships. Alternative: The influence of sediment size on channel width for a given discharge is relevant across all sediment sizes. If true, this hypothesis would require the use of only sediment-specific relationships. Methods:  Hypotheses were tested by comparing records and/or models of Q2yr and predictions of discharge derived from width measurements coupled with non-specific and sediment-specific relationships. Although no gauge record exists for the Usuktuk River, it is a tributary of the Meade River. The Meade has a gauge record from 2006 to 2014 and has similar sediment and hydrological regimes as the Usuktuk [14]. We carried out the analysis using data from the Meade River. Discharges of peak streamflows for the Meade River at Atasuk, AK indicate the Q2yr is 702 m3 s-1 (waterdata.usgs.gov). There is no nearby gauge station for the Quinn River, NV, but we use an in situ estimate of bankfull discharge, 11.9 m3 s-1 [15], as an approximation of the Q2yr. Observations of aerial photographs and digital elevation models of the North Slope of Alaska (5-m res.)  and Quinn River (1-m res.) were made using ArcMap software. For both rivers, samples of channel width were made by measuring bankfull width every 500 meters of channel length. Bankfull width was measured as the distance between the abrupt change in slope, nearest to the channel, on opposite banks. Samples of channel width were coupled with a non-specific form-discharge relationship (Eq. 1) and the relevant sediment-specific relationship (either Eq. 2 or 3) to create distributions of predicted discharge. Results:  Measurements of bankfull width and estimates of Q2yr, from the outputs of form-discharge relationships, are shown in Table 2.

Discussion:  For the sand-dominated Meade River, the accuracy of discharge predictions increased when width measurements were coupled with the sedimentspecific relationship rather than the non-specific relationship. In this case, the null hypothesis can be rejected and the alternative hypothesis can be accepted because the relationship between channel form and discharge is influenced by the properties and abundance of sand. Sand is the most mobile sediment, and causes large variation in channel width for a given flood discharge [1]. If channels on Mars are sand-dominated, conventional use of non-specific form-discharge relationships will overestimate Q2yr. For the mud-dominated Quinn River, the accuracy of discharge predictions decreased by coupling width measurements with the sediment-specific relationship compared to the non-specific relationship. In this case, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. If channels on Mars are mud-dominated, use of non-specific formdischarge relationships will also overestimate Q2yr. Thus, in either case, these results indicate that discharge estimates on Mars made using non-specific relationships are overestimates.   Future Work:  This work will be advanced by statistical analyses to determine the significance of differences between Q2yr and discharge predictions from non-specific and sediment-specific relationships. New form-discharge relationships for mud-dominated channel (as opposed to mud-rich channels) may be derived from analysis of channels in the Basin and Range, NV. References:  [1] Osterkamp W.
