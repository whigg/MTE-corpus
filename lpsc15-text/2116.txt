Several different structures have been proposed,but the most prominent in the literature include either adry or hydrated silicate core with an icy mantle [1]. Thesedifferent structures will lead to different impact cratermorphologies. With NASA's Dawn due to enter orbitaround Ceres soon, we will start receiving the first imagesof craters on the surface, which can be used to infer thenature of Ceres' interior. Here, we use a statistical modelto predict the largest impacts expected on Ceres throughsolar system history, and explore how crater morphologiesfor such impacts vary with internal structure.Predicting impactor sizes: Using the statisticalframework presented in [2], the number, sizes and velocities of impacts on Ceres were estimated. The size- andvelocity frequency distribution of impactors in the asteroid belt were estimated using dynamical and collisionalevolution models of terrestrial planet formation [3, 4] andas predicted for Ceres [5]. The disruption threshold forCeres was set using the criteria from [6], although after104 simulations of Ceres' impact history, no disruptiveimpacts occurred. Over the course of solar system history, Ceres could expect over 63000 impacts of impactors300 m in diameter or larger. Over the same time period,on average Ceres would experience 3 impacts by objectsone-twentieth its size (48 km), and have 1.3 impacts byobjects one-tenth of its size (96 km).The expected number of craters on Ceres today willalso be dependent on the internal structure, as crater relaxation, especially near the equator, could remove evidenceof craters > 4 km if they form in an ice layer [7].Figure 1 shows an estimate of the number of cratersformed on Ceres using the crater scaling parameters forice from [8]. The model predicts around two craters largerthan ∼ 700 km diameter. For small craters which formentirely in the ice mantle, this estimate is robust, but forlarger craters (e.g. in which the core will play a role during the opening of the transient crater, or the curvature ofthe surface is significant), further modelling is required.Impact modelling: The iSALE shock physics code[9-11] was used to simulate impacts into different possible internal structures for Ceres: (a) a dry silicate corewith a radius of 369 km (using the ANEOS equation ofstate for dunite [12]) capped by an ice mantle (ANEOS100 101 102 103 104Crater diameter, df [km]10−310−210−1100101102103104105Cumulativenumberofimpacts>dfFigure 1: The cumulative number of craters on Ceres withdiameters greater than df .equation of state for water), and (b) a hydrated silicatecore of radius 426 km (using the ANEOS equation of statefor serpentine [13]) capped by an ice mantle. The sizeof the cores was calculated to give a mass, surface gravity and bulk density consistent with those estimated forCeres. A computational cell size of ∼ 3 km was used,which means that Ceres was represented by 160 cellsacross its radius. iSALE was used in its 2D, axisymmetricformulation to reduce computational costs (thus imposing a normal incidence impact angle), although full 3Dsimulations are ongoing. The silicate cores were assignedstrength using the model described in [9], with parametersfor dunite taken from [14]; the ice mantles were assignedstrength using the model developed for icy satellites [e.g.15]. Material was weakened after impact using the blockmodel of acoustic fluidization [16]. A gravity field was assigned at the start of the calculation and, due to the largemass difference between the impactor and Ceres, was notupdated during the calculation. Crater scaling for icy targets [8] suggests that to form a final crater ∼ 700 km indiameter, a projectile composed of ice around one tenththe diameter of Ceres is required to impact at 4 km s−1 (atypical impact velocity on Ceres [5]).Results: Figure 2 shows some snapshots of two simulations of a 96 km diameter projectile impacting Ceres at4 km s−1: one with a serpentine core (left hand side) andone with a dunite core (right hand side).

Figure 2: iSALE simulations of an impact of a 96 km diameter ice projectile at 4 km s−1 into two different targetstructures: on the left, a serpentine core (radius 426 km),and on the right, a dunite core (radius 326 km).ness of the ice mantle in the dunite-core case. The second frame shows the opening of a transient crater; in bothcases, the ice mantle is stripped away to expose the core,and in the serpentine case, a small crater is opened up inthe core. In the third frame, the ice has flowed back intothe centre and the core has uplifted beneath the centre ofthe crater. In the serpentine case, the core remains exposed (or only thinly covered) over a region ∼ 200 kmin diameter. The bottom frame, and Figure 3, shows thescale of the final craters. The crater on the Ceres with aserpentine core has a rim-to-rim diameter of ∼ 690 km,and the crater formed on the Ceres with a dunite core hasa rim-to-rim diameter of ∼ 760 km, consisent with thecrater scaling estimate.Discussion: Internal structure clearly plays a key rolein determining final crater morphology. In large scale cratering events like those modelled here, no silicate materialFigure 3: Final crater morphology compared to the preimpact surface (red dashed line)is ejected onto the surface, although some may be broughtcloser to the surface in a central uplift, beneath thinnedmantle material. Modelling of larger impact events willplace a constraint on the type of impact that could leavesilicate ejecta on the surface, and thus be used in comparison with observations from Dawn. The uplift of corematerial will be observable in gravity anomaly measurements from Dawn, which can further be used to constrainthe interior structure of Ceres.Further modelling will extend the parameter space overdifferent impactor velocities, sizes and angles, and otherinternal structures (for example, a "convecting mudball"[17] or a homogeneous hydrated silicate body [18]).References: [1] McCord, T.
