A LOOK AT UNINDEXED PDFS: HOW HIGH SHOULD THE VALUE BE FOR SHOCKED ROCKS?  M. H. Poelchau1 1Universität Freiburg - Geologie, Albertstraße 23b, 79104 Freiburg, Germany. michael.poelchau@geologie.uni-freiburg.de   Introduction:  In a recent letter to the editor, Reimold et al. [1] pointed out an ongoing problem in the field of terrestrial impact cratering. While impact craters continue to fascinate and attract new researchers of many different fields, the false or insufficient identification of shock metamorphism in terrestrial structures remains a problem. A current example is a publication in EPSL by Vannucchi et al. [2], who have misinterpreted Boehm lamellae in samples from Tunguska, Siberia, as planar deformation features (PDFs). Similarly, fluid inclusion trails from the Maniitsoq structure in Greenland have also been incorrectly identified as PDFs in a further EPSL publication by Garde et al. [3]. Reimold et al. [1] make an important effort to educate readers on the correct recognition of PDFs and other shock metamorphic indicators, and add to the list of younger publications that deal with this issue, e.g. Ferriere et al. [4] and French & Koeberl [5]. It comes somewhat as a surprise though, that these efforts fail to reach their targets. In fact, both Vannucchi et al. [2] and Garde et al. [3] both quote these papers (i.e. [4,5]). In light of these recent publications, it seems questionable if the current method of PDF identification via indexing with a universal stage [4] is an appropriate safeguard against the misidentification of Boehm lamellae and fluid inclusion trails in quartz as PDFs. Microanalysis with TEM is certainly a stronger alternative to the u-stage, but it is a relatively expensive method requiring an experienced operator, and the current publication record suggests it is not commonly used for terrestrial impacts. Unindexed PDFs:  This abstract focuses on a currently underrepresented metric of the PDF indexing process, namely the percentage of unindexed "PDFs" in shocked and unshocked samples. This value has the potential to help differentiate between PDF lamellae of shock metamorphosed quartz and measurements of Boehm lamellae, fluid inclusion trails of healed fractures, etc., and thus potentially expose falsely identified impact structures. Compilation of PDF Data:  Figure 1 shows a compilation of recent PDF measurements from a number of confirmed impact structures, including the Nördlinger Ries, Siljan, Bosumtwi, Chesapeak Bay, etc. [4,6-8]. On average each datapoint consists of measurements in over 50 grains. The percentage of unindexed PDFs is plotted against the number of sets per grain. Unindexed values are as high as 16-17%, but the average lies at 6%. In comparison, data from several structures that are not accepted as impact craters are shown [2,3,8-11]. Here, unidexed values are clearly higher, lying between 18 and 32%. It should also be noted that the average of sets per grain is comparably lower.  Based on these data, the acceptable maximum percentage of unindexed PDFs in a shocked rock sample should lie below ~16%. This takes larger values of researchers with a lack of u-stage experirience into account, as is also discussed in [4]. 0123450 10 20 30 40PDF sets / grainUnindexed PDFs [%]PDFs from accepted cratersLamellae from non-impact structures Fig. 1: A comparison of the percentage of unindexed PDFs in samples from impact craters versus structures that are not accepted as impact craters. Unshocked samples with Boehm lamellae and fluid inclusion trails have a higher % of unindexed "PDFs". Data from [211]. A Statistical Look at Indexing:  PDFs are oriented parallel to rational crystallographic planes with low Miller indeces. The orientation of these planes can be determined relative to each other and to the c-axis of the quartz grain, but not to the a-axes of the grain. A template of Miller indeces (e.g., [4]) is used to determine the crystallographic orientation of the PDFs in a stereoplot. For this, the surface poles of the PDFs are rotated freely around the c-axis until as many as possible are fit into 5° error circles of the Miller indeces. Any PDFs outside of these circles remain "unindexed". There are several consequences to this methd of indexing. (1) If only one PDF set is measured, the set can be rotated in most cases until an index is found, which can lead to many "false positives". (2) Basal sets, i.e. sets parallel to the c-axis or (0001), are automatically correctly indexed. (3) Two or more PDF sets reduce the probability of incorrect indexing. Two (non-basal) 2473.pdf

sets are recommended as the minimum amount for a measurement, but Fig. 1 shows that this recommendation is not always follwed. Statistical Methods:  In order to constrain how many unidexed PDFs can occur if Boehm lamellae or fluid inclusion trails are falsely measured and indexed as PDFs, histograms of these features were taken from [12]. Random orientations of 1-2 sets of lamelallae were generated that follow the statistical distribution of these histograms and were indexed using the ANIE v1.2 software from [13]. Figure 2 shows the distribution of non-shock lamellae relative to the quartz c-axis. A completely random, equal distribution should lie along the dashed line and was calculated based on [14]. Microfractures (blue line, average of 455 sets) roughly follow this random distribution, while Boehm lamellae (red line, average of 3835 sets) show a strong preferred crystallographic orientation relative to the c-axis. 051015200 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90% for 5°binsAngle surface pole to c-axis [°]unindexableunindexableunindexable Fig. 2: Distribution of non-shock lamellae relative to the quartz c-axis. Red line: Boehm lamellae, blue line: microfractures, dashed line: theoretical equal area distribution. Data are from [12]. Vertical lines mark the range of angles that cannot be indexed in the template from [4]. Results:  If only one set per grain is measured, there is a high probability that the set can be indexed. Fig. 2 shows that based on the template from [4] only 3 narrow zones exist where lamellae cannot be indexed. If the sets are randomly distributed (dashed curve in Fig. 2), only 14% lie within these zones and are not indexable. For microfractures with a distribution as seen in Fig. 2 (blue curve), 13% are unindexable, while 27% of Boehm lamellae (red curve) are unindexable. These numbers, in particular the Boehm lamellae value, can certainly vary. 30% of the Boehm lamellae in Vannucchi et al. [2] were unindexed (1 set/grain), while Boehm lamellae from [8] had values of 22-26% (1.2 sets/grain). In comparison, Fig. 1 shows <10% unidexed PDFs (<1.5 sets/grain) for shocked samples. For two sets of randomly generated lamellae, numbers are higher. Here, 400 sets in 200 grains were simulated with statistical distributions constrained by the histograms in Fig. 2. These sets were then indexed with ANIE v1.2. For random pairs with no preferential orientation (dashed line), 22% are not indexable. Grains with two "microfractures" have 21% unindexed lamellae, while grains with two "Boehm lamellae" have 41%. A combination of a Boehm lamella and a microfracture yields 32%. In comparison, shocked samples with two or more sets of PDFs have at most 17% unindexed PDFs, or on average 8% (Fig. 1). While statistically the sets did have a preferential orientation to the c-axis, there was no preferential orientation relative to the a-axes, as this could not be derived from the literature. Unindexed values determined here thus may be too high. It should be mentioned that a few older publications give much higher values of unindexed PDFs from accepted impact structures. E.g., 37.5% unindexed PDFs were reported from the Aouelloul structure, Mauretania [15]. This value may be related to the small amount of sets measured (16 sets in 15 grains). Conclusions:  When measuring PDFs sets with a ustage, the percentage of unindexed PDFs in a sample is given, but to date no acceptable limit for this value has been set. Based on a comparison of published PDF measurements and statistical analyses, I suggest ~16% as an upper limit for an average of 1.5 sets per grain or more. Samples with higher values than 16% should be discussed critically with regard to potential shock metamorphism, as a large percentage of Boehm lamellae and microfractures can be falsely indexed as PDFs (e.g., [2]). For 1 - 1.5 sets per grain, values should lie below 13% unindexed PDFs. It should also be stressed that measurements with lower unindexed values are not automatically shocked samples with PDFs. The usual diligence and documentation are still required to confirm the presence of shock metamorphism. References: [1] Reimold et al. (2014) MAPS, 49, 723-731. [2] Vannucchi et al.
