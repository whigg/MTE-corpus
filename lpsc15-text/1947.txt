Until 2013 we had unique magnetograms, obtained by the Irkutsk geophysical observatory which demonstrated disturbances attributed to explosion of Tunguska bolide [1], impacted the Earth on June, 30 in 1908. It was the most powerful documented impact, though no crater-forming [2]. After a fall of Chelyabinsk meteoroid on February 15, 2013 we have no direct detected evidence of geomagnetic field disturbancies.  Observations and results of numerical simulation of the geomagnetic field disturbances caused by the Tunguska bolide: As was discovered in sixties, magnetic field disturbances caused by the Tunguska bolide got started approximately 5-6.5 min after the explosion. The disturbances were positive at the beginning and negative later, maximal values were of order of tens of nT, total duration was of several hours. The variations were observed in H- and Z-components. The observatory is located in almost 1000 km from the explosion epicenter, and the bolide itself hadnâ€™t been seen there. A proposed model showed that geomagnetic disturbances occurred while a well-conductive cloud of heated atmospheric gas moved in E-layer of ionosphere across the geomagnetic field [3]. The disturbed area was of order of a thousand km, maximal values of disturbances were of hundreds of nT, and there were both negative and positive patches over the area. Simulation of the geomagnetic field disturbances caused by the Chelyabinsk bolide:  The Chelyabinsk bolide on February, 15, 2013 had energy of 440 TNT, released at the epicenter with coordinates 54.8N, 61.1E at 3:20 UT. In Fig.1 magnetograms detected on the closest station  ARTI (56.43N,58.57E) are shown.  (http://www.intermagnet.org/Datae.php).   Fig.1 Deviations of z-component of the geomagnetic field (in nT). Results of 3D numerical simulation of gas dynamic parameters of the atmosphere after the impact at time moments 30 s, 300 s and 850 s are presented in Fig.2.    Fig.2 Vertical distributions of relative pressure in a plane of trajectory.   Key factors determining the transient magnetic field are the gas dynamic velocities and the air conductivity. As all velocities are close to sonic values, diurnal conductivities of the E-layer of ionosphere are used in simulations. Spatial distributions of z-component disturbance in nT at time moments 300 s (the upper panel) and 850 s (the lower panel) are shown in Fig.3.  1947.pdf

  Fig.3 Disturbances of z-component on the ground (in nT).  As a location of the geomagnetic station ARTI is about 250 km NW from the epicentre, z-component of the geomagnetic field must reveal a negative disturbance of about ten nT at the time moment 850 s, but there is nothing on the magnetogram. This discrepancy appears caused by insufficient insolation in the morning, when the event occurred. So the conductivity is lower than diurnal conductivity of the ionosphere used in our estimates, because night conductivities of the E-layer are less than diurnal ones by two orders of magnitude.       Summary and conclusions: Study of even nocrater-forming events help to figure out features of the impact-generated transient magnetic fields. It is clear that they are not like a magnetic dipole field. Maximal field values are order of percentages of the local planetary field. They can provide both positive and negative anomalies. The role of the fields increases with impact energy. References:   [1] Ivanov K. (1964)  Meteoritika, 24,  141-151. (in Russian). [2] Artemieva N. (2010) LPS IVI, Abstract #1968.
