However,  theseproperties  are  often  estimated  using  thermal  modelsthat  assume  a  spherical  shape.  Detailed  shapeinformation is  only  available  for  a  small  fraction ofknown asteroids,  so making simplifying assumptionsabout  the  shape  is  often  unavoidable.  Still,  it  isimportant  to  quantify  the  errors  that  can  arise  fromapplying  spherical  thermal  models  to  non-sphericalasteroids.We have developed thermal models of three nearEarth  asteroids  for  which  detailed  shape  models(derived from radar and lightcurve observations) havebeen  published:  (4769)  Castalia  [3,  4],  (8567)  1996HW1 [5], and (162421) 2000 ET70 [6]. All three havesubstantial  concavities:  Castalia  and  1996  HW1  areelongated  contact  binaries,  and  2000  ET70  is  aspheroidal  object  with  large  ridges  that  resemblefingers in a clenched fist.Essentially,  we  are  using  asteroids  with  welldetermined shapes to investigate: What happens if oneassumes  an  asteroid  is  spherical  when it  isn't?  Howmuch does the asteroid's shape affect thermal modelingresults?We  observed  these  asteroids  using  the  SpeXinstrument  [7]  of  the  NASA  InfraRed  TelescopeFacility  (IRTF).  Each  asteroid  was  observed  atmultiple  phase  angles,  as  part  of  our  campaign  toobtain  both  radar  observations  and  infraredspectroscopy of near-Earth asteroids. Using our shapebased thermophysical modeling program, SHERMAN,we  show  the  range  of  variations  in  the  asteroids'infrared spectra due to changes in rotation phase andviewing  geometry.  We  also  compare  the  thermalproperties  derived using the asteroids'  true shapes tothe thermal properties and sizes that would be derivedfrom applying spherical  thermal  models  to  the sameobservations.For  example:  1996  HW1 is  elongated,  and  as  itrotates  its  projected  area  changes  considerably  particularly when it is observed at low phase angle andthe subsolar latitude is near its equator. For the viewinggeometry of  October  1,  2008 (phase  angle  24°),  theobserved flux density of HW1 at 4.0 microns varied bya  factor  of  about  2.9  as  the  asteroid  rotates.  Thisvariation  leads  to  corresponding  variations  in  theFigure 1: IR observations of 2000 ET70 from February 21, 2012 (phase angle 41°), and the spectrum of a good model (Hapke single-scattering albedo 0.032, thermal inertia 600 in SI units, no craters). The inset in the second plot shows a plane-of-sky view of the model, with the brightness of each facet proportional to its thermal flux.2995.pdf

effective diameter that would be derived from thermalmodels that assume a spherical shape [8]. This factorof 2.9 in flux density translates to a factor of about 1.7in  the  derived  effective  diameter.  Depending  on  therotation  phase  at  which  HW1  had  been  seen,  thederived diameter could vary from 1.4 km to 2.4 km(see Figure 2). HW1's actual volumetric mean diameteris 2.0 km.In  contrast,  during  the  times  of  our  infraredobservations of 2000 ET70, the ridges and concavitiesnear its north pole (the most non-spherical parts of theasteroid)  were  barely  illuminated,  so  they  had  verylittle effect on the observed spectra, so ET70's infraredspectra  on  those  nights  are  nearly  indistinguishablefrom  those  of  a  sphere  with  the  same  thermalproperties. In other words, ET70 was observed at timeswhen it looked much like a sphere.For this analysis, we allow each asteroid's albedo,thermal inertia, and surface roughness to vary. Surfaceroughness is parameterized as a fraction of the surfacecovered by hemispherical craters, which gives similarresults  to  more  complex  representations  of  surfaceroughness [9].Laboratory  measurements  of  meteorites  haveshown that their thermal properties can vary stronglywith temperature [10,  11].  However,  thermal  modelstypically assume that the asteroid's thermal propertiesare  independent  of  temperature.  Here,  we  are  alsoexamining  cases  where  the  thermal  properties  aretemperature-dependent.References: [1] J. S. V. Lagerros.  (1996)  Astron.Astrophys., 310, 1011-1020. [2] A. W. Harris and J.

On the night of August 19, 2008 (phase angle 30°), HW1's flux density at 4.0 microns varied by a factor of about 2.6 (or about 50% above the mean to 30% below the mean), mainly because of the asteroid's projected area changing. This means that the derived diameter, if assuming a spherical shape with identical thermal properties, would vary by a factor of about 1.6 (or about -25% to +15% from its actual volumetric mean diameter). As in Figure 1, the insets show plane-of-sky views of the model's thermal emission at the times of the observations. On the night of October 1 (phase angle 24°), HW1's flux density varied by a factor of about 2.9 (±50% from the mean), so the resulting derived diameter varies by a factor of about 1.7 (-30% to +15% from the mean). During all nights of our IRTF observations, the sub-observer latitude was near HW1's equator, so its projected area varied considerably over the course of a rotation. If we had been looking near its pole (but still at low phase), the variations in its projected area and flux would have been much smaller, so the derived diameters would not vary as much.2995.pdf
