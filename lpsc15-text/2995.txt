Infrared  observations  of  an  asteroid  provide constraints  on  its  size,  albedo,  thermal  inertia,  and other  physical  properties  [1,  2].  However,  these properties  are  often  estimated  using  thermal  models that  assume  a  spherical  shape.  Detailed  shape information is  only  available  for  a  small  fraction of known asteroids,  so making simplifying assumptions about  the  shape  is  often  unavoidable.  Still,  it  is important  to  quantify  the  errors  that  can  arise  from applying  spherical  thermal  models  to  non-spherical asteroids. We have developed thermal models of three nearEarth  asteroids  for  which  detailed  shape  models (derived from radar and lightcurve observations) have been  published:  (4769)  Castalia  [3,  4],  (8567)  1996 HW1 [5], and (162421) 2000 ET70 [6]. All three have substantial  concavities:  Castalia  and  1996  HW1  are elongated  contact  binaries,  and  2000  ET70  is  a spheroidal  object  with  large  ridges  that  resemble fingers in a clenched fist. Essentially,  we  are  using  asteroids  with  welldetermined shapes to investigate: What happens if one assumes  an  asteroid  is  spherical  when it  isn't?  How much does the asteroid's shape affect thermal modeling results? We  observed  these  asteroids  using  the  SpeX instrument  [7]  of  the  NASA  InfraRed  Telescope Facility  (IRTF).  Each  asteroid  was  observed  at multiple  phase  angles,  as  part  of  our  campaign  to obtain  both  radar  observations  and  infrared spectroscopy of near-Earth asteroids. Using our shapebased thermophysical modeling program, SHERMAN, we  show  the  range  of  variations  in  the  asteroids' infrared spectra due to changes in rotation phase and viewing  geometry.  We  also  compare  the  thermal properties  derived using the asteroids'  true shapes to the thermal properties and sizes that would be derived from applying spherical  thermal  models  to  the same observations. For  example:  1996  HW1 is  elongated,  and  as  it rotates  its  projected  area  changes  considerably  particularly when it is observed at low phase angle and the subsolar latitude is near its equator. For the viewing geometry of  October  1,  2008 (phase  angle  24°),  the observed flux density of HW1 at 4.0 microns varied by a  factor  of  about  2.9  as  the  asteroid  rotates.  This variation  leads  to  corresponding  variations  in  the Figure 1: IR observations of 2000 ET70 from February 21, 2012 (phase angle 41°), and the spectrum of a good model (Hapke single-scattering albedo 0.032, thermal inertia 600 in SI units, no craters). The inset in the second plot shows a plane-of-sky view of the model, with the brightness of each facet proportional to its thermal flux.   effective diameter that would be derived from thermal models that assume a spherical shape [8]. This factor of 2.9 in flux density translates to a factor of about 1.7 in  the  derived  effective  diameter.  Depending  on  the rotation  phase  at  which  HW1  had  been  seen,  the derived diameter could vary from 1.4 km to 2.4 km (see Figure 2). HW1's actual volumetric mean diameter is 2.0 km. In  contrast,  during  the  times  of  our  infrared observations of 2000 ET70, the ridges and concavities near its north pole (the most non-spherical parts of the asteroid)  were  barely  illuminated,  so  they  had  very little effect on the observed spectra, so ET70's infrared spectra  on  those  nights  are  nearly  indistinguishable from  those  of  a  sphere  with  the  same  thermal properties. In other words, ET70 was observed at times when it looked much like a sphere. For this analysis, we allow each asteroid's albedo, thermal inertia, and surface roughness to vary. Surface roughness is parameterized as a fraction of the surface covered by hemispherical craters, which gives similar results  to  more  complex  representations  of  surface roughness [9]. Laboratory  measurements  of  meteorites  have shown that their thermal properties can vary strongly with temperature [10,  11].  However,  thermal  models typically assume that the asteroid's thermal properties are  independent  of  temperature.  Here,  we  are  also examining  cases  where  the  thermal  properties  are temperature-dependent. References: [1] J. S. V. Lagerros.  (1996)  Astron. Astrophys., 310, 1011-1020. [2] A. W.

Figure 2: As 1996 HW1 rotates, its flux varies (as seen by an observer on Earth), mainly due to its projected area changing. On the night of August 19, 2008 (phase angle 30°), HW1's flux density at 4.0 microns varied by a factor of about 2.6 (or about 50% above the mean to 30% below the mean), mainly because of the asteroid's projected area changing. This means that the derived diameter, if assuming a spherical shape with identical thermal properties, would vary by a factor of about 1.6 (or about -25% to +15% from its actual volumetric mean diameter). As in Figure 1, the insets show plane-of-sky views of the model's thermal emission at the times of the observations. On the night of October 1 (phase angle 24°), HW1's flux density varied by a factor of about 2.9 (±50% from the mean), so the resulting derived diameter varies by a factor of about 1.7 (-30% to +15% from the mean). During all nights of our IRTF observations, the sub-observer latitude was near HW1's equator, so its projected area varied considerably over the course of a rotation. If we had been looking near its pole (but still at low phase), the variations in its projected area and flux would have been much smaller, so the derived diameters would not vary as much.
