(tutu.luu@bristol.ac.uk)   Introduction:  Meteoritic chondrules are submillimeter silicate spherules that underwent partial or total melting, partial crystallization and were quenched in a gas. Whatever their origin, either melting by energetic events and cooling in the nebula gas or formation associated to small planetary objects (in bow shocks or during collisions), they are proxies of the first few Myr of the history of the solar accretion disk. Major questions pertaining to their origin are the nature of their precursors (e.g., formed from high-temperature condensation of a solar gas or produced by fragmentation of mantles of planetary embryos) and the composition of the gas in which they cooled and/or quenched. Obviously, chondrules's ages are key in constraining their origin. Recent developments in dating using short-lived 26Al (T1/2=0.72 Myr) have shown that two different ages can be tentatively obtained for a given object. A 26Al-isochron diagram reports the radiogenic 26Mg excesses (noted in delta notation δ26Mg*) versus the 27Al/24Mg concentration ratios and allows to determine the slope ((26Al/27Al)initial) and the intercept (δ26Mg*initial) of the isochron. The slope of a mineral isochron gives access to the relative age (relative to a reference 26Al/27Al ratio) of the last melting/crystallization event which fractionated the 27Al/24Mg ratios between the different minerals of the object. At variance if different objects have bulk compositions which define a 26Al-isochron (a bulk isochron) then this could be interpreted as giving access to the relative age of the process which established their bulk  27Al/24Mg ratios. An important recent result is that bulk Ca-, Al-rich inclusions (CAIs) from the Allende CV3 chondrite define a very tight bulk 26Al isochron having the following initial (26Al/27Al)0 =(5.25±0.12)×10−5 and δ26Mg*0=−0.034±0.032‰ [13]. One interpretation of this result is that the precursors of these CAIs all formed within a very narrow time window that is defined by the uncertainties of 26Al measurements (less than ~10 kyr), otherwise, because of their high 27Al/24Mg ratios, the bulk CAIs would not share a common initial δ26Mg*0.  The goal of this work is to try to apply the same kind of approach to chondrules in order to date the formation of chondrules' precursors relative to CAIs' precursors and relative to the last melting events that formed the chondrules.   Fourteen Mg-rich chondrules from Allende were studied: eight of them were analysed by ion microprobe (at CRPG Nancy, France) to determine mineral 26Al isochrons and all of them were analysed for their bulk Mg isotopic compositions (at IPG Paris, CRPG Nancy and UCLA Los Angeles USA) to look for a possible bulk 26Al isochron. Analytical techniques are described in [4-6]. The fourteen chondrules studied show a range from ferromagnesian to Al-rich and subsequently they have 27Al/24Mg ratios ranging from 0.05 to 1.81. All the chondrules (except one marginally) have bulk compositions that define an isochron (Fig. 1) with (26Al/27Al)initial=(1.2±0.2)×10−5 and δ26Mg*initial=−0.009±0.012‰ (2 sigma errors) [6].       This tem Fig. 1: 26Al-26Mg isochron diagram for bulk chondrules (n = 14), hand-picked from the Allende CV3 carbonaceous chondrite. The 8 chondrules studied by ion microprobe show mineral 26Al-isochrons with initial 26Al/27Al ratios ranging from (3.5±5.7)×10−6 to (2.6±1.5)×10−5 and initial δ26Mg* ranging from -0.047(±0.024)‰ to 0.063(±0.029)‰. Assuming 26Al homogeneity in the inner Solar System, these mineral isochrons correspond to ages for the last melting events ranging from 0.73(+0.93/-0.48) to 1.86(+1.3/-0.56) Myr after "time zero" as defined by the CAIs' bulk (26Al/27Al)0.   Fig. 2 shows how the melting ages (i.e. that given by the mineral isochrons) compare with the isochron defined by their bulk compositions. By definition the slope of the mineral isochron cannot be higher than that of the bulk isochron (blue dashed line in Fig. 2) since the formation of the chondrule itself cannot predate the formation of its precursors. This is verified by nearly all chondrules except a few that might have in fact a bulk 26Al/27Al ratio higher than that of the bulk chondrule isochron (see discussion below). Fig. 2: Comparison between bulk and mineral 26Al isochrons. Each object is represented by its measured bulk 27Al/24Mg ratio and δ26Mg* value. The mineral 26Al isochrons are represented for each object by the colored segments passing through the bulk compositions. Discussion and implications:   The simplest explanation of the bulk 26Al-isochron defined by the present samples is that it measures the average ages of their precursors. Thus, the precursors of the present chondrules would have formed 1.5±0.2 Myr after CAIs. Using the same reasoning than that used for the bulk-CAIs 26Al isochron, the scatter of the chondrule bulk compositions points to a formation of the precursors over a timescale <180 kyr.  However, considering all chondrules analysed so far (from Allende and Semarkona LL3.0) for their bulk δ26Mg* and 27Al/24Mg [4,6,7,8], it is clear that no bulk 26Al-isochron exists for all chondrules (Fig. 3). In the 26Al isochron diagram (Fig. 3), bulk chondrules plot between the bulk-CAIs isochron and the isochron defined by the present 14 chondrules from Allende. Because ferromagnesian chondrules have low bulk 27Al/24Mg ratios they cannot develop high enough δ26Mg* to distinguish (within errors, see inset in Fig. 3) if they plot on the bulk-CAIs isochron or on the isochron with 26Al/27Al=1.2×10-5 (this could explain why some of them have mineral isochrons with 26Al/27Al>1.2×10-5). At variance, four chondrules having high 27Al/24Mg ratios (one from [7], two from [8], one from [4]) plot clearly on the isochron defined by the present bulk chondrules. Because all bulk chondrules analysed so far plot between the bulk-CAIs isochron and the isochron defined by the present bulk chondrules (with 26Al/27Al =(1.2±0.2)×10−5), we propose to name this later one the minimum bulkchondrule isochron.    Fig. 3: 26Al-26Mg isochron diagram for bulk chondrules, with all available data: from present study [6] (Allende chondrules, blue diamonds), from [7] (Allende chondrules, open green squares), from [8] (Allende chondrules, open purple triangles), and [4]. (Semarkona chondrules, open red circles). The fact that all bulk chondrules plot between the bulk-CAIs isochron and the minimum bulk chondrule isochron suggests that there is no chondrule existing with precursors formed later than 1.5 Myr after CAIs. Either the temperature in the condensation zone of the inner disk decreased below the condensation temperature of chondrules' precursors 1.5 Myr after time zero, or the transport of chondrules's precursors to the region where chondrules were melted by energetic events stopped after 1.5 Myr, or a combination of both [6]. These results could also be understood in the framework of the formation of chondrules during impacts between planetary embryos: the 26Al age of the precursors could tentatively be considered as the age of differentiation of the planetary object parent of the chondrule precursors and the chondrule age as the age of the impact.
