USING ENGINEERING CAMERAS ON MARS LANDERS AND ROVERS TO RETRIEVE ATMOSPHERIC DUST LOADING C. A. Wolfe1, M. T. Lemmon1, 1Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77840USA; wolfe2ca@tamu.eduIntroduction: Dust in the Martian atmosphere influences energy deposition, dynamics, and the viability of solar powered exploration vehicles. The Viking,Pathfinder, Spirit, Opportunity, Phoenix, and Curiosity landers and rovers each included the ability to image the Sun with a science camera that included a neutral density filter. Direct images of the Sun providethe ability to measure extinction by dust and ice inthe atmosphere. These observations have been used tocharacterize dust storms, provide ground truth sites fororbiter-based global measurements of dust loading, andto help monitor solar panel performance [1]. In the costconstrained environment of Mars exploration, futuremissions may omit such cameras, as the solar-poweredInSight mission has. We will present a simulation-basedassessment of imaging strategies and their error budgets,as well as a validation based on archival engineeringcamera data.Procedure and Preliminary Validation : We seekto provide a robust capability of determining atmospheric opacity from sky images taken with cameras thathave not been designed for solar imaging, such as lander and rover engineering cameras. One such methodof deriving optical depth from non-solar sky images involves taking the ratio of sky radiance at two differentelevation angles and generating a brightness profile.Near 90◦ away from a low Sun, the scattering angleis nearly orthogonal to elevation angle. In this case, thescattering angle controls the phase function (P) and theelevation angle controls the airmass (η). For the low optical depth limit, radiance (I) is proportional to opticaldepth (τ ) × airmass (η), but for high airmass and/or optical depth, multiple extinction becomes important [1].To reduce errors from absolute calibration in the highairmass and/or optical depth case, we take the ratio oftwo measurements at the same scattering angle, but different elevation angles. The ratio method is a simplification: one can gain accuracy using an elevation (�)profile of dln(I)/d� from a sky image, taken at constantscattering angle. This is analogous to multiple sun images at different elevation angles to calibrate solar optical depth. The following equation can be used to generate a brightness profile and thus derive optical depth:IaIb≈∫ τ00e−(τ0−τ)e−τηaηa dτ∫ τ00e−(τ0−τ)e−τηbηb dτA set of ”truth” models was created with randomlyvaried parameters. Optical depth was derived with anew set of randomly-varied scattering parameters. Evenwith random errors in single scattering that are largecompared to uncertainties, the model still derives an accurate optical depth. Below is a plot that was generatedusing the ratio method:Figure 1: Ia/Ib Brightness Profile (It is important to notethat 95% of all visible optical depths measured on Marsare < 1.5.)Observational Validation Plan: Below are MERimages obtained from the Planetary Data System (PDS).The image on the left is a typical or ’normal’ image,while the one on the right is contaminated by the waythe light hits the Navcam optics. The contaminated image shows a baffle that shadows the optics. As a result, the Sun casts a shadow onto the window, whichbecomes visible due to the dustiness.(a) SOL 3848 (b) SOL 3733Figure 2: Navcam sky images taken at roughly the sametime of day and viewing anglesNavcam images are taken when the solar elevationand azimuth angle are roughly 30◦ and 90◦ respectivelyto reflect the geometry in the model.

has been modeled from the images, using the brightness profile at constant scattering angle. This can becompared to daily, solar-imaging optical depth measurements [2].Observational Validation Results: Derived optical depths are shown below (red), and compared to thedaily solar-filter optical depth record from Pancam [2].The Pancam derivation includes a correction for opticaldepth on the windows; the Navcam data are shown withno dust-factor correction.Figure 3: Pancam vs. Navcam Optical DepthDespite the dusty optics, the derived optical depth values from Navcam non-solar sky images show a verygood fit when compared to the Pancam data that utilized direct imaging of the Sun to retrieve optical depthmeasurements.Conclusion: With planetary science budgets gettingever tighter, it is not always possible to equip landersand rovers with science cameras with dedicated solarfilters. This study has shown that aerosol optical depthcan be derived, without imaging the Sun, from onboardengineering cameras. Future missions, such as InSight,will unlikely be able to directly image the Sun, but willbe able to take (sometimes color) sky images, especially near the southern horizon. The encouraging results obtained from using the brightness profile methoddescribed in this abstract will hopefully aid InSight andother missions when it comes to retrieving atmosphericdust loading on Mars. Despite their basic purpose, engineering cameras can provide a good estimate of theamount of dust in the Martian atmosphere.References: [1] Lemmon et al. 2004. Science 306,1753.
