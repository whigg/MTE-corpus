Introduction:  The martian meteorite ALH84001 is well known for the carbonate blebs it contains in fracture surfaces [1].   A fraction of magnetite crystals in these blebs are strikingly similar to magnetosomes created by magnetotactic bacteria [2].  Previous studies on the meteorite have shown that the bulk rock was formed ~4.1 Ga [3] and the carbonates were formed along pre-existing fracture surfaces [4].  Paleomagnetic studies have also shown that despite the meteorites ejection from Mars and entry to Earth, the interior of the sample has not been heated above 40°C [5].  Recently, it has been shown that the carbonates record multiple events of aqueous activity with strong interaction with the Martian atmosphere [6].  We seek to visualize the magnetization within the ALH84001 meteorite by creating magnetic field maps on several thin consecutive slices, to see if there were variable magnetic directions.   Methods:  We cut a small chunk (~0.5 cm 3) of ALH84001 with exposed fracture surfaces into 7 slices using a Well Precision Diamond Wire Saw in a class 10,000 clean and magnetically shielded room at the MIT paleomagnetism laboratory (Figure 1).  The samples were then mounted to magnetically clean quartz disks with the same orientations. We then smoothed and ridges from the wire saw using polishing paper and sonicated them for 3 minutes in clean ethanol baths.  Each sample was then measured using our Ultra High Resolution Scanning SQUID Microscope (UHRSSM) (Figure 1).  We used a dipole fitting routine [7] to estimate the strength and direction of each resolvable dipole within the slices and compared magnetizations between slices.  If the magnetization of dipoles cluster in one or several directions we can expect that the magnetization was acquired at multiple times throughout the history of the meteorite.  If the magnetization directions are all coincident we can expect that the meteorite was either remagnetized after magnetite emplacement or that all of the magnetization was acquired during the same event.   Results:  The data show a prominent cluster with scatter that is along a great circle arc through it (Figure 2).  The cluster could be consistent with a major carbonate bleb forming event where as the scatter around the cluster could be secondary mineralization events.  The data are consistent with a lack of late-stage remagnetization.  It appears that the rock experienced magnetization along a plane.  Possible explanations for this planar nature could be explained by true polar wander [8] or a tectonic rotation event, both prior to the collapse of the Martian magnetic field.   Future Work: We will subject the slices to demagnetization (some slices using thermal demagnetization in an atmospherically controlled oven) and other slices using AF demagnetization.  In order to study the individual carbonate blebs and their associated magnetization we must apply the demagnetizing field or heat and then scan the slices on the UHRSSM and repeat the dipole fitting process.

Note the fracture surfaces within the sample.  Each sample is approximately 0.5 mm thick.   Figure 2 (top): We have fit dipoles where possible to the magnetization scans.
