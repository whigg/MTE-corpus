How to explain this characteristic remains a major challenge in planetary sciences. Previous studies show that considering convective vigor in the planet’s interior is not sufficient to explain why the lithosphere of the Earth is broken [1, 2]. The strength of Earth’s lithosphere must be reduced compared to that of other terrestrial planets. This links the possibility of plate tectonics with the formation of localized shear zones, which are expected to develop when a material looses strength as it deforms [3]. In this study, we focus on the formation of ductile shear zones through grain size reduction and discuss the conditions under which significant weakening (defined as an increase in strain rate for a given stress) is possible.   Localization processes: Rocks deform following brittle processes at relatively shallow pressure and temperature and plastic mechanisms are greater depth. Geological observations on Earth show that deformation can localize under both conditions [4], even though plastic rheologies, being strain-rate hardening, are fundamentally stable in the laboratory [5]. Localization can be understood in either case if a state variable enables rock strength to weaken as strain accumulates [2, 5]. The best-studied way to generate ductile shear zones is  by shear heating. In that model shearing generates heat, which increases temperature and weakens the rock, leading to more shear [6-8]. This mechanisms is particularly efficient at low temperature and initial strain rate. However, field evidence for shear heating in ductile shear zones remains scant [9] possibly indicating that heat is evacuated faster than considered in these models. Field evidence supports the notion that localization is facilitated by structure evolution in two ways. First, sheared rocks tend to develop layers that allow interconnection of a relatively weak phase. The interconnection of phyllosilicates, in particular, seems to play a role in the weakening of brittle faults [10-12] and ductile shear zones in the middle crust [13, 14]. This process is particularly efficient when one of the rock phases obeys a highly nonlinear rheology, like mica [5]. Because phyllosilicates are often hydrated, we do not expect this process to be efficient on Venus. It is also possible that micas are rare in the Martian interior because even the crust is dominantly mafic. Ductile shear zones in exhumed mantle rocks often feature a reduced grain size compared to undeformed rocks, which leads to the many shear zones being classified as mylonites [15–18]. Reducing grain size is possible only when dislocations are active inside the rocks [e.g., 19]. However, it leads to weakening only if grain boundary sliding or diffusion creep are dominant, which leads to a connendrum: grain size reduction is not possible under condition where it would be an efficient weakening process (Figure 1). However, at low enough temperature, olivine aggregates may deform in the dislocation-accommodated Grain Boundary Sliding regime (dis-GBS, [20, 21]), which is grain size sensitive and during which dislocations are active. Simulations of simple shear that include grain size evolution result in ductile shear zones only at relatively low temperatures, when dis-GBS is important (Figure 2, [22]).   Figure 1: Shear zone strain rate after grain size reduction to 10 mm to 1 micron (red) or to the value predicted by the van de Wal piezometer [23] assuming an initial strain rate of 1015 s-1 and considering dislocation creep, diffusion creep and (dashed line and dotted line) dis-GBS creep according to [20] or [21].  Consequences for the strength of the lithosphere. Gueydan et al. [22] recently discussed how the strength profile of the continental lithosphere changes with strain.

ence of mica) and uppermost mantle (grain size reduction). The reduced strength of the lithosphere as a whole is accompanied by increased strain rate if the loading stress, controlled by large-scale tectonics, does not change. The lower crust, which does not weaken, becomes the load-bearing layer at high strain (Figure 3).  In that model, the increase of strain rate accompanying microstructural evolution is arbitrary. Two approaches make it possible to determine the strain rate self-consistently. 1) The stress at each depth remains unchanged and the strain rate is that corresponding to that stress. The increase in strain is regarded as a change in shear zone width. However, the horizontal shear resulting from the sloping edge of the shear zone is neglected. 2) The integrated strength of the lithosphere remains unchanged and the strain rate is uniform with depth, but at the value needed to match the integrated strength. In either of these models, the strength profile is not much affected by grain size evolution as grain size remains at an equilibrium value close to where it does not affects rock rheology. However, if the brittle strength decrease during shear, the ductile lithosphere becomes more and more load bearing (for assumption 2), driving further grain size reduction.
