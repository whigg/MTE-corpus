Introduction:  The nakhlite MIL 03346, its paired stones  MIL  090030,  090032,  and  090036,  and NWA 5790 contain high-Cl amphiboles, called potassic-chloro-hastingsite (Cl 5-7 wt%, 1.5-2.0 atoms per formula unit or apfu, compositions in Fig. 1-2), accompanied by glass and titanomagnetite within augite-hosted melt inclusions [1-2].   Although Martian magmas are generally enriched in Cl compared to normal terrestrial magmas (without input from subduction, evaporites, or other surface-derived Cl sources), other examples of Martian amphiboles have <0.4 wt% Cl [3-6]. Therefore,  exceptional  conditions  must  have  been present in order to form such Cl-rich amphibole compositions. There are two theories for the formation of these Cl-rich Martian amphiboles: 1) incorporation of evaporitic material into the nakhlite parent magma [1], and 2)  addition of an exogenous Cl-rich fluid to the chassignite-nakhlite magma body [2]; both theories require addition of excess chlorine to the system prior to amphibole crystallization. Here  we discuss additional constraints  on  the  formation  environment  of  potassic-chloro-hastingsite in the MIL paired meteorites [12] using insights from recent synthesis experiments on Cl-rich (chlorian) pargasites and hastingsites [7-9] and terrestrial  examples  of  Cl-rich amphibole [10-20],  to explore the formation conditions needed to produce the Cl-rich amphibole in the MIL meteorites. Examples  of  Terrestrial  Chloro-amphiboles: Chloro-amphiboles (Cl > 1.0 apfu) [21] are rare in the terrestrial  setting.   Known  localities  for  terrestrial chloro-amphiboles  are  high-grade  metamorphic  terranes where very Cl-enriched fluids encountered a protolith  of  suitable  chemistry [10-16].   In  some cases, chloro-amphibole is accompanied by other high-Cl silicate phases like marialitic scapolite [17].  On the other hand,  extreme Cl-enrichment  of  an  igneous  or  highgrade metamorphic mafic system is not necessarily adequate to create chloro-amphibole on its own [18-20]. High  concentrations  of  K  and  Fe  must  be  present, along  with  extreme  Cl-enrichment,  to  crystallize chloro-amphibole [16,22-24].  Chlorian  Amphibole  Synthesis  Experiments: Synthesis  experiments  have  recently  been  conducted [7-9]  that  crystallized  amphiboles  in  the presence  of brines  or  chloride  salts.   Some runs were conducted with 10% NaCl brine of varying strength.    Other runs contained hypersaline mixtures of NaCl or FeCl2 and H2O added directly to the capsule without prior dissolution.  Still other runs were conducted with FeCl2 as the chloride source and H2O limited to sorbed moisture. K-free pargasite-ferropargasite samples synthesized with 0.1 to 5 m NaCl exhibit Mg-Cl avoidance with Cl contents increasing linearly with the Fe# (= Fe / (Fe + Mg)).   The Cl contents reached a maximum of only 0.086 wt% in end-member ferropargasite [7-8].  Pargasite-series amphiboles synthesized from brines follow a Cl-poor trend [7,12].   Increasing the concentration of the brine to beyond the STP solubility limit of NaCl in H2O, to as high as 26 m NaCl (XCl = 0.32), did not result  in any further  increase  in Cl in endmember ferropargasite [8].  Interestingly, when synthesized in FeCl2 hypersaline brines (XCl = 0.34-0.44), more Cl can be incorporated in pargasite (up to 1.4 wt% or 0.4 apfu Cl), but this is still well short of Cl dominance on the O(3) site. K-free  hastingsite-magnesiohastingsite  synthesized with FeCl2 and incidental moisture showed the expected trend with Fe content to an Fe# of 0.64; this amphibole had 2.2 wt% or 0.64 apfu Cl [9].  However, endmember hastingsite could only accommodate 0.21 apfu Cl [9].  There is unexpected complexity in the Cl incorporation mechanism for the hastingsite series compared to pargasite.  Data from both series show an inability for calcic amphiboles to reach Cl-dominant compositions in the absence of K. Discussion:  Experimental data [7-9] and terrestrial analogs  [10-20]  make it  clear  that  extremely Cl-rich amphibole not only requires abundant Cl to form, but also has other petrological requirements.  We can use these to further constrain the conditions needed to form such amphibole in the MIL meteorites [1-2]: First, the H2O activity in the MIL 03346 melt inclusions needed to have been quite low in order for chlorine-dominant amphibole to crystallize; to date, experiments  have  shown that  when NaCl  is  the  dominant solute, the saturation limit of the brine must be exceeded  before  chloramphibole  crystallizes  [7-9],  and  this may be true of other brine compositions as well. Second, in MIL 03346 and pairs, late enrichment of Fe was required to crystallize amphibole that could accommodate  near-completely  Cl-dominant  amphibole (Fig.  1).   Crystallization  of  extremely Fe-rich augite around the edges of the melt inclusions has been observed,  and  titanomagnetite  is  the  other  major  crystalline  phase  in  the  melt  inclusions  [10,25];  this  ex treme Fe enrichment may have been caused by transport  of  FeCl2-rich  fluid  [26]  upward  from a  deeper source region in or below the nakhlite parent intrusion [2]. Third, the melt inclusions in MIL 03346 and pairs must also have had a high K/Na ratio, as illustrated in Fig. 2 [16,22].  This is consistent with the interpretation of K enrichment in Nakhla relative to Na via metasomatism [27].   Contrasts  exist  between MIL 03346 and Nakhla, however, especially in that (sodic) plagioclase is common in Nakhla and (sodic)  scapolite has been found in one melt inclusion in Nakhla [28],  but these phases are rare or nonexistent in MIL 03346 and pairs [25].  Although it seems clear that both of these nakhlites  were altered  by Cl-rich metasomatic fluids, there are also previously unremarked differences in alkali metal chemistry and mineralogy between them. Next Steps:  The substitution of K and Fe onto the A and C sites of the amphibole lattice [21] causes the lattice to expand anisotropically [29], which appears to accommodate the Cl substitution.  It may be possible to use the unit cell volume or lattice parameters directly to complement compositional information to determine partition relations for Cl and OH from fluids.
