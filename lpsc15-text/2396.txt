CRYSTAL  CHEMISTRY  AND  FORMATION  MECHANISMS  OF  THE  POTASSIC-CHLORO-HASTINGSITE IN MIL03346 AND PAIRED STONES.  P. A. Giesting1 and J. Filiberto2.  1Illinois State University,Dept. of Geography-Geology, 206 Felmley Hall, Campus Box 4400, Normal, IL 61790-4400 (pagiest@ilstu.edu),2Southern Illinois University, Dept. of Geology, Parkinson Laboratory, Mail Code 4324, Carbondale, IL 62901 (fil iberto@siu.edu).Introduction:  The nakhlite MIL 03346, its pairedstones  MIL  090030,  090032,  and  090036,  andNWA 5790 contain high-Cl amphiboles, called potassic-chloro-hastingsite (Cl 5-7 wt%, 1.5-2.0 atoms performula unit or apfu, compositions in Fig. 1-2), accompanied by glass and titanomagnetite within augite-hosted melt inclusions [1-2].   Although Martian magmasare generally enriched in Cl compared to normal terrestrial magmas (without input from subduction, evaporites, or other surface-derived Cl sources), other examples of Martian amphiboles have <0.4 wt% Cl [3-6].Therefore,  exceptional  conditions  must  have  beenpresent in order to form such Cl-rich amphibole compositions. There are two theories for the formation ofthese Cl-rich Martian amphiboles: 1) incorporation ofevaporitic material into the nakhlite parent magma [1],and 2)  addition of an exogenous Cl-rich fluid to thechassignite-nakhlite magma body [2]; both theories require addition of excess chlorine to the system prior toamphibole crystallization. Here  we discuss additionalconstraints  on  the  formation  environment  of  potassic-chloro-hastingsite in the MIL paired meteorites [12] using insights from recent synthesis experiments onCl-rich (chlorian) pargasites and hastingsites [7-9] andterrestrial  examples  of  Cl-rich amphibole [10-20],  toexplore the formation conditions needed to produce theCl-rich amphibole in the MIL meteorites. Examples  of  Terrestrial  Chloro-amphiboles:Chloro-amphiboles (Cl > 1.0 apfu) [21] are rare in theterrestrial  setting.   Known  localities  for  terrestrialchloro-amphiboles  are  high-grade  metamorphic  terranes where very Cl-enriched fluids encountered a protolith  of  suitable  chemistry [10-16].   In  some cases,chloro-amphibole is accompanied by other high-Cl silicate phases like marialitic scapolite [17].  On the otherhand,  extreme Cl-enrichment  of  an  igneous  or  highgrade metamorphic mafic system is not necessarily adequate to create chloro-amphibole on its own [18-20].High  concentrations  of  K  and  Fe  must  be  present,along  with  extreme  Cl-enrichment,  to  crystallizechloro-amphibole [16,22-24].  Chlorian  Amphibole  Synthesis  Experiments:Synthesis  experiments  have  recently  been  conducted[7-9]  that  crystallized  amphiboles  in  the presence  ofbrines  or  chloride  salts.   Some runs were conductedwith 10% NaCl brine of varying strength.    Other runscontained hypersaline mixtures of NaCl or FeCl2 andH2O added directly to the capsule without prior dissolution.  Still other runs were conducted with FeCl2 asthe chloride source and H2O limited to sorbed moisture.K-free pargasite-ferropargasite samples synthesizedwith 0.1 to 5 m NaCl exhibit Mg-Cl avoidance with Clcontents increasing linearly with the Fe# (= Fe / (Fe +Mg)).   The Cl contents reached a maximum of only0.086 wt% in end-member ferropargasite [7-8].  Pargasite-series amphiboles synthesized from brines follow aCl-poor trend [7,12].   Increasing the concentration ofthe brine to beyond the STP solubility limit of NaCl inH2O, to as high as 26 m NaCl (XCl = 0.32), did not result  in any further  increase  in Cl in endmember ferropargasite [8].  Interestingly, when synthesized in FeCl2 hypersaline brines (XCl = 0.34-0.44), more Cl canbe incorporated in pargasite (up to 1.4 wt% or 0.4 apfuCl), but this is still well short of Cl dominance on theO(3) site.K-free  hastingsite-magnesiohastingsite  synthesizedwith FeCl2 and incidental moisture showed the expected trend with Fe content to an Fe# of 0.64; this amphibole had 2.2 wt% or 0.64 apfu Cl [9].  However, endmember hastingsite could only accommodate 0.21 apfuCl [9].  There is unexpected complexity in the Cl incorporation mechanism for the hastingsite series comparedto pargasite.  Data from both series show an inabilityfor calcic amphiboles to reach Cl-dominant compositions in the absence of K.Discussion:  Experimental data [7-9] and terrestrialanalogs  [10-20]  make it  clear  that  extremely Cl-richamphibole not only requires abundant Cl to form, butalso has other petrological requirements.  We can usethese to further constrain the conditions needed to formsuch amphibole in the MIL meteorites [1-2]:First, the H2O activity in the MIL 03346 melt inclusions needed to have been quite low in order for chlorine-dominant amphibole to crystallize; to date, experiments  have  shown that  when NaCl  is  the  dominantsolute, the saturation limit of the brine must be exceeded  before  chloramphibole  crystallizes  [7-9],  and  thismay be true of other brine compositions as well.Second, in MIL 03346 and pairs, late enrichment ofFe was required to crystallize amphibole that could accommodate  near-completely  Cl-dominant  amphibole(Fig.  1).   Crystallization  of  extremely Fe-rich augitearound the edges of the melt inclusions has been observed,  and  titanomagnetite  is  the  other  major  crystalline  phase  in  the  melt  inclusions  [10,25];  this  ex2396.pdf

treme Fe enrichment may have been caused by transport  of  FeCl2-rich  fluid  [26]  upward  from a  deepersource region in or below the nakhlite parent intrusion[2].Third, the melt inclusions in MIL 03346 and pairsmust also have had a high K/Na ratio, as illustrated inFig. 2 [16,22].  This is consistent with the interpretation of K enrichment in Nakhla relative to Na via metasomatism [27].   Contrasts  exist  between MIL 03346and Nakhla, however, especially in that (sodic) plagioclase is common in Nakhla and (sodic)  scapolite hasbeen found in one melt inclusion in Nakhla [28],  butthese phases are rare or nonexistent in MIL 03346 andpairs [25].  Although it seems clear that both of thesenakhlites  were altered  by Cl-rich metasomatic fluids,there are also previously unremarked differences in alkali metal chemistry and mineralogy between them.Next Steps:  The substitution of K and Fe onto theA and C sites of the amphibole lattice [21] causes thelattice to expand anisotropically [29], which appears toaccommodate the Cl substitution.  It may be possible touse the unit cell volume or lattice parameters directlyto complement compositional information to determinepartition relations for Cl and OH from fluids.References: [1] Sautter V. et al.
