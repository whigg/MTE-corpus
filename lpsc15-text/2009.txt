Gemini Dr., Flagstaff, Arizona 86001, rfergason@usgs.gov.        Introduction: Gullies are among the youngest and best-preserved landforms on the martian surface, and provide clues to the recent geologic history and currently active processes on Mars [1-2]. Gullies have often been interpreted as evidence for recent liquid water at the martain surface, potentially related to climatic variations [e.g., 3-19]. However, recent observed changes in gullies have lent support to models in which CO2 frost is a key factor in gully activity. Better constraints on the conditions under which gullies are active are critical to understand gully formation processes and their significance for martian habitability. A quantitative understanding of the physical characteristics of the surface surrounding both active and non-active gullies through the derivation and interpretation of highresolution thermal inertia data [20-21] and advanced thermal modeling based on those results provides new insight into these important features.      Gully Characteristics: Martian gully landforms classically consist of an alcove feeding into a channel and depositional apron [22], and are very similar to terrestrial fluvial or debris-flow features. Martian gullies are concentrated between 30° and 50° north and south, and are particularly abundant in the southern hemisphere [e.g., 6-8; 12; 22-24]. We are building on  previous studies of global gully distribution and activity by foucsing our analysis on the region of 330°E to 60°E and 30°S to 50°S. This focused study allows us to understand gully chracteristics and current levels of activity in more depth than has been possible in previous work.      Currently Gully Activity and Formation Hypotheses: Although gullies have been attributed to liquid water, observed activity suggests that a current non-fluvial process could be responsible for their formation [1-2; 25]. The gullies in our study region have a strong tendency to face the poles, similar to other southern hemisphere gullies equatorward of 45°S [2]. This orientation suggests a relationship to seasonal CO2 frost cycles [1-2]. Dundas et al. [1] observed small-scale channel incision in non-dune gullies as well as formation of complete alcove-channel-apron systems and large channels in dune gullies, demonstrating that all three of the major components of gully systems are forming today (e.g., Figure 1). These observations suggest that CO2-driven processes could be responsible for gully formation with little or no  liquid water [2].       From recent observations, two connected hypotheses describing gully activity have been proposed by Dundas et al. [2]. The first is that mass movements could be responsible for the formation of gullies, without the involvement of flowing water.  This hypothesis is directly supported by observations [e.g. 1-2; 25]  and suggests that gully activity is a current process on Mars. However, it does not rule out other processes forming gullies in the past. The second hypothesis is that current activity is driven by CO2 frost in the absence of liquid water. Observations of multiple similar flows occurring at a single site within a given timeframe support a volatile trigger, such as similar frost conditions, and CO2 frost is far more abundant than H2O. These two hypotheses have significant implications for planetary climate and liquid water on Mars [2].       Gullies are commonly taken as evidence for conditions favorable for melting and liquid runoff from snow or ground ice, placing a constraint on the climate at the time of gully formation and rendering gullies highpriority targets for astrobiological investigations [e.g.. 3-19]. Substantial melting may have occurred in gullies in the past, but  current gully activity [e.g., 1-2; 25] suggests that melting is not necessary for gully formation or modification. Furthermore, the rate of current change observed is such that most morphologies dating from the last high-obliquity period have likely been reworked [2]. Changes in Mars' obliquity have 2009.pdf

surely influenced the climate, but the simplest explanation for gully formation is by the continuation of current processes, although at varying rates. Models for past climates that produce widespread melting snow or ground ice are not needed to account for gullies. In addition, if CO2 frost is the key volatile, the potential for habitability and preservation of subsurface life is reduced [2].      Incorporation of New Methods: Dundas et al. [2] examined a range of factors that could influence gully activity. They found that fresh-appearing gullies are most likely to be active. They also investigated correlations with regional elevation, albedo and thermal inertia; the latter was found to have a statistically significant effect but was strongly skewed by the anomalously active polar pit gullies, and it was not clear whether thermal inertia is the important variable distinguishing those gullies. However, because thermal inertia is expected to affect seasonal frost processes, this parameter warrants further investigation using higher-resolution data.      We are further testing hypotheses on gully activity by focusing on a local region (330°E to 60°E and 30°S to 50°S), allowing us to perform detailed monitoring of frost activity and characterization of gully morphology. This focused study also makes it tractable to apply advanced thermal modeling to further investigate the role of seasonal CO2 frost, subsurface ice, and the possibility of water. We can directly model conditions based on specific gully observations (rather than generalizing global observations), allowing our model results to be more applicable to understanding the role of CO2 (and possible water) in the current formation of gullies at these locations and to better understand whether currently observed processes are capable of forming all observed gullies.      Gullies are typically observed in low thermal inertia materials, but the range of thermal inertia values, and thus the quantification of the range of surface materials, has not yet been assessed in detail, particularly at resolution comparable to the scale of gullies. Further, the bulk thermal inertia is typically reported, which represents a composite mixture of all materials in the upper decimeters of the surface. Therefore, the bulk thermal inertia may only be marginally useful, as gully activity is likely influenced by surface frosts and subsurface ice. Bulk thermal inertia provides initial modeling conditions, which then can be used to perform advanced thermal modeling to estimate the depth to subsurface ice (if present) and how the potential presence of subsurface ice influences surface temperatures. Previous results have indicated that subsurface ice has an important effect on seasonal CO2 frost on mid-latitude slopes [26], and our modeling allows us to more accurately predict when surface frosts are present. Predictions of surface frost are then tested against observations of gully activity to constrain the influence of frost on active processes. This modeling effort also allows us to more accurately predict the minimum and maximum surface temperature as a function of season and assess the properties of the material in which gullies form. This information allows us to better understand the geologic conditions necessary for activity under the current climate, and to more effectively understand whether thermal inertia affects the likelihood of activity in gullies.         Implications: This work helps to establish an improved understanding of the connection between seasonal CO2 frost and gullies. In addition to shedding light on the origin of gullies, this work also supports efforts to understand active processes on Mars. A better understanding of the extent of liquid water involvement in gully formation will lead to better knowledge of their possible implications for astrobiology, and affect future exploration driven by this possibility.
