CRATERS OF THE SATURNIAN SATELLITE SYSTEM:  II. Mimas and Rhea.  S.J. Robbins1, E.B. Bierhaus2, and L. Dones2.  1Southwest Research Institute, 1050 Walnut Street, Suite 300, Boulder, CO 80302, 2Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company, PO Box 179, Mail Stop S8110, Denver, CO 80201.  stuart@boulder.swri.edu  Introduction and Background:  We are working to generate a census of craters across most large Saturnian satellites with the goal to better understand the origin(s) of the crater populations, both the exosystem impactors (mostly comets), intrasystem impactors (sesquinary craters), and secondary ejecta impactors (secondary craters).  The moons, imaged as flybys instead of by orbiting craft, present unique challenges for image processing not found by those who work with most modern imagery of the inner solar system.  In this abstract, we present our approach to processing the data and then using that to measure the crater population of the Saturnian satellites to better understand impacting populations in the outer solar system. Images and Processing:  We identified all images of Mimas and Rhea in NASA's PDS from Cassini's ISS instrument in clear or "green" filters (many pointings were almost exactly duplicated in different filters).  We processed these in the USGS's ISIS software using standard radiometric and other corrections.  All images were projected in an equirectangular system.  Images that extended south of 50°S or north of 50°N were also polar projected.  Despite the satellites' triaxial ellipse shapes [1], the approximate mean radii were used in the spherical projection.  The final images were imported into ESRI's ArcMap software with separate files for each projection and moon. In ArcMap, images were sorted by imaging sequences, where many of the images were part of a flyby and so make mosaics of certain regions at a consistent lighting angle.  Within each imaging sequence, the images were sorted by pixel scale.  Pixel scale as exported as a single value by ISIS is misleading because it is a single value, but images were very rarely taken at nadir, and so the pixel scale can vary significantly across an image.  Therefore, the footprints in Fig. 1 are approximate mpp scale.  Images that were not part of image sequences were sorted by resolution. Because of the images' flyby nature and lack of well-controlled SPICE kernels, ISIS-exported files show tens of km offsets from one image to the next.  To avoid duplication of craters, we used the 2012 publicly released basemap mosaic of Mimas and 2014 basemap of Rhea [2] as references and used ArcMap's georectify tools to manually adjust images to fit the basemap, using an average of ~75 tie points per image. Crater Identification:  Image sequences were examined as groups, and images with the highest resolution were examined first.  One shapefile was used to define the area of the image that would be mapped, and the image resolution and name were saved to the polygon that defined the image.  The crater counting area would ideally be the entire image with any areas that are covered by higher resolution images removed.  However, because (in some cases) of the variable geometry once the image is rectified, some areas of the images were unusable for crater identification; most often this was due to foreshortening or near-noon sun. Identification itself was done by Robbins as described in [3]:  A polyline shapefile was created, ArcMap's native streaming tools were used to create a vertex every few pixels, and the rims of craters were traced.  These vertex points were saved in units of decimal degrees and exported from the shapefile.  They were read into Igor Pro software where custom code (upgraded from [3]) finds the centroid of each traced rim, uses Great Circles to determine the distance and bearing to each point from the centroid [4], fits a bestfit circle, and saves the location and size.  The image name and resolution on which the crater was identified is saved.  Comparison counts by Bierhaus of targeted areas is underway and is important [5]. Due to the way these satellites were imaged, there will often be regions on satellites that are better analyzed on slightly lower resolution images taken during a different flyby / imaging sequence.  As such, crater identification (and image footprint mapping) was an iterative process, requiring frequent changes and often several dozen or even hundred craters were removed in lieu of being measured on more ideal images for Mimas.  This was refined for Rhea and the images were examined and footprints for identification created before craters were identified.

Results:  1. Mimas:  We completed a census of Mimantean craters on all 28 Cassini-ISS images with pixel scales better than 500 m/px; though images more exist, they covered duplicate areas in worse quality.  We identified 10,981 craters on these images which cover 77% of the surface area of Mimas (Fig. 1).  >50% of craters with diameters D > 1 km were identified on images with resolutions ~250-350 m/px. Based on the shape of crater SFDs (Fig. 2), it is unlikely that our population sample over 77% of Mimas is "complete" for craters D < 3.5 km.  If we were to extrapolate D < 3.5 km, based on the crater population D > 3.5 km, we estimate there are roughly 55,000–60,000 craters D ≥ 1 km on Mimas.  Also based on Fig. 2, when accounting for resolution and image coverage limits, the population (as in, the shape of the crater size-frequency distribution) of Mimantean craters is almost uniform across the surface of the moon, with possible deviations near Herschel crater 3 < D < 10 km where the population appears flatter than the rest of the satellite's – fewer craters at the smaller diameters in that range than otherwise expected.  Proximity to Herschel and residence within the continuous ejecta blanket area could account for this, where craters D < 3 km are in production but those larger have not yet had time to resume a production population.  We observe statistically significant crater density differences with location on Mimas, where the region around Herschel crater has fewer impacts, as would be expected. Results:  2. Rhea:  We are in the process of completing Rhean craters on Cassini-ISS images with pixel scales better than 450 m/px.  We have analyzed 31 images to-date, identifying 40,628 craters over 15.7% of the surface area.  Based on the shape of crater SFDs (Fig. 3), when accounting for resolution and image coverage limits, it appears as though the population of Rhean craters in our measured areas is broadly uniform except in one localized, high-resolution region (~65°E ~15°S).  Unlike Mimas, we observed distinct secondary crater fields.  We plan to present nearly completed Rhean crater counts at the March LPSC. Discussion:  We are still in the early stages of this comparative planetology effort which requires the populations of numerous other satellites before we can discuss broad implications.  We can begin to compare Mimas and Rhea, however, and find that as predicted by [6], Mimas shows no evidence of secondary cratering, while Rhea has several well defined secondary crater fields that are also represented in the crater population.  We also observe distinct SFDs between the moons with a marked fall-off in D ≲ 5 km Mimantean craters.  Additionally, we find that both these moons generally show an ancient crater population, saturated over some diameter ranges.  Finally, these data support the hypothesis that a single impactor population could be responsible for the diversity of cratered terrains in the Saturnian system [6]. References: [1] Thomas et al.
