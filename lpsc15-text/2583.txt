Using hyperspectral images returned from Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM), we investigate the mineralogy of northern plains stratigraphy to decipher changing aqueous and igneous processes through time.  While limited detections of phyllosilicates and hydrated silica are found in Acidalia [4] and Utopia Planitia  [5-6] associated with knobs and cones, numerous impact craters within the northern plains have exposed mafic [7] and hydrated [8] mineral signatures in infrared spectra. Here we report the ongoing survey of CRISM targets on impact craters in the northern plains of Mars. We detect and map the locations of mineral phases and use depth-diameter relationships to understand the relationship between mafic and hydrated minerals thereby establishing the stratigraphy and geologic history of the northern plains of Mars. Method: We used the Mars global crater database [9] to filter craters that are relatively fresh (with degradation state greater or equal to 2) into different size bins and start with craters larger than 30 km in diameter for the CRISM survey. CRISM image cubes were converted to CRISM I/F and went through standard processing as in [10]. As the northern plains dataset typically has higher background noise and more dust cover, for particular targets we modified and applied a CRISM noise reduction method [11] to produce ratioed cubes and spectral parameter maps for better identification of mineralogy. Results: To date, we have surveyed CRISM targeted images acquired in Acidalia Planitia as of May 30, 2014, with a focus on large craters that likely expose hydrated minerals.  Summary of crater detections. 61 CRISM targeted images, which cover all the craters >30km in the study region and a number of smaller candidates, have been closely studied to detect and map minerals (Fig. 1). 44 out of 61 images yield mafic mineral detections (olivine or pyroxene) and 25 out of 61 show hydrated minerals, with a few confirmed Fe/Mg phyllosilicate and chlorite/prehnite detections.  Representative observations. Kunowsky Crater is a 62-km-diameter crater in the northern part of Acidalia Planitia (9.3° W, 56.8° N). It is the largest crater with the most diverse spectral features in Acidalia. While some of the strong olivine signatures on the crater floor are associated with dark sand dunes of mafic composition, other exposures of olivine and hydrated minerals are confined to the central peak region and crater wall exposures (Figure 2-A1).   At least two different phyllosilicates have been identified in Kunowsky (Figure 2-B1): Fe/Mg smectite with 1.4-, 1.9-, and 2.3-µm absorptions and chlorite/prehnite phases with 1.4-, 1.9- and 2.35-µm absorptions. Other phases include a subtle hydrated feature with a hint of 1.9-µm absorption superposed on an olivine-like slope. These minerals all occur in patches near the central peak.  Davies Crater is smaller in size, with double-layer ejecta typical of the "rampart craters" in the northern plains. CRISM images of Davies crater typically exhibit weaker absorption features (Figure 2B), and these targets are processed through the CRISM noise reduction code as test images. After ratioing and continuum removal steps, some 1.9-µm absorptions due to hydration can be found. Here, the 3 targets on the central peak all show Fe/Mg smectite, olivine, pyroxene and some other subtle H2O/OH absorptions (Figure 2). One CRISM target on the first layer of ejecta exhibits a 1.9µm H2O band and 2.28 metal-OH absorption (Figure 2B). One of 3 targets on the crater's second layer of Figure 1: Summary of mineral detections in large craters in Acidalia and Chryse Planitia. Stars refer to craters >30 km while circles indicate smaller craters. The mineral detection symbols for each crater include multiple images around that crater. 2583.pdf

A1-2) CRISM footprints with detections; B1) Fe/Mg phyllosilicates  and possible chlorite spectra in Kunowsky and Davies crater compared with laboratory spectra; B2) Olivine /pyroxene spectra in Kunowsky and Davies crater compared with laboratory spectra.  ejecta also yielded detections of 1.9-µm H2O absorption bands. The central peak detection of Fe/Mg phyllosilicates and the ones found on the ejecta share the 1.9-µm absorption, but it's rather ambiguous whether the absorption center of the ~2.3 µm feature agrees.  Impact crater scaling: After careful survey of CRISM maps, scaling relationships were applied to estimate the maximum excavation depth of each crater using different crater models [12-15]. Though there are slight differences, these models predict excavation of materials from depths >2 km for large craters (diameter >30 km) where hydrated minerals are detected, indicating this as the burial depth of the crust containing hydrated mineral phases. The small craters (e.g. Yuti) that only show strong olivine detections suggest that the mafic rocks are buried to much shallower depths < ~1.2 km. Discussion:  The preferential detection of hydrated minerals near the central peaks of the large craters (e.g. Kunowsky, Davies and Bamberg) is consistent with excavation of the hydrated minerals from depth. An alternative scenario is that the hydrated minerals may have formed via hydrothermal alteration after the impact, due to an impact-induced hydrothermal system or other types of transient aqueous events. However, the Fe/Mg phyllosilicates on the ejecta of Davies crater and the corresponding detections on crater walls are consistent with the expected occurrence of excavated stratigraphy in impact crater models [16]. In the initial survey, the largest craters have hydrated mineral-bearing units that are not found in smaller craters, which is consistent with the scenario that phyllosilicate-bearing unit is buried deeper than the mafic units.  Similar-sized large craters near outflow channels had weaker detections or no detections of mafic or hydrated minerals, in contrast to the large craters in the northern part of the plain. This could be a result of thicker mantling material atop the phylloslicate and mafic units due to the proximity to the outflow channels. Alternatively, mass-wasted sediments from the highlands may have subdued the spectral signals by mixing, making minerals of interest harder to detect. More CRISM targets in southern Acidalia will be explored to understand the latitudinal trends. Future work: The application of CRISM noise reduction code proved to be successful in enhancing weak mineral signals and will be applied to a larger dataset in Acidalia Planitia and across the northern plains to complete the mineralogy survey. For craters with diverse mineralogy and good exposures, we will use the Maxwell-Z model to provide upper and lower limits to the thickness of different layers. Relationships between crater sizes and latitude will be analyzed to establish the temporal-spatial variations of northern plains geology.
