Introduction:  The total electron content (TEC = Ne(h) dh) of a planetary ionosphere is dominated by plasma near and above the height of maximum electron density (Nmax).  The ratio τ =TEC/Nmax has a unit of length—representing the thickness (τ) of a slab of plasma with uniform density equal to Nmax that yields the same TEC. For an ionospheric layer dominated by photo-chemical processes, τ can be related to the scale height of the neutral gas (H = kTn/mg) that is ionized by sunlight [1], with τ ~ 4 x H.  For Mars' CO2 atmosphere, this relationship can be further evaluated to yield Tn (°K) ~ 5 x τ ~ 20 x H (km). The MARSIS radio science package on the Mars Express satellite has produced large independent data sets of TEC [2,3,4] and Nmax [5].  The common period of data we investigated was 15 August 2005 to 30 September 2007, with nearly 700,000 TEC values and 32,000 Nmax values. These observations were used to form slab thickness patterns versus solar zenith angle (SZA) for a period of low solar activity (F10.7 at Mars between 25-45 units).   For daytime (SZA < 90 o) average conditions, < τ >day ~ 50 km, while for nighttime conditions (SZA > 90 o) < τ >night ~ 25 km. These correspond to exospheric temperature (Tn) values of 250 oK and 125 oK—consistent with typical day vs. night values during solar minimum years.  To explore the dependence of τ (and inferred Tn) over the full range of SZAs, the MARSIS data were analyzed in two-degree SZA bins, and the resultant pattern is depicted in Figure 1.  The trend is one of essentially constant temperatures during the midday period (20 o < SZA < 60 o), with somewhat higher values near the sunrise and sunset periods (60 o < SZA < 85 o).  A dramatically cooler thermosphere is evident for the pre-sunrise and post-sunset times (SZA = 90 o100 o).  Figure 1 offers the first attempt to relate ionospherically-derived neutral temperatures to local time conditions during a period of low solar flux (<F10.7>Mars = 35 units).   To explore the dependence of τ (and inferred Tn) versus solar flux conditions, we used the 5600 Ne(h) profiles from the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) satellite during discrete observing periods between December 1998 and November 2006 [6].  The profiles were integrated between fixed heights of 100 to 200 km to form TEC values.   Since the MGS profiles refer to ob-  Figure 1.  The pattern of slab thickness and derived temperature vs. solar zenith angle obtained by averaging the MARSIS τ values over the solar flux conditions during a two-year solar minimum period.  The left axis gives τ values that can be converted to scale height (H) values by dividing by 4.  The axis on the right converts H to temperature values using the approximation Tn ~ 5 τ .  Uncertainty levels shown are the standard deviations of the mean values displayed.  The τ(km) and T(oK) values for SZA > 100o are not considered statistically reliable due to the division of two very low magnitude values.  servations spanning a small range of SZAs (70 o -90 o), we averaged over that range to obtain the pattern of τ (and Tn) versus solar flux shown in Figure 2.  The data between 40 and 80 solar flux units are the most reliable and they dominate the curve-fitting method used to obtain a functional relationship:  Tn( oK) = 240 oK + 0.43 x <F10.7>  where <F10.7> is the solar flux averaged over three solar rotations. Defining the basic structure of the martian upper atmosphere is a key requirement for MAVEN's goal of studying atmospheric escape processes.  The MAVEN spacecraft has instruments that will measure (a) atmospheric parameters (emissions, solar and stellar occultation effects) via remote sensing techniques, as well as  (b) compositions and (c) mass densities along its orbit.  These observations will lead to scale height determinations, and thus neutral temperatures.  The Imaging Ultra-Violet Spectrograph (IUVS) will make altitude scans to determine the emission and absorption profiles of various species [7]. The Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS) will make in-situ measurements of neutral species at altitudes along the MAVEN orbit [8]. MAVEN's Accelerometer will be used to measure total mass densities for attitude Control and atmospheric Characterization (ACC) [9]. All of these techniques will be able to derive neutral temperatures at heights of ~160 km, the altitude region associated with the slab thickness method described in this report.     Figure 2. The pattern of MGS slab thickness and derived temperature vs. solar flux at Mars obtained by averaging the τ values from MGS profiles over their limited solar zenith angle range. Uncertainly levels are the standard deviations of the mean values displayed.  The linear fit shown is dominated by SZA conditions between 45o-75o.   References [1] Titheridge J. E. (1973) Planet.
