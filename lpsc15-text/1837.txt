 A MODIFIED m-χ DECOMPOSITION FOR COMPACT POLARIMETRIC SAR DATA.    S. Dhingra 1 and A. Bhattacharya 1, 1 Centre of Studies in Resources Engineering, IIT Bombay, Powai, Mumbai-400076, India (swinks@iitb.ac.in)       Introduction:  The synthetic aperture radars (SARs) aboard NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) and India's Chandrayaan-1 satellite are the first spacebased radars to implement compact hybrid polarimetric architecture, transmitting circular polarization and receiving orthogonal linear polarizations coherently (CLpol) [1]. Both radars measure 2×2 covariance matrices and the data is represented in the form of Stokes' parameters (g0, g1, g2, g3). The matrix decomposition techniques used for quad-pol 3×3 covariance matrices are not directly applicable to compact polarimetric data. However, Stokes' daughter parameters have been used to distinguish between classes of radar backscatter [2]. The common decomposition models that have been used for compact polarimetric data for a large range of applications are m-δ decomposition and m-χ decomposition. Both these schemes use degree of polarization (m) as the first decomposition variable. Relative phase δ was initially used as one of the decomposition variables [3] but later, due to its dependence on the orientation of polarization ellipse, ellipticity χ was found to be more robust for classifying the radar backscatter when the transmission is not completely circular. The m-χ decomposition scheme is shown in Eq. 1 below:                       𝑃𝑑 = [ 𝑚𝑔0(1 − 𝑠𝑖𝑛2𝜒) 2]                                𝑚 = 1𝑔0 √∑ 𝑔𝑖 23 𝑖=1 𝑃𝑠 = [ 𝑚𝑔0(1 + 𝑠𝑖𝑛2𝜒) 2]                            𝑠𝑖𝑛2𝜒 = −𝑔3/𝑚𝑔0  𝑃𝑣 = [𝑔0(1 − 𝑚)]                                                             (1)  where Pd, Ps, Pv correspond to double bounce, surface and volume scattering powers respectively. This method has proved to be an excellent tool for analysis of compact data [4]. However, it falls short of expectations when the backscattered wave is not fully circular polarized. For ellipticity nearing 45° or -45° but not exactly equal to it, the geometrical factor sin2χ approaches unity as shown in Fig 1.     When χ approaches +π/4, sin2χ is +1, which implies that double-bounce power (Pd) is zero and surface power (Ps) is maximum. When χ approaches -π/4, sin2χ is -1, which implies that surface power (Ps) is zero and double-bounce power (Pd) is maximum. However, there are certain targets as shown for Flevoland data in results section for which the double bounce power has significant value when the backscattered wave is approaching left circular polarization (indicated by χ as +π/4), but is not fully circularly polarized.The core idea is that surface and double bounce powers are not correctly estimated when χ is tending to 45° or -45°. In this paper, a new decomposition scheme has been proposed to correct for the anomalous estimation of powers at the extremities.   Fig 1: Plot of geometrical factors sin2χ and 4χ/π vs ellipticity χ      Methodology: The factor sin2χ tends towards +1 or -1 indicating pure odd-bounce or pure double-bounce even for a wave having linearly polarized component which may not be the case always. To remove this anomaly, a linear factor of 4χ/π has been introduced which linearizes the powers near extremities giving a better estimation of surface power and double bounce power. The linearized power m-χ decomposition has been expressed in Eq. 2 below: 𝑃𝑑 = [ 𝑚𝑔0(1 − 4𝜒/𝜋) 2]   𝑃𝑠 = [ 𝑚𝑔0(1 − 4𝜒/𝜋) 2]  𝑃𝑣 = [𝑔0(1 − 𝑚)]                  (2)      where Pd, Ps, Pv correspond to double bounce, surface and volume scattering powers respectively. In the range of -π/4 to +π/4, the factor sin2χ can be replaced by 4χ/π. For ellipticity ranging between 35° to 45°, sin2χ pushes towards 1 making the double bounce power to be null and distributing all the power towards OC. The factor 4χ/π tends to distribute some power to SC component as well though major contribution to  4𝜒/𝜋 power still comes from OC. The results are illustrated in the next section.     Results and Discussion:  We present a comparison of the polarimetric decomposition results obtained by the famous m-χ method and the modified m-χ method. The data set used to illustrate the proposed decomposition technique is the JPL AIRSAR L-band imagery of Flevoland, the Netherlands (Fig 2). Two target sites where χ > 30 ◦ are selected to highlight the significance of new technique. The first selected target site is where backscattered power is dominated by double-bounce contributions. Fig 3 (a) and (b) shows the surface, double bounce and volume powers over a range of pixels indicated by transect 1(in Fig 2) for m-χ as well as modified m-χ decomposition respectively. The m-χ scheme indicates that at the location where double bounce power is maximized when χ = -40.21°, there are hardly any returns contributed by odd bounce. However, at the same location, the modified method shows a change of surface power by about -15.21 dB. This implies that the new method of decomposition slightly redistributes power appropriately amongst SC and OC returns when ellipticity approaches pure circular polarization.     Similarly another target site was selected where radar response was dominated by odd bounce i.e. surface returns. Fig 3 (c) and (d) shows the surface, double bounce and volume powers over a range of pixels indicated by transect 2 (in Fig 2) for m-χ as well as modified m-χ decomposition respectively. In this case, the new method indicates a change in double bounce power by - 16.38 dB when χ = 31.108°.                                                            (a)                            (b)                                                                                            Conclusion: Due to the presence of geometrical factor sin2χ, m-χ decomposition either gives complete odd bounce or complete even bounce near end points i.e. when ellipticity approaches +π/4 or -π/4, but the new method attempts to correct for this anomaly by replacing the factor of sin2χ by 4χ/π, which slightly rectifies the earlier technique by linearizing the powers and giving a better estimation when the wave is nearly but not completely circularly polarized.
