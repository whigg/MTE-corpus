FREEZING OF METHANOL-WATER MIXTURES AT HIGH PRESSURE WITH APPLICATIONS TOTITAN. Andrew Dougherty and Dustin Morris, Department of Physics, Lafayette College, Easton, PA 18042 USA.doughera@lafayette.eduIntroduction: We report measurements of thefreezing points for a 40 wt.% methanol-water solutionat pressures ranging from 50 to 400 MPa, usingsimultaneous measurements of pressure, volume, andtemperature, coupled with optical images of the sample.The eutectic point for the methanol-water solution appears to increase with pressure, similar to the behaviorof the freezing point of pure methanol. Conversely,the liquidus point appears to decrease with pressurein the Ice-Ih regime, consistent with the behavior ofpure water. We also find that the Ice-Ih phase is presentat somewhat higher pressures than one would expectbased on the pure water phase diagram.Background: The presence of a subsurface oceanon Titan has long been suspected[1], and is consistent with electric field measurements from the Huygensprobe[2]. The ocean likely contains impurities, such asammonia and methanol, that act as powerful antifreezecompounds. Sandwiched between an outer Ice-Ih shelland an inner high-pressure ice shell, these compoundscould significantly affect both the thickness of the outershell and the depth of the ocean[3].The phase diagram for methanol-water solutions at atmospheric pressure is shown in Fig. 1. As a methanolwater mixture is cooled, ice crystals precipitate out until the peritectic point is reached, at a temperature ofapproximately 171 K and a concentration of 69%, atwhich point CH3OH · H2O begins to form. Below theeutectic temperature of 150 K, the the system solidifies completely. The eutectic concentration is approximately 88 wt%. At higher pressures, the behavior ofthe peritectic and eutectic temperatures is not known.������������������������������ ��� ��� ��� ��� �����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������Figure 1: Atmospheric pressure phase diagram for methanolwater solutions, adapted from Kargel[4]. Data are from Vuillard & Sanchez[5] and Miller & Carpenter[6].Experiment: Approximately 1 mL of sample wasloaded into a pressure cell. This cell is made from a316 stainless steel block with four ports. Two opposing ports contain plugs that have sapphire windows forthe imaging system, sealed with epoxy. The third portcontains a plug with a silicon diode thermometer, andthe fourth connects the cell to the pressure system. Afiber optic light is used to illuminate the sample, and aninverted periscope is used to obtain images. The pressure system includes a transducer that responds approximately linearly to changes in volume of the sample. Thepressure cell is insulated, and temperature can be controlled between 200 and 300 K. Cooling below 200 K isdone with liquid nitrogen. We generally use very slowcooling and warming so that equilibrium can be closelyapproximated.For these preliminary investigations, we choseto study an intermediate concentration of 40 wt.%methanol in water, similar to that used by Zhong etal.[7] Although the eutectic concentration is 88 wt.%,the relevant concentrations for planetary applicationsare likely much lower. Deschamps et al. estimate[3]that Titan's primordial ocean might have contained∼ 4wt.% of methanol relative to water.Sample Run: A sample data run is shown in Fig. 2for a nominal pressure of 315 MPa. 0.2 0.21 0.22 0.23 0.24 0.25 0.26 190  200  210  220  230  240  250  260  270  280Voltage (V)Temperature (K)(a)(b)(c)  (d)  (e)  (f)Figure 2: Transducer Voltage (approximately linearly relatedto volume) vs. Temperature for a run at a nominal pressure of315 MPa.The system started at point (a) as a homogeneous fluidat about 270 K, and was cooled steadily. As the systemcooled, the fluid contracted. After the system becamesupersaturated, ice crystals precipitated starting at point(b). The volume decreased, indicating that the ice crystals were denser than the surrounding fluid. Comparisonof the temperature to the pure ice phase diagram suggests that the ice phase was Ice-II. Upon further cooling, the system froze and became an opaque solid. Anadvancing solidification front is shown in Fig. 3. Based1894.pdf

on the atmospheric pressure phase diagram (Fig. 1), itseems likely this solidifying phase was CH3OH ·H2O.Figure 3: Image taken during the solidification of a methanolwater solution during a run at a nominal pressure of 315 MPa.The original thin ice crystals are visible against a clear liquidbackground, with a solidification front approaching from thelower left-hand side of the screen. The image is approximately1 mm across.Under gradual warming, this solid phase underwenta repeatable melting transition as the system loopedthrough points (c), (d), and (e). The sample volumechanged rapidly, and the crystals could be seen growing or shrinking in the images. Further warming alongthe curve from (e) to (f) gradually dissolved the ice crystals. The point where the last ice crystals dissolve is theliquidus point. However, the final approach to equilibrium is quite slow, and the apparent value of 230 K inFig. 2 is likely an overestimate.At lower pressures, typically less than about 200 MPa,the volume increased upon the initial crystallization ofice crystals, consistent with the growth of Ice-Ih. Asample of growing ice crystals at p = 49MPa andT = 225.8K is shown in Fig. 4. Upon warming, thedendrites dissolved and floated upward, again indicating that they were less dense than the surrounding fluid.At the 40 wt.% concentration used in these experiments, a good deal of ice has to freeze before the eutectic point is reached. In the Ice-Ih regime, that icetakes up a greater volume and tends to both fill up theimaging window and to lock up the volume transducerso that measurements are more difficult to interpret. Future experiments will likely use a higher methanol concentration to avoid this problem.Results: The resulting transition temperatures areshown in Fig. 5. The phase boundaries for pure water[8]and methanol[9] are included for comparison. The IceIh/Ice-II transition line is taken from Dunaeva et al.[10]Only two liquidus points are shown, at 1 and 100 MPa,but the liquidus temperature does appear to decreaseFigure 4: Image of ice crystals growing from a methanolwater solution during a run at a nominal pressure of 50 MPa.slightly with increasing pressure. Generally, the freezing behavior follows that of pure methanol. We alsoobserve that the Ice-Ih/Ice-II transition appears to occurat higher pressures in this system than has been reportedfor pure water.�������������������������������������������������� ���� ���� ���� ���� ���� ���������������������������������������������������� ������������������������������������������������������Figure 5: Transition temperatures as a function of pressurefor Methanol-Water mixture. Runs where the ice expandedupon freezing are shown as open squares, while runs wherethe ice contracted upon freezing are shown as solid squares.For modeling Titan's ocean, Deschamps et al. estimated the crystallization temperature as a function ofpressure by interpolating between the pure water andpure methanol values. The results in Fig. 5 indicatethat this is a reasonable approximation, at least over theranges studied to date.References: [1] J. S. Lewis (1971) Icarus 15:174. [2] C.Beghin, et al.
