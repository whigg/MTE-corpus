A TRANSITING 'MEGA-EARTH' IN THE KEPLER-FIELD:KEPLER-10C . P. Futó1 1  University of West Hungary, Szombathely, Károlyi Gáspár tér, H-9700, Hungary (dvision@citromail.hu)Introduction: The  planetary  system  Kepler-10  with two identified planet (signed b and c) is located 565 light-years from Earth in the direction of constellation Draco. Kepler 10 b is a terrestrial super-Earth with a relatively great core mass fraction. The planet c orbits its very old G-type host star with a period of 45.3 days at  a  distance  of  0.241  AU. The basic  parameters  of Kepler-10 c  that had also been previously known and it was recently measured to have a precise mass of 17.2 M⊕ and a radius of 2.35 R⊕  [1].The relatively high average density (7.1 g cm3  -1) indicates  that  a  large  mass  fraction  of  gaseous  envelope could not exist in the uppermost sphere thus  the planet needs to have a mostly rocky composition as opposed to  the  Neptune  in  our  Solar-system.  Kepler-10  c  is more  compact  having  a  relatively high  bulk  density which is consistent a terrestrial-like interior rather than a  Neptune-like  structure.  Considering  the  formation and  evolution  of  exoplanets,there  are  definitely massive terrestrial-type planets which have a mass exceeding to 10M⊕. The most important purpose of this study is to investigate a possible scenario for the internal structure of Kepler-10 c that is likely to constitute a transition in composition between Neptune-like and  massive  terrestrial  planets.  In  this  manner,a  terrestrial-like composition is preferred to be modeled by metallic compounds/silicates/water ice combination.Modeling for the internal structure of Kepler-10c: In  terms of the demonstrated model,this planet  has a metallic core and a silicate mantle which above a water ice belt constitutes the top solid layer. Considering the average density,Kepler-10 c has no dominant water ice content but it is composed mostly of silicates. Based on geophysical and cosmochemical considerations,its water-ice mass fraction consists of Ice VII,Ice X and in a small mass fraction liquid water,water vapor in the outermost layer. In terms of the results of Umemoto and Wentzcovitch [1],the  MgSiO3 post-perovskite (ppv) dissociates into CsCl-type MgO and P21 /c-type MgSi2O5 at 0.9 TPa. P21 /c-type  MgSi2O5  might  dissociate  further  into CsCl-type MgO and Fe2P-type SiO2 on the transition pressure 2.1TPa. These polymorphs are likely to have been the characteristic mineral phases in the cores of gas giants and in the lowermost region of the silicate mantle of massive terrestrial super-Earths. The extreme internal  pressure  and  temperature  is  expected  in  the deep interior of Kepler-10 c which parameters are significantly  higher  than  those  in  the  less  massive  terrestrial-planets,constraining  the  MgSiO3 for  further transitions.  Therefore,I  suggested  the  higher-pressure polymorph  of  magnesium-silicate  post-perovskite  in the deep mantle. The behavior of planet-building materials  is  investigated  at  high  pressures  up  to  a  few thousand gigapascals.In terms of the hypothesis for the formation of the coreless terrestrial planets (Elkins-Tanton & Seager,2008) [3],it  might also be possible that the massive silicate interior of Kepler-10c consists of material which had been  oxidized  fully  before  the  metal-rich  material would sink to form a metallic core. The original ironcomponents,reacting with water,transform into iron-oxide which has been trapped in the mantle. However,in my model I focus on a composition with metallic core and silicate-mantle.The utilized zero-pressure densities of planet building materials-Fe,Ni,FeO,ppv,Ice  VII  and  Ice  X-are 8.3,8.908,5.745,4.26,1.46 and 2.51 g cm3   -1 ,respectively.  Vinet  equation  of  states  [4,5]  have  been  used (<1000 GPa) for computing the interior structure. The modified  TFD  EOS  [6]  is  used  to  derive  planetary properties in the pressure range above ~1 TPa.Results: Taking into account the compositional characteristics  and  the  predictions  of  planet-forming theories,Kepler-10  c  must  have  formed further  away from the central star (beyond the snow-line of its system) than its present location. The central pressure is calculated to be 3350 GPa. A relatively significant water content surrounding a silicate interior is likely for Kepler-10c.  As shown in Figure 1,the thick mantle (6326 km) is surrounded by the water-ice mass fraction with two layer of  ice-phases (Ice VII and Ice X). The Ice VII transforms into Ice X at  ~ 2.168  R⊕.  In  the proximity of  the host  star,the planet  could develop a thin water-vapour atmosphere which has a thickness of minimum 70 km. The mass of water vapour-sphere is likely to be less than 0.1 % by the total planetary mass. Underneath the steam layer,a liquid water layer consists the following spherical shell in a thickness of ~ 190 km.Basic parameters for the metallic core has been calculated finding the core radius 0.983  R⊕  is  for   ~3M⊕ CMF. The modeled planet has a similar total radius to a same mass planet with a slightly smaller core mass fraction and a consequently greater mantle mass fraction. Moreover,if Kepler-10 c had no metallic core, a larger total radius would be computed for it in case of the same water-mass fraction than that of the modeled version.1024.pdf

In the lower region of the mantle,the pressure exceeds 0.9 TPa. Accordingly,a phase boundary is presumable located  ~ 2625 km above the core-mantle boundary -depth  6084 km,at the radius of 1.395  R⊕,where MgSiO3-perovskite undergoes to a higher pressure phase by structural transition. The lowermost mantle is made from  CsCl-type MgO and P21 /c-type MgSi2O5  (postpost-perovskite,p-ppv).  This  phase  might  be  more stable than ppv within the wide range of silicate-mantle (or  complete interior)  pressures  for  the case of  most massive  silicate-dominated  planets.  A  density  difference arises across the gradual dissociation which is estimated to be 3-4 percent above 0.9 TPa for the higher pressure phase of MgSiO3. The p-ppv region is 26 % of the silicate-mantle volume fraction. The  viscosity  values  in  the  lower  mantle  of  most massive  terrestrial  planets  are  might  be  extremely high>1031  Pas. The lower region of their mantle is assumed as being a non-convective zone. In terms of the geological  time-scale,  Kepler-10  c  is  very old,however,the internal heating is thought to be even sufficient  to  sustain  convection  in  the  upper-mantle. Moreover,the  lower  region  of  the  mantle  (above  the core-mantle boundary,CMB) is a conductive zone with no convective system owing to the high viscosity which is a temperature/pressure dependent parameter.  In  conclusion,Kepler-10 c has  a  silicate  interior  in a great  fractional  volume which is  consisted mostly of ppv and  in a less volume fraction the aforementioned ultrahigh-pressure phases of MgSiO3.Figure 1. The modeled interior structure for Kepler-10 c:water ice mass fraction above a terrestrial composition.Summary:Considering the modeled  composition and the possible circumstances of Kepler-10c,it need to be interpreted as a new type of silicate planets which can be  classified  to  a  new  planet-class,so-called  'megaEarth'.References: [1]  Dumusque  X.  et  al.2014.Astrophysical  Journal,789,154  [2]  Umemoto  K.  et  al.  2011.Earth  and  Planetary  Science  Letters,311,225-229.
