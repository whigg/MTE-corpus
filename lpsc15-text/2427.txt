In dilute solutions, pyroxene weathering is influenced by pH and temperature [1, 2] and weathers relatively rapidly over geologic time scales compared to many other silicates. Dissolution rates are expected to be highest at low pH, reach a minimum near pH 4-5, and then increase at a lower rate than is observed in acidic solutions as the pH becomes more more alkaline [1, 3].  Despite relatively fast chemical weathering rates under terrestrial conditions, pyroxene grains are detected by OMEGA in dune fields on the surface of Mars, often in association with sulfate minerals [4]. Chloride salts have also been observed in association with Noachian-Hesperian aged weathered deposits [5] and in Martian meteorites [6]. These mineral associations may be indicators of progressive dessication of the post-Noachian Martian surface. Limited data exists on pyroxene weathering in brines. This knowledge gap handicaps our ability to effectively model the geochemistry of the Martian surface as it evolved from a relatively water-rich hydrologic system to a water-restricted, brine dominated system near the end of the Noachian.This study investigates pyroxene dissolution in post-Noachian analog NaCl and Na2SO4 brines, to determine how pyroxene weathers in high salinity fluids. Previous research on jarosite weathering in brines indicates chloride complexes iron, leading to preferential iron release from the mineral surface during dissolution and the subsequent precipitation of Fe-oxides [6]. Fe rapidly oxidizes during weathering in dilute solutions,  resulting in preferential Fe removal from M2 sites in pyroxene and precipitates as Fe-oxides [3]. However, Fe-oxidation rates decrease in high ionic strength solutions, which should reduce brine weathering rates [3, 7]. Feoxidation rates also decrease in in sulfate versus chloride solutions, which would indicate that mineral lifetimes on Mars should increase if sulfate brines are present [3]. Results from this study will inform models of mineral-water interactions on post-Noachian Mars, which may ultimately affect our assessment of Mars' potential habitability.   Methods: A augite sample ((Ca0.96, Na0.04)(Fe0.33, Mg0.65, Al0.01)(Si1.9,Al0.03)2O6) obtained from  Wards Scientific (#466474)  was characterized using electron microprobe and BET surface area analysis.  Pyroxene was crushed with a mortar and pestle, sonicated to clean mineral surfaces before reaction and dried. Batch experiments were conducted in triplicate with 1g pyroxene/L solution using ultra pure water (UPW) and saturated NaCl (aw=0.75) and Na2SO4 (aw=0.15)  brines at 25oC [8, 9]. Samples were taken at ~7 day intervals for 60 days and acidified with high purity nitric acid. Cations (Fe and Ca) were determined using flame atomic absorption analysis. Dissolution textures were evaluated in UPW and NaCl using AFM and SEM.  Dissolution in Dilute Solution: Pyroxene dissolution in UPW is initially incongruent with  Ca:Fe = 2.5  (Figure 1). During this time period, pH increased ~1 pH unit, from 6.5 to 7.5, which corresponds to initial dissolution of pyroxene due to proton attack [7], resulting in initial releases of  1.1x10-4 M Ca and 2.3x10-5  M Fe. Over the course of the experiment Fe-release increased, resulting in steady state Ca:Fe ratios of ~1.4 and  final Ca and Fe concentrations of 4.8x10-4 M and   2.8x10-4  M respectively.   Dissolution in Brines: Despite Ca:Fe ratios of 2.9 in the starting material, total molar release of Ca was only ~0% greater than Fe in NaCl brine, with final Ca concentrations of 6.0x10-4 M and Fe concentrations of 3.6x10-4 M respectively. Steady state Ca:Fe ratios were similar in NaCl brine (1.3) and UPW (1.4). In contrast, pyroxene dissolution was impeded in Na2SO4 brines, with final Ca concentrations of 1.4x10-4 M and Fe concentrations of 1.8x10-4 M. Sulfate stability constants for Ca and Fe are relatively weak in water (βCa=2.91 v. βFe=2.25 in water) [10] and expected to decrease in low water activity Na2SO4  brine, therefore little SO42- 2427.pdf

complexation of Ca or Fe is expected to occur. However, gypsum precipitation may account for some reduction in Ca concentrations in solution, and precipitation of  secondary sulfate salts may explain the cooccurrence of sulfates, pyroxene, and other silicate grains in dunes on Mars. Future analysis of secondary reaction products is expected to elucidate the weathering processes occurring within brine solutions. Similar dissolution textures were observed in UPW and NaCl brine samples with AFM and SEM. Both UPW and NaCl brines displayslight etching at particle edges, typical for  the incipient formation of  "denticles" due to preferential removal of cations along the direction of the silicate chains [11]. Linear features along prismatic surfaces could not be distinguished from cleavage partings observed on unreacted grains.  Implications for Mars: Despite decreased water activity in NaCl brines, observed dissolution rates approach those measured in UPW once the reactors reached steady state.  In contrast, olivine dissolution rates were observed to decrease by an order of magnitude in NaCl-CaCl2-H2O brines [12]. Therefore, olivine grain lifetimes may exceed pyroxene in high salinity brines. Moreover, dissolution in in chloride brines results in mobilization of Ca and Fe into solution, which may facilitate the formation of Fe-oxides and silicarich deposits. These processes may account for the coassociation of Cl-enrichments, siliceous rocks, and Feoxides near "Home Plate", Gusev Crater, Mars [4].  In contrast, the co-occurrence of sulfate minerals and pyroxene grains on the Martian surface may be linked to decreased pyroxene dissolution rates in sulfate brines. Decreased dissolution rates in sulfate brines may be due to (1) decreased water activity, (2) precipitation of gypsum, which would remove Ca from solution or (3) decreased Fe-oxidation and removal of Fe from the M2 site [3, 7]. Future analysis of reaction products should further elucidate the pyroxene dissolution process in sulfate brines. References:  [1] Hausrath (2008) Geology, 36, 67-70.
