Introduction: Impact craters are the most fundamental geomorphological  process in the inner parts of Solar System. Their role is obvious in the formation of Mars, the Moon and Mercury which reflect the history of a heavy  bombardment  period,  4.6  -  3.3  Ga  ago  [1]. Photogeologic analysis of the Moon surface combined with  age  dating  of  samples  from  Apollo  and  Luna missions  has  provided  age  and  size  dependent functions  of  lunar  impact  rate  [2,  3].  Several approaches were proposed to estimate cratering rate on Earth based on recalculation of lunar crater production function and geological dating of nearly 180 terrestrial astroblems (Ivanov, 2008a).  In our study we use this data  to  test  possibility  of  presence  of  specific  type impact structures in the Antarctic Ice Sheet, the oldest and largest terrestrial ice sheet. Accumulation rate: Theoretically, a number of craters at  given  region  is  a  function  of  surface  area  S, accumulation  time  T and  crater  diameter  D.  The surface of the Antarctic is 12 400 000 km2 (2.4 % of Earth). The age of ice in the Antarctic ice sheet varies from 0 at  the surface  to  960  k.a.  in deep  basal  ice cores  from Dome Concordia  [5].  According to  basal ice  age  model  [6]  the Antarctic  is  divided  in to  the Western Antarctic, with a basal ice age <200 k.a. and central part of the Antarctic ice sheet with a basal ice age  >200  k.a..  In  our  study  we  did  not  take  into account  regional  variations  in  age  and  calculations were  performed  for  three  sets  of  T:  10  k.a.  (lower limit), 100 k.a. (median) and 1 000 k.a. (upper limit). To  predict  number  of  craters  in  Antarctica  we used Earth  crater  production  functions  from  Melosh  [7] (equation 1) : K=1/(1400·D2)                                                    (1) where  D  -  crater  diameter  (km),  K  -  impact  rate (number of  craters  with diameter  > or  = D per  year generated  on  all  Earth),   and  validated  them  by Neukum lunar production function adapted by Ivanov to Earth [8]. Results presented in figure 1 and 2 show good agreement and possibility of several 1-3 diameter craters presence in Antarctica.      Crater  morphology  and  evolution:  Absence  of discovered icy astroblems on Earth makes it impossible to   directly   investigate   icy   astroblems   as done for           Fig.  1  Cumulative  number  of  craters  in Antarctica  accumulated  per  10,  100  and  1000  ka. Estimation made by equation (1) Fig. 2 Cumulative number of craters in Antarctica accumulated per 10, 100 and 1000 ka. Adapted from all  Earth surface  impact  craters  accumulation rate calculations - fig. 8 in [8] craters in rock. Icy craters exist on Martian polar caps as well as on icy satellites of Jupiter and Saturn, but they  were  formed  under  different  conditions  from Earth, namely ice composition and temperature, gravity  and  impact  velocity.  Recently  developed  models predict specific features of icy craters for wide range of conditions in the Solar System [9].  In  our model we assume that  basic morphology of  3  km diameter  icy crater is characterized by the same structure as craters in  rocks  plus  layer  of  melt  water  freezing  in  to  ice lining crater  floor (fig.  3, age 0).  Crater evolution in time  is  combination  of  several  factors.  The  Central Antarctic snow and blizzard mean annual accumulation rate  of  <  5  cm [10]  can  be  taken  as  lower  limit  of surface coverage rate resulting in 20 k.a. life time of 1 km deep  crater.  Snow blizzards  and  fluidity  of  ice, especially in case of absence of evident crater  swell, may shorten crater life time to approximately several k.a.. After the end of obliteration stage (fig. 3, age <20 k.a.) buried impact structure continue its evolution at depth.  It  moves  in  horizontal  direction  with  glacier from the  accumulation  area  to  the  ocean  as  well  as continuing to be buried by snow, as a result of which astroblem  moves  in  the  direction  down  from  the surface.  Dipping  of  impact  structure  also  means  the structure is  flattering under pressure (fig.  3,  age 100 k.a.). Fig.  3  Icy  crater  primordial  morphology,  structure and evolution. Geophysical identification: The Antarctic ice sheet is characterized  by  monotonous  flat  relief  which  is disturbed only by fields  of  megadunes or by extensive smooth  variations  in  underneath  bedrock  relief.  The obvious task for the first step in search for Antarctic astroblems  is  the  identification  of  distinctive subcircular relief depressions with diameter up to 3 km using  altimetry  data.  However,  our  calculations  of accumulation rate of impact structures taken together with estimations of its life time predict low possibility of  crater  presence  in  modern  glacier  relief.  The presence  of  buried  in  ice  and  altered  astroblems  is more probable. The Antarctic ice sheet may contain a number of astroblems from 1-3 km craters (fig. 1 - 2). Their search may be based on radar data. Signature of astroblem  in  radar  data  is  subcircular  n·km  scale structure with complex of anomalous layers (fig. 3, age 100  k.a.):  (1)  layer  of  frozen  melt  water  with  big vertical ice crystals, (2) layer with scattered projectiles fragments,  (3)  unconformity  of  bottom  astroblem boundary with primordial glacier layers. Summary: As we are only in the beginning of solving this  complicated  multidisciplinary  question,  here  we present no definite answer but mainly the methodology of Antarctic ice craters survey. The Antarctic ice sheet may contain a number of astroblems buried in ice and modified  from 0  - 3  km craters.  Their  signatures  in radar data may be predicted by modeling of icy craters formation and evolution. Drilling and sampling of icy astroblem is  essential  to  understanding possibility of preservation of asteroid and comet material in ice. References:  [1]  Gomes R, et al.
