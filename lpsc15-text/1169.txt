Their role is obvious in the formation of Mars,the Moon and Mercury which reflect the history of aheavy  bombardment  period,  4.6  –  3.3  Ga  ago  [1].Photogeologic analysis of the Moon surface combinedwith  age  dating  of  samples  from  Apollo  and  Lunamissions  has  provided  age  and  size  dependentfunctions  of  lunar  impact  rate  [2,  3].  Severalapproaches were proposed to estimate cratering rate onEarth based on recalculation of lunar crater productionfunction and geological dating of nearly 180 terrestrialastroblems (Ivanov, 2008a).  In our study we use thisdata  to  test  possibility  of  presence  of  specific  typeimpact structures in the Antarctic Ice Sheet, the oldestand largest terrestrial ice sheet. Accumulation rate: Theoretically, a number of cratersat  given  region  is  a  function  of  surface  area  S,accumulation  time  T and  crater  diameter  D.  Thesurface of the Antarctic is 12 400 000 km2 (2.4 % ofEarth). The age of ice in the Antarctic ice sheet variesfrom 0 at  the surface  to  960  k.a.  in deep  basal  icecores  from Dome Concordia  [5].  According to  basalice  age  model  [6]  the Antarctic  is  divided  in to  theWestern Antarctic, with a basal ice age <200 k.a. andcentral part of the Antarctic ice sheet with a basal iceage  >200  k.a..  In  our  study  we  did  not  take  intoaccount  regional  variations  in  age  and  calculationswere  performed  for  three  sets  of  T:  10  k.a.  (lowerlimit), 100 k.a. (median) and 1 000 k.a. (upper limit).To  predict  number  of  craters  in  Antarctica  we usedEarth  crater  production  functions  from  Melosh  [7](equation 1) :K=1/(1400·D2)                                                    (1)where  D  –  crater  diameter  (km),  K  –  impact  rate(number of  craters  with diameter  > or  = D per  yeargenerated  on  all  Earth),   and  validated  them  byNeukum lunar production function adapted by Ivanovto Earth [8]. Results presented in figure 1 and 2 showgood agreement and possibility of several 1-3 diametercraters presence in Antarctica.      Crater  morphology  and  evolution:  Absence  ofdiscovered icy astroblems on Earth makes it impossibleto   directly   investigate   icy   astroblems   as done for           Fig.  1  Cumulative  number  of  craters  inAntarctica  accumulated  per  10,  100  and  1000  ka.Estimation made by equation (1) Fig. 2 Cumulative number of craters in Antarcticaaccumulated per 10, 100 and 1000 ka.

and  impact  velocity.  Recently  developed  modelspredict specific features of icy craters for wide range ofconditions in the Solar System [9].  In  our model weassume that  basic morphology of  3  km diameter  icycrater is characterized by the same structure as cratersin  rocks  plus  layer  of  melt  water  freezing  in  to  icelining crater  floor (fig.  3, age 0).  Crater evolution intime  is  combination  of  several  factors.  The  CentralAntarctic snow and blizzard mean annual accumulationrate  of  <  5  cm [10]  can  be  taken  as  lower  limit  ofsurface coverage rate resulting in 20 k.a. life time of 1km deep  crater.  Snow blizzards  and  fluidity  of  ice,especially in case of absence of evident crater  swell,may shorten crater life time to approximately severalk.a.. After the end of obliteration stage (fig. 3, age <20k.a.) buried impact structure continue its evolution atdepth.  It  moves  in  horizontal  direction  with  glacierfrom the  accumulation  area  to  the  ocean  as  well  ascontinuing to be buried by snow, as a result of whichastroblem  moves  in  the  direction  down  from  thesurface.  Dipping  of  impact  structure  also  means  thestructure is  flattering under pressure (fig.  3,  age 100k.a.).Fig.  3  Icy  crater  primordial  morphology,  structureand evolution. Geophysical identification: The Antarctic ice sheet ischaracterized  by  monotonous  flat  relief  which  isdisturbed only by fields  of  megadunes or by extensivesmooth  variations  in  underneath  bedrock  relief.  Theobvious task for the first step in search for Antarcticastroblems  is  the  identification  of  distinctivesubcircular relief depressions with diameter up to 3 kmusing  altimetry  data.  However,  our  calculations  ofaccumulation rate of impact structures taken togetherwith estimations of its life time predict low possibilityof  crater  presence  in  modern  glacier  relief.  Thepresence  of  buried  in  ice  and  altered  astroblems  ismore probable. The Antarctic ice sheet may contain anumber of astroblems from 1-3 km craters (fig. 1 - 2).Their search may be based on radar data. Signature ofastroblem  in  radar  data  is  subcircular  n·km  scalestructure with complex of anomalous layers (fig. 3, age100  k.a.):  (1)  layer  of  frozen  melt  water  with  bigvertical ice crystals, (2) layer with scattered projectilesfragments,  (3)  unconformity  of  bottom  astroblemboundary with primordial glacier layers. Summary: As we are only in the beginning of solvingthis  complicated  multidisciplinary  question,  here  wepresent no definite answer but mainly the methodologyof Antarctic ice craters survey. The Antarctic ice sheetmay contain a number of astroblems buried in ice andmodified  from 0  - 3  km craters.  Their  signatures  inradar data may be predicted by modeling of icy cratersformation and evolution. Drilling and sampling of icyastroblem is  essential  to  understanding possibility ofpreservation of asteroid and comet material in ice. References:  [1]  Gomes R, et al.  (2005)  Nature 435:466–469.
