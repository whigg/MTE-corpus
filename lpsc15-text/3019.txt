To fully leverage the information available byremote sensing researchers have often studied the effects of determinant factors such as grain size, illumination and acquisition geometry, temperature on the reflectance spectra of planetary analog samples, which areobserved in the lab under controlled conditions. Sincethe effect of such factors is wavelength dependent (e.g.[1]) researchers have often explored the characteristicsof reflectance spectra over several wavelength ranges,for example combined observations of spectra in theVisible and Near InfraRed (VNIR) and Mid InfraRed(MidIR) have been performed for the characterizationof surface species on Mars (reference).The spectral characterization of mineral speciesin different ranges generally requires accurate intercalibrated data from different instrument, often fromdifferent laboratories. Many variations and inconsistencies in the measurements exist. Reflectancegeometries (biconical vs. bidirectional), instrumentapertures, measurement conditions are highly variable,depending on facilities at the labs where spectra wereacquired resulting in inconsistencies in the spectrawhen considered over a large range of wavelengths.We have established a spectroscopy lab at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst to characterize thespectral and optical properties of minerals at differentranges using only one instrument and the same set up.Our instrument has the capability to acquire reflectanceand transmittance measurements of samples in the visible, near-IR, mid-IR and far-IR from 25000 to 10 cm−1,(0.4 to 1000 μm). The spectrometer operates under vacuum and can automatically set the illumination and observation angles. The spectrometer can perform bothBiconical (or quasi-bidirectional) reflectance measurements at room temperature and under vacuum and transmission measurements at room temperature and undervacuum.The Instrument Setup:The backbone of the setup is a Bruker Vertex 80VFTIR spectrometer. The Vertex 80V can be operatedunder vacuum conditions which eliminates the effectsof the atmosphere from the measured spectra. Thecomplete setup is shown in Figure ??. The Vertex80 is equipped with VISNIR and MidIR light sources,with the liquid nitrogen cooled MCT detector (12000−600 cm−1 or 0.833 − 16.666 μm) and the room temperature Silicon Diode, which covers a range between25000 − 9000 cm−1, (0.4 − 11.111 μm ). A CaF2Figure 1: A513/QA reflectance accessorybeamsplitter is used for the visible and near infra-redmeasurements i.e. in the range 25000 − 9000 cm−1(0.4 − 3 μm) while a KBr beamsplitter is used for theMidIR wavelength ranges. The instrument capabilitiesare also extended to cover the Far Infrared (FIR) withan externally adapted Hg-arc FIR source, a Terahertzbolometric external detector and the possibility of 3 different ranges: 25 μm Mylar beamsplitter, with spectralrange 120 − 20 cm−1 (83.333 − 500.000 μm); 50 μmMylar beamsplitter, with spectral range 60 − 10 cm−1(166.666 − 1000.000 μm) and a Multilayer beamsplitter, with spectral range 680 − 30 cm−1,(14.705 −333.333 μm). The instrument also allows 12 differentaperture settings to achieve better SNR. The standardspectral resolution is better than 0.2 cm−1, with a resolving power greater than 300, 000 : 1 in the visiblerange. The instrument is equipped with an automaticbeamsplitter exchange unit so that measurements in different ranges are possible without breaking vacuum.In addition, the A513/QA reflectance accessory enables specular and diffuse reflectance measurements atdifferent illumination geometries i.e. different incidence and emission angles. The reflectance accessoryis equipped with motorized arms which allow the incidence and emission angles to be independently andcontinuously varied over a wide range i.e. between(13o − 83o). The A513/QA reflectance accessory isshown in Figure. (1).The accessory is placed in the sample FTIR compartment, which enables room temperature vacuum bidirectional reflectance measurements.The sample holder was modified to include a translationstage that allows the measurement of multiple samples3019.pdf

The sample preparation is described in an accompanying abstract (reference). In the visible regionLabsphere Spectralon was used as analogue of a Lambertian scatterer whereas in the NIR and MIR regions aLabsphere Infragold target was used.Figure (2) shows the effect of change in incidence andemission angles on the spectrum of a single Olivinesample (grain size 300-500µm) showing an expectedtrend (e.g. [1]) while Figure (3 shows the effect of grainsize variation on a a Diopside sample.Finally, the spectrum for an Olivine sample (grainsize 300-500µm, incidence angle=15o and emission0.5 0.8 1.000.20.40.60.81VISNIRReflectance1.16  1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0Wavelengths [µm]                               NIR106 − 150 [µm]150 − 180 [µm]300 − 500 [µm]Figure 3: VISNIR spectra for diopside incidenceangle=15o and emission angle=40o))angle=40o) is shown in Figure 4 (red) compared to aspectrum (blue) of a different sample of San CarlosOlivine from the RELAB database measured under similar (but not equal) conditions (grain size 250-500µm,incidence angle=0o and emission angle=30o).Future Work: The immediate next step would beto find the optical constants for these endmembers byassuming that the grain sizes composition remains constant by using the technique described here [?]. Following we plan to use a non-linear least squares basedsolver and the measurements of the same sample at different angle to calculate both grain size distribution andthe optical constants at the same time.References: [1] B.
