OORT CLOUD COMET ENCOUNTERS WITH MARS, EARTH, VENUS AND MERCURY.  Renu Malhotra (Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721; renu@lpl.arizona.edu)    Introduction:  The close encounter of Mars with an Oort Cloud comet Siding Spring C/2013 A1 on October 19, 2014 was of great interest for its transient and long term effects on the planet’s atmosphere.  What is the frequency of such events in the inner solar system?  A rough estimate for the mean time between encounters of parabolic comets with terrestrial planets – Mars, Earth, Venus and Mercury – is obtained here.  Parabolic comet encounter frequency:  Oort Cloud comets (also known as ‘long period comets’ or ‘new comets’) in the inner solar system have a nearly isotropic distribution of orbital planes, nearly parabolic orbits, and an approximately uniform distribution of perihelion distances; the rate of new parabolic comets (of absolute magnitude brighter than about 10) entering the Earth’s orbit is approximately 3 per 4 years [1].  From these observations, we can estimate that the rate of such comets crossing Mars’ orbit is approximately 1.14 per year.  The mean residence time of such parabolic comets within Mars' orbit is about 0.34 years. This yields the steady state number of parabolic comets within 1.52 AU of the Sun of about 0.39. Therefore, the steady-state number density of parabolic comets in Mars crossing orbits is about 0.026 per cubic AU; we will denote this by 𝜈. The relative velocity during a Mars' encounter of such parabolic comets is approximately in the range of 20-60 km s-1 (see Figure 1). We can estimate the mean time between encounters by imagining that such comets appear randomly in the space near Mars, with a mean speed V = 40 km s-1 relative to Mars.  Then the mean time between encounters at flyby distances up to d is given by T♂(d) ≈ 1/(𝞹d2V𝜈) ≈ 3.3x106 yr (d/105 km)-2 (see Figure 2).   For Siding Spring C/2013’s flyby distance (d ≈ 140,000 km), the mean time of encounters is ~1.7 myr.    For Earth, Venus and Mercury, a similar calculation finds that the mean time for encounters with parabolic comets is 2.1 myr x (d/105 km)-2, 1.5 myr x (d/105 km)-2,  0.8 myr (d/105 km)-2,   respectively (see Figure 2).   Comet tail lengths typically exceed 106 km. Parabolic comet encounters with the terrestrial planets, with flyby distances of less than 106 km, occur with a frequency of about one per ten thousand years.   0 50 10000.010.020.03encounter velocity (km/s)MarsEarthVenusMercuryFigure 1.

Encounters with periodic, ‘short period’ comets (including the so-called Jupiter-family comets and Halley family comets) require different considerations than presented above: periodic comets are rather more predictable than the random, unpredictable encounters with long period comets.
