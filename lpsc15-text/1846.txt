Introduction:  NWA 7533 (and paired meteorites) is a Martian polymict regolith breccia [1-3]. It consists of a variety of clasts cemented by a fine-grained interclast crystalline matrix. These brecciated meteorites offer an opportunity to investigate the mineralogical evolution of the Martian regolith. NWA 7533 contains abundant clasts, including monomineralic pyroxenes with exsolution lamellae interpreted to be of plutonic origin [2,3]. We report here on the investigation by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the microstructure of four coarse-grained monomineralic pyroxene clasts. The objective is to analyse the exsolution and shock microstructures in order to constrain the cooling history of the clasts and their degree of shock metamorphism.   Methods:  A section of NWA 7533 was first studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Four pyroxene clasts showing evidence of exsolution in BSE images were selected for extraction of electron transparent thin sections by the focused ion beam (FIB) technique. The FIB work was done using a FEI Strata DB 235 at IEMN, University of Lille, France. The FIB sections were studied with a FEI Tecnai G2-20 Twin (LaB6, 200 kV) and a Philips CM30 (LaB6, 300 kV) at the electron microscopy center of the University of Lille, France. Both instruments are equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) for elemental microanalysis.  Results:  Three Ca-rich pyroxenes (bulk compositions En38Fs18Wo44; En50Fs15Wo35; En43Fs25Wo31) and one Ca-poor pyroxene (bulk composition En53Fs36Wo11) were studied. All the samples contain pigeonite/augite (001) lamellae resulting from subsolidus exsolution (Fig. 1). The average width and periodicity of lamellae vary from one sample to another. Their widths range from 0.15 to 1.5 µm and their average periodicities range from 2.4 to 6.4 µm. For the sample with the coarser primary lamellae, a secondary set of lamellae developed, parallel to the first one, both in augite and pigeonite. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns show that augite and pigeonite belong to the C2/c and P21/c space groups, respectively. The lamellae are crystallographically coherent with the host pyroxene. For the Ca-rich samples, some planar (100) defects are locally lying in the pigeonite lamellae. They are probably stacking faults formed by plastic deformation in order to relax the strain associated with the small lattice parameters differences (including the monoclinic  angle) between augite and pigeonite. Augite-pigeonite composition pairs were measured for each sample in order to estimate the submicron-scale closure temperature of the development of the exsolution microstructure.    Figure 1: Low magnification TEM image of the (001) exsolution lamellae in a Ca-rich pyroxene. The lamellae are crossed by (100) twins.   All Ca-rich pyroxene samples display numerous twin lamellae on (100) with an average spacing equal to 500 nm (Fig. 1). The thickness of the twin lamellae varies from one sample to another, ranging from 5 to 115 nm. The twin lamella thicknesses are closely related to the presence of partial [001] dislocations in the twin boundaries (Fig. 2). These dislocations, clearly in glide configuration, attest to the mechanical origin of the twins. Most of the twins are continuous across the pigeonite lamellae. When crossing them, a shearing displacement is clearly visible for the exsolution domain with an amplitude proportional to the thickness of the twin lamella (Fig. 3). In one of the Ca-rich samples, free perfect dislocations are also locally present in low density. They have [001] Burgers vectors and lie in the (100) glide plane.  Within two samples, we observed that the Ca-poor pyroxene areas were locally transformed into Fe-oxide and silica. The Fe-oxide is presumably magnetite, however its full identification is not completed at the time of the writing of this abstract. Most of the silica is found as amorphous but in some area appears as crys1846.pdf

talline and has been successfully identified as cristobalite by SAED.    Figure 2: Partial [001] dislocations in the (100) twin boundaries.

Discussion and conclusion:  Subsolidus exsolution development in pyroxene is controlled by temperature and time. Exsolution characteristics thus provide information about the cooling history of the pyroxene clasts in NWA 7533, which were obviously pieces of magmatic material before being embedded in the brecciated rock. All the studied samples have comparable microstructure revealing a slow cooling rate, similar to those of other Martian meteorites studied so far by this method [e.g., 4-5]. Nevertheless, the exsolution characteristics (thickness and spacing of lamellae) of the four clasts clearly reveal a large range of cooling rates. In addition, according to the subsolidus phase equilibrium between augite and pigeonite [6], the samples do not show the same sub-µm-scale equilibration temperature. These measured equilibration temperatures range from 700 to 950°C. These characteristics show that the clasts may originate from different parent magmatic rocks or did not cooled at the same depth.  The shock microstructure of the Ca-rich pyroxene samples is highly dominated by (100) twins. The glide of partial dislocations in the twin boundaries enabled plastic deformation, as revealed by the shear of the exsolution lamellae crossed by the twins. Twinning on (100) can be activated at relatively low shock intensity or static deformation at high strain rate [e.g., 7-9]. Except for one sample in which free dislocations are locally observed, no other shock markers are encountered (such as fractures, twinning on (001), mosaicism, planar deformation features). Altogether, the microstructure of the pyroxene clasts revealed a low shock intensity, consistent with the lack of maskelynitisation of feldspars and contrasting significantly with the other Martian meteorites studied so far. The crystal defect microstructure is very comparable from one sample to another, suggesting that the twins formed during the same event, i.e., an event involving the brecciated rock. It also means that the clasts were unshocked prior to being incorporated in the breccia.  In two samples, within the Ca-poor pyroxene areas, we have found evidence of pyroxene transformation into Fe-oxide and silica. This reaction is commonly ascribed to oxidation of the pyroxene Fe end-member  that produce magnetite and silica [10]. It occurred in NWA7533, after the exsolution process, at high temperature and high oxygen fugacity (at least 2-3 log unit above FMQ [10]). Trivalent iron-rich Fe-oxides are also present in abundance within the fine-grained matrix [11-13], their formation mechanism could be related to one another.  References: [1] Agee C. B et al..
