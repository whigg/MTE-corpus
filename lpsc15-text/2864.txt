 PHOTOPHORESIS: POTENTIAL SORTING MECHANISM IN A PROTO-PLANETARY DISK.  J. L. Smallwood, L. S. Matthews, and T. W. Hyde, CASPER, Baylor University, Waco, Texas, 76798, USA.   Introduction: The details of planet formation are still largely unknown, but it is understood that the initial stage of planet formation depends primarily on the coagulation of micon-sized dust grains [1] [2]. One unexplained observation is that the density of the planets in our solar system decreases with increasing distance from the sun. One such force that could be responsible for this phenomenon is the photophoretic force, which can dominate the dynamics of illuminated particles in a low pressure environment. Dust grains illuminated by the central star are unevenly heated. As gas molecules come into contact with the grain, the molecules on the hot side accommodate to the surface temperature and transfer more momentum to the grain due to their greater rebound velocities. This difference in momentum transfer results in a force which is (usually) directed away from the illumination source [3] [4] [5]. Metallic grains are thermally conducting and thus develop a smaller temperature gradient versus non-metals or silicates, thus more metallic grains may stay near the star while silicate grains are pushed outward [5].  Drop-tower experiments and numerical simulations have shown that aggregate grains have greater drift velocities than spheres of equivalent mass, and that the aggregates have trajectories which can deviate substantially from the direction of illumination [6]. This work also indicates that the forces are dominated by ΔTphotophoresis, due to the temperature difference across the grain surface rather than Δα-photophoresis, in which the temperature accommodation coefficient varies over the aggregate surface.  This study examines the photophoretic force acting on aggregates including the effects of grain rotation..  Numerical Method:  The drift velocity of aggregates subject to the photophoretic force is determined by calculating the momentum transferred as gas molecules collide with and are re-emitted from the surface. The aggregates modeled were comprised of spherical monomers, with the surface of each monomer  divided into smaller patches. These patches are used to determine the photon flux to each point, the temperature gradient across the grain, the flux of gas molecules incident on the surface, and finally the momentum transfer to the aggregate. The simulation assumes a light source along a given direction.  Each point is checked to determine whether the illumination direction is blocked by another monomer in the aggregate.  The average temperature of an aggregate was set equal to the mean gas temperature T, with the average temperature of a given monomer Ti determined by the fraction of its surface which is illuminated, such that shadowed monormers have a lower mean temperature than fully-illuminated monormers. The temperature of each point was then adjusted based on the illumination flux and the distance from the last illuminated point, as illustrated in Figure 1. Momentum Transfer Calculations: The incoming gas particles are assumed to move on straight-line paths which are not blocked by other monomers within the aggregate, or open lines of sight (LOS).  The number of particles impacting a surface per unit area per unit time is given by the flux, I   𝐼 =  𝑛 ∭ 𝑣 cos 𝛼𝑓(𝑣)𝑑3�̅�  (1)  where n is the particles' number density, v cos α  is the component of the velocity normal to the surface, and f(v) is the Maxwellian velocity distribution. The integral over the angles in (1) may be separated into an integral over the magnitude of the velocity and an integral over the angles  𝐼 = 𝑛 ∫ 𝑣3𝑓(𝑣)𝑑𝑣 ∞0 ∬ cos 𝛼 𝑑Ω.  (2)  The integral ∬ cos 𝛼 𝑑Ω, the LOS_factor, depends on the open lines of sight at the surface. Points on an aggregate may have lines of sight which are blocked by other monomers within the aggregate, so the LOS_factor is calculated numerically for each patch.  Details of the method are given in [7].   It is assumed that all gas particles which collide with the aggregate equilibrate with the local surface temperature before being ejected, as in [5].  Ejected particles may escape into space along an open LOS or collide with another monomer. If the rebound direction is blocked by another monomer in the aggregate, the gas is assumed to equilibrate with the new surface temperature, and the process repeats until an open rebound direction is selected. Rebounds continue until 99.99% of the gas has escaped; the remaining particles are assumed to rebound along the "average" open LOS for each patch. The momentum transfer from an ejected gas particle is canceled if the gas particle collides with another monomer in the aggregate.  Thus, the calculations consider only momentum transfer from the initial incoming gas particles and from gas particles rebounding along open paths.  The change in momentum, and thus the force, at each point is given by  𝑭 = ( 𝒑𝑜𝑢𝑡 ∆𝑡 )𝑝 − ( 𝒑𝑖𝑛 ∆𝑡 )𝑝  (3) = 𝑚𝐴𝑝[𝐼′𝑝(𝒗𝑠,𝑝 − 𝒗𝑎𝑔𝑔,𝑝) − 𝐼𝑝(𝒗𝑔,𝑝 − 𝒗𝑎𝑔𝑔,𝑝)]   where m is the mass of the gas particle, Ap the area of the patch surrounding a point,  Ip the gas flux at point p calculated by Eq. 2, 𝐼′𝑝 the flux adjusted for rebounding gas particles, vs the velocity determined by the surface temperature and vg the rms  velocity of the gas, given by 𝑣𝑔,𝑠 =  √8𝑘𝑇𝑔,𝑠 𝜋𝑚⁄ . The direction of 𝒗𝑠is determined by the rebound direction, while the direction of 𝒗𝑔 is along the average open LOS at that point. The local velocity of the aggregate, including rotation, is given by 𝒗𝑎𝑔𝑔,𝑝. The average photophoretic force is determined by repeating the calculations numerous times and subtracting the force imparted by the gas when there is no temperature gradient present. The torque on the aggregate is calculated by 𝚻𝑃ℎ = ∑ 𝒓𝑝 × 𝑭𝑝,   (4) where 𝒓𝑝 is the distance from each point on the surface  to the center of mass of the aggregate.       The photophoretic force and torque are then used to calculate the linear and rotational acceleration of the dust grain.  A dynamics code determines the new position and orientation of the grain, and the photophoretic force is recalculated using the new orientation.  In this preliminary model, the rotation is assumed to be slow enough the the temperature is only determined by the current illumination, and not the temperature at the previous time step. Results:  Preliminary results show that an nonrotating aggregate has a slightly different trajectory from a rotating aggregate, as shown in Figure 2. The photophoretic torque acting on the rotating aggregate is on the order of 10 -17 Nm. The rotating aggregate has a greater component of force acting in a direction perpendicular to the illumination direction.  Additional work will determine whether the rotations induced by photophoresis cause significant deviations to the grain trajectories or are sufficiently rapid enough to to prevent a temperature differential from developing across the grain.
