From 16 landing sites defined in 2012,  the selection has been narrowed to 4 potential ellipses based on engineering criteria [1]. The landing site selection process is achieved through a combination of various orbital remote-sensing  technologies   (e.g.  laser  altimetry,  imagery, spectro-imagery, spectroscopy, thermal sensing) to assess the terrain relief, surface cohesiveness, rock height  and  rock  abundance  [2].  We will  present  and discuss  the  novel  Radar  Statistical  Reconnaissance (RSR) technique applied to the active 20-MHz Shallow Radar (SHARAD) instrument [3] to support the InSight landing site selection. Shallow  Radar  (SHARAD): SHARAD  onboard the NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) is an active nadir-looking instrument transmitting a 20-MHz central-frequency signal chirped over a 10-MHz bandwidth [3].  A fraction of the energy is partly scattered back and recorded at the antenna for each permittivity gradient (i.e. geologic discontinuities) along the propagation path until signal  extinction, allowing for deep sounding down to ~1.5 km in clean water ice [4]. The atmosphere-surface echo is the first signal recorded by the antenna. Both the high dielectric contrast between these two media and the absence of volume scattering within the atmosphere, combine to give the echo a high signal-to-noise ratio. The radar surface return holds important information valuable for landing site selection since its  amplitude depends  on the surface  composition, density and roughness. Radar  Statistical  Reconnaissance  (RSR): The RSR is a systematic method to extract and invert quantitative surface properties from the radar surface return. It has been recently demonstrated with the High Capability Radar  Sounder  (HiCARS, 60-MHz central  frequency,  15-MHz  bandwidth)  airborne  radar  data  in Antarctica  [5,  6].  The RSR relies on a physical description of the surface echo assuming a stochastic behavior for the surface geometry. Analytically, the surface echo strength detected by the radar antenna is the summation of two fundamental components, the signal reflectance and scattering [e.g.  7]. The contribution of surface  permittivity  and  deterministic  structure  (e.g. thin deposit or layering) is dominant in the reflectance, while  scattering  is  mainly  a  function  of  the  surface roughness and random internal geometries of the nearsurface (e.g. a pile of blocks from a collapsed terrain). Firstly, the RSR aims to extract  the reflected and scattered components of the signal by best-fitting the histogram of  ~ 1000  surface  echo amplitudes  with a theoretical  stochastic  model   (homodyne  K-statistics [8]).  The correlation coefficient of this fit is a confidence factor to estimate the terrain compliance to the model  assumptions.  The  scattering,  reflectance  and correlation  coefficient  give  a  first  qualitative  insight into the surface properties. Once deduced from the fit, they can be used in a backscattering model to produce a landing risk assessment indicator by considering the following surface criteria that affects the signal: Root mean square (RMS) heights, RMS slopes, correlation length,   roughness  homogeneity/stationarity  over  the landing ellipse, and soil porosity [5]. RSR  application  to  SHARAD  data: SHARAD observation tracks are North-South oriented and spaced from 1 to 100 km over the InSight landing region (Figure 1). The MRO ground speed combined with an effective pulse repetition frequency (PRF after onboard pulse pre-summing) of ~175 Hz provides surface sampling every ~ 20 m along-track. It follows that the typical  sampled  space  over  which  the  surface  statistical properties can be retrieved (~1000 successive surface echoes)  is  ~20 km, resolving the  length of  the EastWest oriented 139 km Ã— 27 km ellipses considered for the  2016  InSight  lander  [9].  SHARAD can  achieve ~ 50 dB of signal to noise ratio from a specular and conductive surface,  promising a theoretical sensitivity to  surface  Root  Mean  Square  (RMS)  heights  from 0.01 m to 3 m over a horizontal scale (baseline) ranging from one to few wavelengths (one SHARAD wavelength is 15 m) [5]. Conversely, the radar signal is expected be sensitive to the surface correlation length and RMS slope with baselines in the range of the pulse limited footprint (~ 5 km in diameter across-track) [10]. We  will  present  the  RSR  application  to  the SHARAD data over the 16 preselected landing ellipses for the InSight lander. The results in terms of surface properties and landing risk assessment will be validated by comparison to other remote sensing data used for the  2012  landing site  selection  step  [13].  A detailed landing  risk  assessment  will  be  presented  for  the  4 landing ellipses still under consideration. The obtained results will also illustrate the RSR capabilities to support other future landed missions, especially the ESA's ExoMars 2018 and the NASA's Mars 2020 rover.  Fig  1.  A.
