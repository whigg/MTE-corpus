Pickle Research Campus, Bldg. 196, 10100 Burnet Rd. (R2200), Austin, TX 78758. cyril.grima@gmail.comIntroduction: The NASA's InSight (Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and HeatTransport)  Lander  is  scheduled  for  launch and  Marslanding  in  March  and  September  2016,  respectively.From 16 landing sites defined in 2012,  the selectionhas been narrowed to 4 potential ellipses based on engineering criteria [1]. The landing site selection processis achieved through a combination of various orbital remote-sensing  technologies   (e.g.  laser  altimetry,  imagery, spectro-imagery, spectroscopy, thermal sensing)to assess the terrain relief, surface cohesiveness, rockheight  and  rock  abundance  [2].  We will  present  anddiscuss  the  novel  Radar  Statistical  Reconnaissance(RSR) technique applied to the active 20-MHz ShallowRadar (SHARAD) instrument [3] to support the InSightlanding site selection.Shallow  Radar  (SHARAD): SHARAD  onboardthe NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) is anactive nadir-looking instrument transmitting a 20-MHzcentral-frequency signal chirped over a 10-MHz bandwidth [3].  A fraction of the energy is partly scatteredback and recorded at the antenna for each permittivitygradient (i.e. geologic discontinuities) along the propagation path until signal  extinction, allowing for deepsounding down to ~1.5 km in clean water ice [4]. Theatmosphere-surface echo is the first signal recorded bythe antenna. Both the high dielectric contrast betweenthese two media and the absence of volume scatteringwithin the atmosphere, combine to give the echo a highsignal-to-noise ratio. The radar surface return holds important information valuable for landing site selectionsince its  amplitude depends  on the surface  composition, density and roughness.Radar  Statistical  Reconnaissance  (RSR): TheRSR is a systematic method to extract and invert quantitative surface properties from the radar surface return.It has been recently demonstrated with the High Capability Radar  Sounder  (HiCARS, 60-MHz central  frequency,  15-MHz  bandwidth)  airborne  radar  data  inAntarctica  [5,  6].  The RSR relies on a physical description of the surface echo assuming a stochastic behavior for the surface geometry. Analytically, the surface echo strength detected by the radar antenna is thesummation of two fundamental components, the signalreflectance and scattering [e.g.  7]. The contribution ofsurface  permittivity  and  deterministic  structure  (e.g.thin deposit or layering) is dominant in the reflectance,while  scattering  is  mainly  a  function  of  the  surfaceroughness and random internal geometries of the nearsurface (e.g. a pile of blocks from a collapsed terrain).Firstly, the RSR aims to extract  the reflected andscattered components of the signal by best-fitting thehistogram of  ~ 1000  surface  echo amplitudes  with atheoretical  stochastic  model   (homodyne  K-statistics[8]).  The correlation coefficient of this fit is a confidence factor to estimate the terrain compliance to themodel  assumptions.  The  scattering,  reflectance  andcorrelation  coefficient  give  a  first  qualitative  insightinto the surface properties. Once deduced from the fit,they can be used in a backscattering model to producea landing risk assessment indicator by considering thefollowing surface criteria that affects the signal: Rootmean square (RMS) heights, RMS slopes, correlationlength,   roughness  homogeneity/stationarity  over  thelanding ellipse, and soil porosity [5].RSR  application  to  SHARAD  data: SHARADobservation tracks are North-South oriented and spacedfrom 1 to 100 km over the InSight landing region (Figure 1). The MRO ground speed combined with an effective pulse repetition frequency (PRF after onboardpulse pre-summing) of ~175 Hz provides surface sampling every ~ 20 m along-track. It follows that the typical  sampled  space  over  which  the  surface  statisticalproperties can be retrieved (~1000 successive surfaceechoes)  is  ~20 km, resolving the  length of  the EastWest oriented 139 km Ã— 27 km ellipses considered forthe  2016  InSight  lander  [9].  SHARAD can  achieve~ 50 dB of signal to noise ratio from a specular andconductive surface,  promising a theoretical sensitivityto  surface  Root  Mean  Square  (RMS)  heights  from0.01 m to 3 m over a horizontal scale (baseline) ranging from one to few wavelengths (one SHARAD wavelength is 15 m) [5]. Conversely, the radar signal is expected be sensitive to the surface correlation length andRMS slope with baselines in the range of the pulse limited footprint (~ 5 km in diameter across-track) [10].We  will  present  the  RSR  application  to  theSHARAD data over the 16 preselected landing ellipsesfor the InSight lander. The results in terms of surfaceproperties and landing risk assessment will be validatedby comparison to other remote sensing data used forthe  2012  landing site  selection  step  [13].  A detailedlanding  risk  assessment  will  be  presented  for  the  4landing ellipses still under consideration. The obtainedresults will also illustrate the RSR capabilities to support other future landed missions, especially the ESA'sExoMars 2018 and the NASA's Mars 2020 rover.1238.pdf
