Introduction: Analyzing  crater  size-frequency distributions  (SFDs)  and  using  them  to  determine model  ages  of  surfaces  is  an  important  technique in understanding  the  Moon's  geologic  history  and evolution. The use of small craters with diameters (D) < 1 km is becoming particularly prolific, especially for analyses  utilizing  the  very  high  resolution  imaging available from Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Narrow and Wide Angle Cameras (LROC-NAC/WAC) and the Selene  Terrain  Camera  [e.g,  1,  2].  However,  in  this diameter  range,  crater  SFDs  can  change  shape depending on the properties of the terrains on which they are recorded  [e.g.,  3-6]. Both the strength of the terrains and how that strength changes with depth are important in determining how the crater SFD will be affected (Fig.  1;  [7]).  If  these influences are ignored crater model ages may not be computed correctly. In this  work,  we  use  the  Model  Production  Function (MPF;  [3]),  which  includes  terrain  properties  in computing the crater production functions, to explore how  incorporating  terrain  properties  affects  the calculation of crater model ages. We also demonstrate how using the MPF can improve estimations of lunar terrain ages. Methods: As an example, we analyze a region in Mare Imbrium containing the Apollo 15 landing site. We  first  compile  a  crater  SFD  for  D=0.01-2  km utilizing LROC-WAC/NAC images (Fig. 2). We use a nested technique to  obtain this wide diameter  range. Craters D=0.5­2 km are measured in the  largest area (2200 km2). The large white box in Fig. 2b indicates the   first   nested   region   where   D=0.09­0.5   km   are measured (95 km2). The smaller white box in Fig. 2b indicates the second nested region where D=0.01­0.1 km craters are measured (1.6 km2; Fig. 2c). Then,   we   quantitatively   fit   the   crater   SFD   with distinct   MPFs   that   use   broadly   different   terrain properties.   Terrain   properties   are   varied   through coarsely altering the parameters  in  the crater  scaling law  [7]  that   represent   material   type   (consolidated, unconsolidated, porous), material tensile strength, and material density (for further details see [3]). Finally, the fits are used to compute the D=1 km crater   model   ages   for   the   region.   These   ages   are compared to radiometric age for Mare Imbrium basalts returned by Apollo 15 (3.25­3.62 Ga; [8]). Results and Discussion:  Table 1 shows the crater model ages computed using the MPF for a variety of terrain  properties.  We  also  indicate  whether  those properties are likely appropriate for the Mare Imbrium basalts (while we do not have the data to determine the exact terrain type, tensile strength, and density, there are broad values that most likely represent the terrain based upon its geology). We first find the model ages can be quite variable indicating that considering strength for these diameters is important. Second, we find the model age that best Figure 1.  Crater  scaling  law for  different  materials [7].  Comparing  two  consolidated  materials  with different strengths (orange vs. blue line) indicates that smaller craters will form for similar impact conditions in a stronger consolidated material and the difference is greater for smaller impactors (arrows). Comparing consolidated  (solid  line)  to  unconsolidated  (dashed line)  materials  indicates  a  crater  forming  in  the unconsolidated material will be smaller.  agrees with the radiometric age is computed with an MPF using parameters for a consolidated material with a tensile strength of 2  x 107  dyne/cm2, reasonable for basalt [e.g., 7]. Model ages not incorporating strength or  using   larger  or   smaller   tensile   strengths   are  well outside   the   radiometric   age   range   (they   also   have poorer fits to the crater SFDs, not shown).  The ability of   the   MPF   to   incorporate   terrain   properties   into calculations of model ages makes it a valuable tool in more accurately estimating ages of lunar terrains. Future  Work: We  will  continue  to  use  this approach  to  constrain  the  influence  of  terrain properties  on  crater  model  ages  by  extending  the variety  of  lunar  terrains  examined.  Furthermore,  we will  explore the effect  of changing terrain properties with depth (i.e., layering) on the computation of model ages. The MPF can currently incorporate a change in terrain properties with depth as a step function. We will use  hydrocode  simulations  to  improve  on  a  layered terrain  crater  scaling  law  [9] and  incorporate  results into the MPF. References:  [1]  Hiesinger,  H.,  et  al.
