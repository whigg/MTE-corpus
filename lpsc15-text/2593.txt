THE STRONTIUM, BARIUM, NEODYMIUM, AND SAMARIUM ISOTOPIC COMPOSITIONS OF NONALLENDE CAIs.  Q.R. Shollenberger1*, G.A. Brennecka2, L.E. Borg1. 1Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA (*shollenberge1@llnl.gov), 2Institut für Planetologie, Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität, Münster, Germany.  Introduction: Calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) were the first solids to form in the cooling protoplanetary disk. Studying the stable isotope compositions of CAIs, therefore provides insightful information about the formation and evolution of our Solar System. The majority of CAIs from the Allende meteorite appear to be isotopically uniform, yet distinct from terrestrial standards in a number of elements spanning a large mass range from ~46 to 164 AMU [16, refs therein]. This observation suggests that these CAIs formed in a homogeneous reservoir that was distinct from that of the terrestrial planets [1]. While CAIs from Allende show convincing evidence of a CAI-forming region that was isotopically homogeneous, little work has been done on heavy isotope systems in CAIs from meteorites other than Allende. Determining the isotopic compositions of CAIs from other meteorites will help determine if the entire CAI-forming region was an isotopically homogeneous reservoir. Below we present the Sr, Ba, Nd, and Sm isotopic compositions of four non-Allende CAIs in an attempt to address this issue.  Samples and Methods:  Four CAIs from four different desert meteorites were selected for study (Table 1). The CAIs were removed from their respective meteorites and digested using Parr bombs, followed by multiple treatments with aqua regia. Chemical separation for a suite of elements was done following the methods outlined in [1]. Table 1 - Characteristics of the CAIs in this study. Meteorite Type CAI   Mass (mg) Unnamed CK3 Homer  136.1 Unnamed CK5 Bart  68.6 NWA 6619 CV3 Marge  111.7 NWA 6991 CV3 Lisa  53.4  Isotopic measurements.  The Sr, Ba, Nd, and Sm isotopic compositions of the samples and standards were measured on a Thermo Triton TIMS at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). Internal normalization was used to correct for instrumental mass bias for all isotope systems. Internal normalization values are: 86Sr/88Sr=0.1194, 134Ba/136Ba=0.3078, 146Nd/144Nd=0.7219, and 147Sm/152Sm=0.56081.  Results & Discussion: The isotopic compositions of select elements are presented below. The uncertainties shown represent the 2SD of replicate analyses of typical unknowns run under similar conditions [1]. For clarity, internal uncertainties associated with individual measurements are not included in the plots. Strontium and Barium Isotopes. Both the Sr (Fig. 1) and Ba (not shown) isotopic patterns are consistent with the nucleosynthetic signatures found in previously published Allende CAIs [1, 5]. Nevertheless, isotopic differences between CAIs are resolvable. This variation is consistent with addition of terrestrial Sr and Ba associated with desert weathering.   Figure 1. - Sr isotopic compositions of CAIs compared to previously published data from Allende CAIs [1]. Data from 87Sr is not shown due to radiogenic ingrowth from 87Rb.  Neodymium Isotopes. Deficits in 145Nd, 148Nd, and 150Nd exist in these CAIs compared to terrestrial standards (Fig. 2). The Nd isotopic composition of CAIs Lisa, Bart, and Marge is in excellent agreement with previous work. Neodymium isotopic data is not reported for Homer due to an extremely low abundance of Nd in this sample.

Samarium Isotopes.  Relatively large 144Sm deficits of ~3ε units exist in all CAIs compared to terrestrial standards (Fig. 3). Interestingly, small and variable deficits exist in 149Sm that are paired with relative excesses in 150Sm. Slight deviations from terrestrial standards may exist in 148Sm and 154Sm, but are not easily identified using 147Sm/152Sm normalization.     Figure 3. - Sm isotopics of the measured CAIs compared to previously published data from Allende CAIs [1].  The measured Sm isotopic composition in these CAIs agrees broadly with the previously published values for Allende CAIs, however significant differences exist, most notably in 149Sm and 150Sm. While previous Sm isotope anomalies in CAIs were attributed solely to nucleosynthetic processes [1], the differences in the isotopes 149Sm and 150Sm in these samples are most easily attributed to thermal neutron capture on 149Sm (Fig. 4). Thermal neutron capture (due to the large thermal capture cross-section of 149Sm) has been observed in multiple studies of lunar and bulk meteoritic samples [i.e., 7, 8], however, evidence for neutron capture in CAIs has not been observed in previous work. As shown in Fig. 4, CAIs from this work, as well as Allende CAIs, plot parallel to a theoretical neutron capture prediction line with essentially the same slope. This is a very strong indication that neutron capture processes are responsible for the anomalies in 149Sm and 150Sm.  Although these effects are probably present in Allende CAIs at a measurable level, they were not previously recognized due to the similar magnitude of the effect in all Allende CAIs combined with the nucleosynthetic differences between samples and standards. However, the significant offset between the lines in Fig. 4 is very likely due to nucleosynthetic differences between CAIs and terrestrial standards. When neutron capture effects on 149Sm and 150Sm are corrected, the nucleosynthetic signatures observed in the CAIs reported here are consistent with previous work on Allende CAIs (Fig. 4). Following calculations from [8], the neutron fluence (Ѱ) for the CAIs analyzed here is calculated to range from 0.20 to 22.3×1014 neutrons/cm2. Note that that a nucleosynthetic excess on 150Sm of ~0.6ε (taken from the y-intercept of the CAI regression in Fig. 4) was removed prior to neutron fluence calculations for all CAI samples.   Figure 4. - The theroretical neutron capture prediction line for 149Sm producing 150Sm plotted with the average Allende CAIs [1] and CAIs of this study. The solid regressed line includes CAIs from Allende as well as this work.  Conclusions: The four non-Allende CAIs analyzed in this study appear to have formed with very similar isotopic signatures to Allende CAIs for the elements Sr, Ba, Nd, and Sm and suggest that the CAI-forming region was isotopically homogenous. Slight variations in the Sr and Ba isotopic compositions are most easily explained by contamination of these mobile elements from a terrestrial source. Less mobile elements, such as Nd and Sm, are not as easily affected by terrestrial contamination. Consequently, these isotopic compositions of CAIs found in desert meteorites are more likely to represent the original source composition of the CAI. The Nd and Sm isotopic compositions of nonAllende CAIs and Allende CAIs agree well within uncertainty when neutron capture processes are taken into account. References: [1] Brennecka et al.
