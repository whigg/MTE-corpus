The cathodoluminescence properties are used to evaluate the crystallization effects and shock wave history as well as the degree of space weathering processes of asteroid Itokawa. This can aid in understanding more about the formation mechanism of the LL chondrites. Furthermore, they provide new insights regarding spectral changes of asteroidal bodies due space weathering processes.       Samples and Experimental Procedure:  A systematic cathodoluminescence investigation was done at Okayama University of Science (Okayama, Japan), as follows. A SEM-CL system containing a SEM (JEOL: JSM-5410LV) combined with a grating monochromator (OXFORD: Mono CL2), having a retractable parabolic mirror coated with aluminium (collecting efficiency of 75 %), provided the CL spectral measurements for this study.  Raman spectral measurements were carried out using a LabRam Confocal Spectrometer (632 nm excitation) for the single spectrum at Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (Jena, Germany) and for the Raman mapping by a WITec Alpha 300 spectrometer (532 nm) at Department of Geology, University of Johannesburg (South Africa).      Results: Two plagioclase samples (RA-QD020025-01 and RA-QD02-0025-02) were selected for the systematic Scanning Electron MicroscopeCathodoluminescence (SEM) imaging including Backscattered Electron (BSE), Secondary Electron Images (SE) and Cathodoluminescence (CL) (Fig. 1ae). In general, there is a homogeneous distribution of the CL patterns. Only the RA-QD02-0025-01 sample shows some CL-zoning, which may be due to the thermal effect of the irradiation delivered from the synchrotron-XRD investigation [1,2]. Otherwise, neither shock metamorphism including high-pressure polymorphs (i.e, maskelynite) nor shock-induced microdeformations such as Planar Deformation Features (PDFs) can be discernible in the selected samples and imaging properties.       Cathodoluminescence spectral features of two Hayabusa plagioclase samples exhibit two emission centers:  a broad band at around 450 (2.82 eV) and a shoulder peak at around 420 (3.04 eV) nm (Figs. 1a and 1b; 2a,b,d,e). Spectral composition after deconvolution shows two components at around 2.8 (defect center) and 3.0 eV (Ti-activator) (Figs. 2c and f). Raman spectral features have peak positions at 485, 500 and 514 cm-1 (bending modes) [3], which are superimposed on relatively high background fluorescence. These observations indicate that both particles have a highly disordered crystalline structure, which would be occurred by a shock event or radiation effect. However, further investigation must be done to classify these processes.             Figure 1.

Discussion: The activator-related emission centers in feldspars can be summarized as follows. In general, the luminescence emission band centered at around 570 nm is due to Mn2+ in M sites (most probably Ca2+ sites) and is most clearly detected in plagioclases [4,5]. It is less common in K-feldspars because of the difficulty of the Mn2+-K+ substitution (Mn concentrations in terrestrial alkali feldspars are mostly< 10 ppm). Measurements on synthetic [5] and natural plagioclases [6] have shown a clear correlation between the intensity of the green emission band and the manganese content from <10 ppm up to a critical self-quenching value of about 1 mole percent Mn2+. Furthermore, Mn2+ activation is common in extraterrestrial plagioclases. For example, in the studied lunar and meteoritic plagioclases the emission due to Mn2+ plays a key role as one of the most intense emission centers [7,8]      Because of the sensitivity of the Mn2+ emission to the local crystal field, a shift of the emission band to longer wavelength due to the shock metamorphism can be detected. Reddish-orange emission in feldspars due to vitrification of plagioclase by shock waves was reported by Sippel and Spencer [9] or due to lattice damage caused by impact events by Ramseyer et al. [10].      Geake et al. [7] and Telfer and Walker [5] showed that the red emission band around 700 nm is due to the 4T1  6A1 emission of Fe3+, which occupies Al3+ tetrahedral sites in the feldspar. Generally, the Fe3+ emission is very common in many terrestrial feldspar types, but it is weak or absent in lunar plagioclases, which has been ascribed to low fO2 during plagioclase crystallization [4]. Nevertheless, the occurrence of the CL emission band at ~700 nm indicates that at least some of the iron in lunar plagioclases is ferric iron [8].       Conclusions: It was observed that the CL image as well as spectral properties of plagioclase samples exhibit bright emissions in blue region with relatively homogeneous intensity. This implies that the plagioclase formed by thermal metarmorphism at subsolidus temperature at an extreme low oxygen fugacity. In this case, plagioclase has often little or no Mn2+, because Mn2+ does not fit well in the Na+ position. However, further analyses on these particles must be done in the future work.
