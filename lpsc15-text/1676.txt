Introduction: Jupiter's icy satellite Europa is thought to host a persistent subsurface ocean overlain by an ice shell, and is the most promising candidate for extant life among the Galilean satellites [1,2,3]. Melting and freezing at a small boundary layer under the ice shell should occur on semi-diurnal (42-hr) time scales. Understanding the dynamics of this layer gives clues into the history of active turbulence at this boundary, and the geological processes that drive the interior ocean. Understanding heat and material transfer between the ocean and ice shell will also provide information about the fundamental physical and chemical processes that are responsible for the distinct surface features of Europa. This work focuses on dynamics of refreezing after a melt event, how that influence the basal ice growth rates, and implications for Europa's tidal response.  Methodology: We adapted the model of McPhee et al., 2008 [4] which parameterizes doublediffusive processes at Earth's ice-ocean interface. Heat and salt content in Europa's ocean were adopted from published literature Table 1 [5].  Table 1: model parameters                 Exchange of heat and salt, and the rates of melting and freezing, depend on the balance of enthalpy at the interface: upward heat flux from the bottom of the ocean <w'T'>; upward heat conduction at the bottom of the ice column (q); and latent heat associated with melting or freezing, 𝑤𝑜  𝜌 𝐿𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ , where wo=-(ρice/ρ)dh/dt is the isostatically balanced ice melt rate. This balance is summarized as: −𝑞 +  𝑤 ′𝑇 ′  𝑜 =  𝑤𝑜   𝜌𝑤  𝐿𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑠 ℎ    (1) We varied one parameter at a time to assess the influence on both the basal ice growth rate "h" and double diffusion tendency "R" for two different values of ice shell thickness: 10 and 20 km. This tendency R for double-diffusive convection is defined as the ratio of the interface heat exchange coefficient αh to the interface salt exchange coefficient αs.  Results and Discussion: Application of terrestrial seawater and sea ice parameters to Europa predicts a strong double-diffusion tendency at the iceocean interface for a plausible range of values for the heat flux, <w'T'> between 0.05 and 0.5 W/m2, the value is R ~200 for 20 km ice thickness, as is shown in Figure 1.    Figure 1: Modelled ice growth rate (h) and the double diffusion tendency (R) at fixed heat flux into the ice column (q), A: heat conduction (q) corresponding to 20 km ice thickness, B: heat conduction (q) corresponding to10 km ice thickness. The ice growth rate is small for the values of heat flux considered here.  For both 20-km and 10-km ice shell scenarios, double diffusive convection is proportional to the heat flux from the ocean (Fig. 1A and 1B). We estimate maximum ice growth rate (h) from freezing at about 0.7 mm/day for the minimum heat flux of 0.05 W/m2. See the pattern in Figure 2.

   Figure 2: ice growth rate (h) and double diffusion tendency (R) for a fixed heat flux from the bottom of the ocean (w'T'), A: maximum heat flux estimated (w'T') = 0.3 W/m2, B: minimum heat flux estimated (w'T') = 0.05 W/m2.  We calculated salt flux  𝑤 ′𝑆′  from parameterized turbulent salt flux:    𝑤 ′𝑆′ 𝑜 = 𝛼𝑠  𝑢∗ 𝑑𝑆         (2) The minimum salt flux leading to double diffusive convection for a 20 km ice shell is ~6.2x10-6 psu m/s (Fig. 3). Discussion and Conclusions: By analogy to processes in sea ice on Earth, we predict a strong double-diffusive tendency (large R), at Europa's iceocean interface for all plausible values of oceanic heat flux (<w'T'> 0.05 - 0.5 W/m2) due to even small imbalances with heat transport through the ice (q), for example due to the onset or elimination of hydrothermal activity.  Double-diffusion implies significant production of super-cooled water near the interface, where heat is extracted from the upper ocean faster than salt is injected downward. Depending on the way ices form (e.g., frazil or congelation) and the way brines distribute within them, the ice-ocean interface may not provide a distinct dielectric interface for detecting the ice shell thickness using radar or acoustic sounding.  Alternatively, lateral variations in resolved radial structure, from sounding profiles of the iceocean interface, may provide important clues into the nature of oceanic transport.  The models we are developing provide a starting point for quantifying and interpreting ice-ocean interactions based on future exploration.
