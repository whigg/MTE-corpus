Several chronological methodshave been applied to the meteorite, yielding ages ranging from 30 Ma to 4538 Ma [3, 4]. The meteorite appears to bear imprints of wide-ranging events throughtime during the Solar era. One of the unique featuresof the meteorite is presence of abundant melt, resultingfrom catastrophic impact [1]. The melt on the meteoriteprovides an excellent opportunity because it yields information regarding the absolute time of the bombardment on near-Earth object.In order to reveal evolution of a small asteroid, weundertook a comprehensive characterization of the meteorite, including chronology. Here we present a part ofanalytical results and discuss history of the Chelyabinskmeteorite, focusing on the period between the shockmelting and entry into Earth's atmosphere.Experiments: All analyses were performed at thePheasant Memorial Laboratory, Institute for Study ofthe Earth's Interior, Okayama University [5]. Thin sections (n=13) were made for each fragment. Distribution of major phases was estimated by X-ray mapping. Raman micro-spectroscopy and EBSD were applied to identify minor phases. Sub-micron observation was conducted by FIB-FETEM. Analytical effortswere focused on five fragments, which were powderedwith a SiN mortar. Abundances of 46 elements weredetermined by XRF (n=3), AAS (n=3), and ICPMS(n=16). Whole-rock H- and O-isotope analyses (n=2,27) were performed using a gas-source-MS. Wholerock Li-isotope analyses were undertaken using MC(a) "ancient" (b) "re-processed"meltvfusioncrustFigure 1: Phase maps of two thin sections of "ancient" and"re-processed" lithologies. Colored phases are .ol, .opx,.di, .pl, .ap, .mer, and .gl. Scale bars = 10 mm.ICPMS (n=6). In-situ major- and trace-element abundances, and Li-O isotope-abundances were determinedby FEEPMA, LAICPMS, and SIMS (nspot=240 formajor-element, 150 for trace-element including water,200 for Li-isotope, and 180 for O-isotope). Employinga five-step acid-leaching, six aliquots (each containingmultiple phases) were obtained from each powder. Forchronological study, acid-leached aliquots and wholerock were analyzed by TIMS with Sm-Nd (n=38) andRb-Sr (n=100).Results and Discussion: Studied fragments havetwo lithologies. Apparent visual heterogeneity is attributed to distribution and proportion of melt (0-47%).Fragments free from melt preserve "ancient" lithology including chondrule textures. Whole-rock oxygenisotope compositions show links to equilibrated LLordinary-chondrite. Occurrence of high-pressure polymorphs of olivine (wadsleyite and ringwoodite) and plagioclase (maskelynite) infers that a part of body reachedpressures up to 26 GPa [6].A "re-processed" lithology is characterized by abundant melt with rocky breccias (Fig. 1).

closes breccias with a sharp boundary and consists ofolivine phenocrysts, spherules of troilite-metal, and interstitial glass. Vesicles on troilite spherules suggest degassing at the melting under a relatively low pressurecondition.Element abundances of whole-rock and silicates arecompared (Fig. 2). Ancient and re-processed lithologiesshow similar abundance. Whole-rock abundance of elements other than water is consistent with that calculatedfrom major silicates.Addition of water after catastrophic impact would beinferred. Reconstructed whole-rock [H2O] from silicates corresponds to merely a few percent of the measured one, suggesting an existence of another reservoir. There is no difference in whole-rock [H2O](0.7 wt%), between ancient and re-processed lithologies(Fig. 3a,b). These facts suggest the aqueous fluid integration did not take place earlier than the catastrophicimpact. A colloform texture of Fe-oxides (Fig. 3c) waslikely formed by an interaction between Fe-metal andaqueous fluids. The Fe-oxides fill cracks in the vicinity of (Fe,Ni)-metal, supporting the aqueous interactionafter abundant cracks formed by bombardments.To determine a timing of the most catastrophicbombardment, absolute age of glass in re-processedfragments was determined. Sr-contribution of thephases in each analysis is estimated using traceelement-abundances of aliquots determined by ICPMS,those of minerals determined by SIMS, and modalabundances of the phases by X-ray mappings. Twodistinct arrays are formed by aliquots from two different lithologies. Sr-isotopes of ancient lithology aredominated by plagioclase, and yield an age consistentwith the age of the Solar system 4.567 Ga (Fig. 4a).Rb-Sr system of re-processed lithology (Fig. 4b)is constrained mainly by glass, and yields an age of153±58 Ma.Conclusions: A comprehensive characterization ofthe Chelyabinsk meteorite was conducted.

The re-processedone is characterized by the melt, formed by catastrophicimpact. With step-wise leaching, the age of the meltingwas determined to be 150 Ma.The water abundances of whole-rock and silicates require another reservoir. The existence of colloform Feoxide supports that the reservoir should be non-silicates,and its source was incorporated into the Chelyabinskparent body after the impact melting. Our whole-rockH-isotope analysis that represents the reservoir, δ2H−100, is consistent with spectroscopic observation oncomets [7, 8], and laboratory analysis on cometary matter [9]. The source of the water reservoir was addedafter 150 Ma. A possible vehicle to be enriched in wateris icy asteroid, comet. The ancestor of the Chelyabinskmeteorite could be accreted as a comet after 150 Ma.References: [1] O. P. Popova, et al. (2013) Science342:1069. [2] J. Borovicˇka, et al. (2013) Nature 503:235.[3] A.
