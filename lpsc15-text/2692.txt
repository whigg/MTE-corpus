THE LUNAR CRATERING RATE OVER THE LAST 1 GY INFERRED FROM THE AGE OF THE LUNAR RAY CRATERS   Quantin C.1,  Trey B. 1, Amet Q1, P. Allemand1, 1 Laboratoire de Géologie de Lyon Terre, Planètes, Environnement, France, 2 rue Raphaël Dubois 69622 Villeurbanne Cedex, France  (cathy.quantin@univ-lyon1.fr)    Introduction:  From the link of lunar crater density analysis and the radiometric ages of the Apollo samples [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the impact rate in the inner solar system has been estimated about constant over the last 3 Gy [1, 5]. However, this statement is not well constrained. We still do not know if the impact rate has been decreasing over the last 3 Gy as suggested by [6] or by [7] and/or if the impact rate has experimented spikes as suggested by the impact spherule in Apollo samples [7, 8] or by the collisional evolution models of the asteroids belt [9]. The rayed impact crater population on the Moon has been interpreted as the youngest impact craters on the surface of the Moon to have conserved their bright rays pattern. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) onboard Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) provides high resolution images down to 50 cm per pixel. These images give us the remarkable opportunity to assess the small size crater density that super-imposed to the rayed crater since their formation. We systematically analyze the crater density postdating 92 lunar rayed craters. This allows us for the first time to assess the relative age of the lunar rayed craters and suggest their absolute ages. These results raise discussion about he conservation of the rays and the impact rate over the last 500 My.    Method :We construct a Geographic Information System (GIS) to combine lunar data set at a wide range of spatial resolution. Our GIS includes: global data set released to public by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), as well as geo-processed LROC images: the wide angle LROC images (LROC WA) at around 60 m per pixel and the LROC narrow angle images (LROC NA) at 50 cm per pixels.   LROC NA data allow us to document the crater size frequency distribution (SFD) down to 4 m of diameter. We mapped all the craters down to 4 m present on the rayed impact crater floor. We exclude crater count on crater ejecta to avoid self secondaries impacts contamination and we restrict our crater counts on the floor of the impacts. As crater floor have often undergone resurfacing processes like crater wall sliding, we carefully avoid to count on such young part of crater floor looking for the more densely impacted part of the crater floors.  Despite these precautions, we have to keep in mind that we are assessing by this method the minimum age of the rayed craters. As we adopt the same method for all rayed crater, we are confident at least in relative age we obtain. We plotted our result in incremental representation of crater size vs crater density from [9] (Figure 1). The incremental diagram being more sensitive to slope variations of the distribution than cumulative plots [10].     Figure 1: (a) Image of Copernicus inner floor with the superimposed small craters counted in red; (b) SFD on the Copernicus melt pond.    Results: We analyze the crater size distribution over 92 lunar rayed craters that are a merge of rayed crater database from [11] and [12].  The figure 2 presents the global map of the rayed craters studied here. The diameters of the studied rayed crater range from 15 to 127 km. The number and size of rayed craters related to the surface of the Moon reveal a crater size distribution with a lower slope than the theoretical isochrones. The  density of rayed crater larger than 88 km in diameter imply an age of 3 Gy while the rayed crater smaller than 22 km seems to have been conserved only after 800 My. These results are consistent with previous estimation of ray conservation that suggests all rayed crater on the Moon are preserved for the last 1 Gy [12].    The deduced age from small size crater density analysis range from 4.2 Gy to 0.5 My according to the Hartmann age model [9]. But in order to analyze the cratering rate, we restricted our further analyze to the rayed crater younger than 1 Gy, to be sure we are analyses the entire cratering record, assuming that rayed crater are correspond to the entire record. We analyze the cumulative number of rayed crater younger than 1 Gy. This reveals a clear increase of the number 2692.pdf

of rayed crater with time. This resembles to the apparent increase with time obtained on Martian landslides or on Martian cratering processes that where interpreted by [6] as an issue with the impact rate model used in the age model. [6] suggested that these apparent increase with time may be explained by the cratering rate decreasing by a factor of 3 over the last 3 Gy instead of being constant as it is hypothesized in the age model. We suggest here also that the apparent regular increase of the formation of rayed crater of the Moon may just be explained by an overall decrease of the cratering rate over the last 500 My.     Then we apply an age model that includes the overall decrease of the cratering rate over the last 3 gy as suggested by [6]. We re-analyze the age distribution of the rayed crater younger than 1 Gy with age model. We highlight variation of the impact rate over the last 500 My with spikes of cratering around 500 my and around 100 My.     Conclusion: We determine the ages of the lunar rayed craters. We confirm that the rayed craters are a complete record of the impact rate over the last 1 Gy. Our results suggest an overall decrease of the impact rate over the last 1 Gy as well as spikes of cratering at 500 My and 100 My.
