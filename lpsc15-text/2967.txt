CLEANING UP DEGREE-2: THE CONTRIBUTION OF IMPACT BASINS AND MASCONS TO THE GRAVITY FIELDS OF THE MOON, MERCURY, AND OTHER TERRESTRIAL PLANETS.  J.T. Keane1 and I. Matsuyama1. 1Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, Department of Planetary Science, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, 85721, USA (jkeane@lpl.arizona.edu).   Introduction:  The quadrapole gravity field of planets and planetary satellites – quantified by spherical harmonic degree-2 gravity coefficients C20 (or J2) and C22 – provide important constraints on the internal structure of these bodies. Degree-2 gravity coefficients are related to the planet’s moments of inertia, which constrain the radial distribution of density, such as the existence and nature of a planet’s core [e.g. 1-4]. Degree-2 gravity also provides insight into the planet’s long-wavelength, triaxial figure, which records the rotational and tidal deformation of the planet. Depending on the elastic properties of the planet, this triaxial figure may also retain information about the planet’s past orbital and rotational history (a so-called “fossil figure”) [e.g. 5-8]. Most previous work investigating degree-2 gravity fields assume that these two effects (radial density distribution and/or fossil figures) dominate the degree-2 gravity field. However, smaller-scale impact basins, mascons, and tectonic/volcanic features (collectively referred to as mass anomalies) can also have an important contribution to the degree-2 gravity field [e.g. 9-12]. In order to properly interpret the degree-2 gravity fields of terrestrial planets, it is necessary to isolate and remove the contribution of mass anomalies from their host planet’s gravity fields. In this work, we use the methodology of Keane & Matsuyama [2014] to model the degree-2 gravity fields of mass anomalies on the Moon and Mercury. In both cases, we find that the mass anomalies have an important contribution to the observed degree-2 gravity field. In both cases, the resulting degree-2 field is misaligned with the present-day rotational and tidal axes, indicating past periods of global reorientation, or true polar wander (TPW). Isolating the Gravity Field of Mass Anomalies:  Since most planetary mass anomalies (e.g. impact basins, volcanic features, etc.) are axisymmetric at longwavelength, we modeled their gravity fields using a linear combination of concentric spherical caps. For an individual spherical cap, the free-air anomaly, gravitational potential, and individual spherical harmonic gravity coefficients scale linearly with a single (scalar) surface density. For each mass anomaly, we determine the best fitting linear of combination surface densities for the set of caps by fitting the observed gravitational potential (evaluated over a grid of latitude and longitude) to the analytically derived gravitational potential from each of the caps (evaluated over the same grid). To prevent directly fitting the underlying degree-2 figure, we performed these fits from degree-3 and up. As the spherical harmonic gravity coefficients all scale with the same, common surface density, we can then determine the degree-2 gravity coefficients associated with the caps by scaling the analytically-derived degree-2 gravity coefficients by the best-fit surface densities determined from the higher order degrees. Results for the Moon: It has been known for two centuries that the observed degree-2 lunar gravity field is significantly larger than predicted by hydrostatic equilibrium (Table 1) [13]. The long-standing solution to this anomalous degree-2 has been a fossil figure, preserving a time when the Moon was closer to the Earth [14-16] and in either a higher-order spin-orbit resonance, or eccentric orbit [6-7,12]. The latter is problematic for our current understanding with the formation and evolution of the Moon [e.g. 17]. We modeled the gravity signature of the 32 largest lunar impact basins and mascons. In the best-fit solutions (Fig. 1B), most impact basins have a negligible contribution to degree-2 – with the exception of South Pole-Aitken (SPA). Removing the degree-2 contribution of SPA reveals a smaller fossil figure (Fig. 1C) that is misaligned with the present-day principal axes ~20°, indicative of a past-period of TPW driven by the formation of SPA and its global ejecta blanket. If the corrected degree-2 field is reoriented into a principal axis reference frame, the degree-2 field is consistent with the Moon forming on a lower eccentricity, synchronous lunar orbit [12].   Table 1: Observed degree-2 gravity coefficients for the Moon [21-23] and Mercury [19-20]. Hydrostatic degree-2 coefficients are calculated following [7-8]. The fossil figure degree-2 coefficients are the degree-2 gravity coefficients that result when subtracting our mass anomaly models from the observed gravity field, and diagonalizing the resulting inertia tensor into a principal axis reference frame.  2967.pdf

Results for Mercury: Like the Moon, the degree-2 gravity field of Mercury is significantly larger than predicted by hydrostatic equilibrium (Table 1). Possible explanations include a fossil figure (like the Moon) [5,8], contributions from the Caloris impact basin [5,8], to contributions driven by regional thermal anomalies resulting from Mercury’s unique 3:2 spinorbit resonance [18]. With newly available MESSENGER gravity data [19-20], we are able to model the gravity signature of the 3 largest observed mass anomalies: Caloris basin, Sobkou basin, and the northern rise. Despite their smaller absolute gravity anomalies (and relatively small regional extent), these three Hermean mass anomalies all have a significant contribution to the degree-2 gravity field (Fig. 1E). Removing their contribution to degree-2 reveals a smaller fossil figure (Fig. 1F), also misaligned with the present-day principal axes by ~20°. Summary: The degree-2 gravity fields of both the Moon and Mercury are significantly contaminated by the presence of impact basins and mascons. We have developed a novel method for removing the contributions of these mass anomalies from planetary gravity fields. For the case of the Moon and Mercury, this reveals a misaligned fossil figure, consistent with past episodes of TPW. These corrected fossil figures provide important insight into the past rotational and dynamical evolution of these bodies.  The methodology developed here is completely general. In future work, we will investigate the contribution of mass anomalies to all objects for which there is suitable gravity data, including: Mercury [19,20], Venus [24], Earth [25], the Moon [21-23], Mars [26], and Vesta [27].
