POTENTIAL COLLATERAL EFFECTS IN STABLE HAFNIUM ISOTOPES DUE TO THE S-PROCESS PRODUCTION OF THE SHORT-LIVED RADIONUCLIDE 182HF ? W. M. Akram1, M. Schönbächler1 and M.

Introduction: Mass independent, nucleosynthetic isotope variations are reported for several elements across different meteorite groups, relative to the Earth [1]. These variations reflect incomplete admixing of materials with variable isotopic compositions produced in stellar environments. For example, refractory inclusions of the CV3 carbonaceous chondrite Allende display 96Zr excesses, which are characteristic of the weak r-process and charged-particle reactions (CPRs), taking place in core-collapse supernovae (CC SNe) [2]. The same inclusions also display Hf isotope variations (iHf, i = 177,178,179,180) consistent with a main r-process depletion, taking place in SNe environments [2]. Collectively, the Zr and Hf isotope data point to the decoupled nucleosynthesis of light (Z ≤ 56) and heavy (Z > 56) neutron-rich nuclei. This decoupling either corresponds to different nuclear production mechanisms (e.g. CPRs, weak r-process or main r-process) or distinct astrophysical sites (low mass (LM) or high mass (HM) CC SNe) [2]. The Hf isotope data, however, is consistent with both an r-deficit and an s-excess signature. Evidence also exists for the presence of the shortlived radionuclide 182Hf (T½ = 8.9 My) in the early solar system [3,4], which may be synthesized by the rprocess (e.g. CC SNe) [5] or instead, as recently proposed, the s-process in LM asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars [6]. Thus, if a SN or AGB star injects 182Hf into the molecular cloud from which our solar system formed and mixing is not perfect, corresponding s- or r-process enrichments would be expected in the stable Hf isotopes. Here, we re-examine the Hf isotope data to test if we may reconcile the abundance of 182Hf and stable Hf isotopes observed in the early solar system. Method: The data analysis is split into three parts. The Hf data for terrestrial samples and calcium-aluminium rich inclusions (CAIs) are taken from [2]. Two normalization schemes relative to the dominantly r- (179Hf/177Hf) or s-process (178Hf/180Hf) isotopes were utilized. Part (1). Since there are no branchings in the nucleosynthetic path way between 178Hf and 180Hf, the sprocess yields of 178Hf/180Hf are proportional to their respective Maxwellian averaged neutron-capture cross sections, σn(180Hf)/σn(178Hf) (e.g. see [7]). Hence, we here use this feature to infer the neutron-capture cross sections for Hf isotopes using independent isotope analyses of meteorites.  Part (2). Utilizing two-component mixing models [8], mixing lines between different nucleosynthetic sources and the Earth are computed. This allows us to match the observed Hf isotope variations in CAIs to a particular stellar source, and the nucleosynthetic process(es) taking place within. The models considered include: (i) the classical and (ii) stellar s-process model predictions for LM AGB stars [9], (iii) a corresponding updated stellar model [10], (iv) a recently proposed stellar model utilizing a new 181Hf half-life [6], (v) a galactic chemical evolution (GCE) model of both LM and intermediate mass (IM) AGB stars [11] and (vi) a Type Ia supernova model [12].  Part (3). The formulation derived in [13] is used to calculate the collateral effects on the stable Hf isotopes for a given amount of 182Hf synthesized in case (iv). These predictions are then compared with the data from [2, 14].  Results and Discussion:   Table 1: Hf isotope data for CAIs.  Data from [2]. Group averages are represented as the weighted averages and their associated uncertainties (2σ).  Based on their Hf, Zr and Ti isotope compositions, CAIs fall into two distinct groups, regardless of the applied normalisation scheme [2] (Table 1). When the data are normalised to the two dominantly r-process isotopes, the majority (5 out of 7) of the CAIs  (denoted CAImaj) yield positive ε178Hf and ε180Hf values, relative to the terrestrial composition. Two CAIs (CAI_NV_3 and CAI_PS_4) constitute a minor subclass (denoted CAImin) and exhibit negative ε178Hf and ε180Hf values (Table 1). Both groups of CAIs and the terrestrial samples define a linear correlation in the ε178Hf-ε180Hf space (denoted A, Fig. 1).  Determination of Hf neutron-capture cross-sections. If we attribute the s-process to account for the Hf isotope correlation, then the gradient of the slope A (i.e. ε180Hf/ε178Hf) is equivalent to the s-process yields of the isotopes 178Hf and 180Hf. In turn, these yields are proportional to the ratio of the neutron capture crosssection, σn(180Hf)/σn(178Hf) [7]. Thus, the gradient of A (1.51 ± 0.4) yields σn(180Hf)/σn(178Hf) = 1.946, which matches the literature value (2.037 ± 0.030, at 30 KeV, measured at the Karlsruhe Van de Graaff accelerator) to within 5% [15]. The isotopic data illustrate that meteoritic analyses may be used to independently verify nuclear parameters relevant for the understanding of  Norm. to 178Hf/180Hf Norm. to 179Hf/177Hf Sample ε177Hf ε179Hf ε178Hf ε180Hf CAImaj -0.10±0.22 -0.25±0.02 0.19±0.01 0.32±0.03 CAImin 0.07±0.07 0.13±0.05 -0.10±0.04 -0.16±0.11 2419.pdf

the s-process.  Possible s-process Hf excesses in the early solar system. Figure 1 illustrates that the diverse s-process models (cases(i)-(iv)) for LM AGB stars and the GCE of LM and IM AGB stars (case(v)) yield similar mixing lines, indicating that the Hf isotope compositions do not vary much from star to star. In all cases, the sprocess source is characterised by positive ε178Hf and ε180Hf, relative to the Earth, whereas depletions are marked by negative ε178Hf and ε180Hf. Overall, the sprocess models reproduce the data trend, A. The agreement between the model predictions of Type Ia and the data are less satisfactory. Thus, the majority of CAIs are consistent with sampling of an excess of sprocess Hf, relative to the Earth, which could also be caused by absent r-process materials. The minor subgroup, CAImin is depleted in s-process Hf. Simple mass balance calculations reveal that the addition of CAIs to CV, CM, CO and CK chondrites, with 3, 1.2, 1 and 0.2 wt% CAIs respectively (CAI abundances form [16]), do not alter the bulk rock chondrite composition significantly (< 11ppm for ε178Hf and < 9ppm ε180Hf). This shows that a heterogeneous distribution of CAIs does not affect the Hf isotope data and is thus consistent with the reported s-/r- process Hf isotope uniformity between the Earth and bulk chondrites [2,14].  Figure 1: Hf isotope data for CAIs and the Earth. Also shown are the various mixing lines obtained by mixing different nucelosynthetic material with the terrestrial isotope composition (see text for more details).  Collateral s-process effects in stable Hf isotopes accompanying 182Hf? The r-process was presumed largely responsible for the production of the 182Hf, owing to the relatively fast β–decay rate of 181Hf (see [6]). Recently, however, newer estimates of this half-life allow the s-process to synthesise up to 6 times the initial production factor in AGB stars [6]. Consequently, the presence of 182Hf in the early solar system can now be attributed to the intervention of AGB stars [6]. This is consistent with the observation of CAIs (CAImaj) sampling excess sprocess material, if the material was not completely mixed into the solar system.  Using the s-process model of [6], and an initial solar system 182Hf/180Hf =1×10-4 [3], the collateral effects expected in the solar system for ε178Hf and ε180Hf are approximately -2.07 and 2.66, respectively (3Msun AGB) and -1.04 and -1.28 (4Msun AGB). The extent of these variations is considerably greater than what is observed in CAIs (see Fig. 1) and bulk chondrites. The latter display compositions that match that of the Earth to within 7 ppm (ε178Hf) and 10 ppm (ε180Hf). This would render anomalies of the order of 1ε clearly resolvable. The absence of such anomalies indicates that the s-process material carrying 182Hf was very well mixed into the molecular cloud and the protoplanetry disk (down to the ~10 % level in agreement with previous studies [8][17]). This is in line with the results from the Hf-W chronometer, which yields consistent ages with other chronometers for various solar system bodies thereby suggesting that 182Hf was homogeneously distributed in the solar system [18]. The exception are CAIs, which preserved both s-process excesses and depletions in Hf isotopes. Conclusions: Stable Hf isotopes that were collaterally produced with now extinct s-process 182Hf [6] were well mixed into our solar system (at the 10 % level). The exceptions are CAIs, where the majority show an excess in s-process Hf, relative to the Earth. These CAIs might have preserved the collateral consequences of the last 182Hf injection. If so, the initial r-process decoupling argument raised by [2] still holds, because these data are consistent with CAIs sampling both (i) an r-excess (due to CPRs and/or the weak r-process) for the lighter elements and  (ii) an s-excess for heavier elements such as Hf, which did not completely erase the unique r-process signature of the light elements.
