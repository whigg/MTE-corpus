HEMISPHERICAL ASYMMETRIES IN H2O ICE BANDS ON THE LARGE MOONS OF URANUS: EVIDENCE FOR SYSTEM-WIDE ALTERATION PROCESSES R. J. Cartwright1, J. P. Emery1, N. Alonso-Pinilla1, A. S. Rivkin2, D. E. Trilling3, 1University of Tennessee, 2John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, 3Northern Arizona University.    Introduction:  Ground-based spectroscopy of the Uranian satellites Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon indicates that their surfaces are dominated by H2O ice mixed with a dark, spectrally neutral constituent that is potentially carbon-rich (e.g., [1-3]). More recent observations of these moons have detected CO2 ice, primary on the trailing hemispheres of the satellites closest to Uranus [4-6]. Similarly, H2O ice bands on the large Uranian satellites also display leading/trailing asymmetries, with stronger bands on their leading hemispheres [4-6] (Figure 1).   The presence of leading/trailing asymmetries in the detected H2O ice bands on all four of these moons suggest that system-wide mechanisms drive the observed differences, as opposed to native geologic processes operating independently on each moon. Two system-wide processes that could generate leading/trailing differences in the composition of these moons are: magnetospheric charged particle bombardment, and micrometeorite impacts by interplanetary/interstellar dust particles (IDPs and ISDPs, respectively) or by intraplanetary dust in-falling from Uranus' irregular satellites. Charged particles (electrons, protons, and heavy ions) caught in Uranus' magnetosphere should preferentially bombard the trailing hemispheres of Ariel and Umbriel due to the higher magnetic field densities closer to Uranus [8]. Irradiation of H2O ice and dark, potentially C-rich materials could drive radiolytic production of CO2 ice and other C-rich, oxidized species [9]. Such a radiolytic production cycle would reduce the amount of exposed H2O ice, and thus, reduce the strength of H2O bands on the trailing hemispheres' of these moons, thereby enhancing leading/trailing asymmetries in H2O ice band strength.  The comparable relative velocities of IDPs and ISDPs (~10 and 30 km s-1, respectively) to the orbital velocities of these moons (~3 - 7 km s-1) should lead to preferential bombardment of their leading hemispheres as the moons intercept dust along their orbits [10], in particular for the moons closest to Uranus where gravitational focusing greatly increases impactor fluxes (e.g., [11]).  Over time, the preferential bombardment of these moons' leading hemispheres by micrometeorites will promote regolith overturn (e.g., [12]), increasing the leading/trailing asymmetry in H2O bands. Unlike IDPs and IDSPs, irregular satellite dust should preferentially accumulate on the leading hemispheres of the regular moons furthest from Uranus due to their proximity to the irregular satellite zone [10].  Thus, charged particle bombardment and micrometeorite impacts are likely enhancing leading/trailing asymmetries in the strength of H2O ice bands on the large Uranian satellites. Data and Methods: To test these different hypotheses, we measured the H2O ice band areas and other parameters in 43 Uranian satellite spectra gathered by three different teams (Rivkin 2000, Grundy 2001 - 2006, Cartwright 2012 - 2013) using the SpeX spectrograph at NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility [13]. H2O ice absorption bands centered near 1.04 and 1.25 μm in spectra of Saturnian satellites [14] are quite weak in the Uranian satellite spectra, and we therefore focus our band parameter analysis on the two larger H2O ice band complexes centered near 1.52 and 2.02 μm (visibly apparent in all 43 spectra, Figure 1). Results: H2O ice band areas for both the 1.52 and 2.02 µm bands are at least one-sigma greater on the leading hemispheres of all four moons compared to their trailing hemispheres (Figure 2). The measured H2O band areas clearly trend with the geometric albedos of the moons, with the strongest H2O bands on the leading hemisphere of the brightest moon, Ariel, and the weakest on the trailing hemisphere of the faintest moon, Umbriel. One notable exception to this trend is the H2O bands on the trailing hemisphere of Ariel, which are weaker than the H2O bands on the trailing hemisphere of Titania.  1647.pdf

Leading/trailing ratios for the mean areas of the 1.52 and 2.02 μm H2O ice bands display a clear planetocentric gradient, with pronounced hemispherical asymmetries on Ariel and only subtle asymmetries on the furthest regular satellite, Oberon (Figure 3). Additionally, the mean leading/trailing ratios for the 1.52 µm bands decrease more rapidly than for the 2.02 µm bands with increasing distance from Uranus, with only minor differences between the 1.52 and 2.02 µm H2O ice band ratios on Oberon.   Discussion: The larger H2O band areas on the leading hemispheres of all four moons are consistent with both the micrometeorite and charged particle bombardment hypotheses. Furthermore, the planetocentric gradient in the mean leading/trailing ratios for the areas of the 1.52 and 2.02 µm bands supports both hypotheses as well. Larger hemispherical asymmetries on the moons closest to Uranus are consistent with higher charged particle and IDPs/IDSPs fluxes, which fall off with distance from Uranus.  Although the reduction in hemispherical asymmetries with increasing orbital radius appears to be inconsistent with irregular satellite dust bombardment, the lower relatively velocity of intraplanetary dust sources compared to IDPs and IDSPs (e.g., [12]) likely reduces the effectiveness of regolith overturn by irregular satellite dust. Additionally, compositional differences between IDPs/IDSPs and intraplanetary dust might help modify the leading/trailing asymmetries in H2O band strengths (for example, if impacting IDPs/IDSPs deliver more H2O ice than intraplanetary dust sources).  Future work: We are gathering additional spectral and photometric data over visible wavelengths (VIS). Spectral reddening in the VIS has been attributed to irradiation of icy moons (e.g., [15]), as well as material delivery and/or radiolysis via micrometeorite impacts (e.g., [10]). For example, enhanced spectral reddening of Oberon's leading hemisphere (e.g., [16]) is consistent with the accumulation of dust from Uranus' retrograde irregular satellites [10], which are spectrally redder than the large moons of Uranus [17]. Therefore, by characterizing the leading/trailing hemispherical distribution of spectrally red material, we will be able to further constrain the relative contribution of these processes to the strength of the detected H2O ice bands. We will also collect spectra at wavelengths > 2.5 µm in order to characterize the H2O ice Fresnel peak (centered near 3.1 µm) on the leading and trailing hemispheres of these moons. Finally, we will utilize numerical models to constrain the grain sizes and composition of these moons' surfaces over the entire wavelength range of our datasets (~0.4 - 4.0 µm).
