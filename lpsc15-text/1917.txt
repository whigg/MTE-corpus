Introduction: The lack of new data about the surface of Venus pushes researches toward extracting new information from old data sets. The shape of the backscattering functions measured during the Magellan radar altimeter experiment [1] could reveal detailed information about small-scale texture of the surface and help determine its nature. Magellan altimeter results have been widely used through global maps of roughness and reflectivity [1] calculated on the basis of Hagfors scattering law. Previously we have applied [2] the principal component analysis to the near-nadir Magellan backscatter and obtained parameters characterizing the surface independently of any scattering law assumptions.  In the present work we analyze the connections between the principal component analysis of the Magellan backscattering function and detailed surface structural properties. Approach and source data:  Three experiments onboard Magellan mission have been carried out to obtain data about Venus surface. Radar echoes were recorded according to delays and Doppler shifts with the Magellan radar altimeter (RA). The surface echo profiles (received echo power vs. echo delay, Doppler shifts being averaged out) were used to extract the range to the surface (=> surface elevation), and estimate normal reflectivity and a roughness parameter [1]. Side-looking synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provided high resolution (~100-200 m) surface images at oblique angles (active mode). The same system working in a passive (radiometer) mode provided distribution of surface emissivity [3]. All observations were made using wavelength of 12.6 cm. As the source data, we use the results of Magellan RA data processing, in particular, the backscattering function solution [4] archived in the PDS as a part of so-called SCVDR data set. These data are arranged as individual points along Magellan orbits; each data point obtained from analysis of 5 consecutive radar bursts. The backscattering function has been estimated [4] for a set of incidence angles from 0.25º up to ~11º (depending on latitude) with 0.5º interval. We studied four regions on Venus including radardark parabolas of craters Boleyn (24.4ºN, 220.1ºE, D = 69 km; Fig. 1) and Bassi (19ºS, 64.7ºE, D = 35 km) and terrain nearby. We also analyzed two areas surrounding old craters (exhibiting no associated radardark diffuse features), Deken (47.1ºN, 288.5ºE, D =48 km) and Rhys (8.6ºN, 298.8ºE, D =44.0 km). These craters show signs [5] of the presence of old “brightened” parabola mantles, degraded to the state that they are not obvious in the radar images, but still present as surficial deposits.   Fig. 1. The crater Boleyn: (a) SAR image; (b) distribution of the second principal component PC2; (c) distribution of the third principal component PC3. Darker shades denote lower PC values We carried out the principal component (PC) analysis of the backscattering solutions from SCVDR within these four regions.

that contain some signal above the noise level; lower or higher values of these PC often form contiguous areas (Fig. 1) that apparently correspond to some specific materials and textures on the surface. The first 3 PCs for radar-dark parabolas of craters Boleyn and Bassi contain 44%, 37%, 7% and 59%, 17%, 6% of the total backscattering function variability, respectively. For old craters Deken and Rhys the first 3 PCs variability portions are, respectively, 77%, 17%, 2% and 46%, 26%, 6%.  As discussed in [2], the 1st PC is a weighted average of the backscatter over the whole range of incidence angles and characterizes the overall intensity of returned echo. The spatial distribution of PC1 intensity usually correlates very well with that of estimated Fresnel reflectivity [1]. The 2nd PC is a weighted balance between low-incidence-angle and high-incidenceangle parts of the backscattering function; high PC2 values mean relatively heavier tail of the backscattering function and therefore generally higher surface roughness. The 3rd PC describes the shape of the backscattering function in more details, in particular, it characterizes relative weighted balance between the middle part and distal tail of the backscattering function; high values of PC3 indicate the disproportionally abundant steeper unresolved slopes. To correlate the PC values with other independent Magellan results, we subdivided the whole range of each PC value into five intervals, equal number of data points in each interval, based on the cumulative distribution of PC values. Examples of such subdivision mapped over Boleyn area are shown in Fig. 1b, c for 2nd and 3rd PCs. Similar maps of every PCs distribution were used to estimate surface properties that were obtained in other independent Magellan experiments. In particular, for each interval, we calculated average radar cross-section σ using SAR images, microwave emissivity using emissivity maps, and the Doppler centroid from the SCVDR data set. The value of σ is mainly dependent on surface roughness including small-scale one (< 12.6 cm), which causes diffuse scattering [6]. Surface emissivity is less sensitive to the surface roughness [7], whose effect could be seen in very rough areas [8], and is controlled mostly by surface composition through the dielectric permittivity. The Doppler centroid is a measure of the asymmetry of radar echoes profiles in Doppler shifts; it gives an estimate of the asymmetry of unresolved surface topography [9] in the SN direction.  Results and discussion: Calculations show that radar cross-section usually increase with the increase of PC2 values. In Fig. 2a the average radar cross-section σ is plotted against corresponded values of PC intervals. We see a direct correlation between PC2 and σ. This correlation has a natural explanation: the rougher surface causes higher diffuse scattering that leads to both a heavier tail of the RA backscattering function and a higher surface brightness in SAR images.  In areas of radar-dark parabola craters Boleyn and Bassi the 3rd PC correlates positively with the Doppler centroid (Fig. 2b). Old crater Deken (Fig. 2b) show the opposite trend: the lower the PC3 values, the higher Doppler centroid. Crater Rhys does not exhibit any monotone Doppler centroid variations.  For craters Bassi and Rhys (PC2), and Deken (PC1) the PC values correlate directly with the emissivity. This indicates that the, surface emissivity is also affected by surface roughness. Crater Boleyn does not show such effects, possibly, due to a very young age of parabola-forming mantle.    Fig. 2. Observed properties of surface areas surrounding craters Boleyn, Bassi, Deken and Rhys plotted against PC values p: (a) radar cross-section, σ; (b) Doppler centroid, fD.  Conclusions:  Principal component analysis of the Magellan radar altimeter backscattering functions allows search for distribution of small-scale surface roughness and unresolved surface topography formed due to aeolian transport of particulate materials of parabola-forming mantles. SAR images could serve as a controlling factor for the choice of principal components set for the purposes of the Venus surface classification. References:  [1] Ford P. G. and Pettengill G. H.
