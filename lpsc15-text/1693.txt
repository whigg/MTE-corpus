Introduction:  The  Desert  Fireball  Network is a large network of cameras across the Australian outback, designed for recording meteor entry and recovering the associated meteorite. The outback offers excellent meteorite  searching  conditions  compared  to  temperate zones, and the Australian climate provides many clear nights for good coverage. The current system is an evolution  of  the  earlier  trial  film-based  network[1],  and now uses self-contained digital video and still cameras. Progress: To date, 30 cameras have been deployed, over South Australia and Western Australia, as shown in  fig  1.  Initial  systems were  deployed  in  early-mid 2014 on the Nullarbor plain, an area well known for meteorite finds. The second phase of expansion, from October 2014,  was focused on South Australia, covering areas with large dry lakes, again good for searching.  Other  minor  deployments  have  been  in  the  WA wheatbelt,  which is  easy to  support  logistically from Perth, and is good searching for the fallow part of the year. System description:  The  hardware  consists  of  a still camera (Nikon D800, Samyang 8mm fisheye), and a  video camera (Watec 902H,  Fujinon fisheye),  supported by a single board PC and hard disks. A Liquid crystal shutter is incorporated into the lens, to act as a flickering shutter to breaks the fireball track in a long exposure, to permit calculation of the fireball velocity [2]. Internet link is provided by 3G mobile coverage, or LAN/Wifi,  depending  on  deployment.  A small  solar power system is used for remote sites, or mains power if available.  Fig 2 shows a typical camera system (at Mount  Ives  homestead),  with  camera  mounted  on  a stand with a sunlight shield. Solar panels and battery are located directly next to the camera. Data pipeline: the network is supported by a mains server located in Perth, and access to the iVEC/Pawsey Centre HPC data store for large data storage. The still cameras  record  images  every 30  seconds  throughout the night, and process them during the day, searching for fireballs.  Video  is  recorded  throughout  the night, and  mostly  deleted  in  the  morning,  unless  a  corresponding fireball is observed. The still images are processed on-board the camera system, such that only text files and occasional images are transferred to the main server,  reducing the bandwidth requirements.  All  images are stored in the camera itself for later off-line retrieval (by hard disk swapping). The  server  correlates  events  seen  by  individual cameras, and attempts to triangulate them to give meteor  trajectory  solutions.  Any plausible  solutions  are forwarded to  an operator  along with relevant  images and fall  mass/position estimates for further investigation. This automated pipeline reduces the manual intervention to a minimum, allowing a large network to be operated by only a few people. Initial  statistics:  commercial  hardware  performance is proving satisfactory for the requirements of the project.  Out of  30  systems deployed for  about  1 year,  2  systems  have  failed  with  mechanical  shutter problems and have been replaced. The 2 oldest working  systems  currently  have  shutter  counts  of  over 300,000 exposures. The network operates as a VPN on top of heterogeneous  infrastructure,  and  there  are  frequent  network dropouts with individual systems (usually the more remote systems running on 3G networks). Once connection is re-established, backlogged data is automatically transfered, and the server then re-checks for any new viable triangulations. At remote sites, solar power has been more reliable than mains, as brief power cuts are not uncommon in the outback, and these result in system re-boots.  In  future,  solar  will  be  preferred,  or  a UPS backup will be used. With the current network of 30 cameras, we record about  1  good  triangulatable  result  every  1-2  weeks. Only some of these are meteorite dropping events. It is very likely that more fireballs have been recorded, but are not detected by the current generation of software deployed on the cameras. Once the hard disks are recovered, the data can be re-analyzed using newer tools. Geminids: over 14-15th December, the DFN cameras saw a marked increase in fireballs, with 3 double  station events recorded in one night, plus multiple single station events. See fig 3. Future: Several  of  the more  remote  camera  systems have no internet link; data from those systems is added to the archive after expeditions to retrieve and replace  the  hard  disks.  (Event  detection  software  is then re-applied to the new dataset in combination with other  nearby cameras).  New satellite  modems are  in testing to integrate these remote cameras to the realtime network. Additionally there  will be further  deployments  of more camera systems, in New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia. We expect to have over 50 deployed cameras by mid-late 2015, and approximately 60TB of archived all-sky imagery, available for analysis by interested researchers.
