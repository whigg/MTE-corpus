ISSUES WITH COUNTING CRATERS ON SMALL AREAS: FOOL ME TWICE.  B. J. Thomson1 and C. I. Fassett2, 1Center for Remote Sensing, Boston University, Boston, MA (bjt@bu.edu), 2 Dept. of Astronomy, Mount Holyoke College, South Hadley, MA (cfassett@mtholyoke.edu).   Introduction:  Stratigraphic divisions on Mars have been defined using the density of impact craters 4-10 km in diameter [1]; 2, 5, and 16 km in diameter [2], and 1, 2, 5, and 16 km in diameter [3]. In order to obtain reliable statistics, these time-stratigraphic boundaries were defined on the basis of numbers of craters per 106 km2. Examining parcels 100 times smaller should still provide robust statistics, e.g., ~2-16 craters 1 km in diameter per 104 km2 for Amazonian surfaces. Yet the application of crater counting techniques to very small regions (with surface areas in the 100 to 1000 km2 range) is problematic since they may lack any craters >1 km in diameter. Given the ubiquity of crater modification processes on Mars (and potential contamination by secondary craters [e.g., 4]), reliance on the sub-kilometer crater population for age dates is challenging. A recent paper [5] examined potential errors in derived ages for 100 and 1000 km2 surfaces compared to larger areas. Here we attempt to generalize this result and more formally estimate the potential bias that small surface areas can inflict upon derived ages. Case of the largest crater:  Issues with deriving ages from small surfaces areas are most acute in the largest crater size bins. On any given surface, the largest craters should be the least susceptible to erosion and modification. If all other things are equal, they should provide the most accurate indication of the unit's true crater retention age. However, the scarcity of the largest craters means that random clustering in their spatial distribution can skew derived ages. One limiting case to consider is the largest crater of which exactly N=1 crater is expected. For example, consider a hypothetical surface on Mars that was formed 1 Ga ago (Fig. 1). If this surface was 1 km2 in area, we would expect N=1 crater ~110 m in diameter. If the surface area were instead 100 km2, we would expect N=1 500 m diameter crater [6, 7]. Numerical cratering model:  In order to demonstrate the clustering effect of the largest craters, we assembled a simple Monte Carlo model to track the accumulation of craters on a hypothetical surface. A random number generator is used to place a given number of craters in the model domain. In our initial model, we considered a 1 Ga surface 100 by 100 km in size (total area = 104 km2) made up of 100 10 by 10 km cells (cell area = 102 km2). 100 km2 count areas: As indicated in Fig. 1, we would expect N=100 craters 500 m diameter across the model domain, or 1 crater per 100 km2 cell. Results from a typical model run are given in Fig. 2.  Figure 2. Checkerboard plot of typical model output of 1 Ga surface with 102 km2 cells colored according to density of 500 m diameter craters. The expected number of craters is one per cell (white). Cells with fewer craters than expected (zero) are given in red; cells with an excess of craters (two or more) are given in blue.  Figure 1. Hartmann isochron plot with expected incremental crater density of 1 Ga surface highlighted in red. Blue arrows mark positions on plot of largest diameter crater expected in a 1 km2 area (~110 m), a 100 km2 area (~500 m), and a 1000 km2 area (~900 m) 2665.pdf

We ran 1000 such models and compiled the results in Table 1. The results indicate that more often than not (39±03%), the measured crater density is too low. In fact, erroneous age inferences are obtained in 2/3 of the cases on average. These empirical results are as expected assuming a Poisson probability distribution [8].  Table 1. Density of 500 m diameter craters on 104 km2 1 Ga surface using 102 km2 count areas (Mean values ± standard deviation after 1000 runs) % cells with density below expected (N=0) % cells with density as expected (N=1) % cells with density above expected (N≥2) 38.7 ± 3.1 34.6 ± 4.7 26.7 ± 2.4  1000 km2 count areas: If the count area is increased by a factor of 10, the expected number of 500 m diameter craters on our 1 Ga surface increases by a commensurate amount. As before, we ran 1000 models with the increased count area and tabulated the results. A histogram of the results in given in Fig. 2b; a histogram of the 100 km2 count area results is given in Fig. 2a for comparison. Unlike the case given in Fig. 2a, here the measured crater density values are centered on their expected value (N=10 craters 500 m in diameter per 1000 km2). The shape of the histogram is approximately Gaussian. Summary: These results highlight the problems when inferring ages from small count areas. It is worth emphasizing that the effects of erosion greatly compound this issue of spatial clustering of the largest craters [e.g., 9], and this is a problem that persists despite efforts to extend chronostratigraphic divisions to small, 100 m diameter craters [10].
