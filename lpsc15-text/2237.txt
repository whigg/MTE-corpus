Introduction:  Although Earth's impact cratering record has been poorly preserved due to active geological processes, orbital observations of the Martian surface have revealed hundreds of wellpreserved impact structures.  Their widespread and random distribution across Mars make them optimal targets for investigation.  In addition, central uplifts of complex craters expose outcrops of deep-seated bedrock, some of which may correspond to the primitive Martian crust [1-6]. Indeed, central uplifts may comprise a mixture of pre-, syn-, and post-impact units [1-2, 5-6].  In fact, the bedrock of central uplifts is often obscured by impact-related deposits such as impactites, and by post-impact aeolian deposits [1-3].  Spectrally, the bedrock within central uplifts may reveal exposures of excavated unaltered mafic phases (some of which could be of Noachian age), and altered phases [1-14]. The crater-exposed bedrock database compiled by Tornabene et al. [1, 5, 6] records three main textural types of parautochthonous (i.e., pre-existing craterexposed) bedrock in complex central uplifts on Mars observed in: layered bedrock (LB), fractured massive bedrock (FMB), and megabrecciated bedrock (MBB).  This research specifically addresses the FMB class of uplift, and aims at combining the morphological, structural, and spectral mapping observations in order to elucidate the origin of the bedrock, and other deposits in central uplifts, in relationship to the surrounding local, regional, and global geology, as well as putting constraints on impact-induced alteration, impactite emplacement, and central uplift formation. This study begins with the detailed mapping of Alga Crater (333.3° E, 24.3° S) Background: Alga is a ~19 km diameter complex crater with a ~200 m elevation central uplift located within the outer rings of Ladon Basin, just east of the Margaritifer-Uzboi Valles system.  Alga is also located within the larger ~87 km Chekalin impact structure.  The pre-impact bedrock may be comprised of the ejecta of the Argyre basin and/or or impact-related materials from the Ladon, and/or Chekalin impact structures.  Spectral analyses by Skok et al. [15] detected fayalitic olivine and moderate-Fe low-Ca pyroxene (LCP) within the central uplift. Methodology:  The detailed decametre- to metre- scale mapping has been performed in the ArcMap platform of ArcGIS, using a Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) orthoimage at 25 cm/pixel [16], Context Camera (CTX) visible images at ~5 m/pixel [17], and a HiRISE-Derived Digital Terrain Model (DTM) at ~1.0 m/pixel.  HiRISE provides the highest resolution details of the surface, accompanied by CTX for regional context of the surrounding geology, and a DTM for 3D visualization.  Analysis of Compact Reconaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM; ~15-19 m/pixel) data was conducted with the Exelis ENVI software and the CRISM Analysis Toolkit (CAT) [18].

B: Associated ratioed CRISM spectra taken from various outcrops in central uplift: A-D: Olivine spectra, F-H: Low-Ca pyroxene (LCP) spectra.  Results: The central uplift of Alga was mapped according to differences in morphology (texture, tonality), structure, and composition. The following spectro-morphological units have been defined: Fractured massive bedrock (FMB): This relatively light-toned unit occupies ~18% of the total area of the central uplift.  It is highly fractured, but shows no signs of layering, and is consistent with other observations of FMB within central uplifts of the crater-exposed bedrock database [1, 5, 6].  This unit can be further divided by slight differences in tonality, and spectral characteristics (Figure 3) consistent with previous studies [15].  Olivine-bearing megablocks of FMB are found in the northwestern quadrant of the uplift. Relatively intermediate-toned low-Ca pyroxenebearing outcrops of FMB occur in the east and southwest portions of the central uplift.   Dark-toned smooth unit (DTs): This unit is prominent at the summit of the central uplift, manifesting as a thin coating based on exposures of underlying FMB (e.g., Figure 2), and appears to flow downward towards the crater floor.  It accounts for ~29% of the total area of the uplift.   Dark-toned rough unit (DTr):  This dark-toned unit strictly coats the steepest slopes of the central uplift, and is similar to DTs, but differs in terms of texture. It accounts for ~17% of the total area of the central uplift. Intermediate-toned unit (IT): This unit occurs in conjunction with the DTs unit, but is mostly found at the crater floor.  It differs from DTs in that it contains abundant light-toned clasts. It accounts for ~33% of the total area of the central uplift. Dark clast (C): This is a single, but relatively large dark-toned block (~170 by 55 m) located in the southeastern quadrant of the central uplift (see Figure 3). Other: We also mapped Mass wasting deposits (MS), Unconsolidated deposits (U), which collectively cover ~18 % of the uplift, and Aeolian deposits (A).  Discussion: The FMB is consistent with preimpact bedrock. This bedrock may be comprised of the ejecta deposits of the Argyre basin, the Ladon basin, or from impact-related deposits of the Chekalin impact. Conversely, they may be of igneous origin, and may include portions of the primitive crust. The dark-toned (smooth and rough) clast-poor, and intermediate-toned clast-rich units are interpreted to be impact melt rocks, because of their characteristic flow textures that coat portions of the central uplift.  The detailed morphological mapping shows that clast-poor impact melt is prominent at topographic highs, whereas clast-rich impact melt is prominent at topographic lows. This may be the result of impact melt flowing downward towards the crater floor, while incorporating rock fragments of the exposed bedrock during the crater modification stage.   The spectral analysis reveals olivine-rich FMB outcrops with sharp boundaries located in the northwestern quadrant of the central uplift, some of which may be clasts transported by the flow of impact melt off the central uplift.  Pyroxene-rich outcrops occur in the southwestern and northeastern quadrants.  The DTs, DTr units, interpreted to be impact melt, are spectrally bland and indistinct. This work highlights the fact that impact meltbearing units frequently coat the bedrock of central uplifts in well-preserved impact structures, and so care should be taken when interpreting spectral data.
