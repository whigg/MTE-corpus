FORMATION OF AN EQUATORIAL RIDGE ON AN OBLATE RUBBLE PILE ASTEROID ToshiHirabayashi1, Daniel J. Scheeres1, and Ben Rozitis2, 1University of Colorado at Boulder, Colorado 80309, USA,2University of Tennessee, Tennessee 37996, USA; masatoshi.hirabayashi@colorado.eduAbstract: Astronomical observations have revealedthat some asteroids spinning at rapid spin periods ranging from 2 hr to 5 hr are oblate and have unique equatorial ridges. These objects are considered to spin up dueto the YORP effect. The preferred scenario of the ridgeformation is that a landslide causes surface materials tocover over the equatorial region. Based on our recent research for the internal structure analysis about such objects, the present study proposes another possible scenario of an equatorial ridge on a rubble pile asteroid.The analysis was conducted by a finite element modeltaking into account a plastic deformation mode. Theinterpretation is that if the material distribution is uniform, an equatorial ridge is likely to be formed based onpermanent deformation of the internal core, leading tohorizontal material flow pushing the equatorial surfaceoutward. In addition, because of its permanent deformation, the internal core may be underdense compared tothe other regions. This scenario is another insight of theridge formation, which has not been considered before.Introduction: With ground-based observations, scientists have believed that rapidly rotating oblate asteroids having an equatorial ridge, such as 1999 KW4 [1],are common in the solar system. A currently popularexplanation for the ridge formation is that rapid rotationcauses the external surface to fail structurally, leadingto a landslide overlapping the equatorial region. Minton[2] and Harris et al. [3] numerically investigated theformation of an idealized shape due to the gravitationalslop, while Scheeres [4] quantitatively analyzed the effect of a landslide on the formation of the idealizedshape. These studies implied that the formation of theequatorial ridge may result from a surface flow.However, regardless of these strong interpretations,less consideration of the internal structure might ignoreinternal permanent deformation of such a body. Also,they might oversimplify the problem by assuming aninitially spherical body and zero-cohesion. Recent radarobservations and asteroid exploration missions capturedthe irregularity of rubble pile asteroids. Jewitt et al. [5]also reported an exciting breakup event of active asteroid P/2013 R3. This event allowed us to find thatthe range of cohesive strength of this asteroid may bearound 100 Pa [6]. Rozitis et al. [7] also confirmed thatbecause of its rapid spin period 1950 DA may be closeto its failure condition and should have cohesion of atleast 60 Pa. These evidences imply that rubble pile asteroids may generally have cohesion.Over the last decade, analyses about the internal structure of asteroids have been conducted using averagedtechniques. This analytical technique is useful to calculate the limit spin of such objects. Holsapple has performed this by averaging the whole body of a uniformlyrotating ellipsoid (e.g., [8, 9]). In general, however,since asteroids are neither spherical nor ellipsoidal, it isimportant to investigate local stresses to see more accurate deformation processes. Hirabayashi and Scheeres[10] proposed a technique for determining the conditions for local stress states in asteroid (216) Kleopatra,a dog-bone like shape, and found that its neck part iscloser to its failure condition than other locations.In this study, based on the results by a finite element model originally developed by Hirabayashi andScheeres [11, 12], we provide an alternative explanationfor the formation of an equatorial ridge. In this scenario,plastic deformation occurs in the internal core, whichalso implies that the interior of such a body could bemore porous than the external surface [11]. This couldexplain why radar albedo observations may suggest asurface density higher than the overall bulk density.Finite Element Model: Hirabayashi and Scheeres[12, 11] developed a finite element model, including aplastic deformation mode, using the commercial software ANSYS. The Drucker-Prager yield criterion isused, and the material flow follows an associated flowrule. The body forces are defined only by self-gravityand rotation. The friction angle is assumed to be 35â—¦,and the loading is assumed to increment linearly. Here,we discuss the critical cohesion cases of 1950 DA [11]and 1999 KW4 [12].Figures 1 and 2 describe the finite element solutionon the external shape and that over the cross section of1950 DA [11]. The colors and numbers in these figures show the ratio of the current stress state to the yieldstress, so called stress ratio [13]. If this ratio is 1.0 (red),the location experiences plastic deformation. As seen inthese plots, although the stress state of the external surface is below the yield condition, the internal core experiences a plastic state. This indicates that the internalcore is more likely to fail structurally at an earlier stage,while the surface is still elastic. Figure 3 shows the deformation vectors of the whole body. The equatorial region is vertically and compressively pushed by the highlatitude regions, while experiencing tension in the horizontal direction. Such a deformation mode causes theinternal core to have permanent deformation, and so thematerial flow is horizontal and outward. From Figure 4showing the deformation vectors of 1999 KW4, we confirm the same deformation mode as seen for the case of1950 DA. In these computations, the cohesive strength1967.pdf

of 1950 DA and 1999 KW4 were fixed as 70 Pa and 20Pa, respectively. Since the ridge formation has alreadybeen observed on these objects, their cohesive strengthmight be around a few tens of pascals.Interpretation: The sensitivity of the internal coreto structural failure and the outward deformation ofthe equatorial plane are a new insight into the ridgeformation of an oblate rubble pile asteroid. Also,given the volume increment of permanent deformation,Hirabayashi and Scheeres [11] predicted that the internal core should be underdense compared to the otherregions, which could possibly be measured by a visitingspacecraft [14]. Currently, ground-based observationshave found similarly shaped objects having equatorialridges. In addition to 1999 KW4 and 1950 DA, 2008EV5 [15], (136617) 1994 CC [16] and (101955) Bennu[17], having spin periods of 2.39 hr, 3.73 hr, and 4.29hr, respectively, are also remarkable examples. Due totheir relatively rapid spin periods, these objects couldalso be experiencing the proposed deformation mode todevelop their equatorial ridges. This deformation modemay be more common than thought for rapidly rotatingoblate objects in the solar system.Figure 1: Unique equatorial ridge of 1950 DA [11]. Thecolors indicate the ratio of the current stress to the yield stress,known as stress ratio. The locations with stress ratio of 1.0,given in red, experience permanent deformation.References: [1] S.
