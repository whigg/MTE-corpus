 RECENT SOLAR-PROTON FLUXES AND SEVERE SOLAR-ACTIVITY EVENTS IN THE PAST.  Robert C. Reedy1, 1Planetary Science Institute, Suite 106, 1700 E Fort Lowell, Tucson, AZ 85719.   <reedy@ psi.edu>.  (Mailing address: 152 Monte Rey Dr., Los Alamos, NM 87544.).    Event-integrated fluences of energetic solar protons in 2014 were compiled and compared with previous data. The current solar cycle continues to be fairly quiet, especially at Earth. One severe solar-proton event was observed by the STEREO A spacecraft in July 2012. There is evidence for very severe solar activity in the past, including in 1859, 993, and 775 AD. Solar protons make cosmogenic nuclides often observed in extraterrestrial matter.  Introduction:  The Sun usually has low levels of energetic activity. Occasionally, the Sun puts out high levels of magnetic activity and high fluxes of energetic particles [1-3]. These activities can affect the surface of the Earth, sometimes very severely [4,5]. Impacts of such severe space weather events including affecting or even destroying electrical power systems and instruments or spacecraft in deep space (including geosynchronous orbit). They also produce nuclides in extraterrestrial matter, as was observed in some samples of the Sutter's Mill meteorite [1].  Because modern observations have been  for only 60 years, data for older time periods (~10 kyr-5 Myr) are used to get a better idea of the nature of rare space-weather events [6]. Other events that have occurred fairly recently are discussed below.  These severe space weather events can have major  effects on other planetary bodies, including meteoroids, as well as spacecraft (e.g., Dawn [2], now at the asteroid Ceres). Gamma-ray data from Mars Odyssey were of limited values for months after major solar particle events activated local material [7].   Recent Solar-Particle Activity:  Energetic particles have been observed since 1956 [8]. Those fluxes are usually low for the 2 years before and after solar minimum. They can be high other times during a solar cycle (typically about 11 years long). Some solar cycles (SCs) have much activity while others, such as SC-21 from 1976 to 1986, have low activity [8]. After a slow start, the current solar cycle (SC-24), which started in 2008, became active in 2011 [2].  The solar-proton fluxes near the Earth since 2009 were compiled [3]. The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) energetic-particle data used here are consistent with measurements by 2 spacecraft at the Earth's L1 Lagrange point, the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) and the Energetic and Relativistic Nuclei Electron (ERNE) experiment on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO).  Solar particle events (SPEs) are also observed by the 2 Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) spacecraft that are ahead of and behind the Earth in solar orbit. They are now on the other side of the Sun from the Earth [2], allowing coverage of SPEs not possible by spacecraft near the Earth. They were useful for studies of Dawn gamma-ray data [2] and of high induced radioactivities observed in some pieces of the Sutter's Mill chondrite [1].   The daily fluxes of high-energy solar protons are plotted for the last 4 years in Fig. 1 for 3 spacecraft at 1 AU from the Sun. Lower-energy solar-proton fluxes are shown in [1]. There were no solar-proton events (SPEs) in 2009 and only a weak SPE in early Aug. 2010. In 2011 and later, many SPEs have been observed. In Fig. 1, the STEREO fluxes are higher partly because of the lower energy used. Some events are not seen by all of these spacecraft while most are.      Fig. 1.  The daily-integrated fluxes of high-energy protons are plotted versus date for 2011-2014.  The current solar cycle started in Aug. 2008.  GOES is in geosynchronous orbit and the 2 STEREO spacecraft were on the other side of the Sun from the Earth. Energies are in MeV.    STEREO A observed a very high flux of solar protons in July 2012. A huge coronal mass ejection occurred on 23 July 2012 and was one of the fastest ones observed since 2006. The fluxes of high-energy solar protons for June to August 2012 are shown in Fig. 2 for 4 spacecraft, including ACE at the Earth's L1 point. The fluxes at STEREO A are almost 3 orders of magnitude higher than at the other spacecraft for an SPE starting on 23 July 2012.      Fig. 2.  The daily-integrated fluxes of high-energy protons versus date for June through August, 2012.   Recent Event-Integrated Solar-Proton Fluxes:   The GOES-13 solar-proton data were used to get event-integrated fluences (in units of 106 protons/cm2) near Earth since 2008 for solar particle events with fluences above 30 MeV >107 (Table 1).  The spectra shape parameters for exponential rigidity (R0) are given in units of MV and are similar to those over several time periods from 10 ky to 5 Myr ago [6].   Date SSN >10 >30 >60 >100 R0  3/16/11 37 70 12 1 0.4 60 6/8/11 53 67 19 6 0.2   85 8/5/11 59 110 15 2.5 0.1 65 1/24/12 65 4400 420 30 1.3 40 1/28/12 65 700 130 20 6 65 3/8/12 67 4000 960 210 70 70 5/17/12 62 90 25 10 4 100 7/18/12 58 130 16 1.8 0.3 50 7/24/12 58 30 11 3 0.8 100 4/11/13 58 60 15 3.7  1  75   Table 1. Event-integrated solar-proton fluxes above 4 energies for major events since 2008 in units of 106 protons/cm2. The date is the event's start. SSN is the smoothed sunspot number. The average exponentialrigidity spectra shape R0 is given in megavolts (MV).   The average flux above 30 MeV is 10 protons/cm2, which is much less than most of the 5 previous solar cycles and similar to that for 1976-1986 [3]. However, the current solar cycle has only 5 years old with about 6 years to go. Big events can occur late in a cycle, such as in Aug. 1972 for SC-20.  The average recent fluxes are not very different from the average solar-proton fluxes for several periods from 10 ky to 5 Myr determined using radioactivities in the surfaces of lunar samples [6].  Extreme Space Weather Events:  Lately, there has been much work on space weather events much larger than those seen recently. The Workshop on Extreme Space Weather Events was held in Boulder, CO, on 9-11 June 2014, see www.predictsci.com/eswe-workshop for details. Similar workshops and meetings have been held before.  Several periods of severe space weather were presented. One was during the so-called Carrington event, a major solar storm in Sept. 1859, which was so intense that telegraph systems failed and a major magnetic increase was observed in Bombay [9]. There is debate on the intensity of energetic solar particles during this event as the record is not clear.  Excess of radiocarbon (14C) was observed in tree rings for 774-775 AD [10] and for 993-994 AD [11]. The increase occurred fast and the excess lasted for over a decade. A few people think that an intense gamma-ray burst could have made the 14C excess, but most question such a scenario and believe solar protons produced the 14C [12].  Summary:  Event integrated fluences of solar protons were compiled for the 10 large events since 2008. The average flux since 2008 is low, but the current solar cycle is less than half over. Much could happen in the next 4-5 years, including huge solar events that occur very rarely. Meteorites should have their cosmogenic nuclides measured after major solar activity to look for solar-proton-produced nuclides indicating a near pre-atmospheric-surface location [1].
