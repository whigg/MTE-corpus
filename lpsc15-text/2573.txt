Very few of them have been analyzed yet. We apply here a big data analytics approach, which allow to look quickly at a wide set of observations, using UVIS as an imager. This visual method allows to easily spot interesting unexpected features. We are building a library of Titan UVIS images, which will lead to further spectroscopic investigations.               Titan airglow can be studied from different angles, the large data set making possible to investigate seasonal variations or the effect of the magnetosphere on the airglow.  We focus here on this last aspect.  Titan has been observed 3 times while in the magnetosheath, on June 13, 2007 (T-32) [1]; March 25, 2008 (T-42) and July 24, 2012 (T-85). While UVIS images in the FUV wavelengths show strong nitrogen emissions as expected, we observe a very localized and sudden bright nitrogen emission on June 13, 2007, during the T-32 flyby. This unusual pattern is studied here.   Figure 1: LBH emission band UVIS image from FUV2007_164_12_51_43_UVIS_046TI_EUVFUV00 1_PRIME.  Observations: Figure 1 represents an UVIS image taken during T-32 at about 1pm. It displays the average intensity of the LBH emission band from 127.0 to 150.5 nm. The x-axis represents the spatial dimension of the UVIS detector. The y-axis is the time. At about 13:15 UTC, a sudden and bright nitrogen emission is seen. The spectra show that the radiance around 13:15 UTC is about 2 times brighter than at 13:30 UTC, as shown in figure 2. This sudden nitrogen emission occurs at about 950 km in the Titan atmosphere and last about 10 minutes.    Figure 2: Nitrogen emission line at 149.3 nm, shown at 13:15 UTC (sample 6) and 13:30 UTC (sample 12).  Discussion: Correlations with other Cassini observations (RPWS, CAPS/ELS) indicate that an electron burst could be at the origin of this sudden, localized and bright nitrogen emission, as observed with Cassini-UVIS. The solar XUV photons and a minor magnetospheric contribution are known to produce Titan airglow [2]. Observing airglow, while Titan is in the magnetosheath will help to quatify the contribution of those two processes.  References: [1] Garnier, P. et al. (2009), Ann. Geophys. 27, 4257-4272.
