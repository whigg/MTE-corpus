AN EMPIRICAL APPROACH TO ESTIMATING MASS FRACTION OF SUBMICROSCOPIC IRON IN LUNAR SOILS. D. Liu1 and L. Li1, 1Department of Earth Sciences, 723 W.

The mass fraction of SMFe is thus a measure of the maturity of lunar soils [1]. In addition, SMFe has been associated with the presence of water/hydroxyl in lunar soils [2, 3]. It was suggested that the solar wind protons are responsible for not only the reduction of FeO to SMFe in lunar soils but the release of water/hydroxyl from the soils as well [2, 3]. This gives rise to the possibility of using high mass fractions of SMFe to locate lunar surface areas with water/hydroxyl. All these observations indicate the importance of the mass fraction of SMFe. SMFe as a by-product of space weathering, greatly alters the optical properties of lunar surface materials and influences the interpretation of VIS-NIR spectra of the lunar surface [4, 5]. The correlation between the mass fraction of SMFe and reflectance spectra of lunar soils was investigated in previous studies [6]. This study was aimed at the development of a simple model to estimate the mass fraction of SMFe in lunar soils from measured reflectance. Dataset: The Lunar Soil Characterization Consortium (LSCC) dataset was used in the model development. LSCC measured bidirectional reflectance, FeO content and maturity index (Is/FeO) of four particle size groups (< 10 µm, 10 - 20 µm, 20 - 45 µm, and < 45 µm), each for 9 highland and 10 mare lunar soils, and altogether 76 data samples. In this study, all the samples were used for the correlation analysis except for sample 71061. This sample is abundant in black beads [7], and has spectral characteristics different from spectra of other samples [8]. Method: Sensitivity analysis (SA) was conducted for a suite of reflectance spectra simulated with Hapke’s radiative transfer model (RTM) to quantitatively determine the relative importance of the mass fraction of SMFe, particle size (PS) and mineral abundance in regulating the reflectance of lunar soils [9]. Results indicate that SMFe and PS have the stronger impacts across the whole wavelength regions of interest as compared to that of mineral abundance (Fig. 1). The results from SA also suggest that the simulated reflectance spectra are more sensitive to the mass fraction of SMFe at short wavelengths than longer wavelengths. This strong effect of SMFe on short wavelengths is evident in the spectra of LSCC which are convergent in short wavelengths for different size groups of each lunar soil sample. The SA results motivate us to explore the correlation between the mass fraction of SMFe in lunar soils and their corresponding reflectance only at short wavelengths. First, the mass fraction of SMFe for each data sample of LSCC was obtained via Eq. 4 of [10] on the basis of the measured FeO content and maturity index (Is/FeO). Then, the corresponding LSCC reflectance spectrum was re-sampled to the same wavelengths as M3 data (beneficial for future application of M3 data) and converted to single scattering albedo (SSA) using Hapke’s RTM to eliminate multiple scattering because SMFe coating on the surface of soil grains mainly affects SSA of lunar soils. As indicated in Fig. 1, the influence of SMFe increases with decreasing wavelength and for the M3 data the 540 nm SSA was the most suitable band for the spectral correlation analysis with SMFe. At last, the correlation between SMFe and the ratio of 540 nm/810 nm SSA was investigated for the selected LSCC samples.  Results and Discussion: Shown in Fig. 2 is the correlation between SMFe and 540 nm SSA of the LSCC soil samples. Although a relatively high correlation was observed between SMFe and all the LSCC soil samples (R2 = 0.78), the points are not tightly close to the regression line, which can be attributed to the interference of PS at short wavelengths as shown in Fig. 1. This is shown by the correlation analysis conducted for each size group of LSCC data. Fig. 2 shows that SMFe of each size group of LSCC data is highly correlated to the SSA at 540 nm, and each correlation can be well fitted (R2 ≈0.9) (Tab. 1) using an exponential function in the form of Y = e-X (dashed color lines), where X is SSA at 540 nm, and Y is the mass fraction of SMFe. Values for , β and R2 for each size group of LSCC samples are presented in Tab. 1. To compensate the effect of PS on the model performance, the ratio of 540 nm/810 nm SSA of all size groups for LSCC samples was examined for its correlation to SMFe, and a higher correlation was yielded with R2 being  0.91 (Fig. 3). This pronounced improvement indicates that the use of the SSA ratio of 540 nm to 810 nm can not only remove the effects of PS but also amplify the presence of SMFe. On one hand, both 540 nm and 810 nm are not strongly interfered by the Fe2+ absorption of mafic minerals in lunar soils; on the other hand, the ratio of 2560.pdf

540 nm to 810 nm is a slope measure for the reflectance continuum at short wavelengths; the more SMFe is contained in a lunar soil the redder of the continuum slope. As a result, the SSA ratio 540 nm/810 nm is very sensitive to the mass fraction of SMFe, and high correlation exists between SMFe and this ratio. Conclusions: Because of high sensitivity of reflectance spectra to the mass fraction of SMFe at short wavelengths, the SSA ratio of 540 nm to 810 nm is strongly correlated to the mass fraction of SMFe. This ratio emphasizes the spectral significance of SMFe, minimizes the effect of PS at short wavelengths, and thus can serve as an efficient spectral index for estimating the mass fraction of SMFe in lunar soils in future applications.
