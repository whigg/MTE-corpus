Introduction:  Although regolith have been ubiquitously observed on airless bodies such as Moon, Mercury, asteroids, and comet [1, 2, 3, 4], a series of processes of regolith on small airless bodies has been still poorly understood, because of lack of real samples.  Since Hayabusa spacecraft returned samples from asteroid Itokawa, now regolith on the small asteroid has been available for analytical studies [5, 6]. For examples, short residence time of regolith on Itokawa's surface less than 8 Ma was indicated from its cosmogenic Ne component [7], and abrasion processes may have result in those having rounded edges [8]. Among Itokawa particles recovered from Hayabusa's sample catcher, there exist certain amount of aggregate-type particles which are composed of small constituent grains. Although it is assumed that regolith particles on small bodies generally should have experienced processes to decrease their sizes, such as destruction and abrasion due to impact and/or seismic shaking [8, 9], a process to increase their sizes has not been well studied. In order to clarify their formation processes and extract information about physical and chemical conditions of Itokawa and its parent asteroid, we started studying about this type of Itokawa particles. Samples and Methods: We selected five Itokawa particles (RA-QD02-0184, RA-QD02-0236, RB-CV-0026, RBCV-0036 and RB-CV-0044) which seems aggregate-type from their surface morphology in their electron micrographs for this study. In order to avoid using glue which might result in fragmentation of the aggregate-type particles, they were placed on SiN holders and analyzed by dual-energy synchrotron radiation computed tomography (SR-CT) in BL47XU of SPring-8 for their three dimensional structures and mineral distributions [8, 10]. In order to check microtextures on their surfaces with high magnification, they were subsequently observed by a filed emission secondary electron microscope (FE-SEM) Hitachi SU6600 in JAXA's Extraterrestrial Sample Curation Center (ESCuC) with acceleration voltage of 2keV in high vacuum mode without conductive coating.  Results: Figure 1 (a)-(e) show cross section images of SR-CT at 8keV. As a result of synchrotron CT, one of the particles, RA-QD02-0236, is not aggregate-type but enriched in cracks, which should have been misidentified as aggregate-type from its surface morphology. Rest of them are aggregate-type, and they are divided into two groups; the ones in which small constituent grains stick together without neck between them (neck-lacking type; RB-CV-0026, RBCV-0036 and RB-CV-0044) and the other which consist of small constituent grains are connected each other with necks between them (neck-growing type; RA-QD02-0184). Compared the neck-lacking type with the neck-growing one, constituent grains in the former are non-equigranular, whereas those of the latter are relatively equigranular. Figure 2 (a)-(d) show secondary electron images of the aggregate-type Itokawa particles taken by FE-SEM. These figures also show same tendencies for sizes of consitituent grains in them. Discussion: The neck growth between constituent mineral grains indicates that they should have experienced ~ 90% of eutectic temperature of constituent minerals [11] or compaction and friction between the mineral grains [12], both implying that the neck should have grown in a large body, unlike the present Itokawa. Additionally, equigranular texture observed in the neck-growing type implies existence of well size-sorted regolith grains, which is inconsistent with unsorted regolith features observed on the present Itokawa surface [9]. These futures of the neck-growing type thus indicates that it would have been formed in a lager parent asteroid before Itokawa, whereas the features observed in neck-lacking type are consistent with surface conditions of small bodies like Itokawa. To make the discussion clear, quantitative data such as size distributions of constituent grains are necessary, and their data reductions are still ongoing. Future works: We are now preparing simulated aggregate particles made of soda-lime glass beads. With these particles, we will test focused ion beam (FIB) process to make a ultra thin section (UTS). After checks of whole the processes of transmitted electron microscope (TEM) observation of their UTSs, we will analyze the real Itokawa particles in order to observe detail structures of grain boundaries of small constituent grains and clarify their formation processes. We are also planning to perform a test measurement of their fracture strength before measurements of real Itokawa particles [13], in order to measure one of the essential physical properties of asteroid regolith.
