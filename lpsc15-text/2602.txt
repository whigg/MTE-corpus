SIMULATED MARS ROVER MODEL COMPETITION 2013-2014 SIPOS, Attila1 VIZI, Pál Gábor2 1siposattila@magyarokamarson.hu, 2MTA Wigner RPC H-1121 BUDAPEST, Konkoly Th. 29-33. vizi.pal.gabor@wigner.mta.hu.Introduction: This is a report about the organization  and  management  of  the  Simulated  Mars  Rover Competition events of 2013 and 2014.Challenge  is  the  engine  of  evolution.  The  young grow old  and  the  replenishment  is  needed.  In  every year we take significant effort to organize and realize this traditional competition of applied engineering sciences. Nine years of success - www.magyarokamarson.hu. [1] ('Hungarians on Mars') We presented in our earlier works (Sipos et al 2009-2011,2013) [2,3,4,5] and (Vizi 2012) [6] the 40th - 44th  Lunar and Planetary Science Conferences in 2009-2013. Last year, in 2014 we got an offer to hold the competition at Óbuda-AREK University, (Székesfehérvár, Hungary) together with enthusiast organizers and sponsors. 2013 Simulation and Realisation: As we explained in detail in 2013 for 44 th LPSC [5] the implementation of plot board with targets and scores has been exactly as described there. Moreover organizers and authors of this article presented a CGI and physical simulation of the dashboard, robot and race before the date of competition. Importance for researching and developing is to reach the capability to supply a good emulation environment before any mission, first at our competition and next in a wide spectrum of planetary environments. Organizers  prepared  some  solutions  and  presented them before the competition. The style of appearance is entertaining-educational  to  reach  the  attention  of  the possible younger  competitors  also,  similar  to a  sci-fi movie trailer. [10]Solutions of competitors Double wheel vehicles had built by competitors gave a variety of mechanical and sensor  based  balance  solutions.  Several  robots  had straddle  wheels to ensure balance,  together  with low center of mass below the axes of wheels. This necessity emphasized the importance of size reduction also." The full length final round visible at video sharing site (trailer included at the beginning until 0:58) [11]Success  of  research  goal  of  2013 Teams  started after a random draw, the 15 minutes mission time was enough  to  bring  the  better  solution  and  the  rest  of mixed qualification with summarized scores gave the best and talented winner. Track was visible; because of cheap and small remote camera solution doesn't make harder the race but makes more expensive the preparation,  but  human commands  was delayed  for  10  sec.  Competitors invited experts from other knowledge or  studied  them.  Planetary  research  specific  goals reached  in  the  next  fields:  autonomous  navigation, climbing  and  artful  winner  strategies  observable  in videos  during  reach  the  differently  scored  targets.  After a good race sight of the excited competitors is always a good feeling.2602.pdf
46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)
2014 Plan and scientific goal:The challenge this year was more sophisticated than before when the automatism and self control were interesting for models but was not dependent on milliseconds:  manual  remote  control  and  in  situ  onboard closed-loop. The more quicker and automated self onboard closed-loop and fuzzy logic, the more chances to fast solve the problem to win. Price of microchips and microcontrollers  this  time  are  low  but  sophisticated skills must be learning using those new cheap parts.The  plan  and  the  mission  were:  To  build  an  air cushion vehicle driven robot, which was capable to put lump sugar sized dices onto top of the different sized boxes. It was necessary to make a control glove (real or virtual) for one hand to control the rover by fine movements of the hand and fingers. Delay was not necessary this year, because speed was important indeed to keep the competition seamlessly, but this time 'satellite' map was not  available  from a  camera  above  the  plotting board.Plotting  board: 8m x  8m with  different  targets. Targets  and  scores:  On the  plotting  board  were placed 15 target boxes, their size were 0.2m x 0.2m as its base and their height were in order 0.1m, 0.2m and 0.3m according to their score; also there were placed obstacle objects to make the race harder. Scoring was similar to last year, 108;72;36;12 by hardness. Targeting objects, dices: Targeting objects were 20 dices per competitor.  The robot: Size of an air cushion vehicle was necessary to be 0.5mx0.4m. Allowed overhang of the robotic arm was maximum 0.3m. The recommended robot had five functions: 1st to turn on and control the air cushion motor, 2nd to control the steering jet, 3rd to control a necessary robotic arm, which can handle dices,  4th to  drop  dices  and 5th to  pick up and store them. Robots were permitted having a gyroscope. Any hardware was allowed to help the self control of the robot.  Safety: All  the  robots  should  be  able  to  brake safely.  All  the  quickly rotating parts  were  necessary covered with a stable protecting grid or mesh.  Fighting:  Robots  were  allowed  to  fight  each  other  with propulsion or with robotic arms.Control  and  navigation: Control  gloves  or  hand movement recognizers were acceptable. Hand and finger  movement  recognition  cameras  and  software  or gesture  recognizer  integrated  circuits  were  useable. Control gloves were permitted to contain gyroscopes. Planetary research specific features: Quick and accurate integrated remote and self control strictly necessary  during  space  mission  operations,  e.g.  near space stations in space or on the surface of a planet, or at NEO asteroids,  etc.  During manual remote control all of the independent reliable local automated operation needed  to  protect  the robot against  any damage during operation, like overrunning and bumping.  In a planetary mission it is necessary to put down and populate measuring devices and to collect them back. Dynamics of a hovercraft machine can simulate the inertia in microgravity, but only in 2D. Virtualization: Organizers made and make virtual traces  for  the  race  already  months  before  the competition in this year  also.  Mission animations are watchable on YouTube from 2010. [7,8,9,10,11,12]Conclusion:  Competitors  have  to  be  capable  of designing,  developing  and  constructing  complex  robots, and moving them by driving in order from wheel and caterpillar, through amphibians, elevator climbers, legs,  balanced double wheels and air  cushion (20062014). During the competitions a lot of sensors, manipulators  and  tricks  were  used.  We  hope  that  a  prize will be awarded thanks to the gratitude of our sponsors, media covers our events, and competitors join the work of Universities and research institutes.
