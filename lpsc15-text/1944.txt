Introduction:  Mud intrusion and extrusion on Earth are well-known phenomena whereby fluid-rich (e.g., water, methane), fine-grained sediments ascend within a lithologic succession mainly because of their buoyancy [1]. The resulting accumulation of the mud could form a conical or shield-like edifice, mud vocano, as large as a few kilometers in width and a few hundred meters in height [2]. Mud volcanoes are an important "window" into the biosphere of underlying strata, because both a lowcompetence parent bed (clay-rich layer) and some rock fragments are transported to the surface and bring together any microbes that are thriving under those extreme conditions. Those extremophiles are known to exist in community and form a complex metabolic network using fluid-rich minerals. Hence the concentration of Mehtane seep is related to the microbial activities. Mud volcanoes occur in various geological settings including those on sea floors. They are predominantly observed at convergent plate margins [1], including ones in the mountain ranges of central Japan [3]. One of the most active on-land mud volcanoes in central Japan is located at Murono, Tokamachi city in Niigata prefecture (Fig. 1). There are four vent sites. Total CH4 emission were estimated to be least 20 ton/year, of which more than half was from invisible seepage surrounding the mud volcano [3]. Subsurface of mud volcano contains petroleum biodegradation. Biological analysis have not been performed yet at this location. In this paper, we investigated the Murono mud volcano by measuring the methane gas and characterizing the microbial community within a mud-filling and methane-seeping vent for the first time.  Figure 1. Maps of the Murono mud volcano (MV), Tokamachi city, Niigata prefecture, Japan. There are four vent sites and our investigation took place at site 1. Materials and Methods:   Sampling and Molecular Analysis. Mud samples were collected with sterile 2 ml centrifuge tubes. By wearing sterile nitrile gloves, tube was plunged into a 30 cm-wide mud-filling vent by hand (where methane gas is seeping out; site 1 shown in figure 1) and the cap was opened at approximately 30 cm in depth. The surrounding mud sample was also collected for a control. Those samples were kept frozen until molecular analysis. For PCR-DGGE analysis, DNA was directly extracted using ISOIL for beads beating (Nippon gene), and 16S rDNA was amplified using GC341f-534r primer [4, 5]. DGGE was then carried out using Dcode DGGE complete system (Bio Rad). Target bands were sequenced using DGGE band sequencing kit (TecknoSuruga). CH4 analysis. Methane gas was detected using a handheld gas detector (Laser Methane Detector SA3C05A from Tokyo Gas Engineering Co., Ltd. in Japan). Remote sensing measurement was conducted with an infrared absorption spectroscopy. A 1.65 μm laser beam, which is absorbed by methane gas, was directed to the target vent and the reflected beam was recieved by detector. Absorption was measured and calculated into column density of methane. The distance between detector and target was kept at 1 meter for every measurements.  Results:   Molecular characterization of bacterial community. In the PCR-DGGE profiles, two clearly dominant bands were detected from the sample collected within the vent. BLAST search for the nucleotide sequence of 16S rRNA gene to the Apollon database DB-BA 9.0 indicated that they were Ferribacterium sp. and Desulfobulbus sp.. The sequences showing the most similarity were F. limneticum strain CdA-1 (97.4% indentity; accession number Y17060) and D. alkaliphilus strain APS1 (93.9% identity; accession number HM750216) respectively. They are both motile and obligately anaerobic rods, proving that they are not contaminants from the surface. F. Limnetium strain CdA-1 is capable of reducing Fe(III) with acetate as an electron donor [6], whereas D. alkaliphilus strain APS1 gain energy by utilizing propionate with sulfate as an electron acceptor [7]. From both inner vent and control, a single dominant  band of Variovorax sp. was detected. BLAST search show this sequence to be most closely related to V. soli strain GH9-3 (98.5% identity; accession number DQ432053), a rod-shaped motile bacterium under Comanonadaceae family which was isolated from greenhouse soil [8]. Identifying this commonly found soil bacteria from both inner vent and control show that it is originated outside the mud volcano and proves that other species found only within a vent are not contaminants from surrounding. Geochemical characterization. We conducted measurement of methane at 0.5 seconds intervals (Fig. 2). As shown in Figure 2, methane column density above the mud volcano increased and decreased repeatedly. The peaks are associated with eruption of gas bubbles on the surface of mud, supporting that the measured methane gas is originated from the mud volcano. Their column density is 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than those in other regions.  Figure 2. Temporary variations in CH4 column density at Murono MV site 1.  Discussion:  Microbial community of one of the most active on-land mud volcanoes in central Japan was characterized for the first time. The molecular analysis show that anaerobic Fe(III)-reducing (Ferribacterium sp.) and sulfate-reducing (Desulfobulbus sp.) bacteria were present within the vent and form a complex metabolic network.  It is well established elsewhere that hematite is produced by the volcanic activity. Therefore it is very likely that Ferribacterium sp. gain energy by reducing ferric iron of hematite with acetate as an electron donor. Acetate is the end product of propionate oxidation and sulfate reduction by Desulfobulbus sp.. Acetate is also known to be utilized by methaneproducing archaea, for example Methanosarcina thermophile [9]. Such methanogens and sulfate-reducing bacteria are often correlated with the methane production from a terrestrial mud volcano [10]. Our methane gas measurement show that the vent produced 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than other regions, which suggests the possibility of methanogenic archaea coexisting within the Murono MV. Desulfobulbus sp. is also known to form consortium with anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) [11, 12, 13]. ANME are ubiquitous in sediments where sulfate dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) occurs [14]. Methane-related archaea in Murono MV have to be explored further using archaean phylogenic analysis in future. Investigation of microbiology associated with mud volcanoes has important implications for astrobiology of Mars [15, 16]. Features interpreted to be mud volcanoes occur widely in the northern plains of Mars and other localities [17, 18]. It is reported recently that NASA's Mars Curiosity rover has measured about a tenfold of methane in the Martian atmosphere [19]. It has to wait for a future report on correlation between mud volcano-shaped topography and methane in the atmosphere, however as this paper suggests, searching for extant life or biomarkers in the sedimentary deposits [20] associated with mud volcanoes could be considered for future astrobiological missions to the planet. This work, therefore, provides a terrestrial analog for inferring a type example of microbiological communities that may be present or may have been present in the purported mud volcano sites on Mars.
