Introduction This meteorite was purchased by Nicola Castellano at the Genova mineral fair in May 2014, from a Moroccan dealer. The main mass, weighing 140g, is partially covered by a dark brown fusion crust. The sawn surface shows two different areas: angular fragments up to 2 cm of light gray, coarse grained chondritic material and dark-gray, very fine-grained, shock-melted veins up to 2 mm wide intersecting the chondritic matrix. The meteorite has been approved by the Nomenclature Committee of the Meteoritical Society with the name NWA 8711. Nicola Castellano owns the main mass and a polished thin section.   Instruments and methods Optical microscopy was undertaken at the laboratories of the Museum of Planetary Sciences of Prato, Italy, using an Axioplan-2 polarizing optical microscope equipped with Axiocam-HR camera. SEM-SE images have been performed at the Dipartimento di Chimica, Università degli Studi di Firenze laboratories by means of a Hitachi SEM model S-2300 equipped with EDX analyser and a Noran System Six 300 software. Micro-Raman analyses have been performed at the Museo di Storia Naturale, Università degli Studi di Firenze laboratories with a Horiba/Jobin-Yvon equipped with a 1800 g/mm single holographic grating. The spectrograph was coupled to a He-Ne laser source emitting at 632.8 nm (red-light region). The laser beam was focused on the sample using a x50 objective lens resulting in a laser spot of about 3 µm2. EMPAWDS analyses have been performed at the Firenze laboratories of the IGG – CNR (National Council of Research) with a Jeol Microbeam microprobe.  Experimental results The polished thin section analyzed shows that the angular fragments display a typical chondritic texture, consisting of a homogeneous intergrowth of olivine and low-Ca pyroxene crystals, while the intersecting shock-melted veins are consisting of two distinct domains: one is a crystalline portion predominantly made of ringwoodite crystals, deep blue in plane polars and 20-200 μm wide, and rare majorite crystals. The other domain is made by a microcrystalline to glassy portion, green in plane polars, made of quenched silicates (mainly augite) with scattered rounded metal and troilite blebs, up to 30 μm wide (Figure 1). The host domain shows an equilibrated  chondritic texture with few chondrules, not clearly detectable, set in a crystalline matrix of olivine, orthopyroxene, minor plagioclase and diopside, Fe-Ni metal, troilite. Weathering is moderate (W2). Due to the presence of melt veins and shocked phases a high shock stage can be argued (S5).  Both the chondritic portion and the shock-melt veins were investigated by means of optical microscopy, SEM, EMPA and Micro-Raman techniques. EMPA analyses of individual grains were performed on the chondritic portion in order to determine the general minerochemical features of the host matrix and for classification purposes. EMPA and Micro-Raman point analyses were performed on individual grains of the shock-melted veins to characterize their mineralogical composition. In particular, the Micro-Raman spectra provided by the optically blue and pale brown grains of the coarse grained assemblage fit well with those of two high pressure polymorphs of olivine and low-Ca pyroxene, namely ringwoodite and low-Ca majorite (Figures 2, 3 and 4). EMPA analyses on these phases (Fo72,2, 0.14 wt. % MnO, Fe/Mn = 181.59 for ringwoodite; En77,5Fs21,3Wo1,2, 0.18 TiO2, 0.18 Al2O3,  0.13 Cr2O3,  all in wt. %, Fe/Mn = 27.62 for majorite) provided compositions very similar to those of olivine and   Figure 1: polarizing optical microscope image of a thin section of the L6 melt breccia chondrite NWA 8711.

low-Ca pyroxene in the matrix, apart from a remarkable difference in the Fe/Mn ratio between olivine and ringwoodite, confirming the hypothesis that these are shock-generated high pressure phases formed from matrix phases. EMPA analyses performed on the fine-grained portion of the veins (Figure 5) allowed to determine the presence of a majorite-pyrope solid solution rich in Al, Ca, Na, and Cr  (47.59 SiO2,  27.17 MgO, 2.60 CaO, 0.38 MnO, 16.64 FeO, 0.10 TiO2, 3.19 Al2O3,  0.33 Cr2O3, 1.20 Na2O, 0.13 K2O, 0.17 NiO, all in wt. %). Micro-Raman analyses on these phases did not return clear spectra due to a marked fluorescence. Discussion and conclusions: Mineral assemblages in shock-melt veins of meteorites may reproduce at the microscopic scale the pressure and temperature conditions that lead to phase transformations in the mantle. In the Earth's transition zone [1] Mg-Fe olivine transforms to wadsleyite and ringwoodite. At higher pressures, and temperatures (P> 23 GPa and T>1600 °C), typical of the lower mantle, ringwoodite dissociates to bridgmanite [2], a perovskite-type structure [3] and magnesiowüstite [4]. Majorite is believed to be a significant component of the transition zone, stable in the pressure range 19-24 GPa and at temperatures between 1700-2600 °C [3], while at higher pressures it transforms to bridgmanite. Our textural and compositional data are consistent with literature data, which report these two different assemblages in other highly shocked chondrites, like Tenham, Coorara, Sah 98222 and YAM 74445 [5]. According to [6] the majorite-pyrope solid solution crystallized from a chondritic melt produced by shockfusion under high pressures and temperatures. The occurrence of magnesiowüstite, cited in the literature [7] was not detected. Ringwoodite and low-Ca majorite were instead formed by solid state transformation of olivine and low-Ca pyroxene originally present in the meteorite. A pressure range from 20 to 24 GPa can be hypothesized. References: [1] Ringwood, A.E. & Major, A. (1970) PEPI 3, 89; [2] Tschauner et al. (2014)  Am Min, 346, 1100; [3] Kato, T. & Kumazawa, M.
