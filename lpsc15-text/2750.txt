A few of these show large massdependent enrichments in the heavy isotopes of some elements, attesting to a formation by melt distillation of low-temperature precursors, and are often classified as fractionated (F) CAIs ([2] and references therein). Some fractionated CAIs also have large mass-independent anomalies of nucleosynthetic origin and are classified as FUN (Fractionated and Unidentified Nuclear effects) CAIs. Other CAIs with large unidentified nuclear (UN) anomalies lack fractionation effects. While F and FUN CAIs are often not petrologically distinct from regular CAIs, UN effects are most commonly found in hiboniterich CAIs like platy hibonite crystals (PLACs) [3]. We have studied 80 hibonite-rich CAIs separated from the Murchison meteorite for their UN characteristics [4, 5] and incorporation of 26Al at their time of formation. Here, we report the mass-dependent and massindependent isotope effects in O, Mg, Ca and Ti in 7 of these hibonite-rich CAIs that have F(UN) characteristics. We also infer their initial 26Al/27Al ratios [(26Al/27Al)0] from model and internal isochrons.  Methods: Al-Mg and O-isotope analyses were performed with the WiscSIMS Cameca ims-1280 at UW. The results for O isotopes have been previously reported [4]. For Mg isotopes, most hibonites were analyzed with a ~12 µm primary O- beam and mono-EM detection [6]. Ca and Ti isotopes were analyzed with the Cameca ims1280 at UH [7]; part of the results have been previously reported [5]. Intrinsic isotopic fractionation is expressed as FTi and FCa as defined in [3].  The major element compositions were determined by EPMA (Cameca SX-50). Trace elements (REE, Mg, Ti) were measured with the Cameca ims-6f at ASU. NIST glasses were used to obtain relative sensitivity factors and oxide interferences on the heavy REE were corrected using the ion to oxide ratios published by [8].  Results: Mineralogy and morphology: Grains 2-5-1, 2-6-6, and 2-8-7 are stubby crystals of hibonite (70 to 300 µm in size). All contain refractory metal nuggets (RMNs); those in 2-5-1 and 2-6-6 were large enough for analysis and are depleted in Mo and W. 2-2-1 and 2-8-3 are single crystals with platy morphologies. In contrast to other hibonites, their surfaces have abundant hexagonal pits. 1-9-1 is a platy CAI fragment consisting of a spinel and a hibonite layer. 1-10-3 is a hibonite aggregate with inclusions of corundum (<10 µm).  Chemical and isotopic characteristics: The results are summarized in Table 1 and Figures 1 and 2. The main observations are as follows: (1) Based on the inferred (26Al/27Al)0, the hibonite-rich CAIs can be divided into three groups: 26Al-free, with subcanonical ratio, and with approximately canonical ratios (Table 1). (2) All except the canonical CAIs are depleted in Mg and Ti relative to PLAC and SHIB hibonites [4]. (3) All CAIs show fractionation effects in at least one element, but never simultaneously in all four studied elements. (4) The most Mg- and Ti-rich hibonites (canonical CAIs) have the highest degrees of Ca fractionation, but lack corresponding effects in Ti, Mg and O (Fig. 2b). (5) Correlated fractionation effects in Ca and Ti are only observed in four CAIs (Fig. 2b), i.e., 1-10-3, two of the 26Al-free CAIs (2-6-6, 2-5-1) and the subcanonical CAI 2-8-7. (6) Nucleosynthetic anomalies are only observed in 26Al-free CAIs and are more pronounced in 48Ca (δ48Ca of up to 43±5‰) than in 50Ti (Fig. 2a). (7) Most analyzed grains have Δ17O (=δ17O-0.52×δ18O) values between -23‰ and -25‰ (Fig. 1), like many FUN and normal CAIs from unmetamorphosed chondrites [e.g., 9, 10]. Only the CAI with the largest nucleosynthetic ef- fects (26Al-free CAI 2-5-1) has a distinct Δ17O of  -14±1‰. (8) Only CAI 2-6-6 shows significant frac Table 1: Characteristics of the studied CAIs.

Discussion: The fractionated CAIs 2-2-1 and 2-8-3 have particularly enigmatic isotopic compositions (high fractionation in Ca, yet not in O, Mg and Ti, ~canonical (26Al/27Al)0). Their identical morphological, chemical and isotopic characteristics suggest that they may have been liberated from the same CAI, possibly during acid treatment. A general feature of the studied CAIs is that fractionation effects can be observed in all analyzed elements, yet never simultaneously in the same CAI. This could be a result of complicated condensation and evaporation histories or of reintroduction of isotopically normal Mg and/or Ti after CAI crystallization.  Most fractionated hibonites studied here lack fractionation in Mg. This has been observed in previous studies and attributed to quantitative Mg evaporation, followed by Mg surface contamination [11]. However, as Mg and Ti contents are generally coupled in the hibonites studied here, most prominently in the Mg- and Ti-rich canonical CAIs, we argue against contamination, but favor late-stage reintroduction of normal Mg (and possibly also Ti) to explain the lack of Mg fractionation effects. Indicators that reintroduction of Mg also resulted in addition of isotopically normal Ti include (1) the lack of fractionation effects in Ti in the CAIs that show high degrees of Ca fractionation (2-8-3, 2-2-1 and less pronounced in 1-9-1) and (2) the steep distribution of δ48Ca vs. δ50Ti compared to PLACs (Fig. 2a), which could indicate dilution of 50Ti anomalies in the Ti-poor fractionated CAIs. Alternatively, isotopically normal Mg could have entered the hibonite lattice without Ti, possibly facilitated by an overabundance of Ti4+ (and vacancies) relative to Mg2+ in the hibonite lattice, as hinted at by our SIMS analyses. Enhanced Ti may be a result of crystallization in a melt with high Ti/Mg due to preferential evaporation of the more volatile Mg. That the excess Ti is present as Ti3+ is unlikely, given that Ce depletions in hibonite (Table 1) and W and Mo depletions in RMNs indicate formation under oxidizing conditions. The mass-independent effects suggest that the samples record at least three different stages of solar nebular history. The range of resolvable anomalies in 48Ca and 50Ti indicates that the 26Al-free fractionated CAIs formed early in a heterogeneous nebula, that was evolving towards a uniform Δ17O of ~ -24‰ prior to the arrival of 26Al. The subcanonical CAI may have formed during admixture of 26Al (although formation after significant 26Al decay cannot be excluded), in a nebula characterized by a Δ17O of ~ -24‰, in which nucleosynthetic anomalies had been homogenized to a level of < ~5‰. Finally, the canonical hibonites formed around the same time as normal CAIs. Whether or not the subcanonical level indicates early or late formation, the approximately constant Δ17O value indicates that the oxygen isotopic evolution of the CAI-forming region appears to have stagnated for a significant amount of time. Conclusions: The lack of Mg and Ti isotopic fractionation in some hibonites with high Ca fractionation suggests that late-stage reintroduction of Mg and Ti may have diluted isotopic effects in these elements. As Ca abundance is fixed by mineral chemistry, this element likely provides a more robust record of the original mass-dependent and -independent isotope effects in hibonite. The variable nucleosynthetic anomalies and levels of 26Al incorporation suggest that these CAIs represent at least three different isotopic populations and sample different evolutionary stages of the nebula. This further implies that conditions favorable for melt distillation existed over a significant period of nebula history. References: [1] Amelin Y. et al. (2002) Science, 297, 1678-1683.
