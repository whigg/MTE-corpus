Introduction and Aim of this Study: Here we present the summary of our research, which aims to characterise the mineralogy of Amazonian-aged impact craters in the northern hemisphere of Mars, with the overall goal of creating a crater database. Specifically, the primary objective is to try to identify and map the nakhlite suite of alteration minerals — comprising ferric saponite, serpentine, siderite and salts [1-4] — in order to the identify the type of crater in which they were formed.  This study draws on research conducted by Bridges and Schwenzer [1], who showed that the parent rocks of the nakhlite Martian meteorites were altered by a hydrothermal brine at ≤200 °C [1] in the last 670 Ma [5]. This may have occurred in the setting of an impactinduced hydrothermal system in the ice-bearing crust of Mars. Although the nakhlite secondary assemblage formed rapidly e.g. < 1 year [1], such systems have the potential to last for up to ~10 Myr [6], resulting in various phyllosilicate alteration phases [7]. The hydrothermal brine that altered the nakhlites also contained elements necessary for life [1], therefore a consequence of this research is the identification of past habitable environments on Mars. Data Analysis Approach: Amazonian-aged impact craters ≥7 km diameter in the northern hemisphere of Mars were selected using the most recent Mars crater database [11] and the latest geologic map of Mars [12]. CRISM data for this subset of impact craters was then obtained. Hyperspectral imagery (362-3920 nm; 544 bands) acquired by the CRISM instrument onboard Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter [8], was processed using the CRISM Analysis Toolkit ENVI extension [9] to remove instrumental, photometric and atmospheric effects, as well as striping and spiking image artifacts. Summary products were then derived to highlight regions of interest, resulting in the extraction of spectra that were compared to reference library spectra for mineral identification [9,10].  Results: Results suggest that 8 impact craters (of various diameters) out of the 144 analysed show signs of hydrated minerals, whereas the rest exhibited a variety of spectral signatures not consistent with hydrated minerals (figure 1). Although dust coverage is an issue in some regions, these findings are consistent with the general understanding of the Martian Amazonianepoch.  Figure 1.

Analysis of CRISM data (figure 3) shows 2.3 µm absorptions, indicating the presence of an Fe-rich phyllosilicate in spectra 1, 3 and 4. 1.9 µm H2O absorptions are apparent in spectra 1 and 2, and less so in 3 and 4. Generally, the spectra extracted from the CRISM data are noisy. During the CRISM analysis, pixels in the same spectral column were compared to those within the region of interest - the spectral absorptions mentioned here are not a repeating feature within the spectral columns and so are consistent with a difference in mineralogy.  Figure 3. CRISM spectra extracted from locations 1 - 4 shown in figure 2. Key absorptions are located at ~1.9 and 2.3 µm for H2O and Fe/Mg-OH absorptions. Impact-Induced Hydrothermal Alteration or Excavation of Older Terrain?: The origin of hydrated minerals located in impact craters has been a discussion point for previous investigations [13,14]. The detection of an altered mineralogy located in impact craters does not immediately indicate the presence of an impact-induced hydrothermal system - hydrated minerals could be evidence for excavation of an older surface. The location of altered material within the impact crater is key to answering this question. Pre-existing hydrated minerals from an older surface would differ to those that are the result of impact induced hydrothermal alteration, and would be present not only within the impact crater, but within the crater ejecta. If the hydrated material is restricted to the impact crater alone and not present within the crater ejecta, then it is most likely the result of impact-induced hydrothermal alteration. [13] Conclusions: The mineral detections shown in figures 2 and 3 are confined to within the impact craters and are not located within the ejecta. This observation suggests that these detections are associated with the presence of an impact-induced hydrothermal system, although the exposure of pre-existing secondary minerals cannot be completely ruled out. The impact history that affected the nakhlite parents rocks must include two impacts - the first inducing a hydrothermal system and the second launching the nakhlites off Mars - thereby resulting in a crater-oncrater formation [1-3]. The crater-on-crater formation, shown in figure 2, is a likely type of source location for the sort of hydrothermal assemblage present in the nakhlite martian meteorites [1-3], though the exact crater identity on Mars is likely to remain uncertain.  In Summary, 258 CRISM images covering 144 impact craters in the northern hemisphere of Mars were studied. Eight of these impact craters showed spectral features that suggest a hydrated mineralogy with some similarities to the nakhlites (Table 1). However, lack of clear spectral signatures, caused by small regions of interest and surface dust coverage, has hindered the investigation.
