 FTIR and Fluorescence Spectroscopic Analyses of NWA 7034: Organic Terrestrial Contamination and its Association with High Nickel Regions .      Introduction: Samples and Methods:       X-ray Results:     FTIR Spectral Results: Discussion:   resolution will increase, with measurements in the ppb range and spatial resolutions of 50 nm giving us the ability to resolve submicron grains in aggregates. But to take advantage of the very small spatial resolution, one needs to analyze  samples that are near the thickness of the spatial resolution. At 10 Kev the escape depth for Zn is on the order of 100 microns, depending on the composition of the sample. With a 50 nm focused spot, a 30 micron thick "thin section" will be out of focus by almost that amount. Also, to analyze a single 200 nm sized mineral grain the sample thickness should be no more than the thickness of the smallest particles so one does not analyze minerals and glasses "behind" the mineral or glass of interest. We sectioned this sample of NWA 7034 with the hope of having beamtime on one of these new beamlines where we will be able to resolve single minerals and also to collect both C and N K-edge XANES spectra.       Why is the Fe/Ni in NWA 7034 Ni rich areas so different from the CI ratio? Yen, et al. analyzing data from the Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity found that bright surface dust in the Gustav region is enhanced with Ni relative to the other soil components. The Gustav region on Mars is believed to be the area from which NWA 7034 and its pairings originated  [1,7].  Yen et al.  concluded that the addition of 3.4%  chondritic material could be used to explain the elevated Ni. However, doing this caused mismatches in other elements and the surface dust at Gustev was not simply chondritic matter added to Martian surface matter. The Ni hot spots found in NWA 7034 that contain little or no detectable Fe may be the result of differentiation of chondritic material from an impact melt. Xu, et al. [11] found metal grains in 4 different lunar samples and concluded these grains were produced from impact melts. Some of these grains contained as much as 31 wt%  Ni.     Why the amide containing material seems to be associated with the Ni rich regions is not clear but bacteria are known to absorb onto the surface of Ni containing compounds  and so, may preferentially attach to any Ni rich regions in any rock and some strains of bacteria are used as bioaccummulators to remove Ni from industrial waste water [8]. The FTIR data also point to a significant variety of organic matter in NWA 7034. Although Grady et al. suggest the C isotope data identifies terrestrial contamination, it raises the question of how does one differentiated between terrestrial organic matter and extraterrestrial material if the C isotopic data is the same? With the reported multiple lithographies occurring in NWA 7034 one would expect any Martian carbon to be highly altered and in the case of carbon associated with high temperature and pressure events such as those found in volcanic or impact processes one would expect the carbon to be in an inorganic form, mostly amorphous carbon but also graphite and diamond. Some of the FTIR spectra may point to the presence of amorphous carbon but graphite has a strong, broad band at ~3500 cm-1 and we did not see this. Diamonds would likely be on the nanometer size and therefore not detectable by the FTIR microscope.      Conclusions:  Coming from a semi-arid environment one has to wonder how NWA 7034 got contaminated with terrestrial organic matter if the meteorite was only on Earth for a short period of time. Tissint, a shergottite type meteorite was recovered 4 months after its observed fall in a region not far from where NWA 7034 was recovered and this meteorite did not contain any FTIR spectra that would point to terrestrial contamination. It has not yet been determined how long NWA 7034 and its pairings have been on earth but the Western Sahara is a dry region and so rainfall is limited. ALH84001 is believed to have been in the Allan Hills region of the Antarctic for ~13000 years and it is not very contaminated with terrestrial organic matter [9] and yet Antarctic ice and ice melts have been shown to support a diverse microbial ecosystem [12, 13] . W. S. Kiefer, et al. have reported a bulk porosity for ALH84001 of 9.1% and for NWA 7034, 7.4% [10]. NWA 7034 is less porous than ALH84001 and 13000 years of exposure to Antarctic summers and melting ice has resulted in significantly less terrestrial organic matter contamination for ALH84001 than NWA 7034. It is possible NWA 7034 was mishandled and the other pairings will contain less terrestrial organic matter. With its low porosity and exposure to minimal rainfall it is also possible  NWA 7034 was on this planet for a significant amount of time before it was found.      References: [1] C. B. Agee, et al.
