Introduction:  Knowledge of mean atomic weight is useful to characterize terrestrial and extraterrestrial minerals and rocks, planets, moons, asteroids and comets. The aim of the paper was to determine and analyze mean atomic weight of Earth, Venus, Mars, Mercury and Earth's Moon. Literature data on the mean bulk elemental/oxide composition of the solar system internal planets and the Moon, as well as their constituents have been used to calculate mean atomic weight Amean values. Apart from the whole planets atomic weights, also mean atomic weights of their cores, mantles and crusts were determined.   Results and discussion:  Tables 1 and 2 collect values of Amean calculated using data on chemical composition predicted by various researchers (e.g. [19])  in their models of planets and moon. To determine Amean values for moon, planets, their cores, mantles and crust following relationships were used: Amean = 1/∑(wi/Ai),                                               (1)                           Amean=∑(Ni/N).Ai),                                               (2) wcore/Acore + wmantle/Amantle + wcrust/Acrust=  =1/Amean,                                                              (3) wcore/Acore + wbsp/Absp = 1/Amean,                    (4) where wi(wt%) ia a mass fraction of i element/oxide, Ni/N(at%) is an atomic fraction of i element/oxide, Ni is a number of i atoms, N is a number of all atoms N =  ∑Ni, Ai is the atomic weight of a given element, and/or a mean atomic weight of oxide. wcore(wt%), wmantle(wt%), wcrust(wt%) represent mass fraction of core, mantle and crust of a given planet or moon, wbsp is a mass fraction of a silicate part of a planet (bsp = BSP = Bulk Silicate Planet = Mantle + Crust), and Acore, Amantle, Acrust, Absp are mean atomic weights of cores, mantles, crusts and silicate parts of planets and moon. In addition, following relationships are valid: ∑wi =1,                                                                  (5) ∑(Ni/N) = 1,                                                           (6)  wcore + wmantle + wcrust  =1,                             (7)    wcore + wbsp = 1.                                                 (8) Mean atomic weight is dimensionless, similary as relative atomic mass.      The comparison of Amean values determined in this paper with values established by other researchers reveals a satisfactory agreement (Tables 3, 4). The agreement is good not only for the whole planets and the moon (Table 3), but also for Earth's core and mantle (Table 4).

For cores of four inner planets and Moon we have Amean = 51.3 ± 1.3, and for their bulk silicates Amean = 21.4 ± 0.4. Only Mercury's core Amean is somewhat higher (Amean = 53.5 ± 3.5) than that of Earth, Venus and Mars, for which Amean = 51.5 ±1.4.       Knowledge of mean atomic weight of terrestrial planets and moon enables one searching for various factors determining Amean and useful dependiences. Important relationships have been established.        First relationship is between mean atomic weight of planets and uncompressed density d(g/cm3) of planets (Fig. 1). It can be expressed by the equation (R2 = 0.99, RMSE = 0.54)  Amean = (7.51±0.13).d + (-2.74±0.55).                  (9)   Fig. 1 Relationship between mean atomic weight and uncompressed density of a planet. Amean of dust of P/Halley comet, and Amean of planetary core material  are also inserted.       Second relationship is between mean atomic weight of planets and mass fraction of their cores (Fig. 2, eqs. (10), (11)). The core mass fraction wcore = Mcore/Mplanet, where Mcore is the mass of core, and Mplanet is the mass of a planet. The relationship can be expressed by two fits.     First is the empirical equation (with RMSE = 0.74): Amean = (23.8±2.8).wcore.2+(5.6±2.9).wcore                +(21.9±0.5).                                          (10) According to eq. (10) for wcore = 1 (planet without silicates) we have Amean = 51.3 ± 6.2 (range 45.157.5) and for wcore = 0 (planet without a metallic core) we have Amean = 21.9 ± 0.5 (range 21.4-22.4). For the Earth wcore = 0.325 so  Amean = 26.2.     The second equation presenting effect of mass fraction of core wcore on Amean follows from eqs. (4) and (8). Substituting wbsp=1-wcore, and mean values:  Abse = 21.4, and Acore = 51.3 into eq. (4) gives the equation: Amean = 1/ [-0.02724.wcore + 0.04673],              (11) where coefficient 0.02724 = (1/Absp) - (1/Acore), and coefficient 0.04673 = 1/Absp. Amean values determined by eq. (11) are listed in third column of Table 3. The following values of wcore were used in these calculations: 0.68 for Mercury, 0.32 for Venus, 0.325 for Earth, 0.025 for Moon, and 0.217 for Mars.  Fig. 2 Relationship between mean atomic weight of a planet and mass fraction of the core.      The reverse effects: the effect of Amean on wcore, and effect of Amean on d  have been also established. They are given by the equations:   wcore = (-36.716 ±1.15)/Amean + (1.716±0.041), (12)          d = (0.133 ± 0.002).Amean + (0.37 ± 0.07),          (13)     which results from eqs. (11) and (9). Values of RMSE: 0.03 for eq.(12), and 0.07 for eq. (13)).  So we are able to predict wcore and d, if Amean is known.      Conclusions: Mean atomic weight of inner planets and the Moon can be determined using chemical composition, planetary uncompressed density, and/or mass of core. Mass fraction of cores and uncompressed planetary density can be predicted by Amean data. References: [1] Anderson, D. L., Theory of the Earth (1989), Blackwell, Boston. [2] Rubie D. C. et al.
