Introduction: Observations of the cometary coma near the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov- Gerasimenko made by the IES (Ion and Electron Sensor) instrument onboard the Rosetta Orbiter during the Fall of 2014 indicate that electron fluxes within a couple of hundred of kilometers of the nucleus greatly exceed solar wind electron fluxes.  The nucleus was at a heliocentric distance of about 3 AU  and the production rate of H2O was between 1026 to 1027 s-1.        We suggest that the large electron densities (e.g., ne â‰ˆ 100 cm-3) and fluxes that were observed are associated with the ion density enhancement created by the photoionization of cometary gas by solar radiation, or by charge exchange with solar wind protons.  Quasineutrality requires that the electron and ion densities be the same. The newly-born ions are accelerated by the solar wind motional field but remain unmagnetized near the nucleus as suggested by pre-encouner hybrid models  of the solar wind interaction with the comet [1]. The ions are unmagnetized near the nucleus at 3 AU (i.e., very large gyroradii) and the electron gyroradii are roughly the nucleus size-scale (few km).  We suggest that the electrons observed include solar wind electrons and photoelectrons produced by photoionization by solar radiation of the coma gas or the surface of the nucleus.  However, these electrons must be partially confined to the vicinity of the nucleus by an ambipolar electric field.  There is probably also some compression of the electron gas near the nucleus due to a magnetic field pile-up [1].  Rosetta IES data will be shown in this paper and compared with model results.        Rosetta IES Data:  Electron spectra measured by IES near the nucleus are shown in Fig. 1.  The IES measures electrons and ions with energies up to 20 keV [2]. A solar wind electron spectrum measured near 970 km is also shown for comparison.  The nearnucleus fluxes greatly exceed typical solar wind electron fluxes for 3 AU.  The cometary electron fluxes remain large up to energies in excess of 100 eV, where there is a sharp decrease of the flux.  The densities obtained from spectra like these are about 10 - 100 cm3 (Fig. 2), whereas solar wind densities at 3 AU are only about 0.5 cm-3.       Electron Sources:   Sources include: (1) solar wind electrons, (2) photoelectrons from the ionization of cometary neutral gas, and (3) photoelectrons from the ionization of the surface of the nucleus.  Far from the nucleus (e.g., 1000 km), the solar wind source appears to be adequate, but other sources are needed near the      Figure 1.

The flux drop-offs are at about 100 eV.  nucleus. Photoelectron fluxes from the cometary neutral gas are modeled using a two-stream code that included sources and collisional electron-impact processes [3, 4].  The flux of photoelectrons from the nucleus (only applicable for magnetic field  lines attached to the nucleus) was found from the solar radiation flux using a 5% emission probability.  The shape of the modeled photoelectron spectra are similar to the data overall, but the magnitude of the model fluxes are  much less that the fluxes measured near the comet, so the models are missing something. Cometary Ions:  We use test particle and Monte Carlo methods to investigate the distribution of water group ions around the comet 67P/CG nucleus (another paper will give the details of the ion calculations which are similar to those undertaken for Mars [5]).  A Haser model [6] is used to determine the neutral density, with a gas production rate of Q = 1026 s-1 and an ionization frequency of 10-7 s-1. The cometary ions (H2O+, but the results would be similar for CO2+ or other heavy ion species) are accelerated by the motional electric field of the solar wind (E = - usw x B).  Fig. 3 shows ion density contours near the nucleus from this simple model.  The Rubin et al.[1] hybrid model also shows   enhanced densities near the nucleus but the density structure is somewhat more spread-out [1]. The predicted densities are comparable to the electron densities measured by IES.       Ambipolar Electric Field and Quasi-neutrality: The generalized Ohm's law gives the electric field needed for a plasma to preserve quasi-neutrality [7].  One of the field terms is an ambipolar/polarization field (Epol = -(1 / nee) grad pe, where the electron pressure is pe = nekTe). The ion density structure (Fig. 3) should give rise to such an ambipolar electric field that confines the photoelectrons and boosts their density. The overall electrical potential difference between the center of the structure to the outside is about equal to the average electron kinetic energy divided by the electron charge (or about 100 Volts).  Elecrons created within the region with energies less than this will be confined (or partially confined, other effects such as E x B drift can remove them).  External solar wind electrons will be accelerated inward.     Modeling the effects of this field on the electron distribution function is very difficult and we have taken a simplified approach to this problem.  In one case, we applied our two-stream electron code, but adopted a reflecting boundary condition for electrons with energies less than 100 eV (Fig. 4).  The electron fluxes were indeed enhanced but still not enough. Perhaps the electron gas is also compressed due to an enhanced magnetic field [1]. Summary: We investigated the energy distribution of cometary electrons near the nucleus of comet 67P/CG.  IES has revealed the presence of greatly enhanced electron fluxes and densities which appear to be associated with cometary ions created near the nucleus.  Some preliminary modeling efforts indicate that the observed electrons are probably photoelectrons due to ionization of the nucleus and coma gas by solar radiation. References:  [1] Rubin M. et al.
