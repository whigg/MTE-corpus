OBSERVATION OF IONOSPHERIC EXPANSION IN MAVEN STATIC DATA R. Livi1 J. McFadden1, B. M. Jakosky2, 1Space Sciences Laboratory, Univ. of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, 94720(rlivi@ssl.berkeley.edu), 2Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, University of Colorado, Boulder CO 803033  Motivation: Using preliminary data from the SupraThermal And Thermal Ion Composition sensor (STATIC) we observe a period of ionospheric expansion where the altitude changes from <200 km to >500 km (Fig. 1) shortly after the arrival of an SEP event, as measured by the Solar Energetic Particle sensor (SEP).    Approach: Plasma moments are derived for three orbits (18 October - 19 October) to monitor ion densities, temperatures, and drift velocities during the transition from the magnetosheath to the cold ionosphere. This transition is characterized by the change in plasma content and temperature as the spacecraft enters and leaves the dense ionosphere. The expansion lasts for ~12 hours.

A sharp drop in ion energy characterizes expansion of the ionosphere. 2910.pdf
