VALLEY NETWORKS AND THE NATURE OF THE LATE NOACHIAN MARS CLIMATE. B.M. Hynek 1Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, University of Colorado-Boulder, 3665 Discover Drive, Boulder, CO 80303, 2Dept. of Geological Sciences, University of Colorado-Boulder  hynek@lasp.colorado.edu  Introduction: Valley networks remain the best evidence that Mars had a long-lived, integrated hydrosphere covering much of the planet, which seems to imply a warm/wet climate for 10s to 100s of millions of years in the Late Noachian.  Most of these connected and often dendritic valley systems are consistent with a fluvial formation via precipitation and surface runoff [e.g., 1-2].  Cross-cutting relations with ancient cratered highlands [1] and network crater-age dates [34] indicated that a majority (~90%) of these systems seem to have formed in the Late Noachian up through the Noachian-Hesperian boundary (âˆ¼3.7 Ga) (Fig. 1).  There is evidence that valley incision was active in different regions of Mars throughout this time period and also that many valleys had several periods of active formation [3].  Smaller, immature valley networks occur on younger terrains of Mars (HesperianAmazonian) with a majority found on volcanic edifices and within Hellas basin [1] (Fig. 1).  These smaller younger systems are more apt to preserve terminal deposits in the forms of fan deltas or alluvial fans [5-6] The largest valley networks are similar in length and drainage area to Earth's largest river systems and individual trunk-segment valleys can be 20 km wide and >1 km deep.  Few of the larger valley systems have sedimentary deposits at their termini; however, many of the lower reaches of the large ancient valley networks have been obscured by younger resurfacing.  Analytical methods were used to assess the formation timescales of eight larger networks.  Results indicate that it took 105-107 years to transport enough sediment out of the valley network to match the observed volumes [7].  Though, considering the large uncertainty in these calculations and the combination of parameters that produced minimum timescales, it is possible that the formation timescales approach durations similar to their span in ages of ~108 years. Outstanding Questions: While strong evidence exists that the Martian valley networks required a climate capable of producing sustained precipitation and surface runoff for formation, many questions still exist: Climatic Triggers: Morphometric arguments, models, and sediment transport calculations indicate that many of Mars' larger valley networks required an active hydrosphere with long-lived precipitation (at least several 10+ m.y. periods).  Impact-induced warm/wet conditions has been proposed as a climate trigger; however, the larger impacts needed to significantly induce warm/wet conditions occurred long before most valley networks formed and individual events were too short in duration to match expected formation timescales [1].  Recently, two Mars climate modeling efforts show promise at making Mars warm during the faint sun Noachian period: SO2 warming of the planet during periods of punctuated volcanism [8] and microphysical models of the early Mars climate [9].  These models provide intriguing ways to allow an active hydrosphere during the Noachian; however, the connection to valley network formation and temporallyresolved details of the models require further work. Additionally, the valley networks formed shortly after the Late Heavy Bombardment.  Could that delivery of volatiles and associated climate disruption been required for valley network formation? Timing: Dating the age of valley networks is challenging.  Cross-cutting relations with the terrains they incised and crater-age dates only provide minimum or termination ages, respectively.  Determining when valleys were actively being incised is further exacerbated by many systems showing evidence of multiple periods of formation through time [3].  It is crucial to characterize the inception of valley network formation and the spatial and temporal components through time, not just the shut-off of incision.  Were valley networks active in the Middle and Early Noachian?  Or was there really a climate optimum in the Late Noachian? Formation timescales: Hoke et al. [7] showed that grain size-frequency and water depth greatly influence valley formation timescale models.  These are unconstrained variables for Mars, since we have never observed Mars' larger valley networks from the ground with landed assets.  How can we better model the length of time required for valley network formation? Distribution: While valley networks cover most of the ancient highland terrains, several regions have a paucity of valleys (e.g., Noachis Terra) or elsewhere there are expansive undissected reaches between systems.  Were valleys formed on these terrains and then later obliterated?  Or did they never form in these regions?  Fine scale tributaries are also lacking across much of Mars.  Is this just a result of the antiquity of valleys on a geologically active planet?  Links to aqueous alteration:  The orbiting spectrometers and rovers have shown significant water:rock alteration of the Martian crust into phyllosilicates, sulfates, silica, and even carbonates [e.g., 10].  Several deltas also exhibit alteration minerals [e.g., 11].  Yet it remains unclear whether or not the widespread fluvial episodes that formed the valley 2166.pdf

(4) Valleys (blue) with drainage density in cold-warm colors.  black = fan deltas [5], dark red = open-lake basins [15], pink = chloride salts [16] networks contributed to the chemical alteration of the Martian crust (i.e., it could have been altered at an earlier time and just transported during valley formation). Links to volcanism:  The majority of the Tharsis mass was emplaced in the Noachian and altered the long-wavelength topography of the planet on which the valleys were incised [12].  Additionally, Hesperian-aged volcanism resurfaced ~1/3 of the planet and was complete shortly after the majority of valley networks formed [13].  The temporal coincidence between valley formation and extensive volcanic outgassing may provide a causal link, especially considering the possible warming effect of Mars' climate through volcanism [8].  Yet this link has not been demonstrated. Lack of terminal deposits: Martian valley networks the size of the Mississippi River seldom have terminal deposits (e.g., deltas).  What happened to all the material excavated from and transported through the networks?  It is easy to dismiss it as subsequent erosion/modification/obliteration, but is that the case? Is an ocean required?:  Modeling by [14] showed that without a large standing body of water in the northern plains of Mars, a long-lived warm/wet climate was impossible.  Further, their regions of enhanced precipitation when including a northern ocean in the models correlated with the regions of dense valley dissection observed of the highland crust.  It is well known that the interior of the Pangean supercontinent on Earth was extremely arid due to the great distance from a body of water, as are the deep interior of continents today (e.g., Antarctica).  Did Mars need an ocean to produce the valley networks? References: [1] Hynek, B.M. et al. (2010) JGR, 115, E09008. [2] Craddock, R.A., & A.D. Howard (2002) JGR, 107(E11), 21-1.
