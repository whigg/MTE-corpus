Introduction:  The 176Lu-176Hf decay system can be used to resolve planetary differentiation timescales, but this application requires knowledge of Hf isotopic evolution for bulk planets. Because Lu and Hf are refractory and lithophile, the isotopic evolution of  bulk planets and their silicate portions can be reconstructed by back-calculation from the present-day 176Hf/177Hf and 176Lu/177Hf in chondrites [1–3]. However, these ratios in chondrites are variable due to re-distribution of Lu and Hf during metamorphism [4], making it difficult to unambiguously define the “chondritic uniform reservoir (CHUR)”. Thus, the validity of the proposed Lu-Hf parameters for CHUR [1–3] needs to be substantiated with using a more direct approach. The initial 176Hf abundance of the solar system is the cornerstone for understanding Lu-Hf systematics of CHUR and terrestrial planets, but it remains poorly constrained. The back-calculation using the proposed Lu-Hf CHUR parameters [1–3] and λ176Lu of 1.867 x 10-11 a-1 [5–7] yields solar initial 176Hf/177Hf of 0.279794–0.279820. Notably, these values are clearly lower than the initial 176Hf/177Hf defined by a Lu-Hf internal isochron for the angrite SAH99555 [8] and whole-rock isochrons for eucrites [9] and combined eucrites and chondrites [10]. In addition, these meteorite isochrons give apparent old dates (~4850 Ma), while terrestrial rocks and meteorite phosphates yield Lu-Hf internal isochron dates consistent with their UPb ages up to 4557 Ma [5–7]. Some have interpreted the apparent old dates and lower initial 176Hf/177Hf to reflect 176Hf excesses in the meteorites resulting from an accelerated decay of 176Lu via photoexcitation on the parent planetesimals [8,11,12]. However, this interpretation is inconsistent with the lack of 176Lu depletions in the meteorites that should accompany the accelerated 176Lu decay [13]. Alternatively, they may reflect metamorphic re-distribution of Lu and Hf. In this study, we determine the solar initial 176Hf abundance using eucrite zircon. Zircon has high Hf contents with low Lu/Hf so that it records near-initial 176Hf/177Hf at the time of crystallization. Moreover, the crystallization age can be determined by U-Pb isotopes and the U-Pb data can validate whether it remained closed U-Pb and Lu-Hf systems. Hence, zircon is suitable for Lu-Hf isotopic study and, in particular, meteorite zircon is ideal to define the solar initial value [14]. Nevertheless, the use of meteorite zircon for Lu-Hf isotopic study has been hampered by its rarity and small size (<20 µm). Recently we found exceptionally large zircon grains (~80 µm) from the eucrite Agoult [15]. These grains allow us to conduct the first highprecision Lu-Hf isotopic analysis of meteorite zircon.  Sample and Methods: Non-cumulate eucrites represent basaltic crust that experienced metamorphic and impact events. Agoult is a non-cumulate unbrecciated eucrite showing granulite textures [16]. The zircon in Agoult typically occurs in association with ilmenite, spinel and/or tridymite in the mesostasis (Fig. 1), whereas ilmenite grains often contain baddeleyite needles. The Ti-in-zircon thermometer showed that the zircon grains crystallized at sub-solidus temperatures of ~900 ˚C [15]. The mineral assemblage and subsolidus crystallization temperatures indicate that the Agoult zircon formed by baddeleyite exsolution from ilmenite followed by its reaction with surrounding tridymite during high-temperature metamorphism.  We measured Lu-Hf isotopic ratios in eight zircon grains by solution MC-ICPMS. All eight grains displayed no zoning structure under back-scattered electron and cathodoluminescence imaging, and yielded concordant ID-TIMS U-Pb ages with a 207Pb/206Pb age of 4554.5 ± 2.0 Ma [15]. Thus, we consider that their U-Pb and Lu-Hf systems remain intact and that the 207Pb/206Pb age reflects the timing of the zircon crystallization during metamorphism, which is ~10 Ma later than the crystallization age of basaltic eucrites [17].

Results: The Agoult zircon grains have presentday 176Hf/177Hf of 0.279796 ± 0.000016 (2 SD), which is significantly lower than those of any previously known solar system rocks and minerals. The remarkably low present-day 176Hf/177Hf is attributed to its old crystallization age and low 176Lu/177Hf of 0.00015–0.00021. The 176Lu/177Hf range is even lower than those of typical terrestrial igneous zircons [18]. This is consistent with the metamorphic origin of the zircon via Zr release from ilmenite having low Lu/Hf [15]. Using the zircon crystallization age [15], we obtain initial 176Hf/177Hf of 0.279781 ± 0.000018 (2 SD) (Fig. 2), which serves as a robust upper limit on the solar initial value. Moreover, the time period of ~13 Ma from the solar system formation to the Agoult zircon crystallization is sufficiently short as to make radiogenic growth of 176Hf prior to the zircon crystallization negligible, unless the decay rate of 176Lu was significantly accelerated. To evaluate possible accelerated 176Lu decay in Agoult and its precursor, we further analyzed whole-rock Agoult and terrestrial samples for Lu isotopic composition. The results show that Agoult and terrestrial basalts have identical 176Lu/175Lu within analytical error of ~0.2permil, thereby eliminating an accelerated 176Lu decay in Agoult and its precursor. We therefore conclude that the zircon initial value can be regarded as the solar initial 176Hf/177Hf. Discussion: The newly defined solar initial value is clearly higher than the initial 176Hf/177Hf obtained from the meteorite isochrons yielding apparent old dates (Fig. 2). At the same time, the initial value overlaps within uncertainty with the initial 176Hf/177Hf calculated from the Lu-Hf CHUR parameters of [3] (176Lu/177Hf = 0.0336 ± 0.0001; 176Hf/177Hf = 0.282785 ± 0.000011) that are based on analyses of unequilibrated chondrites. This general agreement indicates the constant 176Lu decay rate at 1.867 x 10-11 a-1 [5–7] in the chondrites throughout solar system history. In detail, however, some unequilibrated chondrites yield initial 176Hf/177Hf higher than the solar initial value. Furthermore, we found that these chondrites tend to have lower Lu/Hf. The higher initial 176Hf/177Hf associated with the lower Lu/Hf can be explained not by an accelerated 176Lu decay but by secondary Lu/Hf fractionation in the chondrites. The interpretation is supported by the observation that some of the unequilibrated chondrites yield distinctly younger Pb-Pb ages than the others [19]. The unequilibrated chondrites yielding initial 176Hf/177Hf identical to our newly established solar initial value exhibit a narrow range of 176Lu/177Hf and present-day 176Hf/177Hf, that is, 0.0338 ± 0.0001 and 0.282793 ± 0.000011. We propose that these values represent the most pristine chondrites and, therefore, more suitable for the CHUR reference. References: [1]  Blichert-Toft J. and Albarède F. (1997) EPSL, 148, 243–258.
