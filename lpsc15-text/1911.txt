The current consensus is that the two layers were formed from ejecta from the Chicxulub impact with a short hiatus between their deposition [3-5]. The lower layer is thought to be formed from melted target rock that has principally travelled on a ballistic path, and the upper layer from an expanding vapor plume that contained volatiles from sedimentary rocks and vaporized projectile, water, and entrained shocked and melted particles [3]. There are, however, several observations that are difficult to explain: 1) the hiatus between the deposition of the two layers; 2) the near-constant thickness of the lower layer - which would thin away from Chicxulub if it were a purely ballistic deposit; and 3) that some shocked particles in the upper layer are larger than spherules in the lower layer - which is contrary to expectations if the layers are separated in the atmosphere according to Stokes's law.  Here, we use a hydrocode to model the impact and ejection of material away from Chicxulub, and ejecta re-entry. Our models show that the earliest ejecta are formed from melted target rock that arrives in high mass fluxes and passes rapidly through the atmosphere to form the lower layer. Ejecta re-entry causes such intense heating and expansion of the atmosphere that later arriving projectile-rich ejecta are re-directed in all directions to form the upper layer and global K-Pg layer. Methods and initial conditions: We model the impact with the 2D/3D hydrocode SOVA [6] using the ANEOS equation of state for geological materials [7, 8]. The modeling includes two stages: 1) crater excavation including plume and ejecta curtain formation; and 2) ejecta interacting with the atmosphere as it travels to its final destination. Previously we considered only material ejected  at > 2-3 km/s [9] whereas, here, we have included all ejecta traveling at >0.3 km/s.  Stage 1: The modeled Chicxulub target consists of a 3-km-thick sedimentary layer (porous watersaturated limestone), a 30-km-thick crystalline basement (granite). The projectile has a diameter of 15 km and velocity of 18 km/s at 45° to horizon. We use a high spatial resolution (250 m or 30 CPPR) to accurately quantify (with tracer particles) the amount of ejected material, its depth of origin (to distinguish crystalline basement, sediments, and the projectile), maximum shock compression and its velocity at a 15km altitude. At this  altitude ejecta reach their maximum velocity but are not yet separated into either impact plume or ejecta curtain. All tracers' data are stored and used later to construct a model of ejecta for Stage 2. Stage 2: The spatial resolution is set to 2 km in order to cover distances up to 5000 km from Chicxulub and altitudes of 400 km. Once ejected particles reach an altitide of 400 km, ballistic continuation on a sphere [10] is applied to find the re-entry parameters for each particle and its re-entry time. All tracers are transformed into real (representative) particles which exchange heat and momentum with the atmosphere in the frame of a "dusty flow approximation" [11].  Sizefrequency distribution (SFD) of particles is described by a power law N>m=Cm-b with the exponent b=0.9 1.1; maximum fragment size is defined by maximum shock compression [see 12], and minimum size is 1 µm (because of computatitonal restrictions). Particles subjected to shock pressures 60-100 GPa are treated as "melt"; particles compressed above 100 GPa represent a vapor-melt mixture.  The temperature of all particles is defined by their shock compression and varies from 290 K (cold weakly shocked blocks) to 3300 K (partially vaporized projectile, dunite EOS).  Results: At 50 s after impact all ejecta has arrived at the top of the atmosphere, where it is transformed into particles. The total mass of ejecta is 8.8⋅1016 kg; the vapor fraction is less than 1%. The resulting particle SFD is shown in Fig. 1: large (>1 cm) fragments prevail (80 % by mass), particles smaller than 1 mm make ~8% of the total ejecta mass.  Fig. 1. Size-frequency distribution of ejecta in the atmosphere for various time moments (numbers near the curves). There are no particles smaller than 1 µm or larger than 100 m (-6 and +2 respectively on the horizontal scale).  Large fragments have, on average, lower velocities, do not interact with the atmosphere, and are deposited ballistically within the first 10 minutes. Smaller ejecta  are strongly affected by atmospheric interactions, leading to a substantial "widening" of the ejecta curtain (see plots at 100 - 500 s in Fig. 2). Particles smaller than 1 mm (red color in the Figure) outrun the curtain due to disturbances in the upper atmosphere, and some lag behind the ejecta curtain and become incorporated within the impact plume rising above the crater.  Fig. 2. Comparison of our modeled ejecta curtain (red, cyan and magenta colors) with ejected materials that travel on a purely ballistic path (black dots), at 100, 300, and 500 seconds. The interaction of ejecta with the atmosphere causes ejecta curtain material to become increasingly spread out with increasing time. The atmosphere is highly disturbed, as shown by the variation in blue (a darker shade corresponds to a higher density). The dimension of each snapshot is 2000 km × 700 km. Although some sediments are ejected with extremely high velocities, the basement materials have velocities <3.5 km/s. Thus, our new high-resolution simulations confirm our previous results [13]: molten basement ejecta cannot be transported ballistically farther than ~1300 km from the crater (Fig. 3) whereas solid ejecta (shocked quartz) would be deposited within 400 km distance if it were to travel to its final destination on a ballistic path. Our models demonstrate that ejecta curtain material can travel distances of up to 4000 km, and the thickness of this ejecta in the downrange direction between 2000 and 4000 km (Fig. 3) is comparable to observations for the lower layer in North America.  If correct, this lower layer is formed from a mixture of sediments (unshocked dust) and projectile (spherules).  Five hundred seconds after the impact, the ejecta cloud (red dots in Fig. 2) consists mainly of unshocked sediments and molten projectile droplets. The total volume of projectile-derived spherules < 1 cm in diameter (and beyond the 500 km distance from the crater) is ~800 km3 while the volume of basementderived spherules is order of magnitude smaller. The volume of weakly shocked basement material (potential shocked quartz) is 70 km3 (particles smaller than 100µm comprise ~30% of this volume).  Discussion. Our preliminary results allow us to consider the importance of various input parameters in ejecta models. Firstly, vapor production has a minor effect on the final destination of ejecta because of the negligible fraction of vapor in ejecta. Furthermore, chemical fractionation of partially vaporized ejecta is currently neglected in our models, which means we cannot yet directly compare our results with observational data. Secondly, the precise SFD seems to be of crucial importance as small particles are strongly coupled with the atmosphere. It is these particles that produce "non-ballistic" ejecta (the global layer), including prolonged flight times in the atmosphere of lowvelocity ejecta (e.g., shocked quartz) and separation of ejecta into layers. Moreover, the finest particles (<1 µm) are extremely important for climate effects. Fig. 3.
