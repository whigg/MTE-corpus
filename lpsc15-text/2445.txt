Introduction: Amorphous materials in chondrites can form by different mechanisms including (1) evaporation and condensation [1-2] and (2) by melting to form glasses, which are common in chondrules, as distinct porous microchondrules and irregularly-shaped objects which occur in the matrix and associated with chondrules [3]. These materials are sensitive to postaccretionary processes on the parent body, such as thermal metamorphism, aqueous alteration, brecciation or shock [4-5]. In order to understand the effects of the earliest stages of metamorphism and aqueous alteration of these amorphous materials, we investigated the irregularly-shaped regions of glass that are associated with porous microchondrules in two of the most unequilibrated ordinary chondrites (UOCs), MET 00526 (H) and QUE 97008 (L), both classified as petrologic type 3.05. The observations were performed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). These new data are essential in helping to constrain the complex record of parent body processes that have contributed to the characteristics of matrix. In particular, we focus on the formation of secondary alteration products such as sulfides and ferroan olivines and how different elements may be mobilized and redistributed by aqueous fluids.  Methods: Thin sections of MET 00526 and QUE 97008 were initially studied by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) on a FEI Quanta 3D FEGSEM/FIB operating at 30 kV, using backscattered electron (BSE) imaging. After detailed SEM characterization, quantitative analyses of the amorphous materials were obtained using a JEOL 8200 Superprobe electron microprobe (EMPA), operating at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV and a 20 nA beam current. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) sections of several amorphous materials (four from MET 00526 and three from QUE 97008) were prepared using the focused ion beam (FIB) technique with a FEI Quanta 3D Dualbeam® FIB instrument. Bright and dark-field TEM images and quantitative EDS X-ray analyses were carried out at 200 kV on a JEOL 2010F FEG TEM/Scanning TEM (STEM). Results: Glassy silicate objects were identified in the matrices of UOCs [3]. They appear to be texturally and compositionally related to porous microchondrules (Fig. 1) [3]. These objects have distinct occurrences and textures compared to the fine-grained amorphous materials that were previously described in the matrices of UOCs [6]. The glassy silicate objects appear either as (1) discontinuous chondrule rims varying in width from 200 nm to 20 µm, (2) veins ~10 µm in length and ~250 nm width at the grain boundaries between chondrule phenocrysts, (3) irregular objects, generally xenomorph, with elongate, lobate or teardrop shapes and (4) material that fills out the space between the fine-grained minerals and microchondrules (Fig. 1). Most of these porous materials have the same chemical composition as that measured in the porous microchondrules [3].  Figure 1. Backscattered electron images made by SEM in MET 00526 (a) and QUE97008 (b) showing irregular glassy silicate objects having similar porous texture and compositions reminiscent of porous microchondrules. The red lines indicate the two FIB sections shown in Figure 2b-c. In several regions in both MET 00526 and QUE 97008, the glassy objects show distinct areas with fibrous textures suggestive of alteration, including the presence of layered sulfide-rich minerals. This alteration is heterogeneously developed (lower left Fig. 1b) around the glassy objects. New TEM observations show that the fibrous textures associated with the glassy silicate objects in QUE 97008 are (1) sulfurbearing amorphous material (Fig. 2a) and (2) crystalline Ni-rich sulfides and elongated, ferrous olivines (Fig. 2b-c). Figure 2a shows a sulfur-bearing amorphous material that has a flame-like texture inside a glassy silica-rich object. This material contains ~27% SiO2, sulfur (22 wt% SO3), iron (31 wt% FeO) and minor amount of NiO (3 wt%), Ca (3 wt%) and P2O5 (5 wt%). The adjacent glassy silica-rich material (4.7 x 5.7 µm in size; Fig. 2a, low-Z regions) contains 53 wt% SiO2, 27 wt% FeO, 9 wt% Al2O3, 7 wt% MgO and minor elements such as 2 wt% Na2O, 2 wt% SO3 and 1 wt% CaO.  Two additional FIB sections were made in a second, glassy silica-rich object (Fig. 1b). The FIB section A (Figs. 1b and 2b) is composed of an association of crystalline Ni-rich sulfides (16 wt% Ni) showing a lamellar texture, elongated ferrous olivines (up to 200 nm in length, Fa84), tetrataenite and a glassy silica-rich material (72 wt% SiO2), which contains only FeO (~28 wt%) (Fig. 2b). The euhedral, ferrous olivines are 10 µm 20 µm ba AB  elongated perpendicular to the lamellar texture of the sulfides. The distance between the lamellar sulfides varies from a few nanometers up to 600 nm. However, most of the lamellae are separated by distances of 20 to 50 nm. A glassy, silica-rich material was identified in contact with this association of minerals (red dashed line, Fig. 2b) having the same chemical composition as glass in porous microchondrules and the irregularlyshaped objects. This particular region is surrounded by magnetite. It contains up to 9 wt% Na2O. The largest amount of Na2O was found in the porous, central region of the area (red dashed line, Fig. 2b).   Figure 2. Dark-field STEM images of the FIB sections made in the fibrous textures associated with the glassy objects (e.g. Fig. 1b) from QUE 97008. S = sulfide; tta = tetrataenite; Fa = fayalite; mt = magnetite.   The FIB section B (Figs. 1b SEM and 2c TEM) contain the same association of minerals and texture (crystalline Ni-rich sulfides, tetrataenite and a glassy silica-rich phase, which contains FeO; right side of Fig. 2c). The rest of the FIB section (left side of Fig. 2c) contains randomly oriented, elongated ferroan olivines with a similar porous texture as the one identified in the porous microchondrules and in the irregularlyshaped glassy objects. Discussion: Our previous TEM studies of two glassy objects with textures similar to porous microchondrules in the matrix of MET 00526 show that the glass was replaced by phyllosilicates and elongated, ferroan olivines [Fig. 2, from 7]. In contrast, new observations from QUE 97008 indicate a lack of phyllosilicates and the formation of crystalline Ni-rich sulfide and sulfur-bearing amorphous materials (with ~27 wt% SiO2) (Fig. 2). Figure 2c shows the porous material completely replaced by elongated ferroan olivines that preserved the porous texture of the glassy objects. These new data could help us to address the issues of (1) of how secondary sulfides form and (2) how different elements are mobilized and redistributed by aqueous fluids. Previous studies of CM chondrites have argued that Ni-rich sulfide formed by aqueous alteration of troilite and/or Fe,Ni-metal [8-9]. The intergrowth between the sulfur-bearing amorphous material and the glassy silica-rich material could suggest that in some regions in the matrices of UOCs, secondary sulfides and magnetite could form from glassy materials (e.g. red dashed line, Fig. 2b). As the degree of hydration increases more leaching occurs and the sulfur-bearing amorphous material looses most of the major and minor elements identified in the porous glassy objects (Na, Mg, Al and Ca) and must gain S to form crystalline Nirich sulfides. The ferroan olivines must have formed after the sulfides because the length of the crystals is constrained by the distance between the lamellae of sulfides.  Additional observations are required to indicate if the precursor was indeed the glassy silica-rich materials or a Fe,Ni metal grain that was altered. The lack of the porous texture similar with the one observed in the glassy objects (right side, Fig. 2c) and the association of these minerals with this particular lamellar texture could indicated that the precursor might be Fe,Ni metal and the silica-rich material was introduced in the adjacent region of the glassy silica-rich object.
