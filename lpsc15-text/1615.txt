HOW OLD ARE SMALL LUNAR CRATERS ? - A DEPTH-TO-DIAMETER RATIO BASED ANALYISP. Mahanti1, M.S. Robinson1, R. Stelling1 1Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera, School of Earth and SpaceExploration, Arizona State University, Tempe,AZ,USA; pmahanti@asu.edu;Introduction: In contrast to the larger craters(D > 10km) and basins which shaped the baseline morphology of the Moon, small lunar craters (SLC) continue to form and modify the local topography of theMoon. SLCs form on and around larger craters andbasins, are the most populous impact features on the surface but also the least studied - topographic data wasavailable only for larger craters until recent missions(e.g. Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), Kaguya),carrying high resolution cameras (e.g. Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) [1], Selene Terrain Camera [2]). A clear understanding of degradation rates of SLCs can help ascertain the ages of the youngest craters of the Moon.Analysis of depth (d; rim-to-floor) to diameter (D;rim-to-rim) ratio for lunar craters is a well-establishedmethod for quantifying the morphological state (andthus relative age) of a crater. Following the event ofcrater formation, redistribution of mass both inside andoutside the crater rim by various methods continuouslymodifies the crater depth and diameter. The dD ratio wasused to broadly classify craters (simple and complex)[3, 4, 5] and also to study the evolution of craters [6].In this work, we discuss and model the time-dependantof degradation state of SLCs by analyzing the population density vs dD for selected locations on the Moon.Further, we discuss the relationship of angle of repose(θ)(angle at which granular material begins to move under the influence of gravity)and dD for SLCs.A recent study [7] (20m < D < 200m) shows thatcrater population decrease asymptotically with dD ratioand the probability distribution function (PDF) of dD isa skewed bell-shaped curve (Figure 1). First, since thePDF is bell-shaped, the shape of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) is sigmoidal and can be modeledusing a known function from observed dD values withno assumptions. Second, if the representative craterdataset contains almost all craters within a given range(an exhaustive dataset), then the CDF can lead to an understanding of the degradation rate for SLCs. Smallercraters (D < 200m) form a steady state population suchthat the craters disappear at the same rate as others areformed [8, 9, 10]. By assuming this equilibrium, thechange in the cumulative population of craters can bere-written as [11]−∂(dD)∂t= −R[∂N∂(dD)]−1 (1)Here N is a function of dD and is the number of craterswith dD greater than a given d/D value in the considFigure 1: Number of SLCs (PDF) at different dDexpressedas percentage of total population. Note the skewed bell-shapenature of the distribution. dDbins are equally spaced (binsize= 0.03)ered crater population. R is the crater production rateobtained from previous work (Neukum 2001, Hartmann1999, Marchi 2009). The value of R can be obtainedfrom previous work on crater production rate and wasfound to vary between 10−10 to 10−8 (cumulative number; per square km per year) [12]. Hence, an appropriatemodel for ∂N∂( dD )directly helps in the computation of thedegradation rate (for a particular dD and D), which takesus a step further in ascertaining the freshness of the observed SLC.Methods: Craters are identified manually fromNAC ortho-photo image, the digital elevation modeland a derived slope map. Details for obtaining measurements are same as in [7]. While a dataset obtainedglobally was used for comparison, the three regionsconsidered in this work are Apollo 11, Apollo 16 andApollo 17. Data acquired from these regions (obtaining measurements for all craters with D < 200m)represent a dynamic equilibrium of crater formationand crater degradation procedures. The PDF andCDF were computed from observed dD values. Theclasses A,AB,B,BC and C have the same descriptionfor bowl-shaped craters as found in earlier work [6].Class A represents the freshest, steep sloped (> 35◦)craters, class B are moderately steep sloping craters(15◦ to 25◦) and class C are craters with shallow slopes(< 10◦). The other two classes are intermediate.There is a difference in the definition of N (numberof craters with dD greater than a givendD value) andthe CDF (number of craters with dD less than a given1615.pdf

However, under the assumptions of an exhaustive dataset and expressing N as a fraction, the definition can be inverted via probability to express N interms of the PDF (Figure 1). The PDF and CDF (Figure2) can be obtained directly from observations by binning a range of dD values (a bin size of 0.03 was chosenfor this work).Further, a logistic distribution model waschosen to represent the PDF from which the parametersfor CDF can be obtained. The expression for logisticCDF (F(x); x is dD ) isF (x;µ, s) =11 + e−x−µs(2)The parameters µ and s represent the shape of the CDF.Results and Discussion: The percentage of ClassA SLCs is < 10% (Figure 2) but significantly higherthan 1% as indicated in earlier work [6] due to observeddD (across multiple regions from which SLCs were identified) higher than 0.33. Higher dD values were alsonoted in another recent work [13]. SLCs with dD valuesmore than 0.33 also appear to have higher wall-slopestability from the angle-of-repose point-of-view. ForSLCs the topographic profile is parabolic and the theoretical maximum slope occurs just below the rim. Then,it can be shown that dD and the maximum slope are related as dD ≤ tan θ4 . For stability of the crater shape, θshould be less than or equal to the angle of repose, assuming a gravity regime. For the Moon, θ lies between32◦ to 36◦ [14] for both highland and mare targets derived for larger diameter (20 km) craters. If the samerange is valid for SLCs, then dD varies between 0.14 to0.18 for a stable crater morphology after the crater formation event. As degradation occurs the dD value (aswell as the average wall slope) decreases. However, theCDF obtained for dD for the Apollo 11, 16, 17 shownumber of dD above 0.18 suggesting that higher slopes(> 45) are maintained for a small percentage of SLCs.A dD value of 0.18 was selected in a recent work [11]We interpret that dD > 0.18 is due to material properties where the cohesive strength of regolith and (or)layering of regolith and bedrock maintain a wall slopegreater than the angle of repose (gravity regime). Slopesgreater than angle of repose is possible for more coherent non-granular material. The average time spent atany degradation phase is proportional to the observedpopulation density (Figure 1) if a dynamic equilibriumis assumed in the SLC formation-degradation process.Thus, the dD > 0.18 condition is short lived and soonthe dD value reaches a value(dD)θwhich is (a) same(within a small standard deviation) for a given diameter range of craters and (b) correlates to angle of repose.For example, a SLC may initially possess a dD value of0.3, but the dD ratio is reduced to the 0.14 to 0.18 rangein a short period of time. Following this initial degradation, the dD decreases at a slower pace (inferred fromFigures 1 and 2), over a long period of time,till the SLCis obliterated.The CDF of SLCs was modeled using a logistic distribution function (model fitting R-squared value = 1). Thevalues of µ for highland and mare SLCs were found tobe different with mare values at 0.12 and highland values at 0.14. SLCs from Apollo 16 show µ values sameas that for the highlands. The values of s is approximately 0.04 for both mare and highland SLCs suggesting similarity in the degradation process. From equation1, if R is invariant, then the degradation rate for marecraters is lower compared to highland craters - possibly influenced by the relative depths at which bedrockis present in mare and highlands.References: [1] M.
