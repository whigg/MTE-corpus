Introduction:  The 𝑚𝑚− 𝛿𝛿 and the 𝑚𝑚 − 𝜒𝜒 decomposition methods for compact polarimetric SAR data have been proposed in [1] and [2] respectively. The degree of polarization (𝑚𝑚) and the relative phase (𝛿𝛿) were used to define the 𝑚𝑚− 𝛿𝛿 decomposition. The 𝛿𝛿 parameter works well if the transmitted field is purely circular. In [2] the 𝑚𝑚 − 𝜒𝜒 decomposition for hybrid dual-polarimetric radar data were proposed to analyze the lunar surface. By replacing the relative phase parameter 𝛿𝛿 with the ellipticity 𝜒𝜒 this decomposition was able to resolve certain odd-even bounce scattering ambiguities observed over a lunar crater wall. Unlike 𝛿𝛿 parameter, 𝜒𝜒 is more robust to poor transmission circularity. It is mentioned in [2] that a three-component (𝑚𝑚,𝜒𝜒,𝜓𝜓) decomposition could be more appropriate to infer various scattering mechanisms with a priori knowledge of the ellipticity (𝜒𝜒) of the transmitting polarized EM wave. In this paper, a new compact polarimetric SAR decomposition (𝑆𝑆 − Ω) is proposed. The odd-bounce (and Bragg) and the even-bounce powers (𝑃𝑃𝑠𝑠 and 𝑃𝑃𝑑𝑑) are obtained by multiplying the received power in the opposite sense transmitted and the same sense transmitted with the polarized power fraction (Ω) respectively. The diffused power (𝑃𝑃𝑣𝑣) is obtained by multiplying the total power with the unpolarized power fraction (1 − Ω). The decomposition results are obtained for the CP data simulated from full-polarimetric (FP) data by varying the axial ratio (AR) of the transmitting EM wave. The results obtained from the new decomposition are both qualitatively and quantitatively compared with the 𝑚𝑚− 𝜒𝜒 decomposition.  Methodology:  In the analysis of CP data, the four element real Stokes vector 𝑺𝑺 = [𝑆𝑆0, 𝑆𝑆1, 𝑆𝑆2,𝑆𝑆3]𝑇𝑇 of the scattered wave is of primary interest. The received Stokes vector 𝑆𝑆𝑟𝑟  is related to the incident Stokes vector 𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 by (1), where R is the distance between the target and the receiving antenna, n is the number of looks and 𝑀𝑀𝑘𝑘 is the 𝑘𝑘𝑡𝑡ℎ single-look Mueller matrix.  𝑆𝑆𝑟𝑟 = 1𝑅𝑅2 1𝑛𝑛�(𝑀𝑀𝑘𝑘)𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 𝑛𝑛 𝑘𝑘=1 (1) The total received power (𝑃𝑃𝑅𝑅) for a partially polarized wave (0 ≤ 𝑚𝑚 ≤ 1) can be expressed in terms of the incident and the received Stokes vectors (2).  𝑃𝑃𝑅𝑅 = 𝛼𝛼(𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡)𝑇𝑇𝑆𝑆𝑟𝑟 (2) An average Stokes vector can be decomposed into a sum of a completely polarized wave and a completely unpolarized wave [3]. In equation (3), the first term correspond to the polarized power component (𝑃𝑃𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈) and the second term correspond to the polarized power component (𝑃𝑃𝑈𝑈).

The odd-bounce (and Bragg) power (𝑃𝑃𝑠𝑠:𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵) and the even-bounce powers (𝑃𝑃𝑑𝑑:𝑅𝑅𝐵𝐵𝑅𝑅) are obtained by multiplying the received power in the opposite sense transmitted (𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂 = (𝑆𝑆0 + 𝑆𝑆3)/2) and the same sense transmitted (𝑆𝑆𝑂𝑂 = (𝑆𝑆0 − 𝑆𝑆3)/2) with Ω respectively. The diffused scattering power (𝑃𝑃𝑣𝑣:𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑛𝑛) is obtained by multiplying 𝑆𝑆0 = 𝑆𝑆𝑂𝑂 + 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂 with the unpolarized power fraction (1 − Ω) (5).  � 𝑃𝑃𝑠𝑠 𝑃𝑃𝑑𝑑 𝑃𝑃𝑣𝑣 � = � Ω(𝑆𝑆0 + 𝑆𝑆3)/2 Ω(𝑆𝑆0 − 𝑆𝑆3)/2 𝑆𝑆0(1 − Ω) � (5) Backscatter echo from a circularly polarized wave on the transmission has both the opposite (OC) and the same (SC) sense components. The OC echo has both quasi-specular and diffused mechanisms while the SC echo has both even reflections from the target and diffused mechanisms.          The scattering powers estimated for the two areas for the L-band AIRSAR flevoland data are shown in Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 2(a) to illustrate the proposed methodology. It can be seen that in Fig 1(b) the OC (oddbounce) component is roughly three times larger than the SC (even-bounce) component over a target. It can be also seen in Fig. 1(c) and (d) that the odd-bounce power (𝑃𝑃𝑠𝑠) obtained by the two methods are almost equal for this target. However, the even-bounce power (𝑃𝑃𝑑𝑑) is estimated to be almost zero by the 𝑚𝑚 − 𝜒𝜒 decomposition even though the SC component is not equal to zero (Fig. 1(b)). The contribution of this SC component to the even-bounce power (𝑃𝑃𝑑𝑑) is evident in the 𝑆𝑆 − Ω de composition (Fig. 1(c)) with Ω ≈ 0.65. In another example a target for which the ratio, SC/OC ≈ 1 is considered. In this case the powers estimated by the proposed methodology are approximately equal to that of the 𝑚𝑚 − 𝜒𝜒 decomposition powers as shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d) with Ω ≈ 0.3. This suggests, that the powers estimated by the proposed decomposition are in complete agreement with the 𝑚𝑚 − 𝜒𝜒 decomposition powers only when SC/OC = 1 or either SC/OC << 1 (pure odd-bounce) or SC/OC >> 1 (pure even-bounce).    1(a): (Pauli RGB) 1(b): SC (Red) and OC (Blue)   1(c): 𝑆𝑆 − Ω 1(d): 𝑚𝑚− 𝜒𝜒    2(a): (Pauli RGB) 2(b): SC (Red) and OC (Blue)   2(c): 𝑆𝑆 − Ω 2(d): 𝑚𝑚− 𝜒𝜒 Results and Discussion:   The L-band E-SAR data over the Oberpfaffenhofen test site, Germany is used in this study. A hybrid polarimetric data is simulated from the full-polarimetric data with AR = 0 dB. The even, odd and the diffused powers estimated from the two decompositions are shown in Fig. 3(a) and Fig. 3(b). It can be observed in Fig. 3(c) and Fig. 3(d) that the even and the odd-bounce powers for the 𝑆𝑆 − Ω decomposition are 4% and 5% more than the 𝑚𝑚− 𝜒𝜒 decomposition in the area marked in the figures respectively. Consequently the diffused power estimated by the 𝑆𝑆 − Ω is 9% less than the 𝑚𝑚− 𝜒𝜒 decomposition.    3(a): 𝑚𝑚− 𝜒𝜒 3(b): 𝑆𝑆 − Ω   3(c): Power distributions 3(d): Power distributions  The 𝑚𝑚 − 𝜒𝜒 and the proposed decompositions are also shown for the LRO's Mini-RF data over the Kies C crater (Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 4(b)). The even-bounce signature from the crater floor-wall is evident in both the images showing the red halo in the far range.      4(a): 𝑚𝑚− 𝜒𝜒 4(b): 𝑆𝑆 − Ω The transmitted field of Mini-RF is nominally circular (AR = 2.5 dB [4]). The 𝑆𝑆 − Ω decomposition takes into account this transmitting ellipticity to better discriminate the scattering mechanisms. The diffused scattering by the crater ejecta and the crater floor is also more prominent in the 𝑆𝑆 − Ω decomposition (Fig. 4(b)).   References:  [1] Raney R. (2007) TGRS, 45(11),3397-3404.
