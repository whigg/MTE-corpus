Introduction: In terrestrial glaciated environments, a short period of modification has been identified immediately following a period of deglaciaion which represents the environmental response to ice loss. This paraglacial period is characterized by accelerated sediment transport rates and modification, and ends once these rates return to non-glacial or equilibrium conditions [1-3]. The paraglacial period is distinct from periglacial processes and features which occur in cold, nonglacial environments or at glacial margins. Late Amazonian glacial periods on Mars have been observed, attributed to orbital forcing and obliquity variations [4,5], which are characterized by ice migration from the poles to lower latitudes and back [5-7]. In support of this theory, ice-related features have been documented in the mid-latitudes in the form of concentric crater fill (CCF), lineated valley fill (LVF), lobate debris aprons (LDA), and tropical mountain glaciers [8-10]. As much of Mars experienced periods of glaciation, it is logical to also expect periods of deglaciation. Therefore, it is hypothesized that a martian paraglacial period also exists, representing the transition from a glacial to a post-glacial climate [11,12].  To understand the global effects of glaciation and deglaciation, craters bearing CCF were analyzed across the mid-latitudes for evidence of ice loss and paraglacial features [12]. Understanding the initiation and duration of the martian paraglacial period will aid in the understanding of the Late Amazonian climate variation, as well as climatic patterns of ancient Mars. The Paraglacial Period:  On Earth, a suite of "land systems" has been identified which comprise a range of processes and features typical of the paraglacial period: 1) slope evolution, characterized by sackungen (uphill-facing scarps), 2) sediment modification by fluvial and aeolian activity, characterized by gullies, 3) thermal cycling, characterized by gelifluction/solifluction lobes and polygons, and three additional land systems (alluvial, lacustrine, and coastal systems) which are unlikely to be present on Amazonian Mars [2]. It is the combination of these separate land systems that describes the paraglacial period, as many features typical of this period can form in nonglacial environments; as such, the paraglacial period is viewed as a combination of features and processes representing the broad scale environmental response to deglaciation (Fig. 1) [1,2,13,14]. Jawin et al. [11,12] have described the individual terrestrial land systems and components and their application to the martian paraglacial period, including the morphologic features spatulate depressions, gullies, washboard terrain, and polygons. Martian Paraglacial Period and Climate:  The martian craters analyzed in this study which contain paraglacial features also contain relict glacial features in the form of CCF, which implicates a period of glaciation in the relatively recent history of Amazonian Mars. This glacial ice accumulated through the deposition and eventual mobilization of snow and ice in the Figure 1. Chronology of the terrestrial paraglacial period. (A) Glacier retreat triggers mass wasting and gully incision. (B) Glacier continues to retreat, gullies incise, and glacial forelands are modified. (C) Paraglacial period ends when sediment transport rates return to non-glacial levels and gullies and debris cones are stable, often due to vegetation. Modified from [14].  gully alcoves of these craters [15]. The glacial period is expected to have persisted for up to tens of millions of years, in a period of elevated obliquity where the mean planetary tilt was ~35째 (Fig. 2) [16].  At approximately 5 Ma, the mean obliquity decreases from 35째 for a period of ~2.5 million years, until it reaches a relatively stable minimum mean obliquity of 25째, which has persisted from 2.5 Ma until the present. During the period of decreasing obliquity, the rate of snow and ice deposition would slow and eventually halt. In addition, any exposed snow and ice would sublimate, causing glaciers to retreat. This represents the transition of the environment from a net accumulation to a net ablation period (via sublimation rather than melting). This transition is visible in the form of spatulate depressions inside the martian craters; the location, orientation, and stratigraphic age of these depressions suggests that they formed from the recession and/or sublimation of large lobes of glacial ice originating from the alcoves on crater walls. The shape of the spatulate depressions mirrors the shape of the concentric ridges in the CCF on crater floors, and the depressions are stratigraphically younger than the CCF but older than the paraglacial features. These characteristics suggest the spatulate depressions formed after the ice was deposited on the crater floors, but before the paraglacial features had formed, in a period of decreasing obliquity and net ice loss (Fig. 2). The paraglacial features are stratigraphically younger than the spatulate depressions, and are expected to have formed between 0.5-5 Ma, during the period of decreased mean obliquity (Fig. 2), due to instabilities in the crater caused by the removal of ice from the crater floor and walls [2,12]. Several paraglacial features, namely gullies and washboard terrain, are associated with alcoves which represent the peak accumulation areas in glacial periods. The formation of gullies and washboard terrain is spatially and temporally related, forming throughout the paraglacial period and aided by small amounts of liquid water.  In terrestrial environments, the paraglacial period ends and a post-glacial climate is reached when sediment transport rates reach non-glacial conditions. However, this is an impractical metric on Mars due to the low erosion rates and lack of abundant liquid water in the late Amazonian. However, the formation of gullies and washboard terrain appears to have slowed or halted, and the dominant modification process in the martian mid-latitudes currently appears to be eolian. It may be suggested that the current (~0.5 Ma - presentday) climate on Mars is that of a post-glacial setting. Analyses of craters bearing CCF and associated paraglacial features across the mid-latitudes have shown that paraglacial reworking is seen across the planet in both hemispheres. This widespread distribution suggests that the paraglacial period is a large-scale process that persists for a substantial period of time. References: 1. Church and Ryder, Geol. Soc. Am.

Periods of elevated obliquity (~35째 mean obliquity) represent the glacial periods which led to formation of current remnant glacial features (CCF, LVF, LDA). As mean obliquity decreased, surface ice became unstable and was lost, triggering the paraglacial period ~5 Ma, which persisted through the most recent ice age outlined by [5]. The current climate is expected to be a post-glacial climate, with eolian reworking as the dominant form of modification. Modified from [16].
