Introduction:  Apollo mare and highland soils [e.g. 1-3] as well as basaltic rocks [4] have been wellcharacterized across the visible- to near-infrared (VNIR) wavelengths including the effects of mineralogy, mineral chemistries, ilmenite content and space weathering on their spectra. These laboratory analyses provided ground truth to remote sensing observations from Earth-based telescopic observations and spacecraft observations like  those from Clementine, Galileo, Lunar Prospector, SELENE, and Chandrayaan-1 as well as providing key insights into the composition and evolution of the lunar surface. Recently the thermal infrared (TIR) Diviner Lunar Radiometer was launched onboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), making it necessary to characterize Apollo samples across TIR wavelengths. The near-surface vacuum environment of airless bodies like the Moon creates a thermal gradient in the upper hundred microns of regolith. Lab studies of particulate rocks  and minerals (< 100 Âµm) as well as selected lunar soils under vacuum and lunar-like conditions have identified significant effects of this thermal gradient on thermal infrared TIR spectral measurements [e.g. 5-10]. Such lab studies demonstrate the high sensitivity of TIR emissivity spectra to environmental conditions under which they are measured.   In this work, an initial set of thermal infrared emissivity measurements of the bulk lunar soil samples will be made in the laboratories included in the Thermal Infrared Emission Studies of Lunar Surface Compositions Consortium (TIRES-LSCC): the Asteroid and Lunar Environment Chamber (ALEC) in Reflectance Experiment Laboratory (RELAB) [11] at Brown University, the Simulated Lunar Environment Chamber (SLEC) in the Planetary Spectroscopy Facility at the University of Oxford, the Simulated Airless Body Emission Laboratory (SABEL) at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), and the Planetary and Asteroid Regolith Spectroscopy Environmental chamber (PARSEC) in the Vibrational Spectroscopy Laboratory at Stony Brook University. Cross laboratory measurements of bulk lunar soils will be compared and analyzed to: (1) constrain 'best' measurement practices and (2) understand spectral differences resulting from different laboratory set-ups. Laboratory measurements of bulk lunar soil samples are also compared with Diviner data to understand: (1) how to accurately simulate conditions of the near-surface environment of the Moon in the lab and (2) the difference between returned samples and undisturbed lunar soils in their native setting. Both comparisons are integral for constraining thermally derived compositions and properties of the lunar surface from current (Diviner) and future TIR datasets. Experimental Setups:  While the design and workings of each chamber are slightly different, the chambers are functionally the same. In each chamber, we simulate the lunar environment by: (1) pumping the chambers to vacuum pressures (<10-3 mbar), which is sufficient to simulate lunar heat transport processes within the sample, (2) cooling an environment shield in the chambers with liquid nitrogen to simulate the cold space environment that the Moon radiates into, and (3) heating the samples from below, above, or both to setup thermal gradients similar to those experienced in the upper hundreds of microns of the lunar surface. Samples are heated from below using heaters embedded in the base of each sample cup and from above using solar-like halogen lamps. Radiation emitted from the sample is reflected into a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer by a collecting mirror positioned above the sample. Spectral measurements are collected at a resolution of 2-4 cm-1 over the ~400 - 2400 cm-1 spectral range. Each laboratory and chamber has its own strengths and collaborating amongst multiple laboratories will provide us the unique opportunity to do a rigorous characterization of the lunar samples as well as cross-laboratory calibrations. Results:  To best constrain the regolith properties on the lunar surface and compare laboratory measurements of the same lunar sample, initial measurements were made of bulk lunar soil 15071 in ALEC and SLEC. Lunar-like conditions in ALEC are simulated by heating the sample from below to 405K, the surface of the sample is illuminated by a solar-like halogen lamp that can be varied systematically by controlling the wattage of the lamp, the chamber pressure is held to <10-4 mbar and the chamber is cooled to ~85K. In Figure 1 the variation in solar illumination is expressed as percentages of the full 250 watts of the bulb. In SLEC, the sample is heated from below to 393K, the surface of the sample is illuminated by a solar-like halogen lamp that can be varied systematically by con trolling the wattage of the lamp, the chamber pressure is held to <10-4 mbar and the chamber is cooled <125K. In Figure 1 the variation in solar illumination is expressed as the brightness temperatures approximated from the known radiometric calibration of the system. Full resolution spectral measurements of Apollo 15071 under simulated lunar conditions are shown in Figure 1. In ALEC and SLEC measurements, we observe spectral features like the Christiansen feature (CF, emissivity maximum near 1200 cm-1) and reststrahlen bands (absorption bands between ~800 and 1100 cm-1) at the same frequencies. However slight differences in the spectral contrast and slope are observed between spectra from the two simulated lunar environment chambers. These differences could arise from sample preparation as packing plays an important role in the spectral contrast of the reststrahlen bands [e.g. 13], differences in the thermal environment in the chambers, and/or from the calibration procedures of the two chambers (including the accounting for downwelling radiance). These differences will need to be investigated further in future work.     Figure 1. (Top) Full resolution ALEC spectra of Apollo 15071 measured under varying solar-illumination conditions. (Bottom) Full resolution SLEC spectra of Apollo 15071 measured under varying solar-illumination conditions.  Full resolution laboratory spectra of Apollo 15071 were re-sampled to the three Diviner spectral bands and compared with an average Diviner emissivity spectrum [14] from a 400 m box surrounding the location sample 15071 was collected (sampling station 1) as seen in Figure 2. Re-sampled ALEC and SLEC emissivity spectra are similar to the Diviner emissivity spectrum and fit within two standard deviations of the Diviner measurements (as shown by the y-error bars in Figure 2). Differences between Diviner and lab measured spectra will be investigated further.  Figure 2. (Left) Diviner CF map of the Apollo 15 landing site [14].  Blue/green pixels highlight feldspathic materials with shorter CF positions and red pixels highlight more mafic materials with longer CF positions.  The cyan arrow highlights sampling station 1 where Apollo 15071 was collected.

Discussion:  Future work will focus on the measurement of a suite of Apollo bulk lunar soil samples that encompass a range of compositions and maturities.  In addition, we will further characterize the spectral differences observed in ALEC and SLEC measurements to (1) understand where the differences arise and (2) minimize those differences as much as possible. Samples will also be measured under simulated lunar conditions at APL's SABEL and Stony Brook's PARSEC in an effort to better characterize the near surface environment of the Moon as well as understanding cross laboratory measurement differences.
