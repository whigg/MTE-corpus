ON PREPARATION OF APOLLO-ERA DATA FOR MAGNETIC SOUNDING OF THE LUNAR INTERIOR.  P. J. Chi1, 1UCLA, EPSS and IGPP, 603 Charles Young Drive, 3845 Slichter Hall Los Angeles CA 90095-1567, USA, pchi@igpp.ucla.edu.   Summary:  In the continuing restoration of the Apollo magnetic field records, we initiate new tasks to calibrate and prepare data sets for probing the lunar interior.  Background:  In the last several years, we have successfully restored some of the critical portions of the Apollo magnetic field records, including all of the Subsatellite Biaxial Magnetometer (SBM) data as well as several months of Lunar Surface Magnetometers (LSM) data when both Apollo 15 and Apollo 16 LSM's were operational. Containing simultaneous measurements made by both surface and orbiting instruments, the Apollo magnetic field data provide unique information useful for a rich set of scientific studies of the Moon and for the planning of future lunar missions. Scientific Use of Apollo Magnetic Field Data:  Past analysis of Apollo SBM and LSM data was mostly conducted in the 1970s and the early 1980s, followed by a long hiatus due to the difficulty in using these data stored in obsolete forms. As a result, these data are still under-explored. Recent restoration of a part of the LSM data has already led to the discovery of the ion cyclotron waves that are generated due to the existence of the Moon [1]. One of the main interests in studying the magnetic field data from Apollo and other lunar missions has been the understanding of the lunar interior through magnetic sounding analysis. This topic is relevent to several high-priority objectives identified by the recent NRC report. The data useful for magnetic sounding requires careful cleaning and selection of data [2]. Successful analysis also requires accuracy in both surface and spacecraft measurements. It has been found, however, that some magnetometers on Apollo-era missions suffered from drift in gains or zero levels [3]. Steps to Compile Apollo-era Data for Magnetic Sounding:  A new effort has started to compile the magnetic field data collected by Apollo and Explorer 35 missions for magnetic sounding of the lunar interior. In addition to completing the restoration of Apollo magnetic field data, the tasks will include the selection of data intervals suitable for magnetic sounding, data cleaning, and calibration of data. The power spectral densities derived from these data are also created for future studies using the transfer function approach [4]. These efforts will save time for future magnetic sounding studies using Apollo-era data. The common data set can also facilitate reproducible research as well as the comparison of the results based on different methodologies.  References: [1] Chi P. J. et al. (2013) PSS, 89, 2128.
