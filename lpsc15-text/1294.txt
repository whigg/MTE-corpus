REINTERPRETING THE IMPACT CRATERS OF THE NORTH POLAR LAYERED DEPOSITS, MARS.  M.E. Landis1, S. Byrne1, I.J. Daubar2, K.E. Herkenhoff3, C.M.

However, age estimates for the surface of the NPLD range widely. Herkenhoff and Plaut [1] assigned an age of less than 120kyr based on the lack of any visible craters within Viking images. Tanaka [2] derived an age of 8.7kyr based on two superposed craters. Banks et al. [3] searched Context Camera (CTX) and High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) data and recorded a population of ~100 craters on an area that they determined had recently accumulated. Using the crater production function of Hartmann [4], they inferred that the current craters were an equilibrium population, with crater lifetime proportional to crater size, that likely formed within the last 10-20kyr. In addition to the weak constraints on the age of the whole deposit, there are also open questions about the current mass balance of the NPLD. The stratigraphic   Figure 1.

Models suggest that the NPLD should currently be accumulating at the expense of mid-latitude ground ice [5]. However, sizes of ice grains on the NPLD surface in late summer suggest that old ice is currently being exposed, so there is net annual ablation in progress [6].  This situation cannot have persisted long, as those same data show that the old ice surface has not accumulated any significant amount of dust.  Examining the cratering record will put further constraints on how quickly the NPLD could be currently accumulating or ablating, as well as the minimum age of the deposit. Here, we revisit the NPLD crater population, described in [3], with an important new piece of information. Recently, Daubar et al. [7] have measured the production of small craters on Mars directly, and this new production function yields different conclusions for north polar history.  We have also acquired additional HiRISE images of these craters since the Banks et al. [3] study.  Several craters were originally measured with CTX data alone and now these diameter measurements can be refined.   Figure 2. Differential size-frequency distribution of NPLD crater population is plotted in red.  The Daubar et al. [7] isochrons for 0.5, 1 and 2 Kyr are shown in solid black while the Hartmann [4] isochrons for 5, 10 and 20 Kyr are shown in dashed blue.  Methodology:  Crater diameters were measured using the ArcMap Crater Helper Tools, available from the United States Geological Survey. Where crater clusters were present, the effective diameter was calculated according to the formula (Σ D3)(1/3) [3,7].  Following [3], we took crater counts above a diameter of 44m to be statistically complete.  There are 38 craters fitting this criterion  (e.g. Figure 1), eight of which have since had their diameter measurements refined through HiRISE data acquired since the work of [3]. The updated diameter data was on average 2±5m smaller, which is a <10% difference between updated diameters and the diameters reported in [3]. 1294.pdf

 Figure 3. Depth vs diameter for 9 of the NPLD craters.  Results: Figure 2 shows the differential sizefrequency distribution of the impact craters in this study, plotted in red, against several isochrons based on the production functions given in [4] and [7]. The size-frequency distribution of the impact craters on the NPLD is close to the 1kyr isochron of [7], with a bestfit value of ~1.4kyr.  Error bars follow the methodology of [8], suited for small number statistics. There is also error associated with the production function determination in [7].  Overall, ages determined are accurate within a factor of two for this population. Using scaling laws [10] to attempt to account for the icy target material suggests that the best-fit ages or timescales reported here are upper limits and may be even lower by up to a factor of ~2. Figure 3 shows the depths of craters on the NPLD covered by HiRISE stereo-pairs. The variation of d/D ratio from the pristine 0.2 indicates that these craters are at varying degradation states and most likely formed at different times rather than as one population of secondary craters.  The pristine d/D ratio for fresh NPLD craters is consistent with the pristine d/D ratio for whole Mars [9]. Discussion: The closeness of the data to a model age of ~1.4kyr presents two possible scenarios. First, a resurfacing event ~1.4kyr ago could have reset the surface and all visible craters formed afterwards. Second, this may be an equilibrium population with both small and large craters having the same lifetime (~1.4kyr). For shallower craters to persist as long as deeper ones, the accumulation rate within smaller craters must be lower than within the large craters. These scenarios stand in stark contrast to those of Banks et al. [3], which relied on the isochron system of [4] (Figure 2).  They concluded that these craters were best explained as an equilibrium population where crater lifetime is roughly proportional to diameter. Therefore, infill rates would be roughly the same for large and small craters.  The isochron system of [4] also indicates that the current crater population accumulated over the past 10-15kyr, as small craters have been preferentially infilled. Modeling accumulation rates within craters on the NPLD would distinguish between these scenarios. The choice of crater production function affects the interpretation of the NPLD crater population in a firstorder way. The system of [4] is based on extrapolations from craters whose sizes differ from the NPLD population by at least an order of magnitude, while the system of [7] overlaps with the smallest, non-statistically significant size bins of the NPLD population. The system of [4] is an average over timescales orders of magnitude longer than those relevant to this population, while the system of [7] is a snapshot of crater production over timescales orders of magnitude shorter than those relevant to the NPLD.  The varying preservation of the NPLD craters mean that they are unlikely to be secondary craters from a single impact, and their young age rules out secondaries from several large, distant impacts. They are also isolated, and crater clusters are easily identifiable.  This makes the production functions of [7] more appropriate as it does not include distant secondaries, as the [4] production function does, and calculates the effective diameter of clusters in the same way as we have.  The shallower production function slope of [7] would predict many more craters than [4] when extrapolated to even larger diameters.  At some diameter the observed slope of [7] must steepen to the value reported by [4] to be consistent with populations of craters on older surfaces.  The NPLD record may imply that this rollover diameter is larger than a few hundred meters. We will model ice accumulation rates within these craters to test this interpretation.
