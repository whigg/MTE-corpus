THE ROTATION OF MERCURY AND THE THERMAL REGIM OF CRATER PROKOFIEV. E. A. Feoktistova, Sternberg Astronomical Institute, Moscow State University, Universitetskij pr., 13, Moscow, Russia, Email: katk@sai.msu.ru  Introduction: The surface of Mercury was studied more than once with ground-based radars. The studies performed in 1991--1992 using radio telescopes of the Gold Stone and Arecibo observatories detected the some regions in the polar areas of the planet with unusual radar properties similar to those of the echo coming from icy satellites of Jupiter and from the southern polar cap of Mars [1,2]. It was suggested that areas with unusual properties are clusters of volatile elements in the "cold traps" of the polar regions of the planet. All these areas are crescent-shaped and were identified with impact craters located in the polar areas of Mercury. Date from the MESSENGER spacecraft which entered orbit around Mercury in 2012 confirmed this assumption. The largest crater containing a region with anomalous reflective properties in the area of Mercury's north pole was the crater (86 N, 296,3 W) with diameter 112 km. This crater has recently received the name of Prokofiev. According to MESSENGER, the deposits of water ice are located in the southern part of the crater. Recent studies have reflective properties in the crater of Prokofiev showed that in its southern part is water ice [3]. Specific features of the motion of Mercury. Mercury moves around the Sun in an elongated elliptical orbit (e = 0.206) whose plane is inclined to the plane of the ecliptic at 7.0015°. The heliocentric distance of Mercury varies from 46.08 to 68.86 million km. The orbital period of revolution around the Sun (Mercurial year) is equal to 87.97 terrestrial days. The period of axial rotation of Mercury is equal to 58.6 days, which is 2/3 of the orbital period of its rotation around the Sun. The combined effect of the orbital motion of Mercury around the Sun and its axial rotation is that the duration of a solar day on the planet is equal to three sidereal Mercurial days or two Mercurial years and is equal to about 176 terrestrial days. Because of the elongated shape of Mercury's orbit (a = 0.206), its heliocentric distance varies depending on its position in the orbit. This leads to the fact that in addition to the crater temperature influences latitude and longitude.  In the present study, we investigated the temperature regime of the crater Prokofiev allowing for the motion of Mercury. As the initial position of Mercury, we adopted the position when the subsolar point had a longitude of 180°. Below, we computed the longitude of the subsolar point based on the velocity of the orbital motion of Mercury and the velocity of its axial rotation. In our prvious calculations [4] we modeled the crater accordingly the [5] as truncated cone with diameter 90 km, and averadge depth of 3,7 km. The data from MESSENGER allow as to refine the parameters of the crater. In this paper crater Prokofiev was modeled truncated cone with a diameter of 112 km, with an average depth of 3 km based on altimetry data spacecraft MESSENGER (). Fig. 1 Variation of the angular height of the sun (a) and the flux (b) in the area of the crater Prokofiev during the day.  The diameter of the flat floor was defined as 86 km, and the wall angle was 13°. Each element of the surface of the wall of the crater was defined by two parameters: the angular displacement counted from the point of the south and the height of the element. Elements of the flat floor of the crater were also defined by two parameters: the angular displacement counted from the south point and the distance from the center of the crater. The calculation was performed only for the craters, the surrounding surface was assumed to be flat, since according to the data from MESSENGER its average height does not exceed -2,2 км [6]. The model taken in to account the flux of direct solar radiation on the each illuminated surface element, the internal heat flux, the flux which is reflected from the nearby sunlit elements and the infrared flux from the nearby heated elements at each time. These values depend on the altitude of the sun above the horizon, the slope and orien00,511,522,533,544,50 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22angular height of the Sunhours                             a 01E+092E+093E+094E+095E+096E+097E+098E+099E+091E+100 2 4 6 8 10121416182022Direct solar fluxhours                        b1258.pdf

tation of the surface and the angular height of the horizon. The Mercury's surface was assumed as a Lambert scatterer. [7]. Fig. 2. Diurnal maximum surface temperatures (a) and illumination (b) in the Prokofiev crater  We don't take into account the thermal flux from the adjacent elements of the crater; however, this flux can be ignored because of the low thermal conductivity of regolith on the Mercury. Fig. 1 a and b shows the dependence of the heat flux incident on the area of the crater Prokofiev and height of the sun above the horizon for 1 Mercurian day. Fig. 1 shows that the flux from the Sun initially increases with the height of the sun above the horizon, but because of features of Mercury's motion, the flux from the Sun reaches its maximum value already after the angular height of the sun above the horizon begins to decline. Decrease the angular height of the sun on the of 50% leads to a decrease in the quantity of flow is only 15%. The distribution of the maximum temperature and illumination (in%) in the crater of Prokofiev shown in Fig. 2. As can be seen from the figure, in the southern part of the crater there is a vast area where the temperature during the day does not exceed 100 - 150 K. Thus the conditions in the area are suitable for the existence of water ice, which was recently discovered spacecraft MESSENGER [3]. This area is not located symmetrically about the north-south axis: a large part of the area to the east of this axis. The location of heated areas the same asymmetrically. The most heated areas are located in the northern and north-western part of the crater. This reflects the orbital motion of Mercury and agrees well with the location of area with unusual reflective properties in the crater (Fig. 3).    Fig. 3.
