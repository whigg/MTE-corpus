Introduction:  The coupling between gas and magnetic fields is important in many astrophysical contexts.  Calculating this coupling is critical to assessing whether such phenomena as the magnetorotational instability (MRI) or magnetocentrifugal outflows can act in protoplanetary disks [1-3]. Magnetic fields may also affect the temperature structure [4] and dynamics [5] of exoplanet atmospheres. In both disks [6] and exoplanet atmospheres, “current sheet” or “thermoresistive” instabilities have been identified that rely on the increased dissipation of magnetic energy as the electrical conductivity increases at higher temperatures. In all of these contexts, it is of fundamental importance to determine the ionization state of the gas. In both protoplanetary disks and the atmospheres of hot Jupiters, the ionization state must sometimes be found at high temperatures, ~ 1000 K or more.  In these contexts it has generally been assumed that alkali atoms, especially K atoms, in the gas are ionized according to the Saha chemical equilibrium equation [4,5].  This treatment implicitly assumes that K atoms are in the gas phase and that their ionizations by collisions with molecules are in detailed balance with gasphase recombinations of K+ ions and electrons. These assumptions are valid in most stellar atmospheres, but not in protoplanetary disks, which are cold enough even at 1000 K for solids to condense. Dust grains provide enormous surface area onto which electrons and ions can adsorb.  It is easily shown that recombinations catalyzed by grain surfaces dominate over gasphase recombinations. For this reason alone, use of the traditional Saha equation is not relevant in the presence of dust.  While the Saha equation is not warranted, balancing gas-phase thermal ionizations of alkalis against adsorption of ions and electrons on grain surfaces would yield unexpectedly low levels of ionization, and paradoxically lead to lower ionization at higher temperature. The paradox is resolved by recognizing that the adsorption of eletrons and ions onto grain surfaces have inverse processes not previously recognized in this context: thermionic emission and ion emission. If adsorption and emission are in balance, then the proper equation to use would be the Saha-Langmuir equation, which predicts an increase in ionization at higher temperatures, but involves the work function of the solids rather than the first ionization potential of alkali atoms in the gas. Thermionic Emission:  The rate per area at which electrons are emitted from a heated spherical dust grain of radius a is given by Richardson’s law:  where constants have their usual meanings, λR ≈ 0.5 is a constant, and Weff is the work function W plus Ze2/akT, Ze being the grain charge. The rate at which atoms such as K desorb from grain surfaces is also an exponential function of temperature.  Among desorbed atoms, the ratio of ionized to neutral atoms is given by the Saha-Langmuir equation:  where g+/g0 = 2 for alkalis and IP is the first ionization potential, = 4.34 eV for K. For most astrophysical solids, and for silicate in particular, the work function is W ≈ 5 eV [8]. K atoms usually desorb as K+ ions, unless the dust grain is very negatively charged, in which case they desorb as neutral K atoms.  We have constructed a chemical network that includes electrons (e), atomic ions such as Na+ (i), neutral gas-phase potassium atoms (K0), gas-phase K ions (K+),  K atoms adsorbed onto grain surfaces (Kads), and a monodispersion of dust grains with radius a and charge Ze [8]. We include non-thermal ionizations (e.g., by cosmic rays) of H2 to produce e and i. We include adsorption rates of atoms and ions onto grain surfaces following [9]. We include a desorption rate of adsorbed K atoms with binding energy 3.26 eV so that the half the K atoms are desorbed at T=1006 K, matching the “50% condensation temperature” for K [10]. We include gas-phase thermal ionizations of K0 and recombinations of K+ and e following [11]. Rates of thermionic and ion emission are found as above. We solve for the abundances of each species (and the grain charge) so that all rates are balanced, and charge neutrality is maintained. Results: In Figure 1 we show the abundances of species as a function of temperature for our canonical case with nH2 = 1014 cm-3, dust-to-gas mass ratio 0.01, grain radius a = 1 µm and work function W=5.0 eV. The bold curve is electron fraction xe=ne/nH2. Other curves represent i (dotted), K+ (dashed), K0 (dash-dot) and Kads (dash-dot-dot-dot) abundances.  2311.pdf

Figure 1: Abundances of charged species vs. temperature.  Electron fraction is shown in bold.  Below about 700 K, thermal ionizations have little effect: the ionization state is more or less independent of temperature. Between 700 K and 1000 K the electron fraction shoots up because of thermal ionizations of K0 atoms. For W > 4 eV these results do not depend much on the work function. Adsorption of electrons onto grain surfaces is inhibited by their substantial negative charge. Figure 2 shows the charge Z on dust grains as a function of temperature, for various dust grain work functions. Below 700 K dust grains are charged by adsorption of electrons and ions, and have Z ≈ 0. For T > 800 K, grains with W=5.0 eV are very negatively charged by ion emission (K desorbs as K+), until the effective work function matches the ionization potential of K, i.e., until Z ~ –akT/e2 ~ -103.  Figure 2: dust grain charge Z vs. temperature for various work functions from 2.0 eV (top) to 6.0 eV (bottom).  The canonical W=5.0 eV is in bold.  In Figure 3 we show the timescales required to achieve chemical equilibrium.  This shows that for temperatures above 800 K, thermal ionizations are balanced by adsorption onto grain surfaces.  It also shows that equilibrium takes minutes to days for temperatures 800-900 K where the ionization state is beginning to increase.  Figure 3: timescales for chemical equilibrium vs temperature for the canonical case.   We have conducted a parameter study to understand how these results vary with grain work function, dust-to-gas mass ratio, and gas density.  We find the quantitative details are changed but the qualitative behavior described above persists, if W > 3 to 4 eV.   Implications: We have considered the implications of thermionic emission for the role of magnetic fields in protoplanetary disks and in exoplanet atmospheres [8]. Typically the inner edge of the “dead zone,” where the MRI cannot act at the midplane, is placed where T=1000 K. We find this is largely justified; the exact temperature depends on many parameters but is ≈ 800 K. We have considered implications for the current sheet instability [6].  We find that gas likely cools faster than heating can increase the ionization, and we find little overlap between conditions that yield current sheets (which require high conductivity so magnetic turbulence can tangle the field) and conditions that yield the instability (which requires low conductivity so the field can dissipate rapidly). As for exoplanet atmospheres, hot Jupiters are commonly predicted to contain condensates such as TiO [12]; we suggest these be considered in calculations of the ionization.
