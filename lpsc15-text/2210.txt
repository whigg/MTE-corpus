Introduction:  Transverse Aeolian Ridges (TARs) [1-8] are one of the most common landforms on Mars. As the smallest aeolian landforms observed from orbit, TARs are clearly important for understanding meso- and small-scale interactions between the surface and atmosphere. TARs are also indicative of the weathering and sediment transport regime on Mars and an understanding of their morphologies, morphometries, and composition can provide information on the composition, mobility, and availability of aeolian sediments on Mars. Moreover, the spatial distribution of TARs provides information about where on Mars aeolian sediments are concentrated. If we can determine if TARs were active only in the past, or whether TARs are mobile under today's wind conditions, then we can begin to assess when and where TARs are/were active over Mars' recent geological history. Thus TARs have the potential for being indicators/records of climate change on Mars. Methodology: In this work we focus on the local/regional scale and thus have identified six regional study areas, each 5° by 5°,  to investigate the behavior of TARs in detail: one in the northern hemisphere, three in the equatorial band, and two in the southern hemisphere. These study areas were chosen on the basis of high TAR content and good image coverage, based on results from our previous study [6,7]. All HiRISE, CTX, and MOC images for each study area have been downloaded from the PDS, processed in ISIS, and ingested into an ArcGIS database. By exploring sediment sources and local topography/geology as potential factors, we can constrain potential formation mechanisms and theories (e.g., TARs are akin to terrestrial megaripples [6,7], reversing dunes [9], or indurated dust deposits [10].)  Mapping of surficial deposits: Surficial sediment deposit maps of each study area have been produced to trace sediment from source to sink, and to investigate whether LDDs and TARs share sediment sources and pathways. We have mapped TARs in terms of morphology and morphometry. For each of the study areas, we have mapped the surficial deposits with a focus on sediment pathways, sediment sources, and interactions/associations between TARs and LDDs. We have mapped: 1) TARs (including orientations, 'saturation' - i.e., what percentage of the surface is covered by TARs - and morphological characteristics as described by [6,7], 2) LDDs and dark aeolian deposits, and 3) possible sediment sources (e.g., layered terrains, dissected terrains or mass wasting deposits). These maps are being used to examine sediment transport pathways, constraining sediment sources for TARs [8].  In the southern and northern mid-latitudes, TARs are mostly found near LDDs or dark aeolian deposits, indicating a related source, and nearly all of the deposits are found in local topographic lows, or sediment traps. The equatorial bands are heavily blanketed with TARs and show strong association with layered terrains. Transport pathways appear to be primarily constrained by local topography. Morphologic and morphometric analyses: We seek to determine what factors control the morphology and morphometry of TARs. We are producing Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) from HiRISE stereo pairs for each study area for analysis. We are taking height, width, length, and wavelength measurements for large numbers of TAR bedforms within each DTM to assist in calculating TAR volumes as a function of classification in order to estimate their sediment buget. We are calculating the range of values, mean, and standard deviation for TAR heights, widths, lengths, height/width ratios, wavelength, and ripple index (wavelength/height). Four DTMs have been completed and measurements taken for TARs on two of them. Elevation profiles and wavelengths have been taken for 550 TAR bedforms on the first DTM, on the floor of Proctor crater in Study Area 1. TAR heights range from 0.9 m to 3.3 m. The mean TAR height is 1.90 m with a standard deviation of 0.51 m; the mean width (parallel to inferred transport direction) is 31.15±6.51 m; mean wavelength is 53.02±17.07 m; mean ripple index is 29.75±15.59; and the mean height/width ratio is 0.06±0.04. Lengths (perpendicular to transport direction) and areas were also measured to estimate sediment volume within the DTM and then extrapolated to the entire Proctor crater TAR field. The TAR field has a volume of ~30 km 3.  Measurements from 502 TAR bedforms in the second DTM in Kaiser crater in Study Area 2 have been made. Heights range from 0.06 m to 10.00 meters. The mean height is 1.82±1.51 m; the mean width is 31.27±18.17; mean wavelength is 59.33±40.33 m; mean ripple index is 30.36±59.49; and the mean height/width ratio is 0.05±0.02. Calculated sediment volume for the DTM area is 19.7 km 3. The TARs in this DTM have greater diversity of sizes and wavelengths due to larger topographic variations (e.g.,  the presence of a crater) compared to the Proctor DTM, which is over a topographically flat area. These values are generally consistent with previous, limited calculations [11]. Compositional analyses: Compositional studies are being carried out to: 1) constrain the composition of TAR materials themselves, and 2) compare the composition of TARs to the composition of local LDDs and to local layered terrains (or other terrain units). We are testing the hypothesis that TARs are derived from local sources by comparing the composition of the bedforms to that of the terrain on which they rest. We are searching for evidence of compositional uniqueness within the dunes that could potentially contradict this hypothesis, and possibly be linked to a distal source region.  CRISM and OMEGA analyses of TARs and LDDs quantify the albedo and compositional characteristics of the deposits. TARs are distinctly brighter and are more variable in albedo than LDDs, with the brightest TARs having albedos of ~0.36 (Dawes crater, Study Area 5) and the darkest ~0.13 (Kaiser crater, Study Area 2, and Meridiani, Study Area 3). The brightest LDDs are ~0.22 (Schiaparelli Crater, Study Area 4) and the darkest are ~0.10 (Kaiser Crater).   Spectroscopic data do not show any obvious characteristics of TARs or LDDs that might be associated with formation or preservation processes. The compositions of TARs and LDDs seem to reflect the composition of the local materials (e.g., in most cases, they are spectrally unremarkable, like the local non-eolian surfaces, though in Meridiani, they contain sulfates like the local materials). There is no quantifiable enrichment in olivine or other minerals that might be segregated due to density , and there is no observable difference in plagioclase content that might be related to segregation associated with weathering.  Some of the deposits exhibit strong spectral slopes, which might indicate the presence of grain coatings. Chlorides (a candidate binding agent) also exhibit spectral slopes in CRISM data, but chlorides show a positive spectral slope and these materials have a negative slope. In addition, chlorides only exhibit those features in other deposits [12] because they compose a large fraction of the deposit by volume and in the case of TARs or LDDs, they would only be present in small abundances. Lastly, THEMIS decorrelation stretch images do not show obvious spectral differences among or between deposits, which argues against the presence of chlorides and against fundamentally different mineralogy between TARs or LDDs  and their surrounding terrains. Crater counting and changes in high-resolution images: Craters have been found superposed on TAR fields in the equatorial regions. Crater counts on HiRISE and CTX images show these TARs to be several million years old (Fig. 1). TARs in mid-latitude regions have no superposed craters, and are estimated to be at most 100,000 years. We are exploring how TARs evolve under the current climate regime by using time series of  highresolution images to search for changes in morphology and position of TARs with time. Thus far, no changes have been found, suggesting they are indurated. Conclusions: There are strong correlations between the presence of TARs, LDDs, and layered terrains. Mapping, atmospheric models, and composition analyses show these deposits may share a common source. The variety of potential sources, morphologies, and morphometries suggest multiple formation mechanisms for TARs in different localities. References: [1] Thomas P. (1981) Icarus 48, 7690.
