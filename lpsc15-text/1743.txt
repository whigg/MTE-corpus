Applied Geology, Curtin University.Introduction:  Meteor camera networks have beenused  since  the  late  fifties  to  characterise  meteoroidorbits  and  calculate  meteorite  fall  positions  [1].Previous designs used large format sheet film camerasto capture images of a meteoroid's luminous trajectoryduring  ablation.  Advances  in  digital  imagingtechnology  have  enabled  the  transition  from  largeformat  photographic  film  based  systems  to  systemsbased on digital still cameras like the Desert FireballNetwork (DFN) [2].Previous stills based meteor cameras used rotatingor  oscillating  mechanical   shutters  to  chop  orperiodically  interrupt  the  light  recorded  on  the  filmplane  [3],[4].  This  breaks  the  streak  on  the  longexposure  image  into  short  segments  or  dashes;  thetiming  of  which  is  precisely  known and  allows  thedetermination  of  the  meteor  velocity  aftertriangulation.Exposure times can range from a few seconds toone  night,  so  networks  using  long  exposure  imageswith periodic shutters for  velocity determination stillrequire a method of establishing absolute timing alonga fireball path in order to determine a trajectory. Priordesigns  used  various  approaches  including  acombination  of  fixed  and  guided  cameras  [5] orphotomultiplier tubes to log meteor luminosity [4], [6].Video based systems such as [7],[8],[9] do not requirean additional periodic shutter due to the high rate ofimage capture, nor do they require external hardwareto provide absolute timing, but the resolution of videometeor  cameras  is  poor  compared  to  stills  basedsystems  leading  to  larger  errors  in  fall  positionestimation.This  abstract  presents  a  technique  for  encodingabsolute trajectory timing with relative timing withoutadditional  hardware  using  a  liquid  crystal  shuttermodulated  according  to  a  de  Bruijn  sequence.  Thisallows  the  development  of  high  resolution,  smaller,less  expensive  and  simpler  meteor  cameras  thanpreviously possible.Meteor Velocity: The tight tolerances and bulk  ofmechanical  shutter  assemblies  used  to  interrupt  lighttransmission  for  velocity  determination  significantlyincrease  system  complexity,  size,  cost  andmanufacturing  time.  These  factors  need  to  beminimised whilst maintaining imaging performance inorder to maximise network coverage area to enable theobservation  and  recovery  of  as  many  meteorites  aspossible.The  proliferation  of  consumer  liquid  crystaltechnology in  displays  and  more  recently active  3Ddisplay  shutter  glasses  has  made  inexpensive  liquidcrystal (LC)  shutters readily available. These shuttersprovide a solid-state alternative to mechanical periodicshutters, significantly simplifying the system. They do,however, have limited light transmittance in their openstate, approximately 36% for those in use on the DFN.Testing has shown that the LC shutters are a suitablereplacement  for  mechanical  shutters  as  long  as  thelight  loss  in  open  state  transmittance  is  acceptable.They are a good fit with digital image sensors wherethe  contamination  from  dust  and  dirt  is  of  higherconcern than in film based systems. The LC shutters onDFN cameras operate at a rate of 10 Hz providing 20luminous trajectory data points per second.Absolute  Trajectory  Timing: The  DFN  stationsuse coded operation of the LC shutter to determine theabsolute timing for the start and end of the luminoustrajectory. The time is encoded by modulating the LCshutter according to a de Bruijn sequence or cycle. Ade  Bruijn  sequence  is  the  shortest  cyclic  sequencecontaining  all  possible  subsequence  for  a  givenalphabet  size  and  subsequence  length  making  it  theoptimal  encoding for this sort  of problem  [10].  Forexample,  the de Bruijn sequence generated using theprefer high method for an alphabet size of two and asubsequence length of three is '00011101'. As long asthree consecutive elements in the cyclic sequence areknown, it is possible to determine exactly where in thesequence the subsequence of three elements is. The LCshutter runs according to a de Bruijn sequence at a rateof ten elements per second throughout the 25 secondexposure.  Currently,  the  sequence  parameters  are  10elements per second, a subsequence length of nine andan  alphabet  size  of  two,  but  this  can  be  modifiedremotely  for  the  network  connected  systems.  Thesequence  is  long  enough  that  it  doesn't  repeat  itselfduring the 25 second exposure. At least nine elementsor  dashes  must  be  visible  in  the  fireball's  luminoustrajectory  for  the  start  time  of  the  trajectory  to  bedetermined.  In  practice,  it  is  preferred to  have  moreelements  visible  to  validate  the  position  in  thesequence. Validated timing is available for all meteorsclearly visible for one second or longer.Sequence  Encoding: The  de  Bruijn  sequence  isencoded  using  pulse  width  or  dash  length.  A '1'  isrepresented by leaving the shutter open longer whichresults  in  a  longer  dash  and  a  '0'  corresponds  to  a1743.pdf

shorter open time and therefore a shorter dash in theimage.The  advantage  of  this  approach  compared  toprevious techniques is that the absolute trajectory andrelative timing data are collected together on the samesensor  without  any  additional  hardware.  The  LCshutter is required to chop the meteor trail for velocitydata; modulating it according to a de Bruijn sequenceprovides  the  absolute  timing  without  requiring  theintegration,  synchronisation  and  calibration  ofadditional  sensor  subsystems.  This  simplificationallows the production of much smaller, lighter, lowerpower  and  more  economical  meteor  cameras  thanpreviously possible.Timing  precision:  A  microcontroller  ensures  theexposure start time and the LC shutter waveforms aresynchronised  with  UTC  via  a  GPS  module.  Thismodule  is  accurate  to  within  a  few  tens  ofnanoseconds. The shutter opens regularly every 0.1 sand closes either 0.02 s later for a short '0' dash or 0.06s later for a long '1' dash. This system therefore enablessub-millisecond,  absolute  timing  resolution  duringfireball  entry.  This  level  of  precision  allows reliablevelocities  to  be  calculated.  The  deceleration  of  ameteoroid is essential for determining its mass duringbright  flight  with  such  a  simple  system,  andsubsequently  any  potential  fall  locations.  Althoughonly  relative  timing  is  required  for  meteorite  fallpredictions,  the  absolute  start  time  of  the  luminoustrajectory is required for accurate determination of preatmospheric  entry due  to  the  spin  of  the  Earth.  Thesub-millisecond precision offered by the DFN camerasis  well  in  excess  of  the requirements  for  calculatingmeaningful orbits.Example meteor: A meteor was captured over SouthAustralia  by  three  DFN  camera  systems  on  26September 2014 at  16:42:2.80 UTC. Figure 1 showsthe  dashes  in  the  fireball  trail  from  the  de  Brujinshutter sequence. Decoded timings are from the start ofthe exposure and some examples are given in the inset.The beginning of the de Bruijn sequence used is shownat the bottom, with the inset section highlighted. Thealtitude and azimuth of the start and end points of thefireball dashes are determined on each of the imagesand after calibration, triangulation software determinestheir  absolute  latitude,  longitude  and  height.  Thisfireball entered the atmosphere at 135.620° E, 28.529°S, with a height of 75.93 ± 0.15 km. Its entry velocitywas 16.6 ± 1.3 km/s  and its very shallow angle (~9°from  the  horizontal)  meant  that  although  the  totalduration was 6.68 s, it only penetrated 15.4 km into theatmosphere, ending with a velocity of 15.2 ± 1.3 km/s.At the end of  the fireball's  bright  flight  (135.51° E,27.77° S) the angle to the horizontal had reduced to~7°.  Orbital  parameters  were  also  obtained  for  thisevent using the absolute entry time decoded from thesequence.Summary: The combination of a liquid crystal shuttermodulated by a de Bruijn sequence and synchronisedvia GPS makes it possible to record absolute trajectorytiming  data  within  a  long  exposure  image  withoutadditional hardware. This enabled the development ofa  smaller,  simpler  and  more  economical  meteorobservatories  than  previously  possible.  Theimplementation  allows  the  calculation  of  fireballtrajectories with very precise timing data coupled withthe  high  spatial  resolution  of  36  megapixel  imagesensors.  The  low  per  system  cost  and  ease  ofmanufacture of the automated observatories has drivenrapid growth of the DFN to 30  stations covering ~1.5million km2. We are currently developing a simple 'kit'system,  based  on  this  technology,  that  will  allowcolleagues  and  interested  amateurs  to  make  highresolution  fireball  observations  at  low  cost,  seehttp://www.fireballsinthesky.com.au for details.References: [1] Ceplecha, Z.
