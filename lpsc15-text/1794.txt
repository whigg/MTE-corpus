Mars’ Heterogeneous South Polar Magnetic Field Revealed using AltitudeVector Slepian Functions. Alain Plattner1, Frederik J. Simons21 (aplattner@csufresno.edu) Department of Earth and Environmental Science, California State University,Fresno, CA, USA2 (fjsimons@princeton.edu) Department of Geosciences, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USAIntroductionThe Mars Global Surveyor satellite mission (1997–2006)provided us with the first ever global coverage of magnetic measurements for Mars. Due to the absence of acore field, the magnetic measurements on the day sidehave a larger noise component than nighttime measurements. Generally, the lower the measurement altitude,the less signal attenuation, in particular for relativelysmall scale magnetic features.In its orbit insertion, Mars Global Surveyor flewthrough the Martian atmosphere at altitudes down to approximately 100 km above the planet’s surface. Figure 1shows the location of the low altitude (below 200 kmabove mean volumetric radius 3390 km) nighttime dataplotted over the Martian topography provided by [1].In our contribution we present a model for the Martian crustal magnetic field around the South Pole calculated locally from these highest-quality data. Our approach allows us to reliably resolve finer details thanwould be possible by diluting the highest-quality datawith lower-quality data covering the entire planet.Figure 1: Location of low altitude (less than 200 kmabove mean volumetric radius) nighttime data from MarsGlobal Surveyor satellite mission.Altitude vector Slepian functionsClassical downward continuation of satellite magneticfield data employs spherical-harmonics, which by theirvery nature are global functions and therefore not wellsuited for processing our local data.Here we propose to fit and downward-continue thehighest-quality data with our newly designed “altitudevector Slepian functions”. These functions, a localized alternative to vector spherical harmonics, are an enhanced version of the vector Slepian functions presentedby [2, 3]. Instead of solving a bandlimited concentration problem, we minimize the misfit between a bandlimited upward-continued (to the average satellite altitude)vector function, and a generic data function at satellitealtitude within a chosen region. The principal components of this optimization problem are the altitude vectorSlepian functions. The generic data function only appears in the problem formulation but does not enter theconstruction of the altitude vector Slepian functions.The first few altitude vector Slepian functions have alow noise sensitivity under downward continuation whilethe subsequent altitude vector Slepian functions are increasingly sensitive to noise under downward continuation but also allow to resolve finer detail. The noise sensitivity versus resolving power of the investigation canbe controlled by the number of altitude vector Slepianfunctions we use to fit and downward-continue the field.Regional and subregional magnetic field modelingFigure 2 shows the radial component of our resultingmodel obtained by fitting the 620 best altitude vector Slepian functions constructed for the annulus between latitudes−76◦ and−87◦ and maximum sphericalharmonic degree L = 130. We dub this crustal magneticfield model SP130. The field’s intensity and structurevary strongly over the region.Along the antimeridian, the field shows a series ofparallel stripes that abruptly end at around longitude150◦ at the rim of the Prometheus crater. Between longitudes −120◦ and −60◦, we observe parallel stripes thatseem to be a continuation of the parallel stripes aroundthe antimeridian. From this investigation alone it is unclear if these lines are real or artifacts. Close to the Australe Montes topographical feature at latitude−80.2◦ andlongitude 14◦ we see a feature with a dipolar shape.In order to investigate the observed features independently of the strong field heterogeneity surroundingthem, we selected 5 subregions within the South Polarannulus that are indicated in Figure 3 by the large graycircles. For each of these subregions we solve for thecrustal magnetic field from low-altitude nighttime data1794.pdf

They do, however, expose the stripesbetween longitudes −120◦ and −60◦ as artifacts. Detailed model and data analysis shows that this is due tofitting strong fields adjacent to weak fields.The strong magnetic features close to the antimeridian abruptly diminish at the crater rim of the Prometheusbasin. We interpret this as a sign of impact demagnetization. Even though the feature strength downwardcontinued onto the geoid is very high (in this model up to63000 nT), the resulting magnetization estimation undera model of homogeneous magnetization results in magnetization values lower than previously estimated maximum values [e.g. 4]. This is not surprising consideringthat a crude estimation for the demagnetization depth bythe impactor of between 0.04 and 0.15 times the craterdiameter [4] is below the estimated Curie depth on Marsfor both magnetite and hematite [4].Figure 3: Radial component of the subregional altitudevector-Slepian solutions (inside the circles) plotted overthe regional solution SP130 downward-continued ontothe polar radius 3376 km, plotted over topography.ConclusionsWe present a high-resolution model of the Martian SouthPolar magnetic field. Our technique takes advantage oflocally available high-quality data and bypasses the needfor global inversions based on average-quality data.AcknowledgementsThis work is supported by NASA grant 13-MDAP130008 to FJS and AP.References[1] D.
