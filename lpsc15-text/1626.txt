Combe2, 1Arkansas Center for Space and Planetary Science, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR, 72701 (sxs099@uark.edu), 2Bear Fight Institute, Winthrop, WA  Introduction:   Since the arrival of the Cassini-Huygens mission into the Saturn system in 2004, strong indicators of the presence of liquid bodies have been found on Titan's surface near the poles [1][2][3]. Titan possesses a thick atmosphere that is mainly composed of N2 and CH4.  It also experiences an active methane cycle, in many ways similar to the water cycle on Earth [3][4]. Large reservoirs of liquid have been identified, and the observed lake morphologies in Cassini's data, by comparison with similar terrestrial landforms encountered in semiarid regions suggesting that the lakes lie in a depression formed by dissolution of a surface soluble porous layer [5].  The photochemical model of [6] argues that lake composition is dominated by ethane (C2H6)(more than 70%), propane (C3H8)(7-10%), and methane (CH4)(510%) in which some solid compounds can be dissolved if thermodynamic equilibrium between the lake and the atmosphere is assumed. Some of these main solutes are acetylene (C2H2) and ethylene (C2H4). Photochemical and thermodynamic models [6][7], as well as the potential detection of hydrocarbon compounds on Titan's surface [8], provide evidence about the potential solutes existing in Titan's lakes.  Using these studies, we aim at realizing experiments to constrain and to determine the solubility of solid C2H2 and C2H4 by simulating Titan's surface with a liquid enriched with a soluble organic compound in CH4 and C2H6. We also determined if the soluble compounds can be detected by conventional FTIR reflectance spectroscopy methods (Cassini VIMS).   Methods: The facility used for the experiments is specifically designed for simulating Titan surface conditions [9]. Pressure of 1.5 bar is maintained with N2 gas and temperature of 90 to 94 K is maintained with liquid nitrogen. Organics compounds are condensed from gas phase in the condenser, and then washed with liquid hydrocarbons (CH4 or C2H6) for approximately 5-10 minutes before being collected in a Petri dish. The Titan chamber is also connected to a Nicolet 6700 FTIR that acquires in situ IR spectra of the sample (range of 1 to 2.5 µm) via fiber optic. The sample mass is also continuously recorded to measure potential liquid mixture and evaporation processes [9]   Results: First of all, we determined whether if C2H2 and C2H4 have any spectral difference in different phases. To identify these compounds in Cassini VIMS data it is important to know the spectral properties in both the liquid and solid phase. These compounds could be present under their liquid phase as dissolved solids in Titan lakes and in solid phase on the surface of Titan. We determined that one factor that changes in both C2H2 and C2H4 is reflectivity (Fig. 1). A reflectivity ratio (Rsolid/Rliquid) of 1.13 for C2H2 and 1.50 for C2H4 was calculated. The ratio could potentially explain why Titan's lakes, supposed to bear dissolved materials such as C2H2 and C2H4 remain dark at all wavelengths while the evaporite-like deposits appear bright at all wavelengths.    Figure 1: NIR spectra of C2H2and C2H4 in liquid and solid phase under Titan simulated surface conditions.  For the solubility of C2H2, our results show that NIR signature of dissolved C2H2 has partially disappeared except for the absorption band at 1.55 µm and a negative slope at 2.0 µm (Fig. 2A). The C2H2 bands are barely visible in the CH4 mixture; which can be related to the amount of C2H2 present in liquid CH4. The spectral features of C2H2 lie within the two largest VIMS atmospheric windows centered at 1.59 and 2.0 µm and can be potentially detected by VIMS (Fig. 2A). The solubility calculations show that the amount molar ratio of C2H2 dissolved in CH4 is 4.9 x 10-2.  In a similar type of experiment with the same amount of C2H2 in 10g of C2H6, different results are shown. Figure 2B shows the dissolution of C2H2 in liquid C2H6. Comparing C2H2 dissolution in CH4, the solubility of C2H2 in C2H6 is significantly larger. The calculated solubility for C2H2 molar ratio in C2H6 is 20.2 x 10-2.

show several different absorption bands with higher band depth values than C2H2 and CH4 mixture spectra. The NIR signature of C2H2 in C2H6 is easily differentiable and can be identified in 1.55 µm Cassini VIMS atmospheric window.  For C2H4 we performed similar dissolution experiments. Figure 2 C&D shows the NIR spectra of a mixture of C2H4 dissolved in CH4 and C2H6. From the band depth calculations, it appears that C2H4 is equally soluble in both CH4 and C2H6. We were able to resolve all the absorption bands of C2H4 in the mixture. C2H4 produces numerous absorption bands over the same region as CH4 and C2H6. The C2H4 absorption bands covered a number of CH4 and C2H6 absorption features. Provided the same time for C2H4 to dissolve in CH4 and C2H6, the mixture seems to have an equal quantity of C2H4 present, indicating the similar solubility or within the same order of magnitude. The exact number for the solubility of C2H4 in CH4 and C2H6 are being calculated using the spectral un-mixing model.   Conclusions: We have successfully conducted several different experiments of C2H2 and C2H4 in liquid hydrocarbons under simulated Titan surface conditions. Our solubility spectra show that C2H2 is far more soluble in liquid C2H6 than in liquid CH4. However, C2H4 seems to be equally soluble in both liquid CH4 and C2H6. The exact number for C2H4 is being calculated using the spectral un-mixing model. This un-mixing model will provide the exact molar ratio of solute and solvent present in the mixture. The spectral features seen at 1.59 µm and 2.0 µm region lie within two of the VIMS atmospheric windows. Therefore, the absorption features seen in laboratory spectra are large enough to be potentially detected in VIMS data. The FTIR measurements used during these experiments will allow us to observe potential evaporite deposits of C2H2 and C2H4.
