Introduction: Debris-covered glacier (DCG) complexes are known to be abundant in the northern and southern mid-latitudes of Mars, where they are often found as coalescing lobes surrounding high mesas and massifs. Many of these lobate DCGs exhibit basal reflectors in MRO Shallow Radar (SHARAD) sounding data, consistent with a composition of nearly pure water ice under a debris cover no thicker than 10 m [1,2]. Climate modeling supports the hypothesis that these features are the remnants of past high obliquity-induced glaciation in the mid latitudes of Mars [3]. In addition, ice flow models developed for the physical conditions relevant to lobate DCGs on the Martian surface have been able to replicate their observed topography [4,5]. Study Region: DCG complexes in the northern mid-latitude region of Deuteronilus/Protonilus Mensae (DPM) exhibit varied properties in SHARAD sounding data. DCGs in western DPM generally exhibit clear, low angle basal reflectors, while basal reflectors are weak or non-existent for DCGs in eastern DPM (see fig. 1). While similar gross morphology is observed for all DCGs in DPM (convex-up topographic profile, evidence for viscous flow), subtle differences in topography and surface morphology may record differing histories of ice flow/loss and debris-layer modification. These differences are explored using flow modeling and geomorphic characterization. Figure 1: MOLA-derived map of Deuteronilus/ Protonilus Mensae with confirmed detections and non-detections of DCG basal reflectors mapped. Selected DCG are highlighted in green boxes. Flow Modeling Methods: The Parsons flow model [4] was developed specifically for the applied stress and temperatures relevant to ice in Martian DCGs. The model is set up for a given DCG lobe by defining an ice flow catchment and a flow-parallel topographic profile from HRSC data to calculate total ice volume as well as the accumulation zone (parent scarp) slope. Ice is then precipitated onto the parent scarp and allowed to flow until it best matches the observed topography. The model is most sensitive to selection of ice grain size, temperature, and assumed basal geometry. The model thus places first-order constraints on basal slope where unobserved by SHARAD, as well as providing some insight into the emplacement conditions and glacial history of the region. The model is applied to three distinct lobes on each of two DCG complexes in western and eastern DPM. Results are compared between the DCG complexes as well as between lobes with different aspects. Geomorphology Methods: Surface geomorphology is mapped at the tens to hundred meter scale using available HiRISE imagery over the DCG complexes. Surfaces are characterized into 8 different categories based upon general appearance, surface roughness, and hypothesized formation mechanism. These broadly include brain terrain, ribbed terrain, dunes, mantle polygons, deflated and unmodified debris cover. Statistics on surface morphologies are compared between surfaces with differing aspects as well as between western and eastern DPM surfaces. Of great importance is the distribution of surfaces with high roughness at the 20m scale, which is relevant to surficial scattering of the SHARAD signal and thus reduced penetration of the subsurface. Results: Results indicate differing histories of both ice flow and debris-layer modification between the sites in western and eastern DPM. The western DCG is either more ancient or exhibits a larger ice grain size (rheology) than the eastern DCG by a factor of up to 2-3 (as shown in fig. 2(D,H)). The ice grain size is limited by boundary-pinning due to dust content, and thus is indicative of accumulation conditions. These DCG were therefore either emplaced in altogether different episodes of glaciation or represent differing local conditions during the same glacial period. The western DCG exhibits much thicker and more widespread latitude-dependent mantle deposits than the eastern DCG. This serves to bury and soften the surface expression of high roughness debris surfaces such as brain terrain, perhaps allowing for improved subsurface penetration with SHARAD.
