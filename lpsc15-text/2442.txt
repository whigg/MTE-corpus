LARGE (>1 KM) RAYED CRATERS IN HESPERIA PLANUM, MARS: WHAT’S THE EJECTA TRYING TO SAY?  Tracy K.P. Gregg1, 1Dept. of Geology, 411 Cooke Hall, University at Buffalo, Buffalo NY 14260 (tgregg@buffalo.edu).   Introduction:  Rayed impact craters on Mars are defined by the following characteristics [1, 2]:  radial to subradial “filamentous elements” with clear separation and constrast with the underlying surface in visible or thermal emission imagery that extend ≥ 25 crater radii (and commonly >100 crater radii [2]) and diameters > 1 km.  Tornabene and others [2] conducted a global search for martian rayed craters located between 45°N and 45°S with diameters of 2 – 10 km, and discovered 4 “definite” along with 3 “probable” rayed craters.  Subsequently, Schon and others [3] identified a Gasa crater, 7-km-diameter rayed crater in eastern Promethei Terra, as a rayed crater. Rayed craters are interpreted to represent the youngest large, primary impacts on Mars [1 – 4] and so their identification has important implications for crater retention ages, as well as weathering processes and target material properties [e.g., Schultz and Singer, 1980]. Tornabene and others [2] suggested that martian rayed craters are confined to young lava plains (such as surround Cerberus Fossae), possibly because crater rays are likely ephemeral features, and because rays are most easily identified where their albedo and thermal inertia values differ from those of the underlying terrain.  A preliminary search for rayed impact craters meeting the above criteria was conducted specifically within Hesperia Planum, because Hesperia Planum has been interpreted to be composed of layered lava flows that were emplaced at the base of the Early Hesperian Epoch [5,6].  Identification of rayed craters within Hesperia Planum may help to constrain the rate at which crater rays weather away on Mars. Approach:  Using the JMars package [7] developed at ASU (see jmars.asu.edu), I relied primarily on the nighttime global mosaic of Thermal Emission Imaging Spectrometer (THEMIS) [8] data to identify impact craters with rays that appeared to extend several crater radii away from the impact.  Where relationships were difficult to discern within the nighttime THEMIS infrared (nTIR) images, Context Camera (CTX) [9] images were used to confirm or deny the presence of rays, exhibited as concentrations of secondary craters [2,4].  Using the JMars “measure” tool, crater diameter was measured, and a distance equivalent to 25 crater radii was calculated for each possible rayed crater.  Again using the JMars measure tool, crater rays were measured to determine if they extended at least 25 crater radii. A dimensionless parameter, Rr, was calculated to determine whether impact crater rays were sufficiently long to allow the crater to be classified as “rayed,” given by the ratio of 25 * (measured crater radius) / (maximum measured crater ray length).  Thus, if Rr ≥ 1.0, the crater is considered to be “rayed.” Note was made of whether the impact craters displayed lobate ejecta blankets in addition to rays (Figure 1).  Furthermore, it was noted whether the lobate ejecta blankets and the crater rays were arranged symmetrically around the impact crater.  Rays are more easily identified using nTIR images whereas lobate ejecta blankets are more clearly observed using daytime THEMIS images (dTIR) Preliminary Results:  Two impact craters within Hespera Planum have Rr > 1.0:  Resen and Pál (Table 1).  A total of 18 impact craters  displaying rayed morphologies were identified.  Of these, 11 displayed either asymmetric lobate ejecta or a “forbidden zone” [2] where crater rays are not observed, indicative of oblique impacts.  The smallest 2 impact craters did not display lobate ejecta blankets. Discussion:  The advantage of examining craters within Hesperia Planum is that the target material is likely lyered mafic lava flows throughout [6].  Thus, variations in impact crater ray morphology (specifically, variations in Rr) within Hesperia Planum probably reflect crater age, with older impacts having smaller Rr values.  This hypothesis can be tested by counting the size-frequency distribution of small (100’s of meters) impacts superposed on the lobate ejecta of the craters discussed here. The majority of rayed craters within Hesperia Planum have asymmetric ejecta or ray patterns, indicating oblique impacts, similar to the results presented by Tornabene and others [2].  More detailed examination is required to determine if the less-obviously rayed craters were also produced by oblique impacts. References: [1] McEwen, A.S. et al. (2005) Icarus, 176, 3351-381.
