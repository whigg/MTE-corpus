In the context of planetary accretion, for example, the most basic question to answer is whether a collision leads to net accretion or net erosion of the colliding system. The mass of the largest postcollision gravitationally bound fragment, 𝑀lr, is for this reason the focus of attention.  In this work we apply a similar formalism as in [4] to collision outcomes from a set of consistent SPH simulations. With an eye towards applications in early planet and satellite formation [1], [3] we focus on icy bodies with radii between 100 and 3000 km. We provide a scaling law that interpolates, rather than extrapolates in this size regime and is able to better reproduce simulated results. Overview:  To determine 𝑀lr for a particular collision requires numerical integration of, at least, the hydrodynamic equations for the colliding material. For bodies smaller than ~10 km radius elastic strength and the details of mechanical fracturing are important and must be simulated as well, while for larger targets gravity is the dominant force and the trajectories of post-collision fragments must be integrated long enough to allow for gravitational re-accumulation. As this requires significant computational effort, it is important to find efficient ways to extrapolate from the results of specific numerical simulations to collisions that are nearby in parameter space. A collision scenario is completely identified by the target and projectile radii, R and r, the target and projectile masses, mt and mp, and the impact speed Vi and impact parameter b. A useful approach has been to focus on the kinetic energy of impact normalized by the target mass or total colliding mass. Many studies have shown that 𝑀lr is simply related to this specific energy, 𝑄, when normalized by a critical value 𝑄D ∗  that depends on the target, and have suggested scaling laws to predict 𝑄D ∗  for targets of various sizes and compositions [3], [5]-[10]. Recently in [4] Leinhardt and Stewart attempted to synthesize results from a large number of studies by converting critical disruption values obtained with different impact angles, impact speeds, and projectile-totarget mass ratios into equivalent values for head-on impacts between similar sized bodies, characterized by the total mass and material alone. The advantage of this approach is that data from many previous studies can be used to construct best-fit curves for this type of collision. The authors call these principal disruption curves, and use them to predict the critical disruption energy for an arbitrary collision. But as different studies typically use different computer codes with different setup and post-processing requirements the data is inevitably more scattered, and the best-fit curves derived from the global data set are not necessarily the ones that best reproduce the results in any subset of available data. For instance, we find that the principal disruption curves of [4] typically overestimate the energy required to disrupt icy targets with 𝑅 > 500 km by a factor of 5 or more [3]. Method:  We simulate impacts into hydrostatic ice targets using the SPH-based hydro-code SPHERAL [11], [12]. For each target we use several mass ratios of projectiles and vary the impact speed to find the critical value 𝑉∗ for which 𝑀lr is half the total colliding mass, 𝑀tot. We determine 𝑀lr by applying an iterative energy balance algorithm [5]. We then interpolate between the runs with 𝑀lr/𝑀tot values nearest to 0.5 to determine 𝑉∗. To construct the principal disruption curves (PDC) we follow a procedure similar to that in [4] (modified only in the treatment of oblique impacts). The formalism calls for using the variable  𝑄R = 12 𝑚𝑡𝑚𝑝 (𝑚𝑡 + 𝑚𝑝) 2 𝑉𝑖 2 (1) to describe the collision. The ratio 𝑚𝑝/𝑚𝑝 is denoted by γ and the critical value of 𝑄R that corresponds to 𝑉𝑖 = 𝑉 ∗ is denoted 𝑄RD ∗ . Values of 𝑄RD ∗  obtained for different values of γ need to be converted to the equivalent energy for a collision of equal mass bodies. The scaling suggested in [4],  𝑄RD ∗ ∝ 𝑅c1 3μ̅ 𝑉∗ (2−3,𝑢) (2) uses the variable Rc1, the radius of a sphere of density 𝜌1 = 1000 kg m −3 containing the total colliding mass, and �̅� the coupling parameter introduced in [13]. Taken together eqs. (1) and (2) imply (sec. 3 of [4]), first, that for a fixed mass ratio 𝑄RD ∗ ∝ 𝑅c1 2  and, second, that the critical energy for any value of γ is related to the critical energy at 𝛾 = 1 by  𝑄RD ∗ = 𝑄RD,𝛾=1 ∗ ( 14 (𝛾+1)2 𝛾 )( 23�̅� −1) . (3)    Therefore, when plotted against Rc1 on a log scale the equivalent equal-mass disruption energies should fall on the same line of slope 2. We use this fact to find a best-fit value of �̅�. Then, as 𝑄RD,𝛾=1 ∗ ∝ 𝑅c1 2  and is close in value to the gravitational binding energy, we try to fit  𝑄RD,𝛾=1 ∗ = 𝑐∗ 45 𝜋𝜌1𝐺𝑅c1 2 . (4) With the parameters 𝑐∗ and  �̅� we can then predict 𝑄RD ∗  and therefore 𝑀lr for a collision with any initial conditions. Preliminary results:  In figure 1 we show the results of simulations completed to date. The 𝑀lr/𝑀tot values of several runs were used to derive a 𝑄RD ∗  value for two projectile-to-target mass ratios. Three more values are taken from [5] where smaller targets were used in simulations using a similar SPH code. In Fig. 1A the critical disruption energy is plotted against Rc1, and in Fig. 1B the equivalent values for equal-mass collision are plotted, using �̅� = 0.4. Data from the same set of simulations always fall on a line of slope 2 when converted to equal-mass disruption energies. But the two subsets fall on lines that are separated by a constant offset. This may indicate a non-physical dissipation mechanism in one or both of the codes. For this reason, the best-fit principal disruption curve, with 𝑐∗ = 1.3, is not a very good fit for either of the subsets individually. For comparison we also plot in Fig. 1B the same data converted to equal-mass disruption energies using the value �̅� = 0.35 recommended in [4], and the corresponding principal disruption curve with 𝑐∗ = 1.9. As these values were designed to fit even more data from other sources, they result in an even worse fit for each subset of data. It is worth noting that the uncorrected values in Fig. 1A still follow a power-law very closely, albeit one with a shallower slope. This is the equivalent of assuming �̅� = 2/3 or pure energy scaling. This is also consistent with the findings in [5] and taken together with the output from our simulations suggests that the critical disruption energy scales with 𝑅1.188. The shallower slope suggests that in the limit of large targets the disruption energy will approach the gravitational binding energy. References:  [1] C. Dwyer, F. Nimmo, M. Ogihara, and S.
