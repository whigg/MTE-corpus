Introduction: Metasomatism is a high-temperature open system alteration of subsurface rocks by fluids released in metamorphic or igneous processes. It implies non-isochemical alteration due to the transfer of chemical species with fluids. Although chondrites do not reveal large-scale metasomatic processes on their parent asteroids [1], fluid motions are expected during global thermal processes on large water-rich bodies [2]. The large size (~950 km in diameter) of the dwarf planet (1) Ceres suggests at least some thermal processing of the water-bearing interior leading to waterrock separation [3-5]. Thermal evolution models show that Ceres could have warmed, partially dehydrated, and water-rock differentiated even if accreted rocks did not contain any 26Al [4, 5]. Here, we model a globalscale metasomatism in the interior of a Ceres-sized body accreted from hydrated, oxidized, and 26Al-free materials of CI carbonaceous chondrites. Methods: We evaluated the phase composition in warmed Ceres’ interior, the upward transfer of fluids formed through dehydration of minerals, and the accumulation of water mantle. The used temperature (T) profile [5] in the interior reflected Ceres’ warming by long-lived radionuclides when T in the center reached ~700 °C. We assumed rock fracturing and release of the fluid if fluid pressure (P) exceeded lithostatic P by a value of rock’s tensile strength [6]. At each depth, used pressures exceeded lithostatic P by the value of the rock’s tensile strength (~102 bars). The phase composition was calculated in spherical rock layers (~5 km thick) starting at the body’s center. Initial rocks had the grain density of 2.42 g cm-3 [7]. For each layer, the calculated grain and fluid densities together with an adopted porosity were used to compute the rock’s density and the compressed layer’s new thickness. The fluid that did not fill the pore space was transferred to the overlaying layer and was allowed to react with the fresh rock. For each rock layer, we computed an apparent radius of altered rocky core and a thickness of forming water envelope that could condense above the core. A gas escape to space was not considered. The computation stopped when a radius of the differentiated body achieved 470 km, the average pre-Dawn radius of Ceres [8]. The phase composition was evaluated through calculations of chemical equilibria in the O-H-C-Cl-SMg-Ca-Si-Al-Na-K-Cr-Mn-Fe-Co-Ni-P water-rock-gas system with GEOCHEQ codes [9] which have been applied for aqueous alteration in chondrites [e.g. 10]. The models for the organic-inorganic equilibration and organic speciation were tentative. The formation of 1466.pdf

Ceres' radius (in the rocky core), km0 100 200 300log10 Mole (kg H2O)1-3-2-1COH2SH2CO2CH4Na+HCO3HSClHCOONiONaCl methane was either allowed or suppressed. Watersoluble organic compounds were represented by one Catom species which may equilibrate at lower temperatures: formate, methanol, and formaldehyde. Condensed organic species were represented by pyrene (C16H10), and the formation of graphite was suppressed. Results: The calculations led to compositional and density profiles together with masses and volumes of all constituents (rocks, minerals, pore fluids, and water mantle) and the whole body. The models demonstrate the formation of a dehydrated rocky core surrounded by more hydrated and carbonated rocks. The forming ocean accumulates chemical species leached from rocks and released through redox alteration of minerals and organic compounds. Altered rocks. The inner part of the rocky core mainly consists of Mg-Ca rich pyroxene, olivine, magnetite, and troilite (Figure 1a). The major OH-bearing phase is pargasite. Minor minerals are nepheline, Ni sulfide, phlogopite, whitlockite, rhodonite, and Ni-Co rich metal. The outer part of the core mainly consists of saponite, olivine, magnetite, and troilite. Ca and Mg carbonates form closer to the core-mantle boundary.  Compared to initial CI-type solids, all altered rocks are depleted of O, H, C, Cl, and Na, which were removed with alteration fluids (Figures 1b and 1c). In the current model, all chlorine is leached from the rock. All carbon is extracted from the inner high-T-P core, which is implied through decomposition of organic compounds (in reality, a fraction of C could be graphitized). S, K, and Ni are partially leached from the inner core. Other considered elements are not mobile owing to low solubility of corresponding secondary minerals. Fluid composition. Aqueous fluids are rich in dissolved gases (CO2, H2, CH4, CO, and H2S) as well as in sodium and chlorine species (NaCl, Na+, and Cl) (Figure 2). In the inner core, high-T-P fluids contain abundant neutral solutes (H2, CO, H2S, NaCl, and NiO). Closer to the core-mantle boundary, fluids contain more methane and ion species (Na+, HCO3, Cl, and HCOO). If formation of methane is inhibited, CO2, CO, and H2 are the most abundant solutes. A gas phase separates in the forming ocean. Na+, Cl, and bicarbonate/carbonate ions are major impurities in a degassed and cooled ocean. Formed internal structure. The calculated internal structure consists of the rocky core with a radius of 360 ± 15 km and the water mantle with a thickness of ~110 ± 15 km. The dehydrated inner part of the core has a density of 3.6 ± 0.05 g cm-3 (Figure 1d). In the hydrated upper core, the rock density decreases with the radius from ~3.5 to 3.1 g cm-3. The mantle’s mass fraction is ~26 %. Assuming the density of the water mantle to be 0.92 g cm-3, the computed body’s density of ~2.0 g cm-3 is only slightly less than the pre-Dawn data for Ceres (~2.1 to ~2.2 g cm-3). The evaluated density implies some removal of water mantle materials through escape and collisions, and an addition of a rocky cap.  Discussion: A dehydration of Ceres’ interior could have been accompanied by redox transformations of organic compounds, reduction of sulfates, leaching of some elements from the rocks, rock’s fracturing by overpressured gas-rich Na-C-Cl aqueous fluids, and the corresponding heat transfer by upwelling solutions. A deposition of Fe sulfides from cooling fluids is expected at the rock-early ocean interface. Partial degassing and escape of gases (H2, CH4, CO, CO2, and H2S), and a downward freezing of the ocean could have led to accumulation of Na chloride and Na carbonate salts at the core-icy mantle interface. Some CH4, CO2 and H2S could be trapped in clathrates. A possible early leaching of CI’s sulfates during warming of the body does not exclude their presence in a primordial ocean and subsequent accumulation at the core-mantle boundary. None of these chemical species can be seen in Ceres’ regolith. Analogous processes could have occurred on other large carbonaceous bodies. References: [1] Bland P. A. et al.
