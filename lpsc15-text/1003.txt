 ON  THE  VARIATIONS  OF  GALACTIC  COSMIC  RAYS  DURING  THE  LAST  BILLION  YEARS. V.A.

According to more recent data, this period is equal to 147 ± 6 Myr [2]. However, this conclusion is questioned by other researchers ([3] and other). In this work, we analyzed the distribution of the ages of iron meteorites after more strict selection of ages from the available data set. We compared obtained results with results for the model set of ages assuming different periods of the GCR intensity variations.  Calculations and modeling:  The distribution of 82 ages is shown in Fig. 1 (histogram 1). Ages were taken from [4-6]. For correction of ages belonging to paired meteorites (i.e., formed in a single collision), we used the Akaike information criterion [7, 8]. Age distribution of the corrected set is shown in Fig. 1 (histogram 2). Further analysis of the distribution of the corrected values of ages was made by means of calculating the values of phase (according to [8]) and the study of parameters of the distribution of these values. For each value of the age of meteorite (T), the phase (Ph) was calculated according to the ratio: Ph = T / t - int (T / t). Here t is presumptive period in the distribution of ages and, accordingly, the period of changes in the intensity of the GCR [8]. (Ph values vary in the range from 0 to 1.) Further, for the selected value of t there were calculated the population characteristics of the distribution of phase values: dispersion S 2, kurtosis Ek and χ 2. This procedure was made for the 17 values of t: 100, 150, 200, ..., 850 and 900 Myr. Then, changes of each characteristic as a function of t were analyzed. Results for the χ 2 are shown in Fig. 2. Here we can see: (a) changes of χ 2 for the corrected ages of iron meteorites; (b) the same for a model set of 100 random "true" values of ages, assuming no variations of the GCR intensity; (c) the same on the assumption of GCR variations with a period of 150 Myr, and (d) the same on the assumption of GCR variations with a period of 450 Myr. Models of changes of GCR intensity with such periods are shown in Fig. 3. For meteorites (Fig. 2a), we can see a convincing decrease of the χ 2 values for t ~ 400-500 Myr (Δ2 = -44 ± 4 %) and less convincing decrease for t = 150 Myr (Δ1 = -46 ± 13 %). Also, similar deviations from the mean values were obtained in the analysis of the distributions of the dispersion S 2 and kurtosis Ek. Distribution of the model set of 100 values of "true" ages is shown in Fig. 4a. Of course, the distribution of the "measured" values of ages will be the same if the intensity of galactic cosmic rays during the last billion years has not changed. Distribution of "measured" values of ages will have the form (see Fig. 4b), if the intensity of galactic cosmic rays was varied with a period of 150 Myr. The type of this distribution is significantly different from the distribution of ages of iron meteorites (cf. Fig. 4d). But, the distribution of the "measured" ages (Fig. 4c) will be in essence the same like the distribution of ages of iron meteorites (Fig. 4d) in the case of an assumed period of GCR intensity variations of 450 Myr. Conclusions:  The obtained data suggest the existence of the GCR intensity variations with a period of ~ 400-500 Myr during the last billion years. These variations may be due to periodic passing solar system through the spiral arms of the Galaxy. Discussed in [1, 8], changes of the GCR intensity with a period of ~ 150 Myr are less certain.
