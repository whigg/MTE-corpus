TOWARD ISOTOPICALLY SIMILAR EARTH AND MOON: IRON-ENRICHED IMPACTORS. Amy C.Barr1∗, 1Department of Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912.∗Now at RIAMD, Inc., 1321 College Ave., Suite 250, Boulder CO 80302, amy.c.mlinar@gmail.com.Introduction: Any successful scenario of the formation of Earth's moon must explain: (a) masses of theEarth and Moon, (b) the system angular momentum, (c)paucity of lunar iron, and (d) the similarity in terrestrialand lunar isotopic ratios of oxygen [1], tungsten [2], titanium [3], and silicon [4].Canup and Asphaug [5] found that an oblique collision between a body slightly smaller than the presentday Earth and a Mars-sized impactor at an impact velocity close to the mutual escape velocity of the system could yield the proper masses, angular momentumratios, and lunar iron content (see also [6]). Howeverin this scenario, the majority of the material comprising the Moon originates in the mantle of the protoearth,raising the question of how the two bodies could havesimilar volatile and refractory isotope ratios. Mixing inthe impact-generated disk could equilibrate volatile isotopic ratios between the vapor atmosphere of the Earthand lunar material, but this does not provide a naturalexplanation for refractory isotope similarities [7].Recent work seeking to explain the isotopic similarities have identified new impact scenarios that give theproper masses and compositions of the bodies [8, 9]and give moons composed of a larger fraction of impactor material. The impacts are head-on collisionsfrom equal-sized bodies at higher impact velocities thanstudied before [9], or impacts onto rapidly spinningEarths [8]. Not all of the moons created in these candidate scenarios have the proper masses, and both scenarios rely on a specific scenario for the subsequent tidalevolution [8] to obtain the proper angular momentumfor the final system.Here, I show that one can obtain a moon with theproper mass, composition, angular momentum, andtwice the amount of terrestrial material by mass, canbe obtained by impacting an iron-rich projectile onto aslightly iron-depleted Earth in the "canonical" impactscenario [5, 6].Methods: The overwhelming majority of giant impact simulations have assumed that the impactor andtarget have ∼70% rock and ∼30% iron by mass. Recent simulations of so-called "hit-and-run" collisions[10, 11] show that compositional differences can be created in lower-velocity oblique collisions, resulting inmore iron-rich planetary bodies (e.g., Mercury [12]).The terrestrial planets themselves show a range of compositions: Mercury may be ∼50 to 60% iron by mass[13] and Mars is about ∼15 to 20% iron [14]. Recentsimulations tracking the iron content of colliding planetary embryos in our solar system suggest a range of ironcontents similar to that of the modern terrestrial planets(e.g., [15]).The Moon-forming impact is simulated using the Eulerian/Lagrangian CTH hydrocode [16, 17]. We usethe ANEOS equation of state for iron [6] and dunitewith molecular vapor [18, 19]. The impact is simulatedin a fully 3-D Cartesian domain, 125 Earth radii on aside, with self-gravity [17] and variable numerical resolution. The adaptive meshing subroutine puts roughlyequal mass in each grid cell, mimicking the way thatSPH divides mass into particles [19]. The smallest gridcell in the simulation is ∼200 km, equivalent to an SPHsimulation containing a few ×105 particles.I compare the results of two simulations: the canonical"run119" from Canup (2004) [6] where the protoearthand impactor have an iron mass fraction, mfe = 0.3,and a candidate simulation "uneq3" where the target(protoearth) has mfe = 0.27 and the projectile hasmfe = 0.5. The total mass in the both collisions is∼ 1.02M⊕, the impactor-to-total mass ratio, γ = 0.11,the impact occurs at a velocity vimp ∼ vesc,sys. The impact angles for the two simulations are similar, with thecandidate successful case being only slightly more grazing: run119 has a scaled impact parameter, b′ = 0.72,whereas the candidate case here has b′ = 0.73.Result run119 uneq3Mdisk/Mlunar 1.451 1.823MFe/Mdisk 0.04 0.08Ldisk/LEM 0.296 0.314Predicted MMoon 1.536 1.264Fraction of Moon Originating from Earth 0.15 0.31Table 1: Comparison of results for an iron-rich impactor(uneq3) with canonical run119 at 20 hours post-impact.The results are compared at 20 hours of simulated timeafter the moon-forming impact, sufficient to obtain initial information about the disk mass, angular momentum, and composition. I use the iterative procedure described by [19] to distinguish whether material in eachelement in the domain is within the "Earth," orbitingthe Earth in a disk, or escaping from the system, basedon the position and velocity of the material. CTH alsoallows one to distinguish between silicate and iron originating in the protoearth and the impactor, which allowsme to track the provenance of the material ending up inthe Moon.

the time-dependent disk mass is obtained using [20, 21],MLMdisk≈ 1.9(LDMdisk√GM⊕aR)−1.1−1.9(MescMdisk),(1)where LD is the disk angular momentum, Mdisk is thedisk mass, aR is the Roche radius, M⊕ is the mass ofthe Earth, and G is the gravitational constant, and Mescis the total mass escaping from the system. Longer runtimes are of course required to ensure that the disk massdoes not change due to clumps of material impacting theEarth.Figure 1: Slices in the x − y plane of CTH simulations. Colors depict material density (red=10 g/cm3,green=0.01 g/cm3, blue=10−6 g/cm3) for run119 (left;target and projectilemfe = 0.3) and uneq3 (right; targetmfe = 0.27, projectile mfe = 0.5), at t = 1.6 hours(top), t = 4 hours (middle), and t = 20 hours (bottom).Results: Figure 1 shows a few snapshots of the CTHsimulations for each case. Figure 2 and Table 1 showshow the disk mass and fraction of disk mass originatingfrom the Earth change over time for the first 20 hourspost-impact: the disk mass, disk iron content, and angular momentum are similar between the two simulations.However the Moon formed in the case with the iron-richimpactor (uneq3) has twice as much terrestrial materialas its canonical counterpart (run119). This may not beas Earth-rich as the head-on impacts identified in otherworks [8, 9], but the simulation I present here has theimportant benefit of obtaining the proper lunar mass andsystem angular momentum, without the requirement forlater tidal evolution for the system to match its presentstate. I am in the process of exploring more parameterspace, in terms of composition, impact geometry, andvelocity.Acknowledgements: This work was supported byBrown University; CTH simulations were performed ontheir computer systems.Figure 2: (top) Disk mass (in units of lunar masses) asa function of time for run119 (open circles) and uneq3(filled circles).
