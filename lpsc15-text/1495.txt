Introduction: Any successful scenario of the formation of Earth's moon must explain: (a) masses of the Earth and Moon, (b) the system angular momentum, (c) paucity of lunar iron, and (d) the similarity in terrestrial and lunar isotopic ratios of oxygen [1], tungsten [2], titanium [3], and silicon [4]. Canup and Asphaug [5] found that an oblique collision between a body slightly smaller than the presentday Earth and a Mars-sized impactor at an impact velocity close to the mutual escape velocity of the system could yield the proper masses, angular momentum ratios, and lunar iron content (see also [6]). However in this scenario, the majority of the material comprising the Moon originates in the mantle of the protoearth, raising the question of how the two bodies could have similar volatile and refractory isotope ratios. Mixing in the impact-generated disk could equilibrate volatile isotopic ratios between the vapor atmosphere of the Earth and lunar material, but this does not provide a natural explanation for refractory isotope similarities [7]. Recent work seeking to explain the isotopic similarities have identified new impact scenarios that give the proper masses and compositions of the bodies [8, 9] and give moons composed of a larger fraction of impactor material. The impacts are head-on collisions from equal-sized bodies at higher impact velocities than studied before [9], or impacts onto rapidly spinning Earths [8]. Not all of the moons created in these candidate scenarios have the proper masses, and both scenarios rely on a specific scenario for the subsequent tidal evolution [8] to obtain the proper angular momentum for the final system. Here, I show that one can obtain a moon with the proper mass, composition, angular momentum, and twice the amount of terrestrial material by mass, can be obtained by impacting an iron-rich projectile onto a slightly iron-depleted Earth in the "canonical" impact scenario [5, 6]. Methods: The overwhelming majority of giant impact simulations have assumed that the impactor and target have ∼70% rock and ∼30% iron by mass. Recent simulations of so-called "hit-and-run" collisions [10, 11] show that compositional differences can be created in lower-velocity oblique collisions, resulting in more iron-rich planetary bodies (e.g., Mercury [12]). The terrestrial planets themselves show a range of compositions: Mercury may be ∼50 to 60% iron by mass [13] and Mars is about ∼15 to 20% iron [14]. Recent simulations tracking the iron content of colliding planetary embryos in our solar system suggest a range of iron contents similar to that of the modern terrestrial planets (e.g., [15]). The Moon-forming impact is simulated using the Eulerian/Lagrangian CTH hydrocode [16, 17]. We use the ANEOS equation of state for iron [6] and dunite with molecular vapor [18, 19]. The impact is simulated in a fully 3-D Cartesian domain, 125 Earth radii on a side, with self-gravity [17] and variable numerical resolution. The adaptive meshing subroutine puts roughly equal mass in each grid cell, mimicking the way that SPH divides mass into particles [19]. The smallest grid cell in the simulation is ∼200 km, equivalent to an SPH simulation containing a few ×105 particles. I compare the results of two simulations: the canonical "run119" from Canup (2004) [6] where the protoearth and impactor have an iron mass fraction, mfe = 0.3, and a candidate simulation "uneq3" where the target (protoearth) has mfe = 0.27 and the projectile has mfe = 0.5. The total mass in the both collisions is ∼ 1.02M⊕, the impactor-to-total mass ratio, γ = 0.11, the impact occurs at a velocity vimp ∼ vesc,sys. The impact angles for the two simulations are similar, with the candidate successful case being only slightly more grazing: run119 has a scaled impact parameter, b′ = 0.72, whereas the candidate case here has b′ = 0.73. Result run119 uneq3 Mdisk/Mlunar 1.451 1.823 MFe/Mdisk 0.04 0.08 Ldisk/LEM 0.296 0.314 Predicted MMoon 1.536 1.264 Fraction of Moon Originating from Earth 0.15 0.31 Table 1: Comparison of results for an iron-rich impactor (uneq3) with canonical run119 at 20 hours post-impact. The results are compared at 20 hours of simulated time after the moon-forming impact, sufficient to obtain initial information about the disk mass, angular momentum, and composition. I use the iterative procedure described by [19] to distinguish whether material in each element in the domain is within the "Earth," orbiting the Earth in a disk, or escaping from the system, based on the position and velocity of the material. CTH also allows one to distinguish between silicate and iron originating in the protoearth and the impactor, which allows me to track the provenance of the material ending up in the Moon. A prediction of the final lunar mass, based on  the time-dependent disk mass is obtained using [20, 21], ML Mdisk ≈ 1.9 (LD Mdisk √GM⊕aR )−1.1−1.9 (Mesc Mdisk ), (1) where LD is the disk angular momentum, Mdisk is the disk mass, aR is the Roche radius, M⊕ is the mass of the Earth, and G is the gravitational constant, and Mesc is the total mass escaping from the system. Longer runtimes are of course required to ensure that the disk mass does not change due to clumps of material impacting the Earth. Figure 1: Slices in the x − y plane of CTH simulations. Colors depict material density (red=10 g/cm3, green=0.01 g/cm3, blue=10−6 g/cm3) for run119 (left; target and projectilemfe = 0.3) and uneq3 (right; target mfe = 0.27, projectile mfe = 0.5), at t = 1.6 hours (top), t = 4 hours (middle), and t = 20 hours (bottom). Results: Figure 1 shows a few snapshots of the CTH simulations for each case. Figure 2 and Table 1 shows how the disk mass and fraction of disk mass originating from the Earth change over time for the first 20 hours post-impact: the disk mass, disk iron content, and angular momentum are similar between the two simulations. However the Moon formed in the case with the iron-rich impactor (uneq3) has twice as much terrestrial material as its canonical counterpart (run119). This may not be as Earth-rich as the head-on impacts identified in other works [8, 9], but the simulation I present here has the important benefit of obtaining the proper lunar mass and system angular momentum, without the requirement for later tidal evolution for the system to match its present state. I am in the process of exploring more parameter space, in terms of composition, impact geometry, and velocity.
