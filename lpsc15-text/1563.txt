Paige5, 1Space Science Institute(jbandfield@spacescience.org);  2Applied Physics  Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University;  3NASA Goddard  SpaceFlight Center; 4Florida Institute of Technology; 5University of California at Los Angeles.Introduction: The systematic and global collectionof radar, thermal infrared, and high-resolution opticalimages has provided a new perspective on the natureand  variety of  lunar  surface  materials  [e.g.,  1-3].  Inparticular, lunar volcanic and impact related processesexhibit a greater diversity than previously understood.These new datasets have been used to characterizeanomalous  regions  of  elevated  rock  concentrations.Two are discussed here; 1) a 150 km diameter regionon the lunar farside, centered near 167.5°E, 42.5°N and2)  a  diffuse ~700 km diameter  region  centered  near310°E, 35°S in the nearside highlands.Methods: We used Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter(LRO)  Diviner  Radiometer  data  to  map  the  rockdistributions  [4] in  each  of  these  areas.  The  rockabundance  data  were  combined  with  surface  slopesderived from LRO Wide Angle Camera (WAC) images[5]. LRO Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) images wereused  to  identify  surface  morphologies  and  texturesassociated  with  distinct  surfaces  identified  in  theDiviner  rock  abundance  data.  These  datasets  werecompared with  Mini-RF radar data, which was used tocharacterize  near-surface  rock  distributions  andidentify secondary craters and impact melt deposits.Results:  Tycho  Antipode. Surfaces  in  this  areadisplay numerous features that appear to have formedvia  flows  and  ponding.  Although  the  large-scalemorphology  of  this  area  appears  typical  of  heavilycratered  lunar highlands,  radar, thermal infrared,  andhigh-resolution  imaging  measurements  displayproperties that resemble melt ponds and rocky surfacestypically associated with young impact craters [6-8].Rock concentrations are highly variable within thisregion, with many local rocky areas ~1–10 km across(Figure 1). There appears to be two distinct areas withhigh rock concentrations present on distinctly differentslope  azimuth  ranges.  Within  the  northern  region,rocky  surfaces  dominate  western  facing  slopes  androcks are largely absent from east facing slopes. Withinthe southern region, rocky surfaces dominate northwestfacing  slopes  and  are  absent  from  southeast  facingslopes (Figure 2). The nearly complete lack of rocks oneastern  and  southern  slopes  indicates  that  thesesurfaces were protected from incoming debris,  whichmust have arrived from relatively shallow angles.Nearside  Highlands. A  region,  centered  near310°E,  35°S,  appears  to  have  elevated  rockconcentrations with some properties similar to the rockdistributions  found  near  the  Tycho  Crater  antipode.This region is much larger  and diffuse with no clearboundary (Figure 1).  In  this case,  no melt ponds arevisible and flow features  only occur  on the walls oflarger  craters.  Rocks  occur  as  isolated  clusters  onsloped surfaces (Figure 3).Figure 1. Rock concentrations for the two regions discussed here. (left) Elevated rock concentrations (0-5%) occur near the antipode of Tycho Crater. The two ovals roughly denote the northern and southern regions that have rocky surfaces on preferential slope azimuths. (right) The nearside highlands anomalous rocky region is much larger and more diffuse. Mountainous terrain exhibits elevated rock concentrations on west- and northwest-facing slopes. Arrows denote several local areas with rocks present on surfaces of a preferential orientation.Rock Concentration0 0.051563.pdf

Similar  to  the Tycho  Antipodal  region,  the rockysurfaces  in  this  region  are  present  on  slopes  with apreferential  orientation  (Figure  2).  The  asymmetricaldistribution  is  not  as  pronounced  as  with the  TychoCrater  antipode  deposits.  Rock  concentrations  aretypically lower that the Tycho antipode deposits.Discussion:  Over time, rocky surfaces are brokendown and the presence  of  elevated  rock  abundancesindicates a young formation age [e.g., 4,9]. The regionsof interest here have no adjacent source crater or anyother  obvious  origin.  There  is  clear  evidence  forsurface  impact  of  source  material  from  restrictedazimuth angles and high incidence angles across largeareas.  Impact  velocities  must also be  low enough topreserve the pre-existing highlands landscape withoutcreating  obvious  secondary  craters.  Whatever  thesource,  material  fell  from the sky at  a  high angle ofincidence and from discreet directions.The coincidence  of  the rocky exposures  with theantipode and age [6] of Tycho Crater makes it difficultfor us to resist associating the two features.  However,the mechanisms required for the emplacement of suchlarge volumes of impact melt at  such large distancesare  not  understood  [6].  By  contrast,  the  nearsidehighlands region discussed here is not located near theantipode of any recent large impact crater, though theCopernican  period  Jackson,  Byrgius  A,  and  Glushkocraters  are  located  towards  the  northwest,  roughlyconsistent  with  the  incoming  material.  Alternately,Tycho crater itself may instead be the source of thesedeposits,  nearly  completing  a  full  orbit  beforeimpacting  the  surface.  Given  the  evidence  for  thelimited directionality of the deposits and the lack of anantipodal  source  for  the  nearside  highlands  rockregion, it  does  not appear  that  an antipodal  focusingmechanism [e.g., 10] played a role in their formation.Rather, concentrations of ejecta are lofted at variabledistances downrange from the impact, creating strewnfields.  It  appears  that  strewn fields  with a  variety ofmorphologies  can  modify  large  regions  at  distanceswell separated from the source crater.References:  [1]  Robinson,  M.S.,  et  al.
