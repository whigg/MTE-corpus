Introduction: The systematic and global collection of radar, thermal infrared, and high-resolution optical images has provided a new perspective on the nature and  variety of  lunar  surface  materials  [e.g.,  1-3].  In particular, lunar volcanic and impact related processes exhibit a greater diversity than previously understood. These new datasets have been used to characterize anomalous  regions  of  elevated  rock  concentrations. Two are discussed here; 1) a 150 km diameter region on the lunar farside, centered near 167.5°E, 42.5°N and 2)  a  diffuse ~700 km diameter  region  centered  near 310°E, 35°S in the nearside highlands. Methods: We used Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO)  Diviner  Radiometer  data  to  map  the  rock distributions  [4] in  each  of  these  areas.  The  rock abundance  data  were  combined  with  surface  slopes derived from LRO Wide Angle Camera (WAC) images [5]. LRO Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) images were used  to  identify  surface  morphologies  and  textures associated  with  distinct  surfaces  identified  in  the Diviner  rock  abundance  data.  These  datasets  were compared with  Mini-RF radar data, which was used to characterize  near-surface  rock  distributions  and identify secondary craters and impact melt deposits. Results:  Tycho  Antipode. Surfaces  in  this  area display numerous features that appear to have formed via  flows  and  ponding.  Although  the  large-scale morphology  of  this  area  appears  typical  of  heavily cratered  lunar highlands,  radar, thermal infrared,  and high-resolution  imaging  measurements  display properties that resemble melt ponds and rocky surfaces typically associated with young impact craters [6-8]. Rock concentrations are highly variable within this region, with many local rocky areas ~1-10 km across (Figure 1). There appears to be two distinct areas with high rock concentrations present on distinctly different slope  azimuth  ranges.  Within  the  northern  region, rocky  surfaces  dominate  western  facing  slopes  and rocks are largely absent from east facing slopes. Within the southern region, rocky surfaces dominate northwest facing  slopes  and  are  absent  from  southeast  facing slopes (Figure 2). The nearly complete lack of rocks on eastern  and  southern  slopes  indicates  that  these surfaces were protected from incoming debris,  which must have arrived from relatively shallow angles. Nearside  Highlands. A  region,  centered  near 310°E,  35°S,  appears  to  have  elevated  rock concentrations with some properties similar to the rock distributions  found  near  the  Tycho  Crater  antipode. This region is much larger  and diffuse with no clear boundary (Figure 1).  In  this case,  no melt ponds are visible and flow features  only occur  on the walls of larger  craters.  Rocks  occur  as  isolated  clusters  on sloped surfaces (Figure 3). Figure 1. Rock concentrations for the two regions discussed here. (left) Elevated rock concentrations (0-5%) occur near the antipode of Tycho Crater. The two ovals roughly denote the northern and southern regions that have rocky surfaces on preferential slope azimuths. (right) The nearside highlands anomalous rocky region is much larger and more diffuse. Mountainous terrain exhibits elevated rock concentrations on west- and northwest-facing slopes. Arrows denote several local areas with rocks present on surfaces of a preferential orientation. Rock Concentration 0 0.05   Similar  to  the Tycho  Antipodal  region,  the rocky surfaces  in  this  region  are  present  on  slopes  with a preferential  orientation  (Figure  2).  The  asymmetrical distribution  is  not  as  pronounced  as  with the  Tycho Crater  antipode  deposits.  Rock  concentrations  are typically lower that the Tycho antipode deposits. Discussion:  Over time, rocky surfaces are broken down and the presence  of  elevated  rock  abundances indicates a young formation age [e.g., 4,9]. The regions of interest here have no adjacent source crater or any other  obvious  origin.  There  is  clear  evidence  for surface  impact  of  source  material  from  restricted azimuth angles and high incidence angles across large areas.  Impact  velocities  must also be  low enough to preserve the pre-existing highlands landscape without creating  obvious  secondary  craters.  Whatever  the source,  material  fell  from the sky at  a  high angle of incidence and from discreet directions. The coincidence  of  the rocky exposures  with the antipode and age [6] of Tycho Crater makes it difficult for us to resist associating the two features.  However, the mechanisms required for the emplacement of such large volumes of impact melt at  such large distances are  not  understood  [6].  By  contrast,  the  nearside highlands region discussed here is not located near the antipode of any recent large impact crater, though the Copernican  period  Jackson,  Byrgius  A,  and  Glushko craters  are  located  towards  the  northwest,  roughly consistent  with  the  incoming  material.  Alternately, Tycho crater itself may instead be the source of these deposits,  nearly  completing  a  full  orbit  before impacting  the  surface.  Given  the  evidence  for  the limited directionality of the deposits and the lack of an antipodal  source  for  the  nearside  highlands  rock region, it  does  not appear  that  an antipodal  focusing mechanism [e.g., 10] played a role in their formation. Rather, concentrations of ejecta are lofted at variable distances downrange from the impact, creating strewn fields.  It  appears  that  strewn fields  with a  variety of morphologies  can  modify  large  regions  at  distances well separated from the source crater. References:  [1]  Robinson,  M.S.,  et  al.
