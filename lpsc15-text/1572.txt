 MAJOR-ELEMENT  GEOCHEMISTRY  OF  LARGE,  IGNEOUS-TEXTURED  INCLUSIONS  IN ORDINARY CHONDRITES.  K.  Armstrong1 and  A.M.

Introduction:  Approximately 4% of O chondrites contain  large  inclusions  of  igneous-textured  material [1]. These inclusions are about an order of magnitude larger  than  most  chondrules  in O chondrites  and are almost  always  highly  depleted  in  metal  and  sulfide relative  to  their  host  meteorite  [2-7].  They  are otherwise  diverse,  suggesting  various  formation mechanisms  [3,4].  Proposed  models  include  shock melting with an associated  loss  of  metal  and sulfide [e.g.,  3,4,8-10];  melting  of  vapor-fractionated condensate mixtures  [3,4];  large chondrules  [3-5,11]; and igneous differentiation [2,12,13]. This  work  details  the  petrography  and  major element bulk chemistry of 29 of these inclusions from a diverse array of host meteorites. These data indicate that  (I)  none  of  the  inclusions  in  this  study  were derived from an igneous-differentiation source; (II) the inclusions  can  be  subdivided  into  three  chemical groups:  unfractionated,  vapor  fractionated,  and feldspar enriched; (III) a subgroup of inclusions likely crystallized  as  free-floating  droplets  in  a  space environment, and these were often vapor fractionated; and  (IV)  some inclusions  that  probably  derive  from shock-melted  material  have  a  pronounced  K enrichment (fig. 1). Methods and Materials:  Petrographic analyses of 29  inclusions  from  23  meteorites  in  polished  thin section were conducted with optical light microscopy (OLM)  and  scanning  electron  microscopy  (SEM). Backscattered  electron  micrographs  and  false-color chemical phase maps were obtained for each inclusion in order  to  provide  additional  petrographic  data  and determine modal abundance. Major phase compositions were obtained with the SEM  using  a  silicon-drift  energy  dispersive  X-ray (EDX) detector integrated with an Oxford Instruments AZtec  X-ray  analytical  system.  Some  of  these  data were then verified with electron microprobe analyses (EMPA).  Bulk  chemistry  was  then  determined  via modal reconstruction. Results:  The inclusions show variations in texture and mineralogy but all are dominated by olivine and/or low-Ca pyroxene. Bulk chemistry for most inclusions is  essentially  chondritic,  less  metal  and  sulfide;  the inclusions  all  cluster  around  average  O-chondrite composition  when projected  on  a  normative olivineplagioclas-quartz  (Ol-Pl-Qz)  ternary.  Even  so,  the inclusions can be separated into three chemical groups that probably have different origins. Figure  1:  (A)  The  unfractionated  inclusions are  essentially  chondritic;  (B)  comparison  of unfractionated  inclusions enriched  in K compared  to known  impact  melt;  (C)  the  vapor-fractionated inclusions have a clear  trend  of  increasing depletion with  increasing  volatility.  Errors  are  standard deviations. Average O chondrite data from [14]. Discussion  and  Conclusions:  There  is  no correlation  between  host  meteorite  type  and  any inclusion property. Trends in  bulk  chemistry.  Broadly, the  lithophileelement chemistry of the inclusions can be described as  either  unfractionated,  vapor  fractionated,  or enriched in feldspar. The major element compositions  of vapor-fractionated inclusions have a clear tendency to  be  depleted  in  more  volatile  elements,  whereas unfractionated inclusions are, on average, very close to average O chondrite.  Four inclusions are enriched in feldspar  (fig 1),  and a fifth  is  depleted.   A feldsparenrichment (fig 2) is what one would expect based on observations  of  melt  pockets  and  shock experiments that suggest preferential melting of feldspar. Figure  2:  Al-normalized  Na+K  vs  Si  for  all inclusions.  The vapor  fractionated  inclusions tend  to have  a  distinctly  lower  (Na+K)/Al  ratio  than  the unfractionated inclusions, as a result of losing the more volatile  Na  and  K.  The  lone  exception,  Par-I2,  an inclusion from Parnallee, also lost Al, possibly though fractional  condensation.  The  feldspar  enriched inclusions are enriched in both the alkalis and Al. A mixing line  of  Ab85An15  and  average  O chondrite  is shown;  the  feldspar-enriched  inclusions  are  in  good agreement with this line. Crossed symbols are droplets. Timing  of  Melting. Some  inclusions  were metamorphically  equilibrated  before  becoming incorporated  into  their  host,  and  some  hosts  were equilibrated  before  inclusions  were  added.  This indicates that molten material in the early solar system formed both before and after metamorphic heating. Igneous  Differentiation.  Calculated  normative compositions  projected  onto  an  Ol-Pl-Qz  ternary diagram  plot  close  to  the  average  O  chondrite composition. Inclusions do not plot  near  cotectics  or reaction  curves.  This  implies  that  none  of  the inclusions  in  this  study  derive  from  a  differentiated source. Drop-formed  inclusions.  Eight  inclusions  have compelling  evidence  that  they,  like  chondrules, crystallized  as  free-floating droplets  in  space.  These inclusions are round in shape, have textures commonly seen  in  chondrules,  concentric  textures,  radial variations in texture  and/or  chemistry, and appear  to have interacted with their surroundings. Many of them have a texturally distinct rim or mantle, also a common feature of chondrules. Interestingly, all nine of these inclusions may have been affected by a volatility fractionation process (fig 2).  These  inclusions,  as  a  group,  thus  potentially formed  as  melt  droplets  that  experienced  a  kinetic process, such as condensation or evaporative heating. Shock melt.  There is compelling evidence that at least one, and probably several, of the inclusions in this study are  shock melts.  869-I1  is  contained  in a  host meteorite,  NWA 869,  that  is  relatively  well  studied [e.g., 15]. The CML sample studied here has numerous shock-darkened  regions,  and  the  inclusion  itself appears to have intruded into and partially melted the host.  The inclusion also resembles,  in texture  and in olivine chemistry, clasts in other samples of NWA 869 that others have identified as impact melt rocks [15]. Two inclusions, including 869-I1, have essentially chondritic bulk chemistries  but are enriched in K, in some cases to a striking degree (fig 1B). The apparent excess  of  K,  without  an excess  of  Na,  suggests  that metasomatism is not responsible for the K enrichment. Analyses  of  other  samples  known to  be  shock-melt have also shown an excess  of  K, suggesting that  Kenrichment may be an indicator of shock (fig 1B).
