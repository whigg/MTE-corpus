MAJOR-ELEMENT  GEOCHEMISTRY  OF  LARGE,  IGNEOUS-TEXTURED  INCLUSIONS  INORDINARY CHONDRITES.  K.  Armstrong1 and  A.M.  Ruzicka1,  1Portland  State  University  Department  ofGeology (17 Cramer Hall, 1721 SW Broadway, Portland, OR, USA).Introduction:  Approximately 4% of O chondritescontain  large  inclusions  of  igneous-textured  material[1]. These inclusions are about an order of magnitudelarger  than  most  chondrules  in O chondrites  and arealmost  always  highly  depleted  in  metal  and  sulfiderelative  to  their  host  meteorite  [2-7].  They  areotherwise  diverse,  suggesting  various  formationmechanisms  [3,4].  Proposed  models  include  shockmelting with an associated  loss  of  metal  and sulfide[e.g.,  3,4,8-10];  melting  of  vapor-fractionatedcondensate mixtures  [3,4];  large chondrules  [3-5,11];and igneous differentiation [2,12,13].This  work  details  the  petrography  and  majorelement bulk chemistry of 29 of these inclusions froma diverse array of host meteorites. These data indicatethat  (I)  none  of  the  inclusions  in  this  study  werederived from an igneous-differentiation source; (II) theinclusions  can  be  subdivided  into  three  chemicalgroups:  unfractionated,  vapor  fractionated,  andfeldspar enriched; (III) a subgroup of inclusions likelycrystallized  as  free-floating  droplets  in  a  spaceenvironment, and these were often vapor fractionated;and  (IV)  some inclusions  that  probably  derive  fromshock-melted  material  have  a  pronounced  Kenrichment (fig. 1).Methods and Materials:  Petrographic analyses of29  inclusions  from  23  meteorites  in  polished  thinsection were conducted with optical light microscopy(OLM)  and  scanning  electron  microscopy  (SEM).Backscattered  electron  micrographs  and  false-colorchemical phase maps were obtained for each inclusionin order  to  provide  additional  petrographic  data  anddetermine modal abundance. Major phase compositions were obtained with theSEM  using  a  silicon-drift  energy  dispersive  X-ray(EDX) detector integrated with an Oxford InstrumentsAZtec  X-ray  analytical  system.  Some  of  these  datawere then verified with electron microprobe analyses(EMPA).  Bulk  chemistry  was  then  determined  viamodal reconstruction.Results:  The inclusions show variations in textureand mineralogy but all are dominated by olivine and/orlow-Ca pyroxene. Bulk chemistry for most inclusionsis  essentially  chondritic,  less  metal  and  sulfide;  theinclusions  all  cluster  around  average  O-chondritecomposition  when projected  on  a  normative olivineplagioclas-quartz  (Ol-Pl-Qz)  ternary.  Even  so,  theinclusions can be separated into three chemical groupsthat probably have different origins.Figure  1:  (A)  The  unfractionated  inclusionsare  essentially  chondritic;  (B)  comparison  ofunfractionated  inclusions enriched  in K compared  toknown  impact  melt;  (C)  the  vapor-fractionatedinclusions have a clear  trend  of  increasing depletionwith  increasing  volatility.  Errors  are  standarddeviations. Average O chondrite data from [14].Discussion  and  Conclusions:  There  is  nocorrelation  between  host  meteorite  type  and  anyinclusion property.Trends in  bulk  chemistry.  Broadly, the  lithophileelement chemistry of the inclusions can be describedas  either  unfractionated,  vapor  fractionated,  orenriched in feldspar. The major element compositions1572.pdf

of vapor-fractionated inclusions have a clear tendencyto  be  depleted  in  more  volatile  elements,  whereasunfractionated inclusions are, on average, very close toaverage O chondrite.  Four inclusions are enriched infeldspar  (fig 1),  and a fifth  is  depleted.   A feldsparenrichment (fig 2) is what one would expect based onobservations  of  melt  pockets  and  shock experimentsthat suggest preferential melting of feldspar.Figure  2:  Al-normalized  Na+K  vs  Si  for  allinclusions.  The vapor  fractionated  inclusions tend  tohave  a  distinctly  lower  (Na+K)/Al  ratio  than  theunfractionated inclusions, as a result of losing the morevolatile  Na  and  K.  The  lone  exception,  Par-I2,  aninclusion from Parnallee, also lost Al, possibly thoughfractional  condensation.  The  feldspar  enrichedinclusions are enriched in both the alkalis and Al. Amixing line  of  Ab85An15  and  average  O chondrite  isshown;  the  feldspar-enriched  inclusions  are  in  goodagreement with this line. Crossed symbols are droplets. Timing  of  Melting. Some  inclusions  weremetamorphically  equilibrated  before  becomingincorporated  into  their  host,  and  some  hosts  wereequilibrated  before  inclusions  were  added.  Thisindicates that molten material in the early solar systemformed both before and after metamorphic heating.Igneous  Differentiation.  Calculated  normativecompositions  projected  onto  an  Ol-Pl-Qz  ternarydiagram  plot  close  to  the  average  O  chondritecomposition. Inclusions do not plot  near  cotectics  orreaction  curves.  This  implies  that  none  of  theinclusions  in  this  study  derive  from  a  differentiatedsource. Drop-formed  inclusions.  Eight  inclusions  havecompelling  evidence  that  they,  like  chondrules,crystallized  as  free-floating droplets  in  space.  Theseinclusions are round in shape, have textures commonlyseen  in  chondrules,  concentric  textures,  radialvariations in texture  and/or  chemistry, and appear  tohave interacted with their surroundings. Many of themhave a texturally distinct rim or mantle, also a commonfeature of chondrules.Interestingly, all nine of these inclusions may havebeen affected by a volatility fractionation process (fig2).  These  inclusions,  as  a  group,  thus  potentiallyformed  as  melt  droplets  that  experienced  a  kineticprocess, such as condensation or evaporative heating.Shock melt.  There is compelling evidence that atleast one, and probably several, of the inclusions in thisstudy are  shock melts.  869-I1  is  contained  in a  hostmeteorite,  NWA 869,  that  is  relatively  well  studied[e.g., 15]. The CML sample studied here has numerousshock-darkened  regions,  and  the  inclusion  itselfappears to have intruded into and partially melted thehost.  The inclusion also resembles,  in texture  and inolivine chemistry, clasts in other samples of NWA 869that others have identified as impact melt rocks [15].Two inclusions, including 869-I1, have essentiallychondritic bulk chemistries  but are enriched in K, insome cases to a striking degree (fig 1B). The apparentexcess  of  K,  without  an excess  of  Na,  suggests  thatmetasomatism is not responsible for the K enrichment.Analyses  of  other  samples  known to  be  shock-melthave also shown an excess  of  K, suggesting that  Kenrichment may be an indicator of shock (fig 1B).
