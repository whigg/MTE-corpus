Introduction:  The lakes of Titan serve as a nexus for the complex chemical interchanges between the surface and the atmosphere. The lakes are a repository for the products of atmospheric chemistry, interconnecting Titan's geology, atmosphere, and astrobiological potential. Erosion, the extent of pluvial transport of organics, and partitioning of photochemical products between atmosphere and liquid will all leave traces in the chemical composition of the lakes. Detailed chemical analysis is therefore a primary goal of any future Titan lake mission. Standard organic analysis techniques, such as gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, require acquisition and transfer of a sample to the instrument. This is problematic when considering the surface temperature of Titan (94 K), which will most likely be much colder than the interior of the lander. Volatilization, exsolvation and fractionation during sample handling are all major obstacles to overcome. Alternatively, if spectroscopic methods were used, chemical analyses could be performed through fiber optics, enabling analysis of a lake sample without alteration. To this aim, we are developing three fiber optic probe-based instruments to perform in situ chemical characterization of the hydrocarbon lakes of Titan. Two of these instruments take advantage of commercially-available miniature spectrometers and sources to significantly reduce mass and volume (Fig. 1). Such instruments could easily be included on a future Titan lake lander or submersible.  Figure 1. Prototype instruments built from commercial components.

Mid-IR (2.0-9.0 µm) and NIR/SWIR (0.9-2.5 µm) absorption spectrometers can be used to determine lake composition by measuring the proportions of methane, ethane and propane. Absorption in the UV/Vis (190-650 nm) region can help identify and quantify trace species dissolved in the lakes, such as benzene and naphthalene. Here we report results of testing these instruments in various hydrocarbon solutions at Titan-relevant temperatures. Methods:  All three instruments were assembled using commercial components and multimode optical fibers appropriate for the target wavelength range. Miniature spectrometers were used for the UV/Vis and NIR/SWIR instruments (Fig. 1). The Mid-IR instrument included a Nicolet 6700 FTIR (Thermo Scientific) coupled to a Remspec low temperature attenuated total reflectance (ATR) probe. Mid-IR and NIR/SWIR Measurements.  Aliquots of methane, ethane and/or propane were condensed at Titan surface temperature (93-95 K) in a custom-built cryostat under N2 atmosphere [1, 2]. Temperature control to ±0.1 K was achieved with a temperature controller connected to a temperature sensor and wire heater. Hydrocarbon volumes were measured using a plastic pipette cooled in LN2. Solutions were allowed to equilibrate for 15 min with the probe immersed prior to collection of spectra. UV/Vis Measurements.  Benzene and naphthalene were dissolved to saturation (18.5 and 0.16 mg/L, respectively) in liquid ethane at 95 K  [3]. The probe was placed in a borosilicate glass microfiber extraction thimble (0.8 µm nominal particle retention) to filter the solution of any particulates (Fig. 2). This was allowed to equilibrate for 1 hr prior to collection of spectra.

Peak areas were used to generate calibration curves, allowing quantification of these species in a Titan lake using fiber optic-based in situ instruments. Benzene and naphthalene were both identified in the UV/Vis absorption spectrum of the saturated ethane solution (Fig. 4), consistent with previous spectra obtained in our lab using a fritted glass filter and a different light source and fiber probe [4]. Future work will involve determination of the limits of detection for these species using this prototype instrument. However, kinetics studies suggest that benzene would reach saturation in a Titan lake on the timescale of millions of years [3], so the saturation concentration tested here (18.5 mg/L for benzene) is a reasonable metric to validate this prototype. Conclusions: Three fiber optic probe-based instruments were successfully demonstrated at Titan relevant temperatures for three different wavelength regimes. The NIR/SWIR prototype and the mid-IR instrument were capable of distinguishing various ratios of liquid hydrocarbons at Titan surface temperatures to determine lake composition. The UV/Vis prototype instrument quantified trace dissolved components (benzene, naphthalene) in liquid methane and ethane. Two of these instruments (NIR/SWIR and UV/Vis) were based on miniature spectrometers and have small footprints, making them ideal for a future in situ mission to a Titan lake. This work validates the power of spectroscopy as an analytical tool to understand organic chemistry of a cryogenic environment without altering the sample.
