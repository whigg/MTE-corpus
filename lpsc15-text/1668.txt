147SM143ND AND 146SM142ND CHRONOLOGY OF A BASALTIC EUCRITE, NWA 7188.  S. Kagami1, T. Yokoyama1, T. Usui1, and R. Fukai1, 1Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Tokyo Institute of Technology, (2-12-1 Ookayama, Meguro, Tokyo 152-8551, Japan, email: kagami.s.ab@m.titech.ac.jp).   Introduction:  HED (howardite, eucrite and diogenite) meteorites are considered to derive from the 4-Vesta asteroid that has experienced magma ocean and differentiated into core, mantle, and crust [1, 2]. Eucrite originating from the Vesta's crust is petrographically classified into two groups; basaltic eucrite with subophitic texture formed near the surface, while cumulate eucrite having gabbroic texture crystallized slowly deep in the crust [3]. Determination of precise ages for these eucrites will constrain the period of igneous activity and the following thermal metamorphism of Vesta and may further provide insights on its differentiation and thermal history. Recently, Boyet et al. [4] investigated the longlived 147Sm143Nd (T1/2 = 1.06×1011 yr) and the shortlived 146Sm142Nd (T1/2 = 6.8×107 yr [5]) systematics in cumulate eucrites. With the addition of literature data, they found that four eucrites have concordant 147Sm143Nd and 146Sm-142Nd systematics, with a weighted average 147Sm-143Nd age equal to 4546±8 Ma. In contrast, Iizuka et al. [6] performed the U-Pb dating for zircon grains from a basaltic eucrite Agoult and yielded a concordant 207Pb/206Pb age with the weighted average of 4554.5±2.0 Ma. They concluded that the zircon age would represent the timing of thermal metamorphism on the parent body. These chronological studies on eucrites may suggest a potential age gap between basaltic and cumulate eucrites although more data with high time resolution are required. In this study, we investigate the 147Sm143Nd and 146Sm142Nd systematics of a basaltic eucrite, NWA 7188. To obtain highly precise age data, we developed the techniques for determining Nd and Sm concentrations and Nd isotope compositions in meteorite samples. We report the 147Sm143Nd and 146Sm142Nd ages of NWA 7188 and compare the results with the ages obtained in previous chorological studies on cumulate and basaltic eucrites.  Samples:  NWA 7188 was found in Northwest Africa in 2011. The rock specimen is fresh and monomict with relatively small effect of brecciation. It has intersertal texture composed of calcic plagioclase, pigeonite, and minor minerals. For the determination of Sm-Nd mineral isochorons, we conducted the mineral separation as follows. The meteorite chip (~20 g) was crushed and sieved into four sizes; G1) 500-1700 µm, G2) 250-500µm, G3) 106-250 µm, and G4) <106 µm. G3 and G4 were separated into magnetic and nonmagnetic minerals. From the magnetic fractions, we handpicked pyroxene grains. Plagioclase grains were handpicked from the non-magnetic fractions.  Experiments:  We determined the 147Sm143Nd and 146Sm142Nd ages of NWA 7188 using five mineral fractions: G1, G3-px, G4-px, G3-pl, and G4-pl. These mineral fractions were cleaned with distilled acetone and Milli-Q water, then powdered using an agate mortar and pestle. The powdered samples were dissolved using a mixture of concentrated pure acids (HClO4, HF, and HNO3). After the sample digestion, ~10% of the solution was removed and mixed with 149Sm- and 145Nd-enriched spikes in order to determine the Sm and Nd concentrations by isotope dilution using a quadrupole ICP-MS at Tokyo Tech (X-series II, Thermo). Unlike classical approaches, we chose the 145Ndspike rather than a 150Nd-spike to enable simultaneous measurements of 145Nd/146Nd and 147Sm/149Sm ratios. The effect of isobaric interferences of molecular ions (e.g., 130Ba16O, 133Cs16O) should be evaluated. To this end, we determined the Nd and Sm concentrations in a basalt sample (JB-3) by this approach with and without chemical separation of REEs from unwanted elements using the TRU resin (Eichrom). We observed a systematic difference (0.3%) in the Sm/Nd ratios between samples with and without chemical separation, indicating that the effect of oxides was not negligible. With the chemical separation, the reproducibility of the Sm/Nd ratio was 0.17% (2σ). The remainder of the sample solution was used for highly precise Nd isotope analysis using TIMS. In this study, we developed a new chemical separation technique to isolate Nd with high purity, especially for achieving Ce/Nd and Sm/Nd ratios sufficiently low to avoid mass interferences during TIMS measurements. The dissolved sample was first passed through a cation exchange column filled with 1:1 mixture of AG50WX8 and AG50WX12 (Bio-Rad) to separate REEs from major elements. Next, Ce was removed from the rest of REEs by passing through the LN resin (Eichrom), during which Ce3+ in the sample solution (10M HNO3) was oxidized into Ce4+ using KBrO3 [7,8]. Finally, Nd was separated from Sm using the LN resin in HCl media. We achieved Ce/Nd = ~3×10-5 and Sm/Nd = ~4×10-5 with >91% Nd recovery.  The 142Nd/144Nd and 143Nd/144Nd ratios were analyzed by TIMS at Tokyo Tech (TRITON plus) with the dynamic multicollection mode. The reproducibilities of the 142Nd/144Nd and 143Nd/144Nd ratios for a standard JNdi-1 (500 ng) were 2.8 ppm and 2.7 ppm (2σ), respectively. Results and Discussion:  The 147Sm143Nd mineral isochron of NWA 7188 yields an age of 4203±970 Ma (Fig. 1). In contrast, we obtained the much older 1668.pdf

146Sm142Nd mineral isochron age of 4549+28-40 Ma when an initial solar system ratio of 146Sm/144Sm = 0.0094 at 4568 Ma was applied [5].  Our 146Sm142Nd and 147Sm143Nd ages for NWA 7188 are not concordant exceeding analytical uncertainties. Such an inconsistency in Sm-Nd ages with younger 147Sm143Nd ages was observed in samples from Eoarchean rocks from the Nuvvuagittuq greenstone belt [9], for which secondary metamorphism disturbed the 147Sm143Nd systematics significantly but did not affect the 146Sm142Nd systematics. Therefore, it is presumed that thermal metamorphism on the eucrite parent body (4-Vesta) has some effects on the 147Sm143Nd age while the 146Sm142Nd age represents the timing of the last Sm-Nd isotopic closure. Therefore, we use the 146Sm142Nd age of NWA 7188 in the following discussion. The 146Sm142Nd age (4549+28-40 Ma) for NWA 7188 is consistent with the 147Sm143Nd age for cumulate eucrites (4546±8 Ma [4]) within analytical uncertainties. This suggests that the parent body processes associated with the last Sm-Nd isotopic closure were contemporaneous for basaltic and cumulate eucrites. Likewise, the 146Sm142Nd age of NWA 7188 is not resolvable from the metamorphic age of Agoult [6]. According to the 53Mn53Cr systematics [10], the last global Mn/Cr fractionation in the mantle of the eucrite parent body occurred at 4564.8±0.9 Ma, the timing when basaltic magmas have formed in the mantle. We speculate that the 146Sm142Nd age for NWA 7188 represents the metamorphic age which postdate the formation of the crust of the eucrite parent body. This implies that basaltic eucrites quenched rapidly on the surface of eucrite parent body, but thermal metamorphism may have affected both Sm-Nd and U-Pb systematics.  No apparent age difference between basaltic and cumulate eucrites implies that both types of eucrites might have experienced similar cooling history as opposed to their petrographic distinction, or more likely that the time difference is too subtle to be resolved by the 146Sm142Nd system.
