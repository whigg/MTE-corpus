Background: The craters seen within planetary surfaces are formed by impact of bolides which results in the fragmentation of the crust in the vicinity of the impact zone. These fragments get ejected and finally fall as debris forming a thick layer, popularly known as the ejecta blanket surrounding the crater. The thickness of the blanket generally decreases radially outwards as one moves away from the crater rim [1]. It is observed that such ejecta blankets assume different shapes and sizes bearing a relation with the mean diameter of the crater, which it engulfs. The shape of such a blanket is generally symmetrical in geometry, whose ellipticity is controlled by the direction of the bolide impact [1]. The larger the area of the ejecta blanket, more vigorous is the impact; implying that the area of the ejecta blanket is a reflection of the mechanical energy transmitted due to the impact process [1]. The age of planetary surfaces is determined by several methods of which crater count method [2] is the most popular one. The method is based on the frequency of the crater counts of different sizes and assumes that the diameters of impacting bolides have reduced in size with time. Therefore, in an area having craters of different sizes, predominance of smaller craters would significantly reduce the age of the terrane. It may so happen that in case of a meteor shower craters of different sizes are actually formed almost at the same time. Hence blind dependence on size count may actually lead to an underestimated age of the terrane by such a method. Our present work on the shape analysis of crater ejecta blankets is aimed to decipher such possible occurrences of meteor showers giving rise to numerous craters with a wide variation of crater size distribution but of same time frame. Analysis of Crater Ejecta Blankets: For the purpose of this study,  an area of approximately 157500 square km within Icaria Planum of southern hemisphere of Mars, between 110˚W, 39˚S to 101˚W, 48˚S (Fig. 1) is chosen. The area has thousands of primary and secondary craters, with diameters ranging from 100 m to 55km, some of which show a very prominent ejecta blanket. Results of analysis of 16 primary craters having diameter of 0.47 km to 17.2km are presented. High resolution images like HRSC (~10 m/pixel) [3] and CTX (~6 m/pixel) [4] are used for the study with the aid of JMARS 3.0 software [5] for easy access to these images. The availability of these high resolution images of this area helps us to identify the craters and ejecta boundary clearly.   Figure 1: MOLA shaded relief [6] showing the extent of area of study. Studied craters are marked with white points.  Care was taken that the ejecta blankets considered for the present study do not overlap with blankets of adjacent craters (Fig. 2). We observed that the shape of all the ejecta deposits are elliptical, the long axis of which have a more or less similar orientation. The crater rim and margins of ejecta blankets for individual craters are traced for calculation of crater diameter (CD), long and short axis of ejecta blanket (Fig. 2).  As  Figure 2: CTX [4] image of one crater (cr. no. 16) showing ejecta blanket and crater rim outline.  the spread of ejecta blanket varies, we have measured the directions of the maximum (EBLA) and minimum (EBSA) diameters of them.

crater-area (CA), ejecta-blanket area (EBA), ellipticity of the ejecta blanket (EBE), vector mean of the longer axis of the ejecta blanket ellipse and the ejecta mobility (EM) ratio [7] were calculated. The data sets measured and calculated are displayed in Tables 1 and 2. The distribution of the long dimension of the ejecta blanket ellipses vary from 273˚ to 305˚ (Table 1)  with only one crater#9 being an outlier. The vector mean of the population is 286˚, implying that the ejecta of these craters probably were results of bolide impacts from a particular direction.

The unit of measurement is km. Cr-Crater.  The variation in the size range of the craters indicate the variation in the size of the original bolides. These two information lead us to believe that the area experienced multiple sized bolide impact at almost same time and from same direction: opening up a possibility of a meteor shower scenario. The EM for the different craters calculated varies from 1.85 to 2.90 (Table 2). EM shows a cluster and bears a positive relation with EBE when plotted together (Fig. 3). The little variation in the EM values across craters of different sizes within the area also attests to the grouping of the bolides into a similar time frame prior to impact.  Figure 3: Plot of Ejecta Mobility vs. Ejecta Blanket Ellipticity. We therefore, conclude that our study has revealed the following: a) A simple analysis of the shape of the crater ejecta blanket and associated parameters can lead us to identify craters produced at approximately the same time. b) As a corollary to the above fact, such an analysis gives us a handle to identify episodes of meteor showers on planetary crusts. c) Such analysis also helps us in careful selection of craters while using the crater count technique for age determination of planetary terranes.
