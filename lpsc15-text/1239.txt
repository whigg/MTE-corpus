Ovsak, Main Astronomical Observatory of the NAS of Ukraine, Zabolotnoho Street 27, Kyiv, 03680, ovsak@mao.kiev.ua.   Introduction:  In a note [7] was been shown the structure of cloud layers in the upper atmosphere of Jupiter obtained from the analysis of spectrophotometric observations of the planetary disk in 1993 in the absorption bands of methane in the 887, 864 and 727 nm [1]. To do this, the dependencies on the pressure of the values of aerosol a eff  and gaseous g eff  scattering components of the effective optical depth of the Jovian atmosphere (the values of a eff  was been reduced to the wavelength of 887.2 nm) was been calculated and then the dependencies of the relative concentration of the aerosol g eff aeff  /  were been analyzed. The both values of  a eff  and g eff  reflect the average characteristics on the line of view of the gas-aerosol environment from its top edge to the inspected level of the atmosphere. It is obvious that the concentration of aerosol particles and gas molecules both affect the value of g eff aeff  / . On the other hand, it is known, that the scattering properties of aerosol in the unit volume of environment at a pressure P  characterizes the volume scattering coefficient of aerosol )(Pa . And the altitude variation of this value accurately conveys the characteristics of the vertical structure of aerosol layers, allowing you to determine their position, length and density ratio. Therefore, in this paper we solved the problem of obtaining of the dependence of )(Pa . This value is determined by the expression:                        , h   aeff a   (1) where a eff  - change of the aerosol scattering component with changing altitude in the atmosphere h . For the adiabatic  properties of the medium:                   ),()/ln( h 1 igii PHPP    (2) where 1iP  and iP  the pressure at the respective heights, and )( ig PH  - the scale height, determined from the expression:                       ,)( gPTR PH ig   (3) where R - universal gas constant,  PT  - temperature at pressure 2/)( 1 ii PPP ,   - average molecular weight, determined  by the chemical composition of the atmosphere, g  - acceleration due to gravity of the planet. The method of determining the dependence on the pressure of the aerosol scattering component )(Paeff  and the relative concentration of aerosol )(/)( PP geff aeff  , which was used in [7] and [9], has been supplemented in this paper by the following operations: 1. The calculated values of the pairs of values P )(Paeff  for the long-wave and short-wave wings of each methane absorption band was been united in a common array and was been sorted for ascending pressure values.   2. Using the method of moving average, derived from the data in paragraph 1 it was been formed an array of values, which are calculated by interpolating an array of pairs of values P - )(PaInteff  with a constant step change in pressure P . 3. According to the expressions (1), (2), (3) and with using the array P - )(PaInteff  from the paragraph 2 and the dependence of )(PT , the dependence on the pressure of the aerosol volume scattering coefficient )(Pa  has been calculated. Then, using the moving average method, we averaged them, build graphical dependencies and perform their analysis. For calculations we use the special software codes [6, 8] and the program codes made by M.I.Mishchenko http://www.giss.nasa.gov/staff/mmishchenko/ftpcode/spher.f. As well as in the [7], the following parameters for the simulated gas-aerosol environment was been taken by us: -  the value of the real part of the refractive index rn 1.36 and the parameters of the modified gammafunction of particle size distribution effr  0.4 m  and  effv 0.35, obtained from the analysis of polarization observations of the equatorial region of Jupiter in the model of spherical particles [3, 4]; - relative concentration of methane   0,0021 [10]; - relative concentration of the main components of the planet's atmosphere gases hydrogen and helium were taken respectively 0.85 and 0.15;   http://www.giss.nasa.gov/staff/mmishchenko/ftpcode/spher.f - monochromatic absorption coefficients of methane k , which are correspond to the temperature profile of the Jovian atmosphere, they are taken from [5]; - the dependence of temperature on the pressure in the atmosphere of Jupiter has been obtained by combining the results of papers [2] and [11]. Results: Figure 1 combines the result of calculations the dependencies on the pressure in the atmosphere of Jupiter for the volume scattering coefficient of aerosol in the methane absorption bands on the 887, 864 and 727 nm, according to observations in 1993.       a  , 1cm        P, bar Figure 1. The dependence on the pressure (logarithmic scale) of the aerosol volume scattering coefficient in the methane absorption bands in the atmosphere of Jupiter for observations in 1993.  The results of processing a data of the band  on the 887 nm (see. Fig. 2) clearly manifested four cloud layers with gaps between them at pressure levels of about 0.35, 0.52 and 0.81 bar (indicated by arrows). The maximum rate of )(Pa  reached in the fourth layer in the pressure range of 1.0 - 1.2 bar.  The data processing in the bands on the 864 and 727 nm (see. Fig. 3) revealed a coincidence the height position of 3 and 4 of cloud layers with the results for the band 887 nm. After a rapid decrease of the values )(Pa  in the pressure range 1.5 - 4.0 bar, you can see the lowest values of the coefficient at the levels of the atmosphere in the pressure range of 4 - 12 bar Deeply in the atmosphere in the pressure range 13 - 20 bar, in the band 727 nm, the aerosol layer with a stretched maximum centered on the pressure of about 16 bar was been found.
