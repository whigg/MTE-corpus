Introduction:  In this study we analyze the highest confidence simultaneous measurements of relative humidity and ground temperature to identify potential frost events at the surface of Gale Crater during the first 800 sols of the MSL mission. We find that the most likely surface frost events occurred at Dingo Gap Dune during sols 530-535, at an unnamed terrain between Kylie and Kimberley during sols 555-560, and at Kimberley during sols 610-615. In all cases, the identified events occurred between 4 and 6 am. An order-of-magnitude estimate for the thickness of the frost layer indicates that it is below the order of micrometers. Additionally, we analyze the relation between relative humidity and ground temperature to calculate the soil water content accounted for by adsorbed water in equilibrium with the atmosphere along the rover’s traverse. Data:  We have only used REMS relative humidity (RH) and ground temperature (Tg) measurements [1,2] that satisfy the following conditions: (1) RH measurements are obtained during the first three seconds after which the sensor has been turned off for more than 30 minutes to avoid spurious effects due to heating, (2) Tg measurements with the highest confidence are averaged over an interval of 5 minutes centered at the simultaneous RH measurement with a minimum of 30 Tg data points to reduce the uncertainty. Both sets of values are shown in Fig. 1. Sub-micrometer-thick frost events at Dingo Gap and Kimberley?: We calculate the frost point (Tf) using simultaneous values of RH and Tg shown in Fig. 1. Then, we identify the most likely frost events by obtaining the times at which the pair of values Tg and Tf satisfy the next two conditions: (1) Tg < Tf and (2) the function Y = (Tf - Tg)/(ΔTf + σTg) is maximized. Here, ΔTf  stands for the uncertainty in the frost point, while σTg stands for the standard deviation of Tg. Following this procedure, the most likely surface frost events occurred at Dingo Gap Dune during sols 530535, at an unnamed terrain between Kylie and Kimberley during sols 555-560, and at Kimberley during sols 610-615, as shown in Fig. 2.  Soil Water Content at Gale in Equilibrium with the Atmosphere: We calculate the soil water content (SWC) accounted for by adsorbed water in equilibrium with the atmosphere by applying the BET theory [4] to REMS values of RH and Tg. We only use RH values between 0 and 30 % (see Fig. 1), which correspond to the range in which the BET theory can be applied with the highest confidence. In addition to RH and Tg values, the surface specific area (A) and enthalpy of adsorption of the soil to which water vapor molecules adhere need to be known. We take these values from [4]. Fig. 3 shows the SWC along the rover’s traverse for three different types of materials: JSC Mars-1 (A = 106 m2/g), Smectite SWy-2 (A = 52.5 m2/g) and Dunite (A = 2.83 m2/g). Independent estimations of SWC by DAN [5] show average daily values of about 2 wt%, which is consistent with specific surface areas > ~10 m2/g.  References: [1] Harri, A‐M., et al.

(Bottom) Diurnal evolution of the ground temperature and frost point for the sols during which the surface frost events are most likely. The ground temperature falls below the frost point during a few hours on each sol. An upper limit order-of-magnitude estimation indicates that the thickness of the frost layer formed is below the order of micrometers. The rate of increase of the thickness of the frost layer formed by freezing is calculated using the thermal velocity of water vapor molecules and the number density of water vapor molecules [3].

SWC values are calculated by applying the BET theory to REMS RH and Tg measurements and by considering experimentally determined values of the specific surface area and enthalpy of adsorption [4]. 2277.pdf
