SUPERNOVA SHOCK TRIGGERING AND RADIOISOTOPE INJECTION INTO THEPRESOLAR CLOUD: EFFECTS OF ROTATIONAL AXIS ORIENTATION. Alan P. Boss &Sandra A. Keiser, DTM, Carnegie Institution (boss@dtm.ciw.edu).Radio and sub-millimeter observations of theType II supernova (SNe) remnant (SNR) W44 andits interaction with the W44 giant molecular cloudcomplex imply the presence of dense clumps of molecular gas that have been struck and compressed tosizes much less than 0.3 pc by the SNR shock front,with shock speeds of 20 to 30 km s−1 [1,2]. HSTimages of the Cygnus Loop Type II SNR revealshock front thicknesses of order 2×10−4 pc [3]. Detailed 2D [4] and 3D [5-7] hydrodynamical modelsof shock waves with these speeds and thicknesseshave demonstrated the viability of triggered collapse of dense cloud cores with simultaneous injection of shock front material into the resulting collapsing protostar and protoplanetary disk. Giventhe problems with AGB and WR star winds [4], aSNR shock appears to be the leading contender forachieving simultaneous triggering and injection ofsupernova-derived short-lived radioisotopes (SLRIs,e.g., 60Fe and 26Al) into the presolar cloud and theresulting solar nebula [8].Evidence for live 60Fe during the formation ofrefractory inclusions and chondrites has waxed andwaned in recent years. Data on ferromagnesianchondrules from two ordinary chondrites (OC) implied initial 60Fe/56Fe ratios of ∼ 5− 10× 10−7 [9],whereas bulk sample data from a wide range of meteorites suggested an initial ratio of ∼ 1.15× 10−8[10]. A combined study of 60Fe and 26Al in chondrules from unequilibrated OC (UOC) implied aninitial 60Fe/56Fe ratio of ∼ 7 × 10−7 [11] and supported a SNe as the source of the SLRIs. Analysesof other chondrules from UOC yielded ratios in therange of ∼ 2−8×10−7 [12]. While there is as yet noexplanation for the discrepancy between bulk samples and chondrule fragments [12], a SNe remainsas a plausible source for the SLRIs. Indeed, evidence for possible live 135Cs in CAIs suggests itsorigin in a Type II SNe (or its WR progenitor) closeto the presolar cloud [13]. Furthermore, the evidence for live 10Be in FUN-CAIs appears consistentwith 10Be formation in the presolar molecular cloudby galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) emitted by a SNRthat thereafter triggered the collapse of the presolar cloud core [14]. Statistical analysis of the SLRIenrichments expected for disks and cloud cores inclusters containing massive stars showed that cloudcores receive a larger dose on average than disks[15], favoring the presolar cloud scenario [8] overinjection into a previously formed solar nebula [16].Given this strong support for the triggering andinjection hypothesis for the origin of the SLRIs, wecontinue to calculate increasingly detailed modelsof the hydrodynamics of the shock-cloud interactions, in order to further understand the physics ofthe process. Our previous work in both 2D [4] and3D [6] considered rotating presolar clouds, capableof collapsing to form protostellar disks. Becauseof symmetry constraints in 2D, these models assumed that the cloud rotation axis was parallel tothe direction of shock wave propagation. For easeof comparison, our first 3D rotating cloud models[6] made this same assumption. Here we presentthe results of a set of 3D models identical to previous rotating cloud models, but with the rotationaxis perpendicular to the shock front direction. Westart with 2.2 M⊙ cores with radii of 0.053 pc, rotating at either Ω = 10−14 or 10−13 rad s−1. Shockspeeds are vs = 20 or 40 km s−1, shock widths are3×10−4 pc, and shock densities (ρs) are 7.2×10−18g cm−3. The figures show the results for these fourmodels, denoted by their vs and Ω values. Central protostars and disks form in all models, thoughwith disk spin axes deflected considerably. Injection efficiencies, fi, defined as the fraction of theincident shock wave material injected into the collapsing cloud core, are ∼ 0.03 in these models, asbefore [5,6]. Evidently altering the rotation axisorientation has only a minor effect on the outcome.References: [1] Sashida, T., et al. (2013), ApJ,774, 10. [2] Reach, W. T., et al. (2005), ApJ, 618,297.
