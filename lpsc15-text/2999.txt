Introduction:  Evidence of magmatic activity on Mars is abundant and has been occurring from the Noachian period to geologically recent years [1]. Many features also exist on the surface that indicate this magmatic activity interacted with water in both its liquid and solid forms [e.g.1-3]. Out of the fire and ice, hydrothermal systems are born that circulate chemicals, fluids and heat. The combination of water, heat and energy make for ideal habitable zones. As well, on Earth, mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal systems have been suggested as a possible location for the first terrestrial life [4].   Investigations of Martian magma-hydrothermal-ice interactions and their effects on surface morphology have occurred, although in limited quantity [e.g.5,6] and often only invoking heat transfer through conduction. As a magma intrusion grows, it will begin to convect within itself, which will increase the rate of heat transfer to the surrounding water and ice. We focus here on a surface feature, Aromatum Chaos, that has been suggested to have formed from a magmatic sill intrusion melting overlying ice and causing the release of water from a confined aquifer [5].  Aromatum Chaos, a depression at the head of the Ravi Vallis outflow channel system, is located in Xanthe Terra at about 1.1°S, 317.0°E (U.S. Geological Survey, Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature) and covers an area about 30 km x 90 km (Figure 1 – black box).   Figure 1. Modified THEMIS infrared image of Aromatum Chaos depression (approximately within black box) with Ravi Vallis outflow channels flowing NE (NASA/JPL-Caltech/Arizona State University) The previous model by [5] suggested the need for an additional source of water outside the 30km x 90km aquifer suggested beneath the Aromatum Chaos depression. We model the water movement as a hydrothermal system driven by a dike intrusion(s) and consider convection within the system to enable increased heat transfer and water transport.  Methods: To determine the amount of ice melt and subsequent fluid flow through dike-driven hydrothermal system at Aromatum Chaos, we model the system as shown below in Figure 2 using boundary layer theory, as described by [7] and previously applied by [6] at Athabasca Valles. We build on the previous work by also considering convection in an overlying permafrost melt layer through a scale analysis. Our models attempt to determine if such a system could bring adequate water to the surface to form the Ravi Vallis outflow channels.  A dike of about 1200°C heats the system from the side, causing a wall temperature of about 600°C between the magma and 4°C water saturated permeable ground, and induces fluid circulation [8]. Dike thicknesses of 10 to 100 m are considered and their conductive heat transfer limits the lifetime of the system. Dike heights range from 1 to 10 km. Lengths of the dikes follow the size of the chaos depression and range from 30 to 90 km. A 1- 3 km thick layer of permafrost overlies the system. Values of 10-14 to 10-11 m2 are analyzed to consider a range of possible permeabilities.  Figure 2. Dike-driven hydrothermal system beneath Aromatum Chaos, where the boundary layer, δ, signifies the zone within which the water temperature and fluid flow rates increase in the Martian crust.  Heat transferred from the dike induces flow and increases fluid temperatures within a region adjacent to the dike called the boundary layer, δ.  The circulating water reaches the top of the dike, turns beneath the ice layer and transfers heat by conduction to the base of the ice. Over time the ice melts, the melt layer thickens and at a certain thickness the water begins to convect. Once melted through, the circulating water can flow out to the surface and form the observed features at Aromatum Chaos and Ravi Vallis.

solution and so estimates upper end heat and fluid mass flux since the progressive cooling of the magma intrusion over its lifetime is not considered. The boundary layer calculations provide temperatures and water transport velocities that are used to calculate the total energy transferred to the overlying ice layer, Qice = ρwcp,w T v δτ i , where ρw is the density of water, cp,w is the specific heat of water, <T> is the average temperature across the vertical boundary layer of thickness  δ, <v> is the average velocity across the boundary layer and τi, is the time the heat is transferred for. Assuming a constant porosity, ϕ, a horizontal dimension, l , of the horizontal boundary layer, and a thickness of the melt layer, h, and that the permafrost layer is at the melt temperature of ice, the heat taken up by the ice per length is written as Qm = φρiLh(t)l τ i( ) , where ρi is the density of ice, L is the latent heat of fusion of ice. Setting Qice = Qm the melt layer thickness, h, can be shown to grow as: h(t) = τ iρwcp,w T v δφρiLl                        (1) The temperature distribution across the melt layer can be calculated as: T y( ) = q λp h(t)− y( )                         (2) where T(y) is the temperature at vertical position, y, q is the heat flux across the base of the permafrost layer, q =ρwvTcp,w dx0δ∫l, and λp is the thermal conductivity of the permafrost. The temperature at the melt-layer – permafrost interface is 0 (i.e. at y=h, T=0), and the temperature at the melt-layer base will increase with time. Convection will begin in the melt layer once the Rayleigh number, Ra, exceeds the critical value. For a layer of permafrost that critical value is ~17 [9]: Raw =αwgKqh2λpνwa*>17                        (3) where αw is the thermal expansion coefficient of water, g is the acceleration due to gravity on Mars, K is the crustal permeability, νw is the kinematic viscosity of water, and a* is the effective diffusivity = λp/ρwcp,w. Once convection begins in the ice melt layer, the temperature difference across the layer will decrease and become more uniform. Any previous high temperature rock alterations in the layer may then have low temperatures superimposed on them (Figure 3). Results:  For the range of permeabilities and dike parameters we calculated the following ice melt layer thicknesses, h, at the onset of convection and water flow volume provided by the system over the conductive life of the dike (Table 1):  Table 1. Results  and also determined temperatures range fairly linearly from about 250°C at the base to 0 at the top of the melt layer for a 1 km tall dike, K=10-13 m2 and for a 10 km tall dike, K=10-14 m2, indicating high temperature rock alteration will occur primarily near the base of the permafrost layer and will then be overprinted with lower T alterations. Volume out results show that only a fairly high 10-11 m2 permeability with a 10 km tall dike can supply water in the suggested range of 10,500 – 16,500 km3 [5] needed to carve Ravi Vallis. These results are approximate, however, as permafrost will begin to melt and the dike will begin to cool before the steady state boundary layer is established. Further analysis through numerical modeling will greatly improve the accuracy of ice melt quantity calculations over the system lifetime and temperature regime evolution. In future work, we will apply these more accurate temperature regimes to determine rock alterations that would occur within the melt layer before and during convection. We will then analyze the alterations to determine areas conducive to biosignature preservation and habitability.  References: [1]Hamilton et al. (2011), JGR 116, E3. [2]Milazzo et al.
