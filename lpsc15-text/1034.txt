TOWARDS  AUTOMATIC  EXPLORATORY  MINERALOGICAL  MAPPING  OF  CRISM  IMAGERYUSING SUMMARY PRODUCT SIGNATURES.  E. J. Allender1 and T. F. Stepinski1,  1Space Informatics Lab,University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, 45221-0131, allendej@mail.uc.edu.Introduction:  Hyperspectral images taken by theCompact  Reconnaissance  Imaging  Spectrometer  forMars  (CRISM)  are  currently  the  best  source  ofinformation  on  the  mineralogy  of  Martian  surfaces.When  combined  with  high  resolution  panchromaticimages  and/or  HiRISE-derived  digital  elevationmodels they provide the most complete information onpast and present processes shaping the Martian surface.In  particular,  they  have  provided  and  continue  toprovide insight on the history of  water  on Mars [1].However, working with CRISM images is challengingdue to the sheer volume of data a hyperspectral imagecontains.We  are  developing  a  novel  method  forunsupervised  mineralogical  mapping  of  CRISMimagery  which  can  process  multiple  imagesautomatically using a single  processing pipeline.  Weenvision  this  method  as  an  exploratory  tool  which,when  applied  to  a  large  collection  of  images,  willautomatically  map  potential  locations  of  rare  andinteresting  mineral  deposits  in  each  image  withoutinput from an analyst.  The purpose is  to comb largearchives  of  CRISM  images,  inspect  them  for  theexistence  of  interesting  deposits,  flag  these  depositsand their 'interesting' components, and return annotatedmineralogical maps of the images for manual, in-depthanalysis. To  achieve  this  functionality  we  integrated  twocore  novel  technologies.  First,  instead  of  using  aspectral function or a triplet of summary products as iscurrently standard  [2], we use vectors of all  popularsummary  products  as  the  spectral  signature  of  animage.  This  representation  does  not  restrict  whichminerals  can  be  identified  while  at  the  same  timeoffering  instant  interpretation  of  the  content  ofidentified  deposits.  Second,  we  use  the  rare  classdiscovery  algorithm  DEMUD  [3] to  identifymineralogical  classes  in  each  image.  This  has  theadvantage  of  identifying  mineralogical  “outliers,”deposits  that  stand  out  from  the  scientificallyuninteresting background. Data:  We test the feasibility of our method using20  previously  manually  studied  FRT  images[1,4,5,6,7,8] downloaded from the PDS Mars OrbitalData  Explorer.  They  cover  a  range  of  featuresincluding  mounds,  volcanoes,  gullies  and  stratifieddeposits. Method:  The processing pipeline for our methodhas four main components: (1) image input and preprocessing, (2) image normalization and segmentation,(3)  clustering  with  DEMUD,  and  (4)  mapping  andvalidation.  The  pipeline  is  implemented  in  the  bashenvironment, and calls scripts enabling functionality inENVI  IDL,  GRASS,  R  and  C  throughout  eachprocessing stage.Image input and pre-processing:  Batch processingis used to complete this step for the set of images withmaximum efficiency. The pipeline makes use of ENVICAT procedures  within  IDL to  perform photometricand atmospheric correction with artifact removal, andgenerate  hyperspectral  and  multispectral  summaryproducts. Image normalization and segmentation: Summaryproducts are read into the R environment where theyare  treated  as  raster  maps  in  which  each  pixelcontained  a  vector  of  summary  product  values.  Therange of each vector component is normalized to therange  between  0-1  so  that  the  degree  of  similaritybetween summary product signatures can be assessed –in this way, whether band depth or reflectance based,each component of the signature vector contributes thesame  weight  to  the  calculation.  A  graph-basedsegmentation algorithm [9]  is  used  to  (over)segmenteach  raster  in  order  to  reduce  data  volume  and  toreduce  noise  through  spatial  smoothing.  Remainingcalculations  are  performed  on  resulting  segmentscalled superpixels.Clustering  with  DEMUD: The  superpixels  areinput into the rare-class detection algorithm DEMUD(with k=2 preserved eigenvectors) implemented in R.DEMUD is an iterative algorithm designed to identifya  number  of  superpixels  which  are  as  dissimilar  aspossible  from  each  other  and  from  the  rest  of  thesuperpixels.  Thus, the first  several  iterations identifysuperpixels  representing  different  interestingmineralogical deposits.  In order to estimate how manymineral classes are present within an image we use thevalue  of  the  reconstruction  error  (Rx)  between  theDEMUD  model  at  a  given  iteration  and  eachobservation; the larger the Rx value, the more uniquethe  mineralogical  deposit  identified  in  this  iteration(Figure 1). The superpixels selected with values of Rxabove  a  threshold  are  chosen  as  representatives  of‘interesting’  mineral  classes  within  an  image.  Thisselection is one of the two elements of computationalpipeline that is still performed manually in the presentversion  of  our  software.  The  Nearest  Neighboralgorithm is used to assign all superpixels (and thus the1034.pdf

pixels in an image) a mineralogical class on the basisof  minimum  Euclidean  distance  to  representativesuperpixels.  Superpixels  too  distant  from  allrepresentatives are left unclassified. Mapping  and  interpretation:   Resultant  maps  ofmineralogical  classes  are  automatically  produced.Along with each map, the pipeline produces a series ofgraphs  detailing  the  difference  between  each  classsignature and the mean signature of the image – whichis considered the 'background' signature. These graphsare used to make an interpretation of each class. Thisinterpretation is the second element of pipeline that iscurrently  performed  manually  (although  it  is  ratherstraightforward);  future  work  will  automate  the  twomanual elements of the present implementation.Results: In the majority of the 20 surveyed imagesthe mineralogical classes discovered automatically byour method correspond to deposits found by means ofmanual analysis. In some cases, such as images from[4], the  striping  noise  was  too  great  for  meaningfulclasses to be discovered.  In images with a lower levelof  noise,  for  example  those  from [5,6],  our  methoddiscovered  the  presence  of  additional  mineralogicalclasses not found using the traditional tricolor browseproducts.Conclusion: Application of our method to a smallsurvey of 20 previously manually studied FRT imagesreveals that our concept of using the combination ofthe summary product  signature representation formatwith the DEMUD rare-class detection algorithm worksas expected and offers a feasible way to conduct largerexploratory surveys of CRISM images.  Improved preprocessing  and  noise  reduction  procedures  will  berequired for  our method is  to  be  applied to  a  largerrange of  images.  Algorithms for  the selection of  thenumber of classes and for their interpretation need tobe  implemented  in  order  to  make  our  method  fullyautomatic.
