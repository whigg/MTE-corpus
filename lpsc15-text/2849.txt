Ocean crust has existed through much of Earth's history and has been exposed to a range of chemical and thermal conditions that overlap those found today on Earth and proposed on Mars. While significant advances have been made in understanding microbial life in deep sediments over the last decade, a lack of data about the nature, extent and consequence of a biosphere hosted in deep oceanic crust persists- a larger potential habitat for life on Earth than sediments. To date, information about deep crustal communities has derived mainly from studies at Juan de Fuca (JdF) Ridge [1-4], Costa Rica Rift flank [5] and Atlantis Massif [6]. However, the study presented here represents the first to directly sample and identify metabolically active microbial populations within subsurface crustal material. Understanding how life developed to occupy and survive in this basaltdominated crustal biome will help answer fundamental questions about evolution and persistence of microbial communities on Earth and Mars. Life in pre-oxygenic photosynthetic environments is theoretically linked to lithospheric interactions with iron being the principle redox active element  [reviewed in 7]. High concentrations of iron are common in terrestrial planets [8] with basalt being the dominant rock type on Earth and Mars [9]. Basalt contains redox active iron and additional metals available as energy sources for microbial populations [10]. Basalt has been shown to geochemically oxidize over millions of years, thus remaining biologically redox active [11]. Basalt is also porous allowing fluid exchange and providing single-celled life with dissolved metabolites and nutrients required for cell maintenance and growth [12-14].  Microbial populations can remain metabolically active over geologic time scales by recycling carbon and nutrients through combined biological and chemical processes [15-16]. Subsurface populations have been physically isolated from surface communities for potentially millions of years [17]. Isolation and energy limitation to near minimum levels required to maintain cell metabolism [18] have the potential to promote evolution of novel lineages with unique molecular mechanisms. Characterization of the metabolically active populations provides a better understanding of the lineages and metabolic processes within the crustal biosphere and helps determine strategies for detection of modern exo-populations. The objective of this study was to provide the first characterization of metabolically active microbial populations within multiple subsurface crustral samples. Drilling during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 336 provided basalt samples from 144-219 meters below seafloor. Samples were collected using standard biological sampling protocols to prevent operational contamination. Total RNA was extracted following methods described in Mills et al. [19]. The targeted 16S rRNA V1-V3 region was sequenced using 454 pyrosequencing and analyzed following a standard Mills Lab work flow [19]. Based on this objective and these methods, the hypothesis was that multiple active communities would be detected with differences between them related to the crustral substrate where they were sampled.

 Results and Discussion: Basalt samples were selected from two different IODP expedition 336 drill sites within the 'North Pond' sediment pond feature at about 22oN on the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge [20]. Descriptions of each sample were recorded shipboard and then visually confirmed prior to RNA extraction (Table 1). The samples from drill site 1382 were aphyric with glassy margins (7R-2B) and a sedimentary breccia with basalt clasts and a rust color (8R4D). The site 1383 samples included two highly altered phyric basalts (10R-1B and 11R-1B) and a basalt glass with rust alterations (20R-1A). Each sample passed drilling contamination quality controls standard for microbial analysis. RNA was extracted and sequenced from each sample, with controls sequenced for the extraction and reverse transcription protocols. Sequencing efforts produced 2539 sequences; with each sample library containing 124 to 1323 sequences (Table 1) phylogenetically related to 4 to 10 phyla (Figure 1). These lineages were not observed in either of the control samples, thus represent metabolically active populations only found within the crustal material. Analysis of these lineages suggests both anaerobic and aerobic metabolisms with populations capable of utilizing the available carbonate present within the basalt samples. Additional characteristics suggest metabolisms capable of taking advantage of substrates within the basalt. This analysis will support further targeted approaches for enhanced molecular characterizations and culture-based analysis to enhance understanding of the metabolic processes and potential biomarkers available for detection of life within basalts on Earth and potentially in the Martian subsurface.
