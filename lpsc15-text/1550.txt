GEOLOGIC MAP OF WEST CANDOR CHASMA, MARS: A PROGRESS REPORT.    B. K. Lucchitta, U. S. Geological Survey,  Astrogeology Science Center,  Flagstaff AZ 86001, blucchitta@usgs.gov.         Introduction: West Candor Chasma contains a shallow, asymmetrical dome called Ceti Mensa, which stands 2 to 5 km above the surrounding lowlands.  Both the dome and the surrounding floor are underlain by Interior Layered Deposits (ILD), except for massive landslide materials along the north wall of the trough. Even though the geology of the chasma has attracted the attention of many investigators [e.g. 1-5], a comprehensive overview in the form of a geological map has not yet been done.  Such a map, covering the entire interior of the trough, is the subject of this report. For this purpose, all available images were assembled in a Geographic Information System (GIS) model, using Arcmap 10. The final map draft is currently being compiled at 1:250,000 scale, using Mars Express High Resolution Stereoscopic Camera (HRSC) images as a base. A simplified sketch map showing only major units is given in Fig. 1.       Stratigraphy:  Ceti Mensa (orange outline on map) is constructed of three major stratigraphic groups, separated from each other by discontinuities and unconformities.  From the bottom up the groups are (1) a mensa-core group (brown colors on map), mostly exposed in the large erosional and structural reentrants cut into the highest part of the mensa at its southeast and northwest sides, (2) a rim-rock group (blue and purple colors on map), displaying conspicuous ledges on the upper rim of the reentrants and extending over much of Ceti Mensa and the adjacent lowlands, and (3) a cap-rock group (green colors on map), characterized variously by rocks displaying ledges, scallops, or flutes (yardangs) of erosional origin, and resting unconformably on all other units.  This group occurs mostly on the southern side of the mensa and locally in the surrounding lowlands.  In addition, large landslides from the trough walls (yellow color on map) occupy much of the northern lowlands and smaller areas in the south.  Two landslides are on Ceti Mensa.  Fragmented layers forming breccias are common in the ILD in the lowlands, especially along the trough walls (red color on map). Stratigraphic highlights:  The mensa-core group is generally light toned and has pink to light ochre hues in HRSC color data [6] (mensa core, mc).  Most notable is the spectral signature of kieserite [1,2]  The unit looks massive on most images, but in high resolution it shows regularly bedded, fine, fairly uniform, faceted layers.  Broad folds are common.  Its thickness is unknown because the base is not exposed.  Near the top, a more conspicuously layered unit occurs in a few places (layered mensa core, ml).  It has no kieserite signature.  The rim-rock group is on the order of 500 m thick and its layers largely conform to the slope of the Ceti Mensa dome.  Prominent  layers within the unit slope about 5° to the north, as much as 10° to the south, and about 3° to the west (from Mars Express DEM).  Some resistant layers are discontinuous; they pinch out or undergo facies changes.  The lower layers in this group (layered, la) are generally evenly bedded, except for some soft-sediment deformation.  The upper layers (layered and knobby, lk) tend to be more contorted.  They extend all the way from near the top of Ceti Mensa (3500 m elevation) into the western and southwestern lowlands, where the layers lap up onto the trough walls at elevations that are 1500-3000 m lower than those near the top.  In the lowlands, the unit becomes punctuated by numerous knobs. On the western mensa slopes, the unit has a structural discontinuity at its base. The uppermost unit (resistant layer, lr) is rugged with a bumpy surface characterized by dunes and periodic bedrock ridges [7]. This unit breaks up into large fragments where it becomes incorporated in the landslide extending to the northeast. On Ceti Mensa, the caprock group has an eastern unit displaying prominent ledges along its erosional margins (cap ledgy, cle), a western unit marked by extensive fluting (yardangs), reflecting erosion by wind (cap mensa fluted, cmf) and an upper unit dissected into scallops and knobs (knobby unit of Okubo [8] (cap scalloped, csc).  The outcrop pattern shows that major erosional episodes separate the different units within this group, resulting in truncated exposures and reduced areal extent.  Along the southwestern margin of the mensa the fluted unit extends into the lowlands (floor fluted, ff). Here it rests on lower layers without obvious unconformity.  The unit also occurs in the northwestern lowlands.  The wall-rock landslides (ls) impinge on the Ceti Mensa dome and are therefore younger.  However, the fluted unit (ff)  overlies the landslides, suggesting that here it is uncommonly young.  Both landslides coming off Ceti Mensa extend out over the adjacent lowlands, indicating that slide material contributed to the floor materials surrounding Ceti Mensa.  Where breccias (br) occur parallel to the walls, they may reflect the underlying trough fault line.  Where deposited against the wall, they may be due to disruption of layers on wall slopes.  Elsewhere they may have developed along the structural discontinuity between layers of the upper and lower rim-rock sequences.   Discussion: A tentative geologic history is as follows: During  initial faulting and collapse, west Candor Chasma was filled by sediments of the mensa-core group, perhaps in shallow lakes as the basin sank.

these sediments [9] creating the lowlands surrounding the mensa and causing landslides to fall off the walls.  Airfall deposits of dust, volcanic ash, and wind-blown material, perhaps mixed with ice incorporated  during obliquity variations [10] formed the rim-rock group, which draped over the remnant mensa core and the adjacent lowlands, creating the shallow dome.  Sliding within the draped units caused structural discontinuities.  After additional erosion, members of the cap-rock group were emplaced over all other units, including landslides. Further eolian erosion left only remnants of this group.                                             Figure 1:  Summary sketch map.  Black background lines are unit subdivisions not detailed on map.
