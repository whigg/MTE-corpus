Introduction: [1] Measurements made by the Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) instrument onboard the Cassini spacecraft has shown the existence of an ionosphere on both the dayside and nightside hemispheres of Titan as predicted by pre-Cassini and post-Cassini simulation models [2]. Photoionization of neutrals by solar radiation is the main source of ion production in Titan's ionosphere [3] and consequently there is a much higher ion buildup on the dayside. On the nightside electron impact ionization has been shown to be the main contributor to the ion production [4]. Cui et al [10,11] and Cravens et al [5] supported that plasma transport also contributes to the nightside ionosphere. Thermal pressure from heated sunlit atmosphere, wind shear due to collisions between ions and neutrals from lower altitudes and magnetic field pressure from Saturn's magnetospheric flow or incident solar wind can drive plasma motion. Different combinations of these forces can work together or act in opposite directions. Geological position of Titan and the orientation of the dayside hemisphere with respect to the ram direction of magnetospheric flow can determine how the ionosphere is impacted [9]. Magnetic pressure in particular is a result of the stagnation of the magnetic field lines on the ram side and an earlier study Ledvina and Cravens [6] showed the draping geometry of the field lines around Titan.  We use a time dependent approach to study ion transport mechanisms in Titan's ionosphere and to show how different species react differently to the driving forces. For the current study we adopt a horizontal transport from the dayside hemisphere to the nightside. At altitudes 1000-1400 km from the surface, long lived species (typically heavy ions) tend to move with the flow and sustain for a longer time while short lived species die out quickly. At higher altitudes around 1500 km the chemical lifetimes of the long lived species is much shorter due to the high electron densities. The horizontal divergence of the flow due to the spherical geometry showed no significant effect on the densities.  Model:  Besides photoionization and electron impact ionization ions are also produced through chemical reactions between neutrals and ions. The neutral atmosphere is mainly composed of nitrogen, methane and hydrogen [7] and by using the cross sections and reaction rates for different ions we are able to estimate a set of ion production rates at different altitudes [8]. A two-stream methodology is used to track the electrons as they moved along magnetic field lines. The continuity equation that is used for this model includes production and loss terms and spatial and temporal derivatives for about 130 ion species. In [5], transport speeds, u, at selected altitudes have been estimated based on the empirical data from Cassini observations during T5 flyby. In spherical coordinate the divergence of flow speed can also be modeled as a loss term in the continuity equation. We assumed the velocity is constant at each altitude with no vertical transport. The highest production rate happens at 0o solar zenith angle while the terminator is at 90o.     Fig. 1. Ion density distribution at different solar zenith angles for five different species at two different. Top:  1100 km, Bottom: 1500 km  Results:  Ion densities are shown as functions of solar zenith angle for short-lived species (CH5+) and longlived species (HCNH+, CH2NH2+, CH2CN+) and electrons for different flow velocities.  2014.pdf

In figure 1 at low altitudes around 1100 km (top plot) ion densities generally drop as the plasma flows toward the nightside region where the production rates are low, but long-lived species survive to the greater solar zenith angles in the nightside. This is in agreement with the empirical results from Cassini as discussed in [5,10].    Fig. 2. HCNH+ density at different solar zenith angle for different flow velocities at two altitudes. Top: 1100 km, Bottom: 1500 km  Therefore ion transport can make a contribution to ion densities at altitudes 1000 to 1400 km. At higher altitude near 1500 km some of the long-lived species do not behave as expected and disappear faster (Figure 1 bottom). This can be explained in a way that the chemical lifetimes of these ions is sensitive to the electron density. High electron density shortens the chemical lifetimes of these ions since the electron recombination is a major sink for ions and therefore at high altitudes they do not linger to the nightside. In figure 2 we show density variations of HCNH+ as it moves through the ionosphere for different flow velocities. The lower the flow speed the closer are the densities to the equilibrium state where equal production and loss is assumed. At low altitudes for high flow speeds we see higher ion densities in the nightside. Opposite of this effect can happen when the flow is from night to day. In the bottom plot of figure 2 HCNH+ densities are shown at an altitude of 1500 km. It's clear that it takes a longer time for the density to build up to equilibrium values. Even though there can be a variety of reasons for this result it should  be noted that at very high altitudes our  transport results are not accurate.  References: [1] Cravens et al. (2006), Geophys.
