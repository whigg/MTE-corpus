Introduction:  Larkman Nunatak (LAR) 12011 and 12095 are newly found Antarctic Martian meteorites from the 2012-2013 ANSMET field season [1]. LAR 12011 is composed of a fine-grained assemblage of pyroxene, olivine, and maskelynite. Olivine occurs as phenocrysts with grain sizes up to 1 mm. Olivine has brown staining probably due to shock. Pyroxene and maskelynite in the matrix are 200-400 µm in size. Olivine is Fa23-58; pyroxene exhibit a range of compositions from pigeonite to subcalcic augite (Fs24-44Wo3-27; Fe/Mn26-35); feldspar is intermediate in composition (An49-52Or3). LAR 12011 is classified as an olivinephyric shergottite and likely to be paired with LAR 06319 based on their nearly identical petrography and mineral compositions [1,2]. LAR 12095 is an olivine-phyric shergottite showing a porphyritic texture composed of olivine megacrysts (~ 3 mm) set in a fine-grained groundmass of pyroxene, maskelynite, and olivine [1,3]. Olivine has a brown staining probably due to shock.  Pyroxene and maskelynite in the matrix are finer grained, typically ∼ 0.5 mm.  Sulfides and oxides are present, as is one shock melt vein in each section. The modal abundance is estimated to be 62.5% low-Ca pyroxene, 19.5% maskelynite, 12.2% olivine, 4.1% augite, 0.9% chromite, 0.2% Fe sulfide, and 0.1% ilmenite [3]. Olivine is Fa28-42; pyroxene exhibit a range of compositions from pigeonite to subcalcic augite (Fs25-31Wo8-18; Fe/Mn27-32); feldspar is intermediate in composition (An54-64Or0-1). It is reported that LAR 12095 and LAR 12240 are possibly paired, but that they are distinct from LAR 12011 [1].  Here we present Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd isotope results for LAR 12011 and LAR 12095 and place these new data in the context of existing Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd data of shergottites with the aim of identifying similarities and potential source affinities between several shergottites. Samples and Analytical Procedures: A ~1 g aliquot of LAR 12011 and LAR 12095 were gently ultrasonicated in milli-Q water and subsequently crushed with an aluminum oxide mortar and pestle. The crushed material was sieved into various size fractions, of which the 200-325 mesh fraction was used for mineral separations via heavy liquid separation. For LAR 12011, a total of four mineral fractions were isolated: maskelynite, pyroxene, olivine, and oxide.  The pyroxene, maskelynite, and whole rock (44 µm or less) were used for this study. For LAR 12095, fine grained material (44 µm or less) was used for whole rock Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd isotope analyses. All chemical separation procedures were carried out in clean lab facilities and all isotope analyses were carried out using the Nu Plasma II MC-ICP-MS at the University of Houston.   Results and Discussions: Figure 1 shows CInormalized REE patterns for whole-rock samples of some of depleted and enriched shergottites [4-9], and CI-normalized Sm, Nd, and Lu abundances of LAR 12011 and LAR 12095. LAR 12011 has a relatively flat REE pattern with CI-normalized Nd, Sm, and Lu value of 10.2, 12.1 and 10.0 respectively. The REE abundances of LAR 12011 obtained here are higher than LAR 06319 [6]. These shergottites contain Caphosphates which is main host of REE elements. Caphosphate is easy to break down to powder in the process of crushing. Since the fraction used in this study is fine-grained (< 44 µm), it might contain higher amount of Ca-phosphate resulting higher REE abundances than LAR 06319. LAR 12095 shows a light-REE (LREE) depleted pattern (Nd 2.2 x CI) with a hump in a heavyREE (HREE) region (~4 x CI), which is similar to other depleted shergottites, suggesting that LAR 12095 is likely to be depleted shergottite. A higher REE abundance for LAR 12095 compared to some of other depleted shergottites can also be explained with the possibility of higher Ca-phosphate abundance in the finegrained whole-rock sample used in this study.

LAR12011:  The Lu and Hf isotope data are shown in Figure 2 (red ellipses: LAR 12011 studied here; black ellipses: LAR 06319 mineral fractions from [10]).

However all three points fits an isochron obtained from LAR 06319 [10].  When using pyroxene and maskelynite points the calculated age and  initial 176Hf/177Hf  are ~200 Ma and 0.282134 which are close to those of LAR 06319 (193 Ma and initial of 0.282141±10). The WR point gives anolder age (3 point isochron age ~ 295 Ma) .  It could be due to weathering either Martian and/or terrestrial.                Fig. 2.

It shows limited spread in Sm/Nd ratio as well as 143Nd/144Nd isotope ratio from three mineral fractions from this study, it therefore yields no useful age information. However all three points again fits an isochron obtained from LAR 06319 [10].                Fig. 2. Samarium-neodymium isotope data plot for LAR 12011.  Red ellipses are the data from LAR 12011.  Black ellipses are data from LAR 06319 [10].  LAR 12095: Lu-Hf analysis of LAR 12095 whole rock yielded a present-day ε176Hf = 51.1 ± 0.3 (2σ) and a measured 176Lu/177Hf = 0.0400. Sm-Nd analysis yielded a present-day ε143Nd = 47.2 ± 0.3 (2σ) and a measured 147Sm/144Nd = 04558. At present, there is no information on the crystallization age of this sample. Source Composition(s): The modeled source 176Lu/177Hf  and 147Sm/144Nd isotope ratios are calculated using crystallization age of LAR 06319 (193 ± 20 Ma [10]) assuming LAR 12011 has the same crystallization age as LAR 06319, a two-stage model assuming a differentiation age of 4.513 Ga [11] and the CHUR parameters of [12]. The decay constants used for 176Lu and 147Sm are 1.867 ×10-11a-1 [13] and 6.539 × 10-12 a-1 [14], respectively. The calculated source 176Lu/177Hf and 147Sm/144Nd isotope ratios of LAR 12011 are 0.02726 and 0.1841 respectively. Even applying crystallization age between 150-250 Ma, all of the calculated source compositions are nearly identical with other enriched shergottites [15].  Although we do not as yet have age information on LAR 12095, the closest match for the modeled source composition using crystallization age range between 400-550 Ma is Dar al Gani 476 (DaG). In fact, mineralogy and petrology of LAR 12095 is also almost identical to those of DaG [3]. When using the crystallization age of DaG, the calculated source 176Lu/177Hf and 147Sm/144Nd isotope ratios of LAR 12095 are 0.5070 and 0.2569 respectively. Those numbers are closest match to those of DaG. LAR 12095 is a depleted shergottite based on REE abundances as well as both LuHf and Sm-Nd isotopes.
