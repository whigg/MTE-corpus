POSSIBLE THERMAL STATE, COMPOSITION AND CORE SIZES OF THE MOON.  E. V. Kronrod, V.A. Kronrod and O. L. Kuskov (Vernadsky Institute of Geochemistry and Analytical Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, Kosygin Str., 19, 119991 Moscow, Russia, kendr_ka@bkl.ru).  Introduction:  Currently there is a great number of theoretical works about mantle temperature computation. The temperature of the Moon's interior structure remains one of the most controversial and indefinite physical parameters. The information on the Moon's thermal regime is extremely important. Chemical composition and thermal regime of the Moon can be estimated based on the geochemical study of lunar rocks, orbital data, and the basis of joint inversion of geophysical data (elastic wave velocities, the moment of lunar inertia, and the mass of the Moon) under certain constraints on the chemical composition [1-3]. In this work the possible lunar thermal conditions, surface heat flow values, bulk composition and radius of the lunar core are discussed. Computer simulation: For calculation of the temperature profiles and the radioactive source intensity one-dimensional stationary model of thermal conductivity has been used. We propose the following model of the Moon. It consists of the crust, the upper mantle with a heat source Qup, the lower mantle with a heat source Qlow and the core.  The depth of the crust varies from 34 km to 43 km and the density is 2580 kg/m-3 [4]. The depth of the lower boundary of the upper mantle is 750 km, the radius of the core is 350 km. The temperature at the crust-mantle boundary (350-550oC) was estimated from temperature gradient and upper mantle temperature [3]. The maximal temperature at the depth of 1250 km (1650 oC) is close to the solidus temperature at the same depth. Following constraints on the model were accepted in this study:  1. Temperature at the crust-mantle boundary (from inversion of seismic velocities to temperature): Тcr-mantle =350 - 550 оС [3]  2. Temperature gradient in the upper mantle (from seismic data inversion [5]): dT/dH ≈1.17 K/km   3. Temperature at the depth of 1250 km (from melting condition): Т1250 ≈ 1600 оС.   4. The composition of the lower (undifferentiated) mantle should be identical with the composition of overlying layers (the model of a lunar magma ocean) [1]. On the basis of geophysical constraints on the moment of inertia and mass of the Moon we used the hypothesis of chemical differentiation of the Moon as a result of partial melting (500-750 km) of initially homogeneous material (hypothetical magma ocean). Leaving aside the details, we considered models of the internal structure of the Moon, including a crust, upper mantle , middle mantle, lower mantle and a Fe-10 wt.% S-core (=5.6 g cm−3). We suggest that bulk composition of the lower mantle is equal to that of the crust+upper+middle mantle. We have estimated required parameters  from fulfill conditions mass, moment of inertia, seismic velocities, the  chemical balance and others constrains. The phase composition and the physical parameters of the mantle are calculated using the method of the Gibbs free energy minimization and the equations of state for the mantle material in the system CaO-FeOMgO-Al2O3-SiO2 [1, 2]. A Monte-Carlo inversion procedure has been used to estimate the distributions of the density, composition and velocities in the mantle and Fe-FeS core radii [2, 3]. Results: Due to the uncertainty in estimation of the uranium content in the crust (Ucrust) by different authors, it is regarded as a parameter. In the range of Ucrust = 80-240 ppb, the temperature distribution (Fig. 1), the temperature gradient (Fig. 2), the uranium content in the upper (Uupper) and lower (Ulower) mantle, and also heat flow from the Moon's surface (JMoon) were calculated.  The magma ocean depth is 750 km (a sharp seismic velocity increase in seismic models [1]), the crust density =2550 kg/m3, probable temperature of the crust-mantle boundary Tcr-mantle=350оС. There exists a solution that is in agreement with the seismic data and the statement of the thermophysical problem under a limited range of the required parameters. The results obtained show a weak dependence of Ubulk and JMoon on the thickness of the Moon's upper mantle and the temperature at the crust-mantle boundary (Tcrmantle).

- typical profile for  Tcr-mantle= 550oС; the depth of boundary  crust-mantle Hcrust-mantle=750 km, crust density =2580 kg/m3, the depth of the crust Hcr=34 km; 3 - typical profile for the model without melt [3].  Figure 2: Temperature gradient in the upper mantle; red squares - Tcr-mantle= 350oС, blue triangles - Tcr-mantle= 550oС; Solid line - the gradient dT/dH = 1.17 K/km.  Bulk uranium concentrations in the silicate Moon have been estimated at the level of 15-19 ppb. Calculated values of surface heat flow (6-8 mW/m2) are two or three times less than Apollo-15 and -17 estimations. Temperature profiles with Tcr-mantle=550оС are less probable because of too high temperatures in the upper mantle. For the model with the Tcrmantle=350оС, the resulting uranium bulk concentration is about 19 ppb. Numerical experiments show that the restrictions of the seismic velocities [5] allow us to obtain the temperature required to melt the mantle at a depth of 1250 km.   We have estimated bulk concentration FeO1112wt.% and the relationship of the concentration Al2O3 (wt. %) as function of the Tmean, were Tmean - the mean volume temperature in the mantle, oC:  Al2O3=-5.7+0.0113Tmean. The probable temperature at a depth of the upper mantle (40-500 km) of olivine-pyroxenite composition was obtained and can be approximately described by the next dependence: T(±150)oC =430+1.18 H-0.00034H2, which provides a zero density gradient with an accept able accuracy with depth. The temperature gradient is equal to 1.17°K/km. The probable temperature profile has been used to estimate the lunar bulk composition. The results of researching show, that Moon is essentially enriched by oxide FeO (10.8-12.6 wt.%.) and depleted by MgO (28,5-32,5 wt. %) in comparison with earth's mantle. Magnesia number lies in the range of 0.82-0.83, bulk  concentration  Al2O3 - 3.4 - 6.8 wt.%.  Al2O3 4 wt.% for the probable temperature profile.  References:  [1]V. A. Kronrod and O. L.
