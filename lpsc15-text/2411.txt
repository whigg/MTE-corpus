Introduction: It is widely concluded that ureilites have experienced post-crystallization reduction based on the presence of magnesian rims within constituent olivine associated with blebs of iron metal [e.g.,1].  This is commonly attributed to reactions with elemental carbon (graphite or diamond), which is a ubiquitous accessory phase [2].  However, certain other ultramafic achondrites also exhibit similar petrographic evidence for such reduction, and probably by different mechanisms than those operative in ureilites. We previously have described [3] anomalous brachinites NWA 7388 and NWA 7605, which contain marginally modified olivine converted to an assemblage of iron metal + orthopyroxene, and which we attribute to reactions involving methane.  Here we describe features in two paired anomalous lodranites, which appear to require yet another explanation.    Figure 1. BSE images of NWA 8410 (above) and NWA 8422 (below) .  Olivine (darkest gray, mottled), clinopyroxene (light gray), orthopyroxene (intermediate gray), altered metal (brightest).   Petrography of NWA 8410 and NWA 8422: Both specimens are coarse grained (0.8-4 mm), protogranular aggregates of olivine (cores Fa12.4-12.9; FeO/MnO = 21-23), subcalcic augite (Fs6.1-6.8Wo36.5-35.9; FeO/MnO = 10-13) and subordinate low-Ca pyroxene (Fs10.010.9Wo4.9-4.7; FeO/MnO = 12-16) with accessory altered Ni-poor metal and rare Cr-bearing troilite. Olivine near grain margins and along cracks is significantly more magnesian (Fa5.0-7.2) than cores, and is associated with fine blebs of Ni-free iron metal (see Figure 3).  In contrast to ureilites though, there does not appear to be any elemental carbon in these specimens.    Figure 2. Detail of reduction assemblages (dark with bright specks of Fe metal) within olivine in NWA 8422. Adjacent grains are orthopyroxene; included grain is clinopyroxene; metal and Fe oxides are bright.  Oxygen Isotopic Composition: Analyses of acidwashed subsamples of NWA 8422 by laser fluorination gave, respectively, δ17O 2.535, 2.724, 2.649, 2.496; δ18O 6.761, 7.024, 6.852, 6.671; Δ17O -1.035, -0.985, 0.969, -1.026 per mil.  These values plot on an extension of the trend for acapulcoites and lodranites.  Discussion:  The marginal and interior reduction of olivine grains in these specimens may have been induced by post-crystallization processes involving fluids (possibly hydrogen-rich), or alternatively these features may signify an evolving redox state during magmatic crystallization, (as deduced for some angrites and olivine-phyric shergottites).
