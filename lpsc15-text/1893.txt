Introduction:  Mercury's rotation is tidally coupled to its orbit. The planet rotates three times for every two revolutions around the Sun. In addition to its mean rotation, longitudinal librations are expected because of Mercury's eccentric orbit and the aspherical distribution of mass within the planet. The annual libration has a period of about 89 days and an amplitude of 38.5 arc seconds [1]. Further, perturbations on Mercury's orbit by other planets can lead to long-period librations (with a dominant period of about 12 years [2,3]), which at short time scales would manifest themselves as an apparent small secular change to the mean rotation rate. Measurements of rotational parameters are of considerable interest because they are related to key internal structural parameters [1]. Furthermore, precise knowledge of the planet's rotation rate is essential for producing accurate maps and planning spacecraft observations. The MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft, in orbit about Mercury for more than three years, enables precise measurements of rotational parameters. As of April 2014, MESSENGER's Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA) had performed over 30,000,000 high-accuracy range measurements to Mercury's surface. Because of the spacecraft's eccentric orbit and high northern periapsis the ranging by the instrument is performed dominantly in Mercury's northern hemisphere (Fig. 1). Method: From the MLA observations we determined simultaneously the spherical harmonic coefficients of the topography and the rotation rate of Mercury. This method has been described for simulated MLA data [4] and was recently applied to simulated data from the BepiColombo Laser Altimeter (BELA) [5]. The method benefits from the wide temporal and spatial distribution of the observations. From the laser range measurements at different epochs we applied a model with static and dynamic topography components. The static topography was expanded in spherical harmonics. The body-fixed coordinates of the laser altimeter measurements were computed from the rotation rate value and the dynamic component of the topography. Observations at the same coordinates but at different epochs allow us to separate dynamic and static topography. The observation equation for the inversion is 𝑟𝑟LA𝑖𝑖 = ∑ ∑ � 𝐶𝐶𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙, 𝑚𝑚 ≥ 0 𝑆𝑆𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙, 𝑚𝑚 < 0 � 𝑌𝑌𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝜆𝜆𝑖𝑖 ,𝜙𝜙(𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖)) + 𝜖𝜖𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙=−𝑙𝑙 𝑙𝑙max 𝑙𝑙=0  , (1) where 𝑌𝑌𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 is the spherical harmonic function and 𝐶𝐶𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙, 𝑆𝑆𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 are the corresponding coefficients of degree 𝑙𝑙 and order 𝑚𝑚. The expansion is performed up to a maximum degree 𝑙𝑙max of 60. 𝑟𝑟LA𝑖𝑖  is the ith observation of the planet's radius, 𝜆𝜆𝑖𝑖  is the corresponding bodyfixed latitude, and 𝜙𝜙(𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖) the longitude. The mismatch between the observed radius and the model is denoted by the residual 𝜖𝜖𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖 . The longitude of the observation is computed from the inertial longitude 𝜑𝜑𝑖𝑖 of the laser altimeter footprint and the time of observation 𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 by 𝜙𝜙(𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖) = 𝜑𝜑𝑖𝑖 + 𝜔𝜔1𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 ,   (2) where 𝜔𝜔1 is the apparent rotation rate during 20112014. Although the method in principle can also be used to determine the amplitude of the forced libration, the limited coverage with MLA profiles in equatorial regions makes the detection of the small librations challenging and is not treated in this work. Further, we neglected any variation in 𝜔𝜔1 and derived a mean value for the three years of observations. We performed a least-squares inversion for the unknown parameters. We applied a weighting scheme to account for varying observing conditions (e.g., offnadir pointing of the instrument). Because MLA observations are limited to the northern hemisphere of Mercury, the inversion for the (global) spherical harmonic coefficients cannot be performed without constraining the solution with a priori information. For that purpose, we applied a spherical harmonic solution for Mercury's topography (HTM02) to degree and order 120. This was obtained with the help of a regularization technique, based on Kaula's power law, and additional radio occultation data in the southern hemisphere [6]. With that solution as a priori information, we solved simultaneously for the topography coefficients and the rotation rate of the planet. We also performed our calculation with a priori   information provided from limb images [7] and with a localized spherical harmonic approach [8]. To assess the uncertainty in the rotation rate value we performed simulations of laser altimeter measurements with an assumed rotation rate and characteristic uncertainties for spacecraft position and laser time-of-flight measurements. Then we inverted for the assumed rotation rate and derived the uncertainty from the variance of the simulation results. References: [1] Margot J.-L. et al. (2012) JGR, 117, E00L09. [2] Peale S.
