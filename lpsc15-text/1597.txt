 VANADIUM ISOTOPE HETEROGENEITY OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM: NEW DATA FOR ACHONDRITES.  Sune G. Nielsen1, Adam Sarafian1 and Jeremy D. Owens1, 1 - NIRVANA laboratories, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, 02543 Woods Hole, MA, USA   Introduction:  In a recent paper, the first high precision vanadium (V) isotopic data was presented for several carbonaceous chondrites, HED's, one Ureilite and the Martian meteorite Nakhla [1] (Fig. 1). Within the long-term analytical uncertainty these meteorites were shown to display indistinguishable V isotope compositions (defined as δ51V =1000×( (51V/50Vsample/51V/50VAlfaAesarSpecpure)-1)) of δ51V = -1.7 ± 0.2‰ (2sd). In contrast, bulk silicate Earth (BSE) has been inferred to exhibit δ51V = -0.7 ± 0.2‰ (2sd) [2], which suggests that meteorites are uniformly enriched in the low-abundance isotope 50V compared with BSE.   Figure 1: Vanadium isotope data reported previously for bulk silicate Earth and various meteorites [1, 2]  Experiments in which liquid metal and silicate were equilibrated did not produce any resolvable V isotope fractionation [1] and thus it was concluded that terrestrial core formation cannot account for the offset observed between BSE and meteorites. Other processes that potentially could contribute to V isotopic differences between Earth and meteorites were identified as 1) volatile element depletion or impact erosion, 2) stable isotope fractionation during igneous processing, 3) stable isotope fractionation during parent body metamorphism, 4) cosmic irradiation of meteorites before delivery on Earth, 5) heterogeneous distribution of nucleosynthetically anomalous material and 6) highenergy irradiation of the solar nebula before or during formation of the first nebular condensates akin to the so-called X-wind process [3, 4]. All of these alternative explanations are difficult to reconcile with a uniform V isotopic offset between Earth and meteorites because the spatial distribution within the solar system and chemical origin of meteorites precludes any of the above-mentioned processes to produce a uniform V isotopic reservoir for the solar system bar the Earth. Given these complexities, it was concluded that more data needs to be available before it can be determined what the ultimate cause for V isotope variation in the solar system is.  We will present additional V isotope data for a number of achondrites in order to obtain more detailed information about the V isotope variation present in differentiated solar system objects.   Methods: We use a Thermo-Finnigan Neptune located at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) Plasma Mass Spectrometry Facility to measure precise and accurate V isotope ratios by multi collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICPMS). The main methods that we use have been described elsewhere [5, 6]. However, these methods were originally developed using a Nu Plasma MCICPMS instrument and the Neptune MC-ICPMS instrument at WHOI required several important modifications to the original technique in order to generate reliable data.  The most important difference is that sulfur needs to be removed from sample V in order to avoid interferences in the mass spectrum we collect (49-53 atomic mass units) from sulfur oxide molecules (e.g. 32S17O, 32S-18O, 33S-16O, 33S-17O, 33S-18O, 34S-16O, 34S-17O, 34S-18O). At the level of sulfur present in samples, sulfur oxide molecules only contribute negligible ion beams on a Nu Plasma because the transmission of ions in the low mass range is much lower than for a Neptune. We use the anion exchange resin AG1X8 in dilute hydrochloric acid medium to capture the sulfur (in the form of sulfate) present in our vanadium samples while vanadium does not interact appreciably with the resin. The Neptune MC-ICPMS at WHOI is equipped with one 1012 Ω and one 1010 Ω resistor, which we apply to the faraday cups that collect the 50V and 51V ion beams, respectively. Given this amplification we are able to analyze samples and standards with V concentrations of 2 µg/ml, an improvement by a factor of 2.5 over the Nu Plasma. This setup allows us to obtain V isotope compositions using less than 1µg of sample V. -­2.5 -­2.0 -­1.5 -­1.0 -­0.5 0.0 Carbonaceous  Chondrites HED  parent  body Other  chondrites Mars CI CM CO CV CK Nakhla BSE:   51V  =  -­0.7  ±  0.2‰  51 V Repeated measurements of the secondary V solution from BDH chemicals previously used to evaluate mass spectrometer performance [5, 6], yielded the correct value of δ51V = -1.20 ± 0.15‰.     Preliminary results: In order to ascertain the longterm reproducibility of δ51V for real samples when using the Neptune MC-ICPMS we have obtained large fragments (>5g) of several meteorite samples that we will measure at least one of during each mass spectrometry session. These meteorites are: angrite D'Orbigny, eucrite Juvinas, shergottite NWA 1068 and LL chondrite Chelyabinsk. Initial results from repeat measurements of D'Orbigny, NWA 1068, Juvinas and Chelyabinsk all exhibit values intermediate between that of BSE and the previously published meteorite data with uncertainties similar to those obtained for the BDH standard solution. Additional tests will be performed in order to verify that these data are accurate as well as precise.   Discussion: Our preliminary V isotope results suggest  that meteorites exhibit more V isotope variation than initially indicated based on a small number of samples (Fig. 1). As discussed in Nielsen et al. [1], it is difficult to explain how carbonaceous chondrites, ordinary chondrites and achondrites exhibit an essentially uniform V isotope composition while the Earth is different by ~1‰. Therefore, it is expected that meteorites as a whole should preserve some additional variation compared with that displayed in Figure 1. As such, our new results for D'Orbigny, Juvinas, NWA 1068 and Chelyabinsk confirm that meteorites do not represent a uniform V isotope reservoir. Although, the new data do extend the range of V isotope compositions observed for meteorites, extraterrestrial samples do not overlap with samples of the silicate Earth. Hence, Earth is still significantly different in terms of V isotopes to all known meteorite values. However, the four new data points presented here are far from sufficient to evaluate each of the six alternative interpretations outlined to explain the V isotopic difference between Earth and meteorites.  Only further and more detailed V isotope investigations of extraterrestrial material such as Martian meteorites, Lunar samples, HEDs, angrites, and different chondrite groups will enable a more unambiguous evaluation of the origin of V isotope variation in meteorites and on Earth.
