Scaling Law of Impact Induced Shock Pressure in Planetary Mantle.  J. Monteux1 and J. Arkani-Hamed2, 1 Laboratoire Magmas et Volcans, Clermont-Ferrand, France (j.monteux@opgc.univ-bpclermont.fr), 2 Department of Physics, University of Toronto, Canada (jafar@physics.utoronto.ca).   Introduction:  While hydrocode simulation of impact induced shock pressure inside planetary mantle is more accurate, it is not suitable for studying several hundreds of impacts occurring during the accretion of a planet.  Not only simulation of each impact takes over two orders of magnitude longer computer time than that of a scaling law simulation [1], but also it is cumbersome to apply for growing proto-planets where size of a proto-planet and impact velocities of the accreting bodies increase significantly.  This is compounded by the formation of the iron core during the accretion with increasing size. Major impacting bodies during accretion of a Mars type planet have very low velocities.   Figure 1: Composition (left) and pressure evolutions as a function of time (from top to bottom) after 50 km impact radius on a differentiated Mars size body (dunite is green and iron is red) Method:  We use 2D-iSale spherical axisymmetric hydrocode simulations (Fig. 1) and adopt physical properties of dunite for both the mantle and the impactor to monitor the shock pressure and the particle velocity in a Mars type body for 11 impact velocities ranging from 4 to 60 km/s.  Large impactors of 100 to 1000 km in diameter, comparable to those that impacted Mars and created giant impact basins, are examined.  Results:  The results are in good agreement with those of Pierazzo et al. [2] that were calculated for impact velocities higher than 10 km/s and impactor of 0.2 to 10 km in diameter.  The internal consistency of our models indicates that our scaling laws are also accurate for lower impact velocities. We found no distinct isobaric region, rather the peak shock pressure changes relatively slowly versus distance from the impact site in the near field zone, within ~ 3 times the impactor radius, compare to that in the far field zone as also suggested by Ahrens and O'Keefe [3].   Figure 2: Peak pressure (black dashed line) as a function of the distance from the impact site after a 50 km radius impact on a Mars-size differentiated body. The green and red solid lines represent the scaling laws in the near and far field zones respectively.    Hence we propose two distinct scaling laws, the power law distribution of shock pressure P as a function of distance R from the impact site at the surface, one for the near field zone and the other for the far field zone (Fig. 2 and 3): 1891.pdf

    Log P = a + n Log (R/Rimp)         With   n = 1.72 - 2.44 Log(Vimp)     for R < ~3 Rimp,  and  n = -0.84 -0.51 Log(Vimp)     for  R > ~3 Rimp  where a is a constant, Rimp is the impactor radius, and Vimp (in km/s) is the impact velocity. We show the effect of dynamic phase change in dunite at around 220 GPa during the propagation of the shock wave occurring for impact velocities higher than 10 km/s (Fig. 3).       Figure 3: Particle velocity (top) and peak pressure (bottom) as a function of the distance from the impact site for impact velocities ranging from 4 to 60 km/s. Impact velocities (in km/s) are indicated close to the corresponding curves. The dashed lines show the phase transition zones.   Perspectives: By extending the range of impact velocities down to values comparable to the Martian escape velocity, we are now able to better predict the consequences of the impacts that occurred during the late stages of the Martian accretion. Indeed, to retain a significant part of the impacted material, most of the impacts that built up Mars occurred with a small impact velocity [4]. Moreover, these scaling laws provide us a mean to better determine impact heating of a growing proto-planet in terms of temperature increase as well as in terms of heat repartition [5]. These scalings are of major interest when considering the full accretional heating of a growing protoplanet [6].  References:  [1] Arkani-Hamed, J., and Ivanov, B., (2014), Phys. Earth Planet.
