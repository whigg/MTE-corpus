Presence of H2 in the plumes is an important indicator of hydrothermal activity in Enceladus' ocean. Quantifying the amount of H2 also has implications for determining its role in the production of the plumes as supersaturated H2 could create the conditions for accelerating water to the observed mach number. However, results from the various Enceladus flybys by Cassini show that the apparent hydrogen abundance increases with spacecraft speed. This evolution is attributed to the impact of ice grains in the antechamber of INMS [1]: the impacts on the wall of the antechamber expose/project fresh titanium that will react with water to form hydrogen. The large number of ice grains arriving during a single integration period of INMS means that grains are going to appear in the data as a continuous source of water, titanium, and hydrogen, complicating the determination of the amount of Ti released. This process poses the question of how much of the detected hydrogen is native and how much is an artifact. Data from the Cassini CAPS instrument has allowed us to determine a distribution function of the size of ice grains for E5 flyby (fast flyby at 17.7 km/s). In parallel, a series of impact physics computations [2] have given an estimate of the quantity of titanium exposed/ejected by impacts. Combined these allow us to model the products of grain impacts around the closest approach of flyby E5, especially the quantity of titanium released. This is used an input for a surface chemistry model of the INMS antechamber. This model has been developed to consider adsorption and chemisorption effects and to follow the evolution of surface and gas phase species in the antechamber. Here we present a comparison of the calculated H2 from this model for the grain size distribution based on CAPS data from the E5 flyby, with H2 measurements from Cassini-INMS. We show how this allows us to constrain the proportion of native hydrogen and from this, to make predictions as to the quantity to be detected in the upcoming open source flyby of Enceladus on E21.
