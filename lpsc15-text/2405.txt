In fact, it  is the link between the rocky and icy asteroids of the belt and possibly one the key to understand the main  phases  of the  evolution  of the  solar  system.  NASA mission  DAWN scheduled  to  arrive  at  Ceres  in  the spring 2015 [1]. Theoretical models suggest that Ceres has a differentiated interior,  consisting in  a silicate core (with a weak presence of metals),  an  icy mantle  [2,3,4]  and hydrated minerals at surface [5]. Water  vapor presence has  been recently observed by Herschel [6]: the observations give a flux of at least of 1026 molecules for second from mid-latitude localized sources.  Water  emission was also suggested for the first time by [7]. Thermo-physical Model: In the literature we can find several works dedicated to the study of Ceres, in particular  to  the  formation  and  internal  evolution [2,3,4]. These models consider Ceres like an icy satellite and deal with its geophysical evolution. Our model, conversely, derives from the the study of the thermal evolution of cometary nuclei [8,9,10]. The model contemporary solves the 1-D heat diffusion equation,  taking  into account the energy gained or lost by the solid matrix due to sublimation and recondensation  of H2O ice,  and  the  mass conservation equation that  controls the gas flow through the pore system. The model is a "quasi-3D" model, since the illumination for each facets (which cover the entire surface of the body), is calculated by the insulation on the body. Surface temperature derives from the balance of solar  input  and  the energy re-emitted in  space,  conducted in the interior and used the sublimate surface ices. We assume Ceres as a  spherical  body, composed by water ice, dust and organics in well-defined proportions.  Dust  grains  are  distributed  in  different  size classes having different physical and thermal features. The physical and orbital parameters used in the model are reported in the following Table. Results:  We developed several  scenarios in  order to study the  effects of the different physical parameters on the sublimation. First, we explored the dependence  of the  water  emission  (and,  generally,  of the thermal evolution) on the initial internal temperature: we examined the cases of 163 K, i.e. equilibrium surface temperature assuming a solar constant of 1330 W m−2 and an emissivity of 0.9, and the case of a lower temperature, i.e. 80 K. The water ice has been considered on the surface or at  different  distance from the surface:  0.25  m  (comparable  with  the  diurnal  skin depth of 0.15 m) and 100 m (below the annual  skin  depth  of about  9  m).  A typical  surface  temperature map, in case of silicatic crust (no ice on the surface),  is shown in Fig.1. Fig.1: Typical surface temperature.  The maximum temperatures achieved with the different models is about 235 K at 2.72 AU, consistent with  measured temperature of the warmest area (235 ± 4)K [11]. In Fig.2 we show a flux profile vs time, in case of porosity of 0.6, at top with initial temperature of 80 K and on the bottom with initial  temperature of 163 K. Conclusions:  We  applied  a  cometary-like  model [8,9,10] in order to study the surface temperature and water sublimation of Ceres, one of the targets of the DAWN NASA mission. We have seen that ice on surface at the equator is stable for very few orbits. Thus if the water emission comes from the equatorial surface we should have a continuos replinishment of water on the surface. In this case, relatively small active area is necessary to fit the Herschel observations. Conversely, water  ice is quite stable for very long time if buried below few tens of centimeters of dust. In this case, the water flux is small. Our  simulations  will  be  an  useful  support  for Dawn to better understand the phyiscal conditions for water sublimation and ice stability.
