Introduction:  Gullies on Mars are closed erosiondeposition systems, which resemble water-worn gullies on Earth and consist of a source area (alcove), channel and deposition apron, or fan [1]. Martian gullies are extremely common on steep slopes in the mid-latitudes of Mars [2]. In our previous work, we examined a certain class of these gullies incised into a surface deposit called the latitude dependent mantle (LDM)[3]. The LDM blankets the martian surface at the mid- to highlatitudes and is thought to comprise ice and dust [4]. We found that the erosional volumes of gullies incised into the LDM far exceeded the volumes of their deposits, indicating an ice content between 46 and 95 %. Another result of this study was that the steepnesses of the gully incision walls were very consistent, implying that the length of the incision walls could be used as an indicator for LDM thickness. Here we present the preliminary results of a study to measure these lengths in Terra Cimmeria and the Argyre impact basin and associated rim materials. Study Areas: The Argyre impact basin is 1200 km in diameter and is the second largest basin in the southern hemisphere after the Hellas Basin. Previous work has shown that the Argyre Basin has abundant gullies and LDM [5], as well as other ice-related features [6-8]. In contrast, Terra Cimmeria is a region of southern highlands terrain with a lower, more 'typical' amount of LDM [9] and gullies [2].  Approach:  As base data we used the gullies that were mapped from Context camera (CTX) images from [10]. The data were projected into a Lambert Conformal Conic projection with standard parallels of 34°S and 56°S and centre latitude of 45°S. For Terra Cimmeria a central meridian of 154°E was used and for Argyre a central meridian of 43°W was used.

 We split the Argyre region into two sites along the 42.4°E longitude line, to allow us to compare sites with similar spatial extents. We measured gully-incision length (and hence depth) from the CTX images, as a proxy for LDM thickness in the three study sites. We have to use such a proxy because there is no topography data available at the metre-scale across these large study-sites (Fig. 2). To perform this analysis, we assume that, where gullies incise into the LDM, they form v-shaped, straight-sided chutes whose walls lie between 15-30° [3]; hence, by measuring the length of the wall of the vshaped incision perpendicular to the channel we derive an estimate of the incision depth. We measured these incisions on CTX images using the previous gullycatalogue to expediate the search. Hence, the resulting data were biased towards larger examples. Results:  The estimated thickness of the LDM from gully-incisions ranges between 3 and 94 m (average 27 m) assuming a wall-slope of 20°. The LDM is, on average, thicker in the two Argyre sites (34 m) compared to Terra Cimmeria (20 m). In all three regions, we found that the average LDM thickness increases from the mid- to the high-latitudes (Fig. 3), with the most marked increase between 30° and 40°S. North of 40°, the LDM mean thickness is 18 m, increasing to 38 m at latitudes south of 40°.   Figure 3: Estimated gully incision depth against latitude for each study site. Black dots are the estimate of incision depth assuming a 20° wall-slope, the black lines extend down to the depth assuming a 10° wallslope and extend up to the depth assuming a 30° wallslope. The dotted line is a moving average of the black-dots.  Most estimates made from the dissected LDM ouside craters have found thicknesses  on the order of 10 m or less [9,11,12]. Our results therefore show that LDM deposits on crater walls tend to be thicker than those outside craters. Our finding of thicker LDM in the Argre Basin (compared to Terra Cimmeria) compares well with observations in the Hellas basin, made by Zanetti et al. [13]. By analysing buried craters, they found LDM thicknesses varied from ~21 m south of the Hellas Basin to ~26 m inside the basin. When, instead, they measured scalloped deepression-depths [14], they found LDM thicknesses with a mode of 1015 m to the south of the Hellas Basin.  Conclusions:  Gully incision widths are an efficient way to measure LDM thicknesses across the martian surface. The LDM is thicker in the Argyre Basin than on the Terra Cimmeria highlands, showing that eithergreater accumulation has occurred in the Argyre Basin, or that greater ablation has occurred in the Terra Cimmeria highlands. This highlights the climatic influence of the large basins in the southern hemisphere of Mars.  References: [1] M.C. Malin and K.S. Edgett, Science, (2000), 288,2330-2335. [2] T.N. Harrison, G.R.
