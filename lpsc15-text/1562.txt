Some of the minerals, however, show strong fluorescence interference with 532 nm laser excitation (e.g., [4]).  It is known that excitation of samples with deep UV could minimize fluorescence interference with the Raman spectra of minerals.  In addition, the intensity of the Raman scattering is anticipated to be high for samples excited with UV laser due to 1/λ4 dependence of the scattered light.  We have carried out preliminary work to evaluate the feasibility of using 266 nm laser excited Raman spectroscopy for detecting minerals from a standoff distance of 17 m in the laboratory.  Samples:  Natural mineral samples were purchased from the Ward's Natural Science Establishment, Rochester, New York.  For standoff Raman measurements the mineral samples were used without any cutting or polishing. The following is a list of samples investigated in the present study. Table 1.

For excitation wavelength the fourth harmonic 266 nm of an  Nd:YAG laser (Quantel Brilliant Eazy) was used. The laser operates at 10 Hz and its energy was set to 10 mJ/pulse (pulse width 5 ns) at the sample. For standoff Raman measurements, a 5x beam expander focused the laser to a spot size of 10 mm diameter at the 17 meter range.  Two 266 nm RazorSharp long pass edge filters from Semrock (Rochester, NY) were used to minimize Rayleigh scattered light at 266 nm. The standoff time gated Raman spectra of minerals were measured with the 6 ns gate of the ICCD camera and intensifier gain was set at 40. The spectra were calibrated using the known Raman peaks of cyclohexane, and calcite. For the Raman spectral range of 100 - 1800 cm-1 the accuracy of the strong and sharp Raman lines is estimated to be ±2 cm-1, and ±4 cm-1 for weak and broad bands.. Results and Discussion: Standoff Raman spectra of various α-quartz varieties excited with 266 nm laser are shown in Fig. 1. The broad feature at ~149 cm-1 is due to rotational lines of atmospheric gases. The Raman line at 1556 cm-1 in these spectra is the symmetric stretching mode of atmospheric O2. The Raman fingerprint peaks of α-quartz are at 208 and 464 cm-1, and are observed in the spectra of all the six quartz varieties (Fig. 1). The 208 cm-1 line is from a lattice mode and the 464 cm-1 line is attributed to the Si-O-Si symmetric stretching mode of the six-member ring of SiO4 tetrahedra (e.g., [5, 6]).  The rock crystal variety of quartz, which is the purest form of α-quartz, produces the strongest Raman spectrum.  The intensities of the Raman lines in the other varieties of quartz (W02W06) are much weaker, which is most likely due to the presence of impurities and microcrystalline nature of these samples.  In addition, there is a weak shoulder at ~501 cm-1 in the spectra of chert, flint, chalcedony and jasper originating from defects present in these samples. Similar to flint variety of quartz, the chert quartz show short-lived fluorescence in the 700-1800 cm-1 region, most likely due to presence of organic impurities or structural defects. Figure 2 depicts the standoff Raman spectra of the feldspar group of minerals. The Raman lines characteristics of T-O-T symmetric stretch of feldspars that contain 4-membered rings of TO4 tetrahedra, where T = Si or Al, are observed in the 430-550 cm-1 range (e.g., [67]). These lines appear at 478 and 514 cm-1 for microcline (W07), 484 and 510 cm-1 for Cleavelandite (W08) and 479 and 512 cm-1 for plagioclase (W09) samples. In the spectra of feldspars, the high frequency anti-symmetric stretching modes of T-O-T appear in the 950-1200 cm-1 range. These bands appear at 999 and 1129 cm-1 in the spectrum of microcline (W07) but give rise to broad and weak bands in the spectra of feldspars W08 and W09, indicating that these feldspars are formed at high temperatures.

Figure 3 illustrates the Raman spectra of carbonates. All the spectra show the Raman fingerprints of carbonate ions. The strongest symmetric stretching modes, νs(CO3), of magnesite (MgCO3), calcite (CaCO3) and dolomite (CaMg(CO3)2) appear at 1096, 1085, and 1099 cm-1, respectively. The types of carbonate minerals can easily be identified from their respective lattice modes, which appear below 350 cm1. Figure 4 shows the time-resolved standoff Raman spectra of gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O) and barite (BaSO4). The internal modes of vibrations of sulfate ions are clearly visible in these spectra.  The strongest symmetric stretching mode, νs(SO4), of gypsum and barite appear at 1009 and 989 cm-1, respectively.  These Raman lines can be used for detecting sulfate minerals [3].  Figure 3.
