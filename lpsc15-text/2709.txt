This specimen is the subject of multidisciplinary studies at the Royal Ontario Museum, and here we report on its petrographic, oxygen isotopic, trace element abundances and radiogenic isotopic characteristics. Future studies will include analyses of bulk major element abundances, cosmogenic isotopes, and lead isotopes in Zr- and P-bearing accessory minerals.    Figure 1.

Petrography and Mineralogy: NWA 8679 has an intersertal texture (see Figure 2a), and is composed predominantly of prismatic grains (up to 1.8 mm long) of clinopyroxene (exhibiting complex, patchy compositional zoning - see Figure 2b) and lath-shaped grains (up to 1.2 mm long) of maskelynite (An47.9-54.1Or1.5-1.3).  Pyroxene compositions comprise high-Ca subcalcic augite (Fs21.1-37.2Wo31.6-33.9; FeO/MnO = 28-37) and low-Ca pigeonite (Fs29.9-59.7Wo9.8-16.9; FeO/MnO = 3238). Accessory phases include ulvöspinel, ilmenite, pyrrhotite and rare merrillite; some pyroxenes contain crystallized melt inclusions composed of Na-K-Si-rich glass+merrillite+pyroxene.  In addition to the conversion of originally crystalline plagioclase to maskelynite and fracturing of pyroxene, other effects attributed to shock are radial reexpansion fractures around trapped melt inclusions (see Figure 2c) and very thin, cross-cutting veinlets and sparse small pockets of dark brown glass.          Figure 2a-b. BSE images of NWA 8679 highlighting patchy-zoned pyroxene grains (medium grays), maskelynite (dark gray), Fe-Ti oxides (lightest gray) and pyrrhotite (bright).  Figure 2c shows a trapped melt inclusion (black) surrounded by radial cracks.    Pyroxene Compositional Trends: Pyroxene compositions in NWA 8679 follow the familiar fractionation trends observed in other enriched mafic shergottites, especially Zagami [1-4] (see Figure 3). Pyroxenes in NWA 7257 [5] and NWA 3171 [6] exhibit a similar pattern.    Figure 3. Quadrilateral plot of pyroxene compositions compared to those in Zagami [1-4], NWA 7257 [5] and NWA 3171 [6].  Bulk Composition: Representative interior samples were analyzed at the Scripps Isotope Geochemistry Laboratory (SIGL) for trace element abundances. Selected trace element abundances are as follows (all in ppm): La 1.89, Ce 4.69, Pr 0.69, Nd 3.50, Sm 1.41, Eu 0.59, Gd 2.14, Tb 0.43, Dy 3.06, Ho 0.64, Er 1.79, Tm 0.25, Yb 1.62, Lu 0.23, Hf 1.72, Zr 53.48, Ba 57.04, Rb 4.94, Sr 56.77. The REE pattern is typical for enriched shergottites such as NWA 3171 and NWA 7257 (Figure 4)  and very similar to that for LAR 12011 [7].    Figure 4. CI-chondrite normalized rare earth element abundances for NWA 8679 and two comparison samples, NWA 7257 and NWA 3171.   Oxygen Isotopic Composition: Analyses of acidwashed interior subsamples by laser fluorination at the University of New Mexico gave, respectively 17O 2.742, 2.896, 2.845, 2.642; 18O 4.680, 4.974, 4.934, 4.562; 17O 0.271, 0.270, 0.240, 0.233 per mil (reference TFL slope = 0.528). These compositions plot within the field for most other Martian meteorites (with the exception of NWA 7034 and paired stones) [e.g. 8]. Radiogenic Isotopic Compositions: Hafnium and neodymium isotopic compositions and Lu/Hf and Sm/Nd ratios were determined on a 62 mg interior sample with a Nu Plasma II MC-ICP-MS at the University of Houston.  Chemical separation, mass spectrometry, and data reduction follows methods outlined in [9].  Present-day Hf and Nd isotopic values are listed below:  176Hf =  -17.7 ± 0.3; 176Lu/177Hf = 0.0178 ± 1 143Nd =  -6.2 ± 0.3; 147Sm/144Nd = 0.2375 ± 5  Discussion: Northwest Africa 8679 is an enriched shergottite with textural, mineralogical and compositional similarities to Zagami, Northwest Africa 3171 and Larkman Nunatak 12011, yet it is distinct from the somewhat similar enriched mafic shergottites Northwest Africa 8656/8657 [10]. NWA 8679 has Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd isotopic similarities to NWA 856.  References: [1] Stolper E. and McSween H. (1979) GCA 43, 589-602. [2] Treiman A. and Sutton S. (1992) LPS XXII, 1411-1412.
