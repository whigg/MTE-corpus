Missionaccessibility  is  defined  by  delta-v,  the  change  invelocity required for a spacecraft to rendezvous with acelestial  body.  With  current  propulsion  technology,spacecraft can reach NEAs whose orbits have delta-V< 7 km/s. Across the entire NEA population, the smallest (d <1 km) objects have not been well-studied, owing to thedifficulty of observing them. These very small objectsare often targets of opportunity, observable for only ashort period of time after their discovery. Even at theirbrightest (V ~ 18), these asteroids are faint enough thatthey  must  be  observed  with  large  ground-basedtelescopes.The  Mission  Accessible  Near-Earth  ObjectSurvey (MANOS) began in August  2013 as a multiyear physical characterization survey that was awardedsurvey status by NOAO. MANOS will target severalhundred  mission-accessible  NEOs across  visible  andnear-infrared  wavelengths,  ultimately  providing  acomprehensive  catalog  of  physical  properties(astrometry, light curves, spectra).Methods: Sixty small,  mission-accessible  NEAswere  observed  in  2013  and  2014  using  the  GeminiMulti-Object Spectrograph at Gemini North & Southobservatories. Taxonomic classifications were obtainedby fitting our spectra to the visible wavelength portionsof  the  mean  reflectance  spectra  of  the  Bus-DeMeotaxonomy [1]. Results  &  Discussion:  The  smallest  near-Earthasteroids are the likely progenitors of meteorites; weexpect  the  observed  fraction  of  ordinary  chondritemeteorites to match that of their parent bodies, S-typeasteroids. We present classifications for these objectsas  well  as  preliminary  results  for  the  distribution oftaxa  (as  a  proxy  for  composition)  as  a  function  ofobject  size  and  compare  to  the  observed  fraction  ofordinary chondrite meteorites.
