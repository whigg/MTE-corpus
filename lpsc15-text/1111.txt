Introduction: The  global  distribution  of  TiO2 in the lunar regolith was estimated using Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Wide Angle Camera (WAC) multi-spectral observations (7 bands from 321 to 689 nm [1]). The spectral slope from UV to visible wavelengths is known to be significantly affected by variations in ilmenite  (FeTiO2)  abundance  [2,3].  Thus we used the WAC 321 and 415 nm bands to estimate TiO2 abundance.  The new TiO2 abundance map was compared with TiO2 maps based on the Clementine and Lunar Prospector (LP) data sets. Methodology: We assumed that the dominant control of the 321 nm over 415 nm band ratio for the mare is ilmenite abundance variation [2,3]. The ratio value was compared to lab analyses of returned lunar soils to establish a conversion from ratio to TiO2 abundance. The WAC 321/415 ratio values were derived from ~36 months of observations at each sample-return site. The original pixel scale (average within a frame) of the WAC during the LRO's quasi-circular 50 km orbit period was 423 m for the UV and 83 m for visible bands [4]. In the current elliptical orbit, the pixel scale ranges from 550 to 1170 m/pixel in UV and from 107 to 228 m/pixel in visible bands within the latitudes of samplereturn sites (-9° to 26°N). For each site, about 30 UV and 230 visible (per band) observations (image pixels), whose pixel edges are inside a 800 by 800 meter box centered at the exact sample-return spot, were selected from non map-projected WAC images for each band. The DN value of each pixel was converted to the radiance factor (I/F) [5], then photometrically normalized by a Hapke function [5] using spatially resolved Hapke parameter maps [1]. To minimize the influence of local features with anomalous albedo (very high or low relative to the sample site), all the pixels that included such local  features  were  removed  (determined  from  ~2 m/pixel  Narrow  Angle  Camera  images).  The  modal value and the standard deviation of the normalized I/F (nI/F)  from the down-selected WAC pixels were derived for each band at each sample-return site. For the lunar sample TiO2 values, we used the compositional data reported by [6,7]. Several sample-return sites are found at geologically complicated locations, such as the Apollo 17 LRV2 and LRV3 sites, where the Light Mantle partially covers the surface (within ~200 m radius, the average WAC pixel size in UV). These sites are difficult to obtain WAC ratio values that accurately represent the reflectance of the sampled material, and were thus excluded. A linear correlation was assumed between the TiO2 contents of the lunar samples and the WAC ratio values [2]. The linear-fit line was obtained by least-square fitting, then a near-global TiO2 abundance map was created  using the fitted  line and  the 321/415  nm WAC near-global ratio map (70°S to 70°N and 0°E to 360°E, 64 pixel/degree). The  new  WAC  TiO2 abundance  map  (hereafter called WACTiO2) was then compared with the Clementine  UVVIS  based  TiO2 map  [8]  (hereafter  called CLMTiO2) and the LP Neutron Spectrometer version [9]  (hereafter  called  LPNTiO2).  The  WACTiO2 and CLMTiO2 were compared  in 32 pixel/degrees  (947.6 m/pixel at the equator) to minimize scatter due to georeferencing  and  photometric  normalization  uncertainties [10] in the Clementine mosaic. The LPNTiO2 was sampled at 2 pixels per degrees, thus the WACTiO2 was down sampled for the comparison. Results  and  Discussion: The  lunar  sample  TiO2 values and the 321/415 nm ratios of the WAC normalized  I/F (nI/F)  show  a  strong  positive  correlation (Fig.1,  black  dashed  line  is  y  =  86.2x  -  59.5,  R2 = 0.95). The error bar (standard deviation) is based on all the  selected  WAC  observations  (non  map-projected pixels) thus includes geologic variation within the 800 m box and  nI/F derivation uncertainties. The sample from Luna 16 was excluded from the fit.  The derived WACTiO2 has negative values within most of  the highlands (-0.7  wt% in median,  Fig.  2), suggesting very low ilmenite content. Median and standard deviation in each major mare are shown in Table 1. Compared to the CLMTiO2 (Fig.  4), the WACTiO2 shows systematically lower TiO2 content (2.0 and 1.1 Figure  1. Plot of the TiO2 content of lunar soils vs WAC nI/F ratio (321/415 nm) for each mission.  wt% below CLMTiO2 in the maria and in the highland respectively),  particularly in  high-TiO2 content  maria (e.g.  Mare Tranquillitatis  -3.1 wt%; Fecunditatis  -2.1 wt%; and Oceanus Precellarum -1.8 wt%; see Fig.  4). In some areas (< 0.15% of whole map area) the WAC 321/415 ratios are higher than the highest value of the lunar sample-return sites (0.79, ~8.6 wt%). For those areas TiO2 values were extrapolated from the linear fit line. Thus the highest WACTiO2 values should be interpreted with extra caution. Other studies have proposed that the CLMTiO2 technique overestimates TiO2 abundance in areas  of  high concentrations (e.g.  LPNTiO2 [11], Chang'E1 IIM [13], and HST [2]), consistent with the new WACTiO2 values.  The median value of LPNTiO2 - WACTiO2 in the mare is -1.1 wt%. The difference map (2 pixel/degree; Fig.  5)  represents  that  the  WACTiO2 is  higher  (blue area) in the most areas of maria but lower (deep red area) at Copernican crater ejecta blankets (Aristarchus, Copernicus,  and  Kepler)  relative  to  LPNTiO2.  Since each observation of the neutron spectrometer is based on  a  large  field-of-view (about  700  km in  diameter [11]), each pixel value of LPNTiO2 accumulates signal from a broader  area,  which results in fuzzy geologic boundaries.  Also  the  effective  depth  of  the  neutron spectrometer is deeper (~30 cm [12]) than the UV/visible reflectance (several micron [5]). The sharpness and the sampling depth of the two instruments likely influenced  the differences between the WACTiO2 and the LPNTiO2 as seen in Fig.5. References: [1]  Sato  et  al.
