Among the questions surrounding comets and their elusive character are the properties and processes of the rarefied  gasses  and  disperse  dust  that  surround their solid nucleus. Dusty,  or  complex, plasmas have been studied in laboratory environments and are thought to exist naturally in several types of space environments. The coma surrounding  comet  nuclei  have  been  identified  as  a possible home for dusty plasmas [1]. Within a  complex plasma,  dust  particles  that  become charged  can begin to  interact  with each other, and the system as a whole can exhibit properties such as self-organization  and  wave propagation  similar  to that  seen in a  liquid  or  an atomic crystalline lattice. These structures have been called "plasma crystals" or "coulomb lattices" [2]. Hypothesis:  Coulomb  lattice  structures  within complex  plasmas  can  exist  in  the  coma surrounding comets.  The conditions that  allow these structures to form would be intact at 1.9 AU from Sol as was comet Wild  2  when  the  Stardust  spacecraft  performed  its flyby.  At this distance  perturbation  by solar  wind is minimal yet there is enough solar energy for the sublimation,  photodissociation  and  photoionization  processes of the comet's ice to produce the dusty plasma environment conducive to coulomb lattice formation. Methods:  NASA's Stardust spacecraft performed a flyby of  comet  81P/Wild (Wild 2)  in  2004 and  collected data on the distribution, mass and composition of dust particles surrounding the comet in addition to collecting and returning to Earth physical samples of comet and interstellar  dust.  Data from the Dust Flux Monitor Instrument (DFMI) and the Cometary and Interstellar  Dust  Analyzer  (CIDA)  mass  spectrometer will be used to develop a profile of dust properties that surround Wild 2. A generic comet model to approximately match the geometry [3]  and orbital  position of  Wild 2 at  Stardust's encounter will be developed to create a baseline for  the properties  of  the comet  coma and its  plasma component. For this model, the plasma is assumed to be composed of photoionized hydrogen from gaseous water  that  has  sublimated  and  been  photodissociated from the comet's surface. To  determine  the  existence  of  coulomb  lattice structures within this idealized comet model based on Wild 2,  coulomb coupling parameters  will be  calculated for varying cases. Preliminary Results: Development  of  the  comet dusty plasma model is ongoing. Data from Stardust's DFMI, a polarized plastic (PVDF) sensor system that detects  impacts  of  particles  within  different  mass thresholds,  is  presented  below. This  chart  shows the mass and spacial distribution of collisions that were detected within a 1 kilometer radius sphere around the comet nucleus. Significance: Understanding  the  space  that  surrounds comet nuclei will shed light on some of the dynamic processes that define the near-nucleus comet environment. If the complex plasma in the comet coma is found to be a home of plasma crystals, that would provide further opportunities to observe these macroscopic phenomena in a natural setting. The results of this research can later be compared to further in situ exploration  by  other  spacecraft  such  as  ESA's  ongoing Rosetta mission. References: [1]  Mendis,  D.A.,  and  M.
