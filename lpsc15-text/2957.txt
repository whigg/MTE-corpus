Introduction:  The oxygen isotope composition of the Martian atmosphere is of interest for comparison with recent MSL results [1], and to understand the origin of oxygen isotope anomalies (i.e., massindependent fractionation or MIF) in secondary minerals in SNC meteorites [2], [3]. The SNC secondary minerals (carbonates, sulfates, and water) show small (~0.5-1 permil) 17 O excesses relative to SNC silicates. Various origins are possible for these signatures, including carbonate formation in dust surface reactions involving O3 and H2O2 [4]. Here, we consider other atmospheric processes that can affect oxygen isotopes. MIF signatures are valuable as indicators of very specific processes, e.g., O3 formation, or certain types of photolysis. Much of this isotope chemistry has analogs in Earth's stratosphere and troposphere. Mars atmospheric chemistry: Several potentially important sources of oxygen isotope MIF (i.e., 17 O excess or depletion relative to equilibrium isotope exchange) are shown in Table 1. Our focus here is on reaction R1, spin-forbidden photolysis of CO2. Reactions R2 and R3 (especially R3) are well known sources of MIF in Earth's atmosphere, and are likely to be important in the atmosphere of Mars as well. Reaction R4 is an exchange reaction rather than a MIF source reaction. Another source reaction is H + O2  HO2. Modeling of these additional MIF source reactions is in progress, but will not be discussed further here. The spin-forbidden photolysis of CO2 (R1) is unusual in the Martian atmosphere because of its high reaction rate from the upper atmosphere (80 km) all the way to the ground (Fig. 1). This range of altitudes spans 4 orders of magnitude in atmospheric pressure, and occurs because of the gradual decrease in the CO2 cross sections from 167 to ~200 nm. Previous laboratory photolysis experiments on CO2 in the spin-allowed and spin-forbidden regions have shown evidence for a remarkably large MIF signature ( 17 O excess ~ 100 permil) in O2 product for photolysis at 185 nm [6]. Recent theoretical cross sections for CO2 isotopologues argue that the results in [6] were an artifact of using a narrow bandwidth Hg lamp, and that the MIF signature expected from spin-forbidden photolysis is much smaller in magnitude [7].  CO2 photolysis experiments:  We performed photolysis experiments on CO2 at the Soleil synchrotron using the FTS branch of the DESIRS beamline. High purity, natural isotope abundance CO2 was placed in a 20 cm photocell with MgF2 windows. Experiments were performed at 3 wavelengths (Table 2): 160 nm (spin-allowed), and at 175 nm and 185 nm (spinforbidden). The undulator bandwidth on the DESIRS beamline is 6 % FWHM, so with the beam centered at 185 nm, there is appreciable photon flux form 180-190 nm, making these truly broadband experiments.  Results and discussion:  After VUV exposure, aliquots of the photolyzed CO2 were stored in stainless steel bottles, and sent to the Department of Isotope Geology at the University of Goettingen for O isotope analysis. The results of the isotope analyses are shown in Table 2 and Figure 2. O2 and CO were produced in all experiments. (The volume % of O2 in Table 2 is relative to the total pressure in the aliquot, which can be converted into a photochemical yield.) We expected a CO:O2 yield of 2:1, but instead see a much higher value of ~ 11-16. We do not know the cause of this high ratio, but suspect that O3 may be formed and lost to the bottle walls (without reforming O2). The oxygen isotope composition of the CO in the samples will be analyzed at a later date, and should help to resolve this issue. The oxygen isotope results show that the spinallowed photolysis (experiment D, Fig. 2) yields normal, mass-dependent fractionation in agreement with [6]. Photolysis at 175 nm (E and F), which is mostly spin-forbidden, yields a small positive (or zero) MIF signature. Photolysis at 185 nm, which is entirely spinforbidden, yields O2 with a substantial negative MIF signature ( 17 O ~ -8 to -10 permil). The results at 185 nm disagree in magnitude and sign with the very large positive MIF signature reported in [6]. Our results provide support for the theoretical cross sections of [7], but we have not yet made a detailed comparison using their cross sections. Photochemical simulations of the experiments are in progress to test the possibility that the negative MIF in O2 results from O3 formation. Once we have determined the MIF signature due to spin-forbidden photolysis only, we will incorporate the  results into Mars atmosphere photochemical models. Model results will be reported.
