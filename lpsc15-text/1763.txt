It  is a bright,young crater, ~779 m.y. [1]. Figure 1a shows a portionof the Clementine mosaics at λ = 750 nm. The crater isoptically heterogeneous. There is an amazing feature inthe left upper quadrant of the crater, which is very welldetected  in  color-ratio  (red/blue)  images.  Figure  1bshows a  color-ratio  A(750 nm)/A(415 nm) image  obtained with the Clementine mosaics. This very red feature was discovered many years ago by Whitaker [2].Its unusual color results from a spectrum characterizedby strong ultraviolet absorption. There are several veryred formations [3] attributed to pre-mare material withunusual composition. A portion of such red spots couldbe  surface  manifestations  of  pre-mare  basalts  [e.g.,3,4]. Examples of red spots are the formation Helmetand Riffaeus Montes.  These formations,  perhaps,  arerhyolite extrusions. A question arises: do the Copernicus red spot andthe  red  extrusions  have  commonalities  besides  theircolor characteristics? Objective and source data:  We study the craterCopernicus and its ejecta blanket near the rim, primarily using optical data, to confirm the hypothesis that theCopernicus red spot is a residual of a rhyolite extrusionthat was involved in the impact formation process ofthe  crater.  The  rhyolite  material  could  be  partiallymelted, crushed, and ejected to the crater vicinity. Thedescribed asymmetry (Fig. 1b) of the red ejecta can berelated to the eccentricity, relative to the extrusion, ofthe impact and a to tilt trajectory of the impactor. Clementine mosaics [e.g., 5] and LROC WAC dataare used for the analysis as source data. We also applyLucey’s [6] and LSCC (Lunar Sample CharacterizationConsortium) [7] approaches to assess chemical/mineralcomposition of the studied area. Results and discussion:  First of all, it should benoted  that  there  is  no  topography asymmetry in  theejecta blanket distribution related to the red spot. Themap of slopes calculated from the topography data setGLD100 [8] clearly show this (Fig. 2a). Moreover, wenote the complexity of the impact event, drawing attention to a symmetric slight red ring located immediatelyout of the crater rim (Fig. 1b). We do not find the redasymmetry in the distribution of the parameter OMAT(optical maturity degree) calculated by the corresponding Lucey equation [6] (see Fig. 2b). We obtain essentially the  same results  when we consider  the opticalroughness of the region. This parameter was calculatedfrom LROC WAC images. We use all available imagesto find the phase function for each point of the scene: A(α, i, e) = An exp(–μα) D(α, i, e),                       (1)where A is the apparent albedo (radiance factor),  An isthe diffuse albedo (the normal albedo, if the oppositioneffect  is  absent),  μ is  the  parameter  of  phase-curveslope, and  D is Akimov’s disk function [9]. For eachpoint of the lunar surface, the parameter μ is calculatedusing the least-square method for several tens of sourceWAC images for wavelength 415 nm. Resulting mapare presented in Fig. 3. The results shown in Figs.  2b and 3 demonstratethat the red asymmetry probably was not formed duringthe  evolution  of  the  lunar  surface,  but  arised  in  theprocess of the crater formation. Using  Lucey's  approach  [6]  and  the  Clementinemosaics at λ = 415, 750 and 950 nm, we calculate theFeO and TiO2 abundance presented  in Fig.  4a,b.  Asone can see, low concentrations of ferrum oxide and titanium dioxide are observed on the crater floor and inthe north portion of the ejecta blanket. The values aremore typical  for  highlands than for  maria,  especiallywithin the red anomaly. To  estimate  mineral  composition,  we exploit  thetechnique developed in [7]. We here use Eq. (1) in [7]to calculate the total pyroxene abundance and ratio ofPigeonite/Fe-pyroxene with lunar sample (LSCC) andClementine data. Figure 5a,b shows the distribution ofthe mentioned characteristics over the scene. These images, especially, the ratio Pigeonite/Fe-pyroxene correlate with the color distribution (Fig. 1b). Pigeonite contains more Mg than Fe-pyroxene.  Thus, the red spotcontains an excess of Mg. Like in the case of FeO andTiO2 distributions,  the same mineral  features are  observed on the crater floor and in the north portion ofthe ejecta blanket. The complex crater Copernicus is a typical examplethat demonstrates high occurrence of impact melt deposits. The impact events responsible for forming largecraters may have generated melt that coated not onlythe crater floor, but the surroundings located within ~1crater  radius  from  the  rim.  The  ejecta  deposits  ofCopernicus  contain  a  portion  of  melt  and  crushedbedrock material that may have composition and optical properties distinct from distant surroundings. This1763.pdf

heterogeneity is due to the composition complexity ofthe target area. Perhaps, the red spot seen in Figs. 1b,4a,b, and 5a,b and areas in-and-around the crater contain a large amount of melt and crushed rocks that areformed by including, in particular, target rhyolite material. In spite of evidence for efﬁcient mixing of impactmelt in complex craters, Dhingra et al. [10] documentthe mineral heterogeneity in impact melt deposits on ascale of tens of kilometers in the Copernicus floor andnorthern wall that are spectrally distinct from melt inits immediate vicinity. Our data in Figs. 4a,b and 5a,bare consistent with the conclusion [10]. Figure 1 a,b.  Copernicus crater. Albedo (750 nm) map(a) and color ratio (750/415 nm) image (b).Figure 2 a,b.

We find several confirmations of the hypothesis that the Copernicus red spot can be a residualof a rhyolite extrusion that was involved in the impactprocess,  in particular,  in target  material  melting. Therhyolite body could be partially melted, crushed, andejected  to  the  crater  north-western  vicinity.  The  described asymmetry of the ejecta can be related to theeccentricity, relative to the extrusion, of the impact anda tilt trajectory of the impactor. References:  [1] Hiesinger H., et al.
