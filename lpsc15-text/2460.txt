Introduction:  The history of volcanism on the western near side of the Moon is unique in both its duration and the diversity of basaltic compositions produced.  A recent study has mapped 83 distinct mare deposits in Imbrium based on spectral and spatial variations observed in data from the Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) on Chandrayaan-1 [1].  The reflectance properties of small and optically immature craters within these basalts are examined here as part of a continuing study of the volcanic deposits in this region [1, 2].  Mineralogic interpretations of the Imbrium flows are being combined with stratigraphic mapping to examine the broader volcanic evolution of this complex region of the Moon.  Previous Work:   Volcanism in the Imbrium basin lasted for at least 1.5 billion years [3], with large flows of high-titanium basalts covering older, more extensive deposits of lower titanium basalts within the basin [e.g. 4].   Schaber [5] mapped three extensive flow phases that extend great distances to the north-east across the Imbrium basin and were interpreted to originate from a source near Euler crater (labeled E in Figure 1).  More recent studies of Mare Imbrium have observed patterns of spectral change that suggest increasing olivine and iron contents over time within these flows, resulting in recognizable sequences of volcanism over large areas and absolute ages of emplacement [6,7,1].  Other recent studies have also mapped broad regional patterns of increased TiO2 and FeO over time [e.g. 8].    Thiessen et al. [1] used images created from eight different M3 spectral parameters to map the basalt units in Mare Imbrium.  These images included parameters sensitive to the 1 and 2 μm absorption band position, strength and widths of mafic minerals, as well as the overall albedo of the mare deposits.  Figure 1 shows the outlines of spectral units from [1] overlaid on a mosaic of Mare Imbrium displayed as an M3 integrated band depth (IBD) color composite.  Previous work has compared the average spectral properties of these mare units to assess compositional differences across exposed basaltic units.  However, exposure to space weathering and mixing processes weakens absorption features over time [9].  Examination of the least weathered materials obtained from small optically immature mare craters provides a more diagnostic measurement of the mineralogy of the emplaced basalts and are used here to further characterize the mineralogy of each mapped basalt unit.     Data Analysis:  A large mosaic of global-mode M3 data was created at its full spectral and spatial resolution using data from optical period 1B (Figure 1).  This data covers the wavelength range of ~0.46 to 3.0 μms in 85 spectral bands at a spatial resolution of 140 m/pixel.     Figure 1:  M3 IBD mosaic of Mare Imbrium  with spectral unit boundaries from [1] overlaid in white (red=1 μm IBD, green=2 μm IBD, blue= reflectance at 1.58 μm).  Eratosthenian age mare deposits appear as  redder hues due to weaker 2 μm ferrous bands relative to absorptions at 1 μm while bright feldspathic areas appear blue.  The region shown in Figure 2 is located SW of Euler Crater (E).  The Imbrium mosaic incorporates the PDS delivered reflectance calibrations [10] as well as updated photometric corrections [11].  Separate spatial masks have been created to include the interior of each mare spectral unit defined by [1] while eliminating regions near each boundary and areas of highland kipukas.  Visual inspection of M3 parameter images have identified many regions where mare craters have excavated through relatively thin surface flows to excavate underlying compositional units.  As a result, craters larger than 1 km in diameter and their ejecta have been eliminated from comparisons across spectral units to reduce the inclusion of underlying compositions.  For thin flows (e.g. Figure 2), spectra are further being E 100 km  compared as a function of crater size to characterize compositional stratigraphy.  To identify the least weathered crater materials in each mare unit, the approach of Staid and Pieters [12] has been adapted to the M3 data to map the optical weathering trend of each mare basalt.  This approach uses parameters similar to those of [13] and is being implemented using an IDL algorithm that creates scatterplots of  the 1 and 2 μm integrated band strength parameters versus albedo, fits a linear trend to each plot and then identifies mare craters that fall along each weathering trend with the highest combined albedo and band strength (indicating optically immature surfaces and ejecta).  Craters representing the least weathered materials as a percentage of each unit's surface area are used to compare previously mapped basalt units.    Figure 2: Full resolution M3 IBD data showing part of Rima Euler is overlaid on a Kaguya TC image.  Smaller craters exhibit spectral properties associated with increased olivine (redder) while larger craters sample deeper and more pyroxene-rich basalts.    Results:  M3 spectra derived from optically immature craters in several mare regions are presented in Figure 3.  These spectra are presented after removing a continuum with a straight line approximation from 730-1620 nm and 1620-2620 nm [e.g. 14].  Crater materials from high-titanium flows display broader and longer wavelength absorptions at 1 μm and weaker 2 μm absorptions than the older low titanium basalts.  These results are consistent with previous studies suggesting enrichment in olivine within the mare soils and crater ejecta of the younger high titanium basalts relative to the surrounding low titanium maria [1, 5, 6, 15].  However, detailed examination of the high-titanium flows indicates that this enrichment in olivine is variable on scales smaller than even the detailed mapping of [1].  The average spectral properties of craters within the high titanium flows represent a mixture of ejecta containing both pyroxene-dominated ejecta and smaller, localized craters excavating more olivine-rich layers.  In particular, the spectral properties associated with olivine are primarily observed within the smallest craters sampling the uppermost 10s of meters of these flows with a significant number of craters 1 km in diameter or smaller excavating through to underlying, more pyroxene-rich basalts  (e.g. red in Figures 2 and 3).  Current work is focused on interpreting the mineralogy of mare craters within Imbrium as a function of crater diameter to explore stratigraphic variations in mineralogy related to the evolution of the Imbrium basalts over time.        Figure 3. Continuum removed M3 spectra of the fresh craters materials from two large mare units in Imbrium are compared to the spectra of small craters from the volcanic deposits near Rima Euler (Figure 2).
