Introduction: Small amounts of snowmelt can wet the Mars soil during the Late Hesperian and Amazonian and this would create a 'cool little pond' environment suitable for forming the carbonates in Mars' shallow subsurface. Supraglacial channels and fresh shallow valleys show that surface runoff did sometimes occur; runoff was not spatially correlated with impact events, suggesting climate-driven habitability. Habitable climates could not have been both long-lasting and global because postNoachian terrain lacks deep weathering and erosion, indicating intermittent habitability. We hypothesize that understanding the intermittency of post-Noachian Mars habitability requires better constraints on the role of stochastic, intermittent long-term transitions in obliquity. Obliquity variations are acknowledged to be critical to post-Noachian climate (e.g., [1-10]) (Fig. 1). No existing model (e.g, [8-11]) combines orbitally-resolved full histories for Late Hesperian and Amazonian Mars with explicit (2D) spatial resolution of surface liquid water distribution. A model that incorporates such coupling is crucial to relate MAVEN constraints on atmospheric thinning to the geologic record of late climate-driven surface liquid water.       3.5 Gyr-long orbital forcings: Mars' obliquity varies chaotically, so we generated 18 orbital histories for Mars [4-7] using the mercury6 N-body code [12] to integrate the solar system for 3.5 Gyr. We then applied an obliquity code (10 randomly chosen spin-axis orientations per mercury6 simulation) [13]. The results show a remarkably wide spread of equally possible orbital forcings (Fig. 1). This raises the question - did Mars' small size seal its fate, or are there orbital roads not taken that would have allowed habitable conditions at the present day?       Climate evolution model: To assess the likely consequences of these disparate orbital forcings, we used the spin-orbit output (obliquity, eccentricity, and longitude of perihelion as functions of time) to drive a simple 0123 x 109 020 40 60 80 100 Orbital integration #9 ob liq ui ty (° ) / P (m ba r) Age (Gyr) liquid water, % of peak 0123 x 109 020 40 60 80 100 Orbital integration #6 ob liq ui ty (° ) / P  ( mba r) Age (Gyr) liquid water, % of peak 0123 x 109 020 40 60 80 100 Orbital integration #1 ob liq ui ty (° ) /  P  ( mba r) Age (Gyr) liquid water, % of peak 103 106 108 1010 00.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1Timescale (yr) lo ca l f ra ct al d im en si on  10 Myr desert periods occur even during wet intervals Minkowski dimension of day−integral melt Minkowski dimension of high obliquity  Figure 1. Intermittency of liquid water (peak day-integral melt, blue) predicted by using our obliquity tracks (red) to drive a simple energy balance model of snowmelt. Atmospheric pressure (black) is reduced by escape-to-space and by carbonate formation. Three different, equally likely tracks are shown. Bottom right:  Intermittency of surface liquid water (blue) is much greater than intermittency of high-obliquity (gray). Though the specifics of the tracks differ greatly, the three tracks show common intermittency-spectrum characteristics. For reference, the Cantor set has fractal dimension 0.63.  snowpack energy balance model [10], which was in turn coupled to an atmospheric evolution model. The energy balance model assumes that warm-season snow was only present in cold traps (locations that minimize annualaverage sublimation rate), which is reasonable [10, 14]. It calculates snow temperatures taking into account sensible and latent heat exchange with the atmospheric surface layer, Rayleigh scattering, greenhouse warming, time-of-day, and season, and the solid-state greenhouse effect. The atmospheric evolution model assumes that the initial atmospheric pressure (P) was 100 mbar. If P(t) had not decreased over the last 3.5 Gyr then habitability would have increased over time, the opposite of what is observed. CO2 is currently escaping from Mars at >1 mbar/Gyr. Our escape-to-space parameterization follows [15], scaled to higher UV flux of the young Sun. MAVEN will supply improved escape constraints.       Carbonate formation: Self-consistently calculating P loss also requires considering carbonate formation, because modest amounts of liquid water, P > 0.006 bar, and cold temperatures are sufficient physical conditions for rapid carbonate formation (e.g., [16-17]). Because low melt rates are sufficient to form carbonate but insufficient for runoff, evidence for climate-driven runoff (e.g., [18-20]) implies physical conditions suitable for carbonate formation over a much wider range of locations and times. Carbonate formation must have occurred on Mars to explain the carbonate dispersed in the soil and in Amazonian alteration veins (e.g., [21-22]); carbonate isotopes indicate "[derivation] from atmosphere interaction with only transient water" [23], while (1-5) wt % abundances reported equate to ~1 mbar CO2 drawdown per 105 km3 dust/silt/sand. Because >>106 km3 dust/silt/sand was cycled through the weathering-prone diurnal skin depth since 3.5 Ga (e.g., [24]), there is a potential for liquid water availability to feed back on P (as on Earth) [8, 11, 25]. Although a potentially significant feedback on climate, the amounts of carbonate formed in our models are two orders of magnitude less than in pre-Mars Exploration Program models of Mars climate evolution, and this relatively modest carbonate inventory is consistent with the paucity of bedrock carbonate. We assumed MgCO3 formation within parts of the planet experiencing seasonal melting was limited by the supply of weatherable sand, silt and dust (ρ = 2000 kg/m3) at a deposition rate of ~30 µm/yr [26, 27], giving 3 g/m2/yr of CO2 consumed. This assumes that 10% of the input is converted to MgCO3, high values that are subsequently diluted by mixing with never-weathered materials from outside the spatially-restricted melt zones.        Results: The results show a wide range of possible histories (examples shown in Fig. 1). Size is not fate: Among the modeled ensemble of Mars-like planets, some are habitable at the present day. For this to happen, obliquity has to stay low for most of the 3.5 Gyr-long simulation (so that carbonate formation does not occur), with a "jump" to high obliquity in the recent past. This is an uncommon, but not impossible, circumstance. Although obviously not representative of the Mars in our own solar system, this shows a pathway by which Marssized exoplanets [28] could be habitable late in their histories. Relatively late wet "spikes" define bursts of habitability: Late Hesperian / Amazonian crater-retention ages obtained for alluvial fans can be understood in terms of higher L☉ at later times favoring surface liquid water. Intriguingly, the expectation of >100 comparablywet intervals (given 105 yr quasiperiodic forcing) is flatly contradicted by the results, which instead show a few very wet "spikes" due to rectification at the meltingpoint and buffering of P by carbonate formation (Fig. 1). Intermittency of liquid water at all timescales: Although the details of the orbital histories vary greatly, a common trend is that surface liquid water availability is more intermittent (at all time scales) than are high-obliquity conditions (Fig. 1). Biological isolation of late bursts of habitability: >108-yr global desert conditions are common, due to long periods of low φ. Long global desert intervals define a challenge for the persistence of life on the Mars surface. The longest continuous run of wet years (each wet year has a dry season) is ~60 Kyr.  We are excited by these results. Work in progress consists of refinement and extension to our forward modeling framework to investigate obliquity's role in the greater detail allowed by the LMD GCM (e.g. [29]); we will present initial results at the conference.
