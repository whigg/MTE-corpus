 MEGARIPPLES AND THEIR SEDIMENTARY DEPOSITS ON EARTH AND MARS.  R. Sullivan1, and James Zimbelman2, 1CRSR, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY (rjs33@cornell.edu), 2CEPS, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC, 20013-7012.  Introduction: Aeolian sediments commonly are well sorted, but aeolian megaripples are exceptions,  having bimodal grain size-frequencies.  Distinguishing aeolian megaripple deposits from mixed grain size fluvial deposits is important for martian sedimentary rocks, because indicators of flowing water in the martian past (if revealed by legitimate fluvial deposits) are mission drivers for rovers and landers.  Megaripples (aka granule ripples or coarse-grained ripples [1-3]) develop when saltating sand has sufficient energy to drive coarser grains in creep.  Megaripples typically develop thin surface layers of coarse material overlying interiors dominated by finer, saltation-capable sand [1, 4].  Although crest heights can exceed 1 meter [5], megaripples are relatively minor components of terrestrial aeolian settings (e.g., as interdune features), so have attracted little attention for their potential to contribute to the sedimentary rock record [e.g., 4].  On Mars, however, megaripples have been encountered in many locations by landers and rovers as the most common aeolian bedform class [e.g., 3, 6-9].  Megaripples can be very long-lived on the martian surface [10] due to self-armoring surface layers of coarse materials that become indurated.  For reasons of abundance and durability, aeolian megaripple deposits might be expected in the martian sedimentary rock record.   Distinguishing aeolian megaripple deposits in martian sedimentary rocks is complicated by (1) most outcrops are never imaged at hand lens resolution; (2) outcrops typically are mantled in dust; (3) stand-off images of outcrops typically are obtained from only a single point of view, and usually are returned to Earth only after the rover has already moved on.  Therefore we have undertaken wind tunnel experiments, fieldwork, and image analysis to assist interpretations distinguishing aeolian megaripple deposits from mixed grain fluvial materials.   Field Investigations of Active Bedforms.  Active megaripples were examined for grain size distribution and internal structures at White Sands, NM, Coachella Valley, CA, and Great Sand Dunes, CO.  Coarse fractions were 1-2 mm very coarse sand, with the saltating fraction ~250 µm sand.  The presence of internal structures, particularly foresets of coarser grains, varied widely with setting.  Medano Creek borders the main dune field at Great Sand Dunes, CO, and when the creek bed is dry, grain sizes from dune sand to cobbles are exposed to the wind.  Megaripples develop from this mixture and rapidly achieve good sorting of the coarse material (1-2 mm) over relatively short migration distances. Wind Tunnel Experiments.  All experiments were conducted at the 1-atmosphere wind tunnel at the Arizona State University Planetary Aeolian Laboratory.  Sorting during megaripple development and migration was investigated using 250 µm sand, impacting coarser grains 600-2800 µm divided into nine equal (by mass) fractions.  At 10-12 m/s, megaripples with sorted crests 850-1180 µm developed spontaneously.  Other experiments indicate that creep rates of individual saltationdriven coarse grains decline exponentially with increasing grain size (Fig. 1), leading to very effective sorting within a meter of migration downwind. Figure 1.  Grain creep rate as a function of grain size, for 250 µm sand impacting coarse grains at 12 m/s freestream wind tunnel speed.  Times for individual grains to migrate from their starting points across the camera FOV have been inverted for creep speeds.  Field Investigations of Ancient Deposits:  Horizons of very coarse sand have been reported in several aeolian settings in eastern UT [e.g., 11-12].  Examples within the White Rim Sandstone near Anderson Bottom, and at the J2 Unconformity at Buckhorn Wash, were imaged and measured for grain size-frequency.  Similar to the wind tunnel results, sorting involved narrow coarse modes (1000-1180 µm at White Rim SS, 1700-2000 µm at Buckhorn Wash).  We interpret these sorted, very coarse sand horizons within aeolian strata as reflecting saltation-driven creep during mega ripple migration.  In one instance at Buckhorn Wash, the coarse grains are arranged in structural fashion similar to cross-sections obtained of active megaripples.  Preservation of megaripple structures is more prevalent within Permian sandstones on the Isle of Arran [13], where several trains of megaripples can be identified (e.g., Fig. 2); horizons of sorted ~1 mm grains are also present. Megaripples and Related Deposits on Mars:  At Gale crater, the Rocknest sand shadow has textural characteristics (very coarse sand overlying poorly sorted very fine sand and silt) similar to indurated megaripples reported from the MER Gusev and Meridiani Planum sites [3, 7-10, 14].  Bedforms resembling megaripples have been observed incidentally by the MSL rover on many occasions in drive-direction planning mosaics, and more closely on sols 356, 377, 387, 528535, 601, 630, 669, 673-674, 679, 707, 720, 746, 766, and 799-802.   Maximum coarse grain size at the surface ranges from ~1 mm at some features to ~3 mm in others.  The bedform wheel-scuffed on sol 799 is the first martian example showing relatively abundant internal coarse grains (Fig. 3), although the absence of this feature at previous localities/landing sites can be attributed partly to very limited internal sampling.   So far, possible examples of ancient megaripple deposits (or deposits representing the effects of aeolian saltation-driven grain creep) include two sedimentary rock outcrops in Gale crater.  (1) The sol 746 "North Jubilee Pass" mosaic captured dipping, straight, parallel laminae comprised mostly of grains too small to resolve with Mastcam100 images (locally 250 µm/pixel), as well as scattered very coarse sand grains glimpsed at 4-8 pixels (1-2 mm) across (Fig. 4). (2) Wind-driven grain abrasion of the "Squaretop" outcrop observed on sols 583-585 has exposed horizons of ~2 mm grains (Fig. 5).  No preserved megaripple structures are apparent at this candidate site, and other interpretive information is limited, so the ~2 mm grains might have been derived from saltation-driven creep via megaripple migration, then ultimately were deposited either subaerially or subaqueously.
