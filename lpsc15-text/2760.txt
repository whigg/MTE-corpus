Introduction: The matrices and accretionary rims in CV3 chondrites characteristically contain the Ca-Fe silicates hedenbergite (Hd, CaFeSi2O6), andradite (Ca3Fe2Si3O12), and kirschsteinite [Kir (CaFeSiO4) the Fe-rich end member of a solid solution series with monticellite (Mont) CaMgSiO4]. Thought at one time [1] to possibly have a nebular origin, we recently [2] showed convincing evidence that these phases are of parent body origin. The 53Mn53Cr short-lived isotope system (53Mn half-life ~ 3.7 Ma) has proved very useful for unraveling the chronology of fluid-assisted parent body processes on chondritic asteroids (e.g. [3] and refs. therein). We present here the first such isotopic analyses for Ca-Fe silicates, in order to understand their formation times relative to other chondritic components. Analytical methods: Polished sections of the CV3 chondrites Allende, Leoville, Efremovka, Vigarano, and NWA 3118 were studied at the Smithsonian using a FEI NOVA NanoSEM 600 field-emission gun scanning electron microscope. Because Ca-Fe silicates are especially abundant in the accretionary rims in the immediate vicinity of Ca-Al-rich inclusions (CAIs), we focused our efforts on CAIs that we previously have studied in detail. All isotopic measurements were made using the Cameca ims-1280 ion microprobe at the University of Hawai'i. The analytical procedures used were the same as given in [4], except that we used a Mn- and Cr-doped synthetic glass standard intermediate in composition between kirschsteinite and fayalite in order to reduce the systematic errors in measuring the relative sensitivity factor [(55Mn+/52Cr+)SIMS/(55Mn/52Cr)true] for kirschsteinite that result from using magnesian olivine as a standard [5]. Note that the standard composition is not same as those of CV kirschsteinite and we are working on making more appropriate standard. In general, for all analyses, the 55Mn+/52Cr+ ratio varied greatly during the course of each 120 cycle analysis. This variation reflects real chemical heterogeneity within each crystal. This also made it difficult to obtain analyses with sufficiently high 55Mn/52Cr ratios to be able to resolve excess 53Cr.  Sample descriptions: Andradite occurs exclusively in the oxidized CV3 chondrites [2], and is concentrated in the matrices and accretionary rims around CAIs. Kirschsteinite occurs almost exclusively in matrices and fine-grained rims of the reduced CVs, in the form of individual crystals or clumps of crystals. Hedenbergite occurs in both oxidized and reduced CV3s, intimately intergrown with andradite or kirschsteinite. Kirschsteinite grains in the accretionary rim around the FUN CAI Vigarano 1623-5 are exceptionally large and well-developed (Fig. 1). Figure 2 shows somewhat smaller kirschsteinite crystals near the NWA 3118 CAI 48E. In both cases the temporal relationship with the associated hedenbergite is unclear.  Mn-Cr isotopic compositions: All analyses of andradite and hedenbergite yielded 55Mn/52Cr ratios that were too low (< ~1000) to give resolved 53Cr excesses (Cr*). Consequently no resolvable initial 53Mn/55Mn ratios [(53Mn/55Mn)0] from the Allende Ca-Fe silicates were obtained. In contrast, kirschsteinite from the reduced CV3s yielded 55Mn/52Cr ratios up to ~21,000 and well resolved Cr* excesses. Even so, about half of the kirschsteinite analyses still yielded too-low 55Mn/52Cr ratios. Figure 3 shows the results for kirschsteinite from accretionary rims around three CAIs from Vigarano and NWA 3118. The most data were obtained from the accretionary rim surrounding the CAI Vigarano 1623-5; most data from the other two meteorites gave too-low 55Mn/52Cr ratios. A Model-1 ISOPLOT fit to all of the data gives (53Mn/55Mn)0 = (3.37±0.43)×10-6. Data for Vigarano 1623-5 alone yield a slightly higher value but with a larger uncertainty, (53Mn/55Mn)0 = (4.1±1.8)×10-6. Discussion: The slope given above for all of our data corresponds to an age difference of 3.7±0.7 Ma after CV3 CAIs [7] with D'Orbigny angrite anchor [8,9]. The data for Vigarano 1623-5 alone give a slope within error of the combined, but taken at face value gives a slightly older age, ~2.7 Ma after CV3 CAIs. For comparison and also shown in Fig. 3, data [4,6] for fayalite from the CV3 chondrite Asuka 881317 yields (53Mn/55Mn)0 = (3.07±0.44) × 10-6, which corresponds to fayalite formation in that meteorite at ~4.2±0.8 Ma after CV3 CAIs. Given the uncertainties, our data are entirely consistent with that for the Asuka fayalite, and constrain the Ca-Fe silicates to have formed ~coevally with fayalite on the CV3 parent body.
