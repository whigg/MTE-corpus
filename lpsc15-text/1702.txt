Introduction:  The European Space Agency's spacecraft Rosetta is now in the comet escort phase around 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P/C-G). Onboard Rosetta is the Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis (ROSINA) experiment. ROSINA is a suite of three instruments, consisting of the COmetary Pressure Sensor (COPS), the Double Focusing Mass Spectrometer (DFMS), and the Reflectron-type Time-Of-Flight (RTOF) mass spectrometer [1]. ROSINA Characteristics:  The two mass spectrometers are designed to measure in situ the neutral and ionised volatile material in the coma of comet 67P/C-G. Due to their high sensitivities, measurements of very low particle densities are possible. The two mass spectrometers have high dynamic ranges and complement each other with a large mass range (RTOF) and with high mass resolution (DFMS). The results of both mass spectrometers will allow to detect heavy organic molecules as well as isotopic ratios of the main cometary species. With COPS we are able to derive the total gas densities, bulk velocities and temperatures of the coma. Measurements and Results:  We will present the latest ROSINA measurements, i.e. the time from lander delivery in mid November 2014 until the end of February 2015. Until early February 2015 Rosetta stays in bound orbits at a distance of 20 to 30 km away from the center of the comet. From then on Rosetta performs comet flybys with changing distances from 10 km up to 250 km away from 67P/C-G. During this time the heliocentric distance of the comet changes from 3 AU to 2.2 AU, thus the comet crosses the snow line. We will discuss the evolution of the cometary activity within this given time frame as seen by ROSINA. References:  [1] Balsiger H. et al. (2007) Space Sci. Rev., 128, 745-801.  1702.pdf
