EFFECT OF ENCELADUS' RAPID SPIN ON INTERPRETATION OF CASSINI GRAVITY.  William B. McKinnon, Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences and McDonnell Center for the Space Sciences, Washington University in St. Louis, Saint Louis, MO 63130 (mckinnon@wustl.edu).   Introduction:  Cassini has determined three important gravitational coefficients for Enceladus, J2, C22 and J3 (Iess et al. [1]). The gravity field is nonhydrostatic to 3σ (J2/C22 = 3.38-3.63, as opposed to a nominal 10/3). Iess et al. interpret these in terms of a hydrostatic interior (core) and isostatic (not hydrostatic) floating ice shell. The hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic contributions are separated by assuming the isostatic compensation factor/depth is the same for each gravity term, although this can't be strictly true in the case of a regional south polar sea. Enceladus' rapid (1.37 d) synchronous spin distorts its shape substantially, though, enough that the predicted J2/C22 is not 10/3, but closer to 3.23. Thus Enceladus is farther from hydrostatic than implied in [1]. This leads to the following revision to the internal picture of Enceladus, following the methods of [1]: 1) the core of Enceladus is somewhat smaller and of higher density (190 km radius and 2500 kg/m3); 2) the compensation depth of the global (degree-2) ice shell is ≈60 km, rather close to the base of the ice+water layer; and 3) the compensation state and shell thickness beneath the South Polar Terrain (from J3) remains unchanged at 30-35 km (that is, it is independent of the degree-2 solution). Effect of Rapid Spin on J2/C22:  The deviation from first order of the axial ratios and degree-2 gravity harmonics of synchronous satellites increases with increasing spin and lower density (i.e., with q = ω2R3/GM, where ω = rotation rate, R and M are the mean radius and mass of the satellite, and G is the gravitational constant). The ratio (b-c)/(a-c), where a > b > c are the principal axes of the triaxial figure, is less than 0.25. In particular, to second order in q, J2 increases less than linearly in q, whereas C22 increases greater than linearly. This is not a new result [2], but it is underappreciated. The measured J22/C22 ratio for Enceladus from [1] is 3.507 ± 0.042 (1σ), which should be compared to a hydrostatic ratio of ~3.215 [3], not the canonical 10/3. Enceladus is actually nonhydrostatic at the 10% level. Now, the value of 3.215 strictly applies to a uniform density Enceladus [3], but the argument carries over to a differentiated body. Separating Hydrostatic and Non-hydrostatic Degree-2 Gravity:  Following [1], the contribution of compensated topography to the degree-2 gravity is calculated as a function of compensation factor f20 (= f22 as isotropic compensation at degree 2 is assumed),   Figure 1.  Enceladus degree-2 gravity as a function of topographic conpensation factor. The left-hand axis indicates the Cassini measured values. Moving to the right, subtracting the gravitational contributions from excess topography, yields the hydrostatic contribution from Enceladus' internal structure (assuming the core is hydrostatic). The solution is self-consistent when the inferred hydrostatic values J2,h and C22,h reach the proper hydrostatic ratio [1].  and subtracted from the total degree-2 gravity (either J2 or C22). A fundamentally equivalent approach uses admittances for the non-hydrostatic topography [1,4]. Compensation factors indicate the extent to which the gravity due to excess surface topography is compensated at depth by a mass deficit or excess, and vary by harmonic degree [e.g., 5]. The remainder is the presumed hydrostatic gravity, but only when J2,h/C22,h is in the proper hydrostatic ratio (Fig. 1). This ratio was assumed by [1] to be 10/3, which gives an f at degree 2 of ≈0.27. For a differentiated, rapidly spinning Enceladus, however, this ratio is closer to 0.322-0.324 (strictly speaking, it depends on core density, or more generally, on the normalized moment-of-inertia, NMOI), which from Fig. 1 implies an f20 = f22 = 0.41-0.44. This compensation factor is not that small. Assuming Airy isostasy (shell thickness variation) and complete physical compensation (iceberg-like), this immediately gives a global depth of compensation d from f20 = 1 - [1 - d/R]2 (where R is Enceladus' mean radius = 252.1 km) of ≈60 km.  For Airy isostasy, this compensation depth is the thickness of Enceladus' global, floating ice shell. It is a 2615.pdf

global constraint determined from the measured values of J2 and C22, which were determined by 3 flybys of varying geometry [1]. It is independent of any information from J3, which was only determined on the E19 south polar flyby. The remainder of the degree-3 gravity field is unknown. The Airy interpretation implies a global ocean, albeit one confined to the very bottom of the likely low-density (ice+ water layer). Physical isostasy implies an equator-to-pole shell thickness variation > 10 km; the azimuthal variation is an order of magnitude smaller. As in [1], the degree-3 gravity is uncontaminated by tides or rotation and provides a direct estimate of f30 ≈ 0.33, which from f30 = 1 - [1 - d/R]3 yields a depth of compensation of ~32 km. This is the depth of compensation of the South Polar Terrain, and need not be the same as the global depth of compensation (indeed, it would not make much sense as such). The inferred thinning at the SPT, with respect to the depth of compensation, would be an additional ~4-5 km, depending on estimates of the depth of the south polar depression (-0.38 vs. -0.5 km [6,7]).  Internal Structure of Enceladus as a Function of Core Density:  Shown in Fig. 2 are the core radius and inferred J2,h (to first order) for a simple two-layer structural model of Enceladus, assuming a uniform density core overlain by a 925 kg/m3 density ice shell (ice being a better approximation than water for a 2layer model when most the shell is frozen). For the range in J2,h determined from the compensation model in Fig. 1, the core density should be ~2500 kg/m3 and the average core radius ~190 km (the corresponding NMOI value would be ≈0.33) The sensitivity of structure to the change in J2,h (or C22,h) is such that the differences with respect to the inferred cores in [1] are modest. In fact, calculating J2,h to second order in q for a given structure gives slightly smaller values, which pushes the inferred core density (to match Fig. 1) to slightly lower values as well. What is significant in this analysis the change in compensation depth at degree-2, which is now ≈the same as the total water+ice shell thickness. The implication is that there is a global ocean, but that it is nearly frozen to its base. But it can't actually be frozen or there would be no Airy compensation (as noted in [4]). Furthermore, over the South Polar Terrain the ice shell is much thinner (~30 km and possibly much less, if Airy isostasy is less a matter of mass or force balance than pressure balance at depth).  Other Compensation Mechanisms.  Compensation could be provided by the core itself, but the sense of anomalous core topography, i.e., excess core mass at the poles and a deficit at the equator, would be opposite to that expected from dynamics [8]. Compensation could be provided in a Pratt sense, by a systematic  Figure 2.  Core radius (blue curve) and hydrostatic J2 (black curve) for a two-layer Enceladus model (ice over hydrous and/or porous rock core). The inferred hydrostatic value J2,h from Fig. 1 (blue horizontal bar)  then implies a core radius and density. In this revised gravity interpretation, Enceladus' core is still rather low density, if it is hydrostatic.  shell density variation, but there is no obvious mechanism to make Enceladus' shell composition vary as a function of latitude (nor any independent evidence that this is so). Near-surface porosity variations are possible in principle [7,9], but this would require the heavily cratered north polar region of Enceladus to be less porous than the equatorial regions, which is counterintuitive. Moreover, the very shallow compensation depths would imply f ≈ 0, inconsistent with Fig. 1. Remark on Hydrostaticity:  For the analysis presented here to be valid, the core must be hydrostatic, or very nearly so. This is far from guaranteed [8]. For example, if Enceladus' core density were 3000 kg/m3, excess topography of only 1 km amplitude could provide the same J2.h component as in Fig. 1 (and would require only 0.1 MPa of stress support). Without the hydrostatic stipulation, however, the degree-2 compensation factor cannot be constrained, and the problem becomes indeterminate (although bounded).
