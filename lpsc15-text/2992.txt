COMPARING WDS ANALYSES OF MINERALS IN LUNAR METEORITE NWA 2727 ACQUIRED USING AN ELECTRON MICROPROBE AND A SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE.  S. M. Seddio1and S. N. Valencia2 (stephen.seddio@thermofisher.com). 1Thermo Fisher Scientific, 5225 Verona Rd, Madison, WI 53711. 2Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri, 63130.   Introduction:  The electron microprobe (EMP) has long been the pinnacle of quantitative microanalysis using WDS (wavelength-dispersive spectroscopy). EPMA (electron-probe microanalysis) is a particularly useful analytical technique for the study of planetary materials given its broad analytical range (i.e., B - Pu) and non-destructive nature. Scanning electron microscopes (SEM) are much more common instruments, given their relatively low cost, but are typically associated only with imaging and microanalysis using EDS (energy-dispersive spectroscopy) which lacks some of the analytical rigor associated with WDS.  Here we compare WDS analyses of pigeonite, ferroaugite, and pyroxferroite in lunar meteorite NWA 2727 acquired using an electron microprobe and an SEM. Methods: A thin section of NWA 2727 was analyzed by EPMA using the 5-spectrometer JEOL JXA-8200 superprobe at Washington University in St. Louis. Analytical conditions were 15 kV and 25 nA. The 5 spectrometers were used to count multiple elements concurrently.  The same thin section was then analyzed using a Thermo Scientific MagnaRay parallel beam wavelengthdispersive spectrometer mounted on a field emission SEM. Analytical conditions were 15 kV and 50 nA. Because there was only one WDS spectrometer on the SEM, all elements were measured in serial. Results: Pyroxene analyses acquired using the EMP (red) and the SEM (blue) are plotted on a pyroxene quadrilateral in Fig. 1. Both instruments yield similar results for pigeonite, ferroaugite, and pyroxferroite compositions. Average pyroxene compositions obtained using each instrument are in Table 1. Conclusions: Although WDS systems on SEMs cannot fully match the full analytical capabilities that exist for EMPs (e.g., interference corrections and time-dependant intensity corrections), they can yield quantitative results that rival those obtained using an EMP.
