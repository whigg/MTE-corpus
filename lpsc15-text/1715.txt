EVIDENCE FOR A HETEROGENEOUS DISTRIBUTION OF H2O IN THE MARTIAN INTERIOR. F. M. McCubbin. Institute of Meteoritics, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131 (fmccubbi@unm.edu).   Introduction: The abundance and distribution of H2O within the martian interior will lend important insight into the geologic history of Mars, including the thermal and magmatic evolution of the planet, the processes by which the present day surface was shaped, the composition of the atmosphere, and whether Mars could have once supported and sustained life. Although evidence for abundant surface and nearsubsurface water is strong [1], the possible origin of this water from magmatic degassing of the planet remains one of the most important outstanding questions [2]. To determine the abundances and distribution of H2O in Mars requires a broad set of samples that are representative of the martian interior. At present, our only samples come in the form of martian meteorites, so they make up the bulk of our understanding of the H2O content of the martian interior. Martian meteorites can be characterized by several geochemical and petrologic types. The nakhlites and chassignites are clinopyroxene and olivine cumulates, respectively, that exhibit long-term geochemical depletion but have LREE-enriched bulk compositions [3]. These meteorites may have had a co-magmatic origin [4], and they are grouped here as a single geochemical group of martian meteorites. Another set of martian meteorites includes the shergottites, which are basaltic meteorites that fall into three distinct geochemical subgroups. These subgroups include enriched, intermediate, and depleted based on their distinct bulk rock REE patterns, mineral chemistries, and magmatic oxygen fugacity [5-6]. The characteristics of martian basalts have been linked to different reservoirs in the crust and mantle of Mars [59]. Abundance of H2O in the Chassignite-Nakhlite source: The abundance of H2O in the chassignitenakhlite source has been estimated from kaersutitic amphiboles that occur within olivine-hosted melt inclusions within the Chassignite meteorites. The melt inclusions occur within olivine hosts that possess noble gas signatures that are interpreted to have come from a martian mantle source [10]. The kaersutitic amphiboles are hydrous and based on their H2O abundances, McCubbin et al. [11] estimated that the mantle source has between 140-250 ppm H2O. This abundance of H2O is greater than the depleted MORB source on Earth [12] and supports a hydrous martian interior. Abundance of H2O in the depleted, intermediate, and enriched shergottite sources: The depleted shergottite source has been estimated using apatite compositions in QUE 94201 [13] as well as olivine-hosted melt inclusions in Yamato 980459 [14]. Both of these methods of estimating the H2O content of the martian mantle point to a fairly dry source in the range of 15-65 ppm H2O. The source for the enriched shergottites has been estimated from apatite in the shergotty meteorite and seems to indicate that they were derived from a wet source region with 170-440 ppm H2O [13], although it is not clear whether the source for the enriched shergottites is a mantle source or a hydrated crustal contaminant [15]. The H2O content of the intermediate shergottite source has been estimated from apatite in NWA 6293, which indicates the intermediate shergottites came from a source that is similar to depleted terrestrial MORB [16], which has 57-227 ppm H2O [12]. Furthermore, the H2O content of the intermediate shergottite source is intermediate between the estimates of the H2O content of the depleted and enriched shergottite sources. Distribution of H2O in the martian interior: Based on the estimates of H2O abundances in four different geochemical source regions from the martian interior, Mars has a heterogenous distribution of water within its interior. Some portions of the martian interior are dry compared to the terrestrial mantle while other parts seem to have as much H2O as portions of Earth's interior, if not more. This heterogeneous distribution of H2O is also supported by the identification of at least three distinct H isotopic reservoirs on Mars [17]. It is difficult to determine the extent to which any of these 4 geochemical sources represents the bulk H2O abundance of the martian interior, and it is possible that none of them is broadly representative. Additional samples, preferably collected and returned from the surface of Mars would help place further constraints on this important question.
