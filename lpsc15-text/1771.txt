The different closure temperature of the U-Pbsystem for phosphate complements zircongeochronology in meteoritics. Here we report U-Pbdating results for phosphates from lunar meteoriteDhofar 1442, following our initial report of U-Pb ageson zircons from the same meteorite [5].Samples: Dhofar 1442 is a glassy-matrixregolithbreccia that is rich in clasts, including basaltic,granulitic, and felsic lithic clasts [5,6]. With theexception of the impact-melt breccia (IMB) lithologyof SaU 169 [7], Dhofar 1442 is the most KREEP-richlunar meteorite to date [8]. The provenance of SaU 169and Dhofar 1442 is almost certainly within theProcellarum KREEP Terrane (PKT), likely in thevicinity of a low-Ti mare in the case of Dhofar 1442[6,7].Experiment: In-situ isotopic analysis of U-Pb wasperformed on a large radius magnetic sector multicollector Cameca IMS-1280 ion microprobe at theInstitute of Geology and Geophysics, ChineseAcademy of Sciences in Beijing. The experimentalprocedure for apatite followed those of [9-12]. NW-1apatite (1160Ma) was used as a standard, which comesfrom the same complex of Prairie Lake where theapatite standard (PRAP) used by Sano et al. [13] alsocame from. The spot size is 20×30m.Results: Forty-nine analyses of U-Pb isotopicanalyses were performed on 46 phosphate grains inDhofar 1442, including 13 apatite and 33 merrillite.Uranium concentration is variable from 10 to 492 ppm,and thorium contents from 27 to 1457 ppm. The Th/Uratio for merrillite is variable from 1.3 to 22.3, butconsistently low for apatite (0.4-1.4, with average of ~1). Compared to IMB clast and matrix, the Th/U ratiosof merrillite are rather homogenous in granulite clast(6.8-10.3), norite clast (7-7.9), and basalte clast (10.613.4).Shown in Fig. 1 is orthogonal projection of thetotal 238U/206Pb and measured 207Pb/206Pb compositiononto the Terra-Wasserburg diagram following [14,15].The important advantages of this method are that it isnot necessary to know a priori isotopic composition ofinitial lead.Fig. 1. Terra-Wasserburg diagram for phosphatefrom Dhofar 1442. Solid lines are mixing lines withterrestrial (Earth, black square on the y-axis),primordial (CD, black square on the y-axis) ormeasured in situ plagioclase (Pl, red bar on the y-axis)Pb composition. Dashed lines are discordia lines.Uncertainties are 2.We obtained an concordia intercept age forgranulite clast of 3977 ± 56 Ma (Fig. 1a), norite clastof 3808± 24 Ma (Fig. 1b), and IMB clast of 4153±63 Ma (Fig. 1c). Due to the complex origin, the datapoints of phosphate in matrix are scattered (Fig. 1d)and no intercept age could be regressed. However, thedata cluster cross the concordia at ~4Ga.Compared to the terrestrial common Pb andprimordial Pb isotopic composition, the arrangement ofthe data points appear to be best explained, for themost part, by mixing with the lunar common Pbsources represented by the in situ measurements ofplagioclase in the respective lithologies (red bars onthe y-axis in Fig. 1a-d). Therefore, the common Pbcorrected 207Pb/206Pb age for phosphate with theplagioclase Pb isotopes as common-lead compositionswas evaluated in our study. As seen in Fig. 2, the207Pb/206Pb age age range of phosphate is comparable1771.pdf

to that of zircons in Dhofar 1442. The major peaks ofphosphate corresponds to the major peaks in relativeprobability plot of zircons.Fig. 2. The 207Pb/206Pb age distribution andprobability density function of zircon and phosphategrains in Dhofar 1442. Data source for panel a include[5] and additional new data from this study. Panel bfrom this study.Discussion: Granulitic clats in Dhofar 1442:Granulite is metamorphic rocks presumably formed atdepth from older breccias associated with a largeimpact. From our study, the U-Pb age of zircon grainsin granulite clasts of Dhofar 1442 indicate anmetamorphic event at ~ 3850 Ma (Fig. 2a). However,the upper intercept age of 3977 ± 56 Ma (Fig. 1a) forphosphate in the same clasts is slightly older than theage of zircons. This is hard to be explained bydisturbance of later impacts considering the lowclosure temperature of U-Pb systems for phosphate.Norite clasts in Dhofar 1442: The 3-D concordiaintercept age for phosphate in norite clasts is 3808 ±24 Ma (Fig. 1b), which is significantly younger thanthe age of co-existing zircons (ca. 3950 Ma, Fig. 2a).This sugests that the U-Pb system for phosphate innorite clasts was disturbed by later impact at ~ 3800Ma, which was also reflected as the youngest peak of207Pb/206Pb age for zircon grains in matrix (Fig. 2a).IMB clasts in Dhofar 1442: Impact melt breccias(IMB) are products of crystallization from shockinduced melt. From the earlier studies of Apollosamples, the majority of impact melt breccias haveages falling into a rather narrow time interval between3.92 and 3.85 Ga. Tera et al. (1974) concluded that theage of ~ 3.9 Ga recored an intense bombardment onthe moon and referred this catastrophic event as the“lunar cataclysm” (also known as the Late HeavyBombardment, LHB) [16]. However, more recent workon returned lunar samples and lunar meteoritesconfirms that there are more impact melts older than3.9 Ga [e.g. 3,5,17]. In Dhofar 1442, the U-Pb age ofphosphate in IMB clasts (4153 ± 63 Ma, Fig. 1c) isalso older than 3.9 Ga. Compared to the co-existingzircons in IMB clasts (Fig. 2a), the younger phosphateage indicated that the U-Pb system of phosphate inIMB clast probably was disturbed by the later impactevents. In addition, the peak age of ~4.3 Ga is asprominent as ~3.9 Ga in the zircon age histogram forDhofar 1442 (Fig. 2a). This reinforces the fact that theimpact event at ~ 4.3 Ga was also evident on the Moon.Phosphate grains in matrix: Due to limitedpetrographic information, phosphate in matrix couldnot be directly related to an igneous lithic clasts.However, the 207Pb-206Pb age distribution range ofphosphate grains in the matrix of Dhofar 1442 wassimilar to that from lithic clasts (Fig. 2b). This suggeststhat separate phosphate grains in matrix was probablyoriginated from the lithic clasts of granulite, norite andIMB in Dhofar 1442.The 207Pb-206Pb age of zircon grains in matrixshow a major peak at ~4.3 Ga. While the 207Pb-206Pbage of phosphate was variable from ~3.2 to ~4.3 Ga,with a major peak age around 3.8 Ga. It suggests thatthe U-Pb system of phosphate failed to preserve the oldimpact event, such as the impact of ~4.3 Ga recordedby zircons grains.References: [1] Rubin A.E. (1997) MAPS, 32, 231.
