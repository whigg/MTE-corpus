The particular texture of solidified lava is related to the emplacement dynamics of the parent lava flow. If other factors (e.g., slope, composition, temperature, crystal content) are equal, a'a texture is indicative of high volumetric flow rate and viscosity while pahoehoe texture is indicative of low volumetric flow rate and viscosity [1,2]. In the field, an experienced volcanologist can readily distinguish flow textures in fresh and degraded lava flows and use that knowledge to infer emplacement dynamics. However, a reliable method for distinguishing lava texture in remote sensing data remains elusive making lava texture identification on other planets challenging. For instance, a'a is easily confused with slabby lava as both are rough at the meter scale but a'a forms by brecciation of a cooling crust and slabby forms as previously formed pahoehoe is disrupted by subsequent flow processes. Thus, each indicates unique processes during the emplacement of a lava flow but can easily be confused, thereby leading to inaccurate inferences about emplacement styles and rate. A global dust mantle [3] further complicates lava texture identification on Mars.  This project identifies patterns in surface roughness to differentiate lava flow textures on Earth, and identifies the data necessary to similarly identify lava textures on Mars.    Approach: Data were collected of the December 1974 lava flow from Kilauea Volcano, HI using two different light detection and ranging (LiDAR) techniques. Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) and Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS). Both techniques measure the 2 way travel time of a laser pulse, from the instrument to the target and back to the detector, to build a point cloud of surface locations.  ALS instruments are flown in an airplane and TLS instruments are mounted on a ~1.5 m tripod. Each technique provides a unique perspective and using them together lets us explore roughness characteristics of lava flows at different scales. Meter and decameter scales are apparent in ALS data, while centimeter and decimeter scales are apparent in TLS data. Details about ALS data acquisition are given in [4]. TLS data were collected from nine tripod locations on the surface of the December-1974 flow during a 2014 field season. Data from six of the nine were combined to form one point cloud of surface locations ~500 m square.   Surface roughness is calculated directly from the LiDAR data by first removing regional trends from the measured surface locations. De-trending is achieved following [5] by fitting a regression surface to all measured ground points within a roughness neighborhood (Rn). The standard deviation of the residuals (elevation measurements minus the fitted values) is the definition chosen here to characterize roughness. This roughness value is then assigned to a corresponding pixel; all of the pixels arranged together produce a roughness map. To ensure that meaningful roughness calculations are made, we require 95% of pixels to include a minimum of four elevation points. The smallest Rn where this is achieved is 1.5 m for ALS data and 10 cm for TLS. After roughness maps are made, roughness patterns are quantified following [6].  To calculate roughness patterns, roughness values are binned in 64 levels. Binning is achieved by fitting a step function [7] to the roughness data. Two search windows are then produced to interrogate the resulting 64-level roughness maps. Here, these two windows are referred to as base and shift. Both windows are W pixels square (here, W = 11 following [6]). The shift window is offset from the base window by δ pixels and θ degrees. The probability that binned (i.e., quantized) roughness value i occurs in the base window in the same place roughness value j occurs in the search window is the co-occurrence probability (Cij) defined by the probability function Pr(x) after [7&8] as:           (1)  Cij is found by:                 (2)   where Pij is the number of measured roughness cooccurrences (i and j) between the base and shift windows with a specified number of quantized roughness values, Q (Q =64 in this case). Three statistical measures (mean, homogeneity, and entropy) are then applied to the cooccurrence matrix to identify roughness patterns.   Mean (µ) is the average roughness value within the base window, W pixels square. Rough regions have high µ.      (3)  Homogeneity (HOM) measures how smoothly roughness values change within Cij. HOM increases linearly with the reciprocal of the difference of each i and j pair. Regions with regular changes in roughness within W have high HOM  € Pr(x) = {Cij  (δ,θ)} € µ = Cij∑ W 2 € Cij = Pij Piji, j=1 Q∑     (4)  Entropy (ENT) measures how random the values in Cij are. Increases in ENT are proportional to the log of Cij. Regions with random distributions of roughness values within W have high ENT     (5)  Assigning a color to each statistic (Red: HOM, Green: µ, Blue: ENT) and displaying them together builds a roughness pattern map. A lava texture map [after 9] is then compared to a roughness pattern map.  Results: Observations comparing an updated texture map and roughness patterns are summarized here [Figure]:  - Pahoehoe lavas (Ph) are more homogeneous than slabby lava (Sb) at both the 1.5 m and 10 cm scales - At 1.5 m (ALS), Ph lavas are less homogeneous and more random than at 10 cm scale (TLS). - Slabby (Sb) lavas are rougher and more random than pahoehoe (Ph) at both the 1.5 m and 10 cm scales. - Platy (Pl & BrP) lavas are intermediate and difficult to differentiate from pahoehoe (at the 1.5 m scale).  Interpretation:  A pahoehoe crust formed over slow moving portions of the lava flow resulting in a homogeneous and smooth surface. Where flow sped-up (around obstacles and down-flow from constrictions) the smooth crust was broken forming rough and random slabby lava. Smooth crust is preserved in places that did not experience high volumetric flow rate (up-flow of obstacles and along flow margins).   Planetary Relevance: Terrestrial Laser Scanning enables centimeter scale topography. This "rover-scale" point of view holds a wealth of information. However, topography derived from orbital platforms (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment: HiRISE) is sufficient to differentiate lava flow textures. If lava flow textures showthough the martian dust mantel, roughness patterns in orbital data will be able to identify them.
