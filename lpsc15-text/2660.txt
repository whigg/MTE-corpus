EVIDENCE FOR  LARGE, ANOMALOUS NUCLEAR EXPLOSIONS  ON MARS IN THE PAST. J. E. Brandenburg, Morningstar Applied Physics  LLC Vienna Va Introduction:  Previously, it had been  hypothesized  that  Mars had been  the location of large natural nuclear reactors[1,2], as are known to have occurred on Earth [3]  This hypothesis was prompted by evidence of a large nuclear energy release in Mars past, and was considered the simplest hypothesis to explain the available data. Evidence of  large scale nuclear activity on Mars comes from a variety of sources. It has been a long standing paradox that uranium, thorium and potassium, appear hyper-abundant on Mars surface when compared to Mars meteorites, which are believed to sample subsurface rocks. [4] This suggested a thin debris layer on the surface of Mars, enriched in Th, K and U , and dispersed by some impact or explosion. Thorium and radioactive potassium appear concentrated  in the northern Mare Acidalium in the region of approximately  50 W  55N   with a smaller concentration  in Utopia Planum  centered at approximately  90E  and 55N   with an additional  small concentration at the approximate antipode of  the Acidalium  hot spot  ( see Figure 1and 2).  This pattern suggested a massive explosion, such as the explosive disassembly of a large natural nuclear reactor,   producing a global debris pattern , with a shock wave wrapping around the planet  and colliding with itself at the approximate antipode.   Figure 1. Distribution of radioactive K on Mars                   Figure 2. Distribution of Th on Mars  It is also known that xenon and argon components of Mars atmosphere are dominated by radiogenic isotopes when compared to Terrestrial , Jovian, Solar,  or averaged Carbonaceous Chondrite standards. [5] However, the xenon 129  hyper-abundance  in the Mars atmosphere is not consistent with the operation of a  natural nuclear reactor, which requires moderation  and  slow neutrons to favor creation of  fission on U235 nuclei rather than competing neutron capture processes[6] (Fig. 3)  . The xenon 129 hyper-abundance is also not consistent with spontaneous fission of  U238.(Fig. 3)   Figure 3. Distribution of Fission Xenon Isotopes  Other than  the decay of  large amounts of isolated  Iodine 129,-half-life 15.7 million years.  Xenon 129 hyperabundance is caused by fast neutron fission  and  this is the source  of  its hyper abundance in the radiogenic component  of xenon the Earth's atmosphere that has appeared since 1945 [5]  (Fig. 4 and 5)  2660.pdf

     Figure 4.  Xenon Isotopes in Earth and Mars Atmos.   Figure 5.Radiogenic Xe  atEarth vs Mars Atmos.   Mars meteorites show evidence of  components being irradiated by neutrons with total flux of 1015/cm2 while on Mars [7] based on their Kr 80 abundance,  a strong component of high energy neutron s E > 2.5 MeV has also been found. [8]. However, Eugster has  argued for a cosmogenic origin of this irradiation [9].   Also arguing against the natural nuclear reactor source for these isotopic anomalies is the absence of large craters at either  radiation hot spot.  Instead, spectroscopic features of acid etched  glass has been found at both sites, and no-where else[ 10].  Nitrates, possibly formed by fireballs chemistry, together , with signs of neutron irradiation,  have been detected in ETA79001, [11,7,8] suggesting its possible source region in Mare Acidalium. This suggests large fireballs  in the atmosphere such as Tunguska-like events , with mid-air explosions, but of much greater energy release than  Tunguska.  Calculations of the energy release [2] indicate similar energies as required to form the Lyot impact basin, of the order of 1024 J [12]  Alternative  Hypotheses to a Natural Nuclear Reactor in Mars Past :  The Natural Nuclear Reactor Hypothesis had the merit that it provided a known source  for a  large nuclear explosion  that , in turn, explained   the salient features of Mars isotopic anomalies with one or two events.  However, deeper analysis-the xenon spectrum and absence of large craters-  has shown this hypothesis is inadequate. Therefore,  we must consider other hypotheses that are more complex. The first  hypothesis that will be considered, is that  nuclear explosions  occurred  in mid-air above both  Mare Acidalium and Utopia Planum but that their cause is anomalous , this be called the Anomalous Explosion Hypothesis[ 13]   We will also consider the  hypothesis of explosions  in mid-air  of  two large asteroidal  bodies enriched in Iodine 129 and other fission products and fissional materials. We will call this the TIFRA (Tunguskoid Intrinsically -Fission Rich Asteroid) hypothesis.  Finally the Null Hypothesis , will also be considered, which says that the isotopic anomalies-particularly the xenon 129 hyper-abundance, the K-Th -U  enriched surface layer,  the neutron  irradiation in the Sherggotites  and finally the acid-etched  glass at both the radioactive hot spots,  is simply due to variety of independent causes unique to the large and geologically active environment of Mars and its proximity to the asteroid belt.
