Introduction:  The HED meteorites have long been thought to have originated from Vesta. This interpretation was confirmed by Dawn’s visit to Vesta in 2012 [1].  Fu et al. [2] analyzed the HED meteorite Allan Hills ALHA81001 and determined that the remanent magnetization of the meteorite likely formed in the presence of crustal fields about 12 microteslas (µT). The Dawn spacecraft was not equipped with a magnetometer to confirm these results; however, the photomultiplier tube associated with the Bismuth Germanate (BGO) scintillator that is part of Dawn’s Gamma Ray and Neutron Detector (GRaND) instrument [3] is sensitive to strong magnetic fields. The gain of the photomultiplier tube varies with both the magnitude and direction of the present magnetic field (Figure 1) [4].  Here we attempt to use the variation of the gain of the photomultiplier tube as Dawn orbits Vesta as a proxy for any crustal fields that may be present.    Figure 1: Response of the photomultiplier tube to present magnetic fields.   Approach:  A magnetic field can affect the output of the photomultiplier tube by deflecting the electrons as they travel from the photocathode to the first dynode. A changing magnetic field can be observed by shifts in the prominent peaks in the gamma ray spectrum. However, other variables such as temperature, galactic cosmic rays, live time, and solid angle can affect the gamma ray spectrum as well. We attempt to elimate these factors in our analysis procedure.  Due to the arrangement of the photomultiplier tube, it is most sensitive along one axis (defined as the X axis in Figure 1).  Fortunately, the defined axes of the photomultiplier tube are well aligned with the coordinate system defined for the spacecraft. We can monitor how the output of the photomultiplier tube changes as the sensitive axis varies in orientation with respect to the surface, while in close proximity to Vesta. Method:  We analyzed calibrated gamma ray spectra, housekeeping, ephemeris and pointing data [PY13] to correlate gain shifts with orientation and other variables such as instrument temperature.  Note that the spectra have already been corrected for gain on long time scales (250x70s measurements, a little bit longer than an orbit).  Variations due to local magnetic fields must be present in this data set on shorter time scales. To obtain an optimum trade between statistical accuracy and spatial resolution, we averaged over 25 spectra, which is about one tenth of Dawn’s orbit. Here we examine variations in the centroid of the electronpositron annihilation peak at 511 KeV. This is the most intense peak in the spectrum and has the highest signal to noise ratio. The gamma ray peaks are super-imposed on a power-law background continuum. To isolate the annihilation peak, the background continuum was removed with a linear fit to the log counts as a function of log energy between the annihilation peak and the next consecutive peak (channels 46-59 highlighted in cyan in Figure 2, left). The peak (Figure 2, right) was then fitted to a single Gaussian probability density function, which is appropriate for scintillators.  Figure 2: Example of peak fitting procedure.  Results: We then sorted the data into equal-area bins by latitude and longitude and mapped the average change in peak position at a particular location for a specific altitude range.

present, we would expect to see the annihilation peak at a particular location have its largest shift closest to Vesta and gradually return to its reference position with increasing distance from the surface. We can detect this change in shift by comparing Dawn’s Low Altitude Mapping Orbit (LAMO) and the High Altitude Mapping Orbits (HAMO1&2); the former orbits at ~165-300 km from the surface and the latter orbits ~640-765 km from the surface. By comparing the maps from LAMO and HAMO, we can check for consistent shifts of the peak with relation to a point on the surface and if that shift is constant in direction and decreasing in magnitude with distance. We must be cautious of other factors that affect the spectrum when we interpret these results. After applying our fitting procedure, a correlation coefficient of r<0.2 was found for each variable mentioned previously, allowing us to eliminate the possibility that the change in peak position is attributed to external factors. Other sources of magnetic fields, such as the solar wind and from the spacecraft, do not cause shifts in the spectrum. The solar wind is too weak (~few nanoteslas) to substantially deflect the electrons in the photomultiplier tube. For this study, we only use data from when the spacecraft is operating at nominal settings so background magnetic fields originating from instruments on the spacecraft will be constant will not casue a change in the LAMO and HAMO spectra.
