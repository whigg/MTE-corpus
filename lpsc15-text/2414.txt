Introduction:  Analyses of Mercury's surface by the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft have determined that large portions of the surface consist of plains, likely of volcanic origin, with a range of compositions similar to Mg-rich basalts and basaltic komatiites [1-3]. However, the compositional heterogeneity across Mercury's volcanic plains cannot be the result of fractional crystallization of magmas derived from a single source composition and instead require that the plains are products of partial melting of at least two distinct mantle lithothologies [2, 4]. Mantle heterogeneity is also an expected consequence of crystallization of an early magma ocean on Mercury generated by the heat from planetary accretion and differentiation [5]. Although magma ocean models prior to MESSENGER orbital observations did not account for the high sulfur surface abundances and low oxygen fugacity of magmas on Mercury [e.g., 3], these models nonetheless provide insight into the range of mantle stratification possible after magma ocean solidification was completed [5]. Whereas studies of mantle convection on Mercury to date [6, 7] have examined a wide range of mantle thicknesses, viscosities, radiogenic heat contents, and temperatures, such models have not addressed the role of compositional stratification.  In this study, we investigate the effects of compositional stratification on the form and vigor of mantle convection and the extent and duration of partial melting.  Model:  By employing a three-dimensional (3-D) spherical finite-element convection model (CitcomS) [8-10] that simulates mantle convection through the governing equations for conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, we examine mantle convection and melting for a compositionally stratified mantle.  We note that our version of CitcomS has been modified to allow for mantle partial melting of dry peridotite [11], secular cooling of the core [12], and evolution of radiogenic heat production [6]. We implement a temperature- and depth-dependent rheology and employ a nominal reference viscosity of 1020 Pa-s for a mantle with a reference density of 3500 kg-m-3.  Our models begin at 4.5 Ga. Results and Discussion:  For a 400-km-thick mantle, we investigate the role of compositional stratification through three models: (a) a homogeneous density mantle consistent with past models for mantle convection on Mercury; (b) a mantle with density that increases linearly with depth by 500 kg-m-3, representing a likely maximum density contrast between the bottom and top of the mantle (determined from [6] and excluding the possibility of a plagioclase floatation crust); and (c) a mantle with density that increases linearly with depth by 200 kg-m-3, consistent with a postmagma-ocean overturn density profile [5].           Cross sections of mantle temperature for models shown in Figure 1 illustrate that a compositionally stratified mantle decreases the amplitude and size of the mantle convective cells, thus accommodating more numerous but smaller convective cells.  As shown in 400 K                                                                    1900 K A B C   Figure 1.

Figure 2, the compositionally stratified scenarios allow the lower mantle to more readily retain heat, yielding later, more intense periods of higher temperatures (greater than 1900 K) sufficient to produce late-stage partial melting. Compositional modeling and melting experiments indicate that Mg-rich compositions similar to the northern and intercrater plains likely have liquidus temperatures in the range of 1600-1800 K (at 1 bar) [3, 4, 13]. Although all models tend to concentrate heat within ~50 km of the core-mantle boundary, the model with a density gradient of 200 kg-m-3 from the top to the bottom of the mantle (consistent with magma ocean models) concentrates heat most effectively.  We also note that the model timeframe (~400-1100 Myr) encompasses the likely ages of the intercrater plains (~4 Ga) and major expanses of smooth plains  (~3.7-3.8 Ga) [14, 15].   Summary: Our results indicate that a compositionally stratified mantle on Mercury could yield the highdegrees of partial melting indicated by Mg-rich basaltic and basaltic komatiitic compositions observed on the surface.  Given that the volcanic plains did not form from magmas derived from a single source material [2, 4], lateral heterogeneity in the mantle or largeamplitude mantle convection may be required in the interval between emplacement times of the two types of plains.
