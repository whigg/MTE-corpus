Introduction:  The search for minerals and other materials  from  the  wealth  of  imaging  spectroscopy data  being  returned  from  Mars  poses  a  formidable task.  Most recent mapping has required human intensive massaging/filtering of image cubes and mapping by parameters [1, and references there in].   The new CRISM Map-projected Targeted Reduced Data Record (MTRDR) image cubes [2]  enable a  new sophistication in detection and mapping of materials.  We have developed a  new version  of Tetracorder  [3]  that  expands capabilities and wavelength range allowing for more capability of the expert system used for identification and mapping of materials in CRISM data. The new system includes automated  curved continua  to detect  trace  compounds  whose spectral  features are superimposed on other spectral features.  For example,  curvature  of thermal  emission  spectra  and water absorption spectra in the 3 to 4-micron region or absorption  by broad  2-micron  pyroxene bands  cause false  positives  when  searching  for  spectral  features that  are  narrow on the scale of the curvature  of the continua.  Curved continua reduces false positives, enabling weaker spectral features to be detected. We are assembling a new expert system for materials mapping on Mars that includes successful and extensively field checked expert systems that  have been used for mapping minerals, organics and other materials  with  terrestrial  imaging  spectrometers.   We can now search hundreds of minerals, amorphous materials, organic and inorganic chemical compounds in under 30 minutes per CRISM scene using a standard PC with an Intel I7 CPU. Tetracorder:  Tetracorder [3] is an expert system that  applies  multiple  algorithms  to  identify spectral features. The main identification algorithm is a modified least  squares  system that  compares  spectral  features to a spectral library and includes areal as well as intimate mixtures and coatings.  Overlapping absorption  bands  can  be detected as  mixtures  (example  in Figure  1  showing  epidote,  prehnite  and  epidoteprehnite mixtures in a Martian crater). Subtle band shifts  of spectral  features  have been shown  to  change  with  chemistry  enabling  small changes  in  chemistry  to  be  mapped  with  imaging spectroscopy [3], for example, aluminum substitutions in muscovite, or solid solution series, for example NaK alunite.  We show changes in the wavelength position of adsorbed H2O around 1.9 microns in Figure 2. Results:  The  CRISM  MTRDR  merged  image cubes [2] register the short and long wavelength channels of the instrument,  allowing a full spectral analysis,  from the  near-UV to 4-microns.   This  includes broad  spectral  features  that  bound the  short  to long wavelength  channels,  such as olivine and  magnetite, both of which abundantly map. In  scenes studied  so far,  adsorbed water  is  common, but the band positions vary with local mineralogy (Figure  2).   Olivine,  pyroxene,  magnetite  and Fe3+-bearing  minerals  are  widespread.   Consistent with  previous  studies,  alunite,  chlorite,  nontronite, and Fe, Mg-bearing phyllosilicates are found. To date,  no organic compounds have been found, though some spectral  structure  is  observed in  the 3micron region.   Organic chemicals could survive for periods after  exposure,  for example,  due to a  recent landslide.  Solar UV will erode organic chemicals on the surface, so none are expected to survive for long periods. The latest mapping results will be presented at the meeting. References: [1] Viviano-Beck, C.
