This includes the planet itselfand the major satellites that orbit in the planet’sequatorial plane. The current paradigm for the causeof this property is that the planet experienced a giant off-axis impact by a large body (of the orderof one Earth mass) some time after its formation.Since the seminal work of Slattery et al (1992) [1]two decades ago there has not been a major effortto study this problem. We are currently carryingout a new set of simulations using the same method(Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics) as Slattery et al[1] but with one hundred to a thousand times bettermass resolution (106-107 SPH particles).We are employing the parallel tree-code developed by Warren and Salmon (1992) [2] withSPH capabilities enhanced by Warren and Fryer forastrophysical applications and extensively used incosmological simulations and hydrodynamics (e.g.Warren et al., 2006, 2013; Fryer et al., 2006 [3, 4,5]).Here, we report on the findings obtained fromour initial suite of 35 SPH simulations of the impactorigin of the obliquity of Uranus.Initial conditions The initial conditions aregenerated using the algorithm introduced by Diehlet al [6] and further improved by Teodoro et al [7].Briefly, the target and impactor are generated according to density and temperature profiles that aresampled by a set of SPH particles in a regular grid.To verify whether such a configuration is in hydrostatic equilibrium we compute the forces at the particle location using the SPH code and we move theSPH particles according to the net hydrodynamicalforce at the particle location. We repeat this procedure until hydrostatic equilibrium is reached. Typically one hundred steps are required to reach convergence.The rock/iron core is assumed to be isothermal.The velocity of the impactor is set at 5 km/h at infinity. The temperature at 1 bar is such that it agreeswith the current observed effective temperature (78K at P = 1 bar).Our suite of simulations explores a range of parameter space and tests the conclusions of the workby Slattery et al. Furthermore, it takes advantageof the vastly higher mass (and spacial) resolutionto place additional constraints on the process, bymeans of investigating possible post-impact satellite formation. Additionally, we are currently testing various combinations of proto-Uranus structuresand compositions with the aim of constraining theimpact given our present-day knowledge about theinterior of the planet.Equations of State (EOSes) are importantcomponents of hydrodynamic simulation programs.This is especially true for calculations that includemultiple materials, as these do. Based on ourknowledge of planetary bodies, we require the ability to represent iron, silicate material (e.g. dunite),ices (principally H2O ice), and hydrogen-heliummixtures. We focused on incorporating advancedformulations, such as ANEOS, or SESAME fromthe Los Alamos National Laboratory, which aretoo complex to be efficiently evaluated analyticallyduring a calculation, and are thus represented intabular form which can be used as look-up tablesfor interpolation during a simulation. Componentssuch as iron or silicate material (“rock”, representedby dunite) are presently incorporated in tabularform (SESAME iron, ANEOS dunite). SESAMEis provided by T-1 Group at Los Alamos NationalLaboratory (http://aphysics2.lanl.gov/opacity/opacdocs/sesame.html), and2916.pdf

2Figure 1: Snapshot images rendered from our planetary collision simulation. Colors represent the logarithmof projected density. White and blue denote the high- and low-density regions, respectively. The imagesare chronologically ordered from the left to the right. The initial impact comes into the system from theupper-right, making initial contact with the proto-Uranus with a relative velocity of 5 km/h. In the center,the “impactor” and initial debris approaches for a secondary collision. In the bottom row, the cores of theproto-planets have merged, leaving an orbiting stream of iron-poor material. This simulation used over 1SPH million particles with the equations of state detailed in the text. The images show the events up to ∼20hrs after the impact. The different snap-shots represent the time-steps 200, 1200, 4000, 10000 and 17000.ANEOS is described by Thompson and Lauson(1984). We have successfully implemented routinesto read the EOS tables and interpolate from theminto the hydrodynamics code and are able to makeuse of SESAME and ANEOS tables. However,we have found that our initial formulation of theinterpolation routines adds a significant amount ofcomputational time to the calculation, comparedto a simple analytic EOS, such as a perfect gasor analytic formulae such as those presented byHubbard and Macfarlane (1980) for outer-planetstructure models. We are also at the present timeusing an analytic representation for ices in Hubbardand MacFarlane (1980).References[1] W. L. Slattery, W. Benz, and A. G. W.
