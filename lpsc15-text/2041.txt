We have unambiguously linked them to current activity, in the form of tiny jets arising from the upper area of their walls. These pits are found in different types of terrains, but appear to be clustered in small groups. This indicates that the heterogeneity seen in the surface exists also in depth; the physical and compositional requirements to form pits are not met everywhere on the nucleus. Pit shapes and locations do not appear to be correlated with latitude and illumination conditions. There is however a possible link between pits and ageing of the surface. Active pits are sharp and deep whereas pits currently inactive are shallower and filled with debris and possibly more characteristic of an aged surface. While pits are indeed active now, the current sublimation rate does not account for their formation and morphology. Such features must be formed during a shorttimed event. These can be explosive (outbursts) or more like a sinkhole process. Comparisons with other comets and early detection of outburst from 67P in April 2014 [3] tend to rule out explosive events and we believe pits are more likely to be formed by a collapse of the surface on a cavity underneath. This cavity is either primordial or formed by the sublimation and subsequent escape of volatiles deep below the current surface. This sublimation can take place only if we consider pockets of super volatiles or invoke secondary sources of energy such as the phase change transition of water ice.   We interpret active pits as the prototype of early cometary activity, when the comet's interior has not yet been heavily processed by many orbits in the inner Solar System, and the expression of large compositional and structural heterogeneities within the nucleus. This bears important consequences for the formation of 67P by favoring formation scenarios that are capable of producing such a complex internal structure.
