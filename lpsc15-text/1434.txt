PHOTOMETRIC LAMBERT CORRECTION FOR GLOBAL MOSAICKING OF HRSC IMAGE DATAS. H. G. Walter (sebastian.walter@fu-berlin.de), G. Michael, S. van Gasselt, T. Kneissl, Planetary Science andRemote Sensing Group, Institute for Geological Sciences, Department of Earth Sciences, Freie Universitaet Berlin,Malteserstr. 74-100, 12249 Berlin, GermanyIntroduction: The High Resolution Stereo Camera(HRSC) is a push-broom image sensor onboard MarsExpress recording the Martian surface in 3D and color[1, 2]. Being in orbit since 2004, the camera has obtained over 3,600 panchromatic image sequences covering about 70% of the planet’s surface at 10-20 m/pixel.The composition of an homogenous global mosaic is amajor challenge due to the strong elliptical and highlyirregular orbit of the spacecraft, which often results inlarge variations of illumination and atmospheric conditions between individual images. For the purpose of aglobal mosaic in the full Nadir resolution of 12.5 m perpixel we present a first-order systematic photometric correction for the individual image sequences based on aLambertian reflection model.Example region: To give an example for the effect of the photometric correction, we assemble a mosaic from the uncorrected images and compare it withthe mosaic of the photometrically corrected images. Theplanned global HRSC image mosaic effort will be basedon the USGS MC-30 quadrangle scheme. For this comparison we chose the half-quadrangle MC-10 east (MC10E) as the sample area. It covers the eastern part of theLunae Palus Region with the the dark basin of ChrysePlanitia to the east and parts of the Kasei Valles to thewest. Furthermore, it covers the high albedo region ofLunae Planum in the south. As such it contains typicalfeatures for geomorphologic investigations like low andhigh albedo areas as well as steep topography and homogenous planes.HRSC spectral reflectance: During the radiometriccalibration of the HRSC data, values for the reflectancescaling factor and the reflectance offset are added to theindividual image labels. These parameters can be usedfor a linear transformation from the original DN valuesinto spectral reflectance values. The spectral reflectancevaries with the solar incidence angle, topography (changing the local incidence angle and therefore adding an extageometry factor for each ground pixel), the bi-directionalreflectance distribution function (BRDF) of the surface,and atmospheric effects. Mosaicking the spectral valuestogether as images sometimes shows large brightness differences (see Fig. 1a for the mosaic of the sample region).The major contributor to the brightness differences between two images is the differing solar geometry dueto the varying time of day when the individual imageswere obtained. This variation causes two images of thesame or adjacent areas to have different image brightnesses. The histogram of the mosaic in Fig. 1b showsmany maxima of the brightness distribution and is obviously not showing the true albedo distribution of thesurface. A scatter plot of the spectral reflectance versusthe incidence angle (measured as the angle between theSun and the surface normal) reveals a high (negative) correlation between the pixels’ brightness values and theirincidence angles (see Fig. 1c).Photometric correction: As a first-order correction for the varying illumination conditions and resulting brightness variations, the images are corrected forthe solar incidence angle by assuming an ideal diffuselyreflecting behaviour of the surface. This correction requires the calculation of the solar geometry for each image pixel by an image-to-ground function. For the calculations we are using the VICAR framework [3] and theSPICE [4] library. Under the Lambertian assumption,the reflectance diminishment resulting from an inclinedSun angle can be corrected by dividing the measured reflectance by the cosine of the illumination angle. After rectification of the corrected images, the individualimages are mosaicked together (see Fig. 1d). The overall visual impression shows a much better integration ofthe individual image sequences. Fig. 1e shows the histogram for the mosaic of the corrected images consistingof a narrower bimodal distribution of the values. A smallmaximum at ∼0.2 and a larger maximum at ∼0.3 represent the low albedo and the high albedo features from thesample area, respectively. As can be seen in the scatterplot of Fig. 1f, the correction resolves the direct correlation between the reflectance and the incidence anglesfrom the data.Conclusion/outlook: The Lambert correction showssignificant improvements for the purpose of image mosaicking. The correction does not account for topographic, atmospheric or BRDF influences to the measurements. Topographic effects could be treated as described by [5] and [6]. Since the main purpose of theglobal HRSC image mosaic is the application for geomorphologic studies with a good visual impression ofthe albedo variations and the topography, the remainingdistortions at the image seams can be equalized by nonreversible image matching techniques [7].Acknowledgements: This work is supported by the German Space Agency (DLR Bonn), grant 50 QM 1301 (HRSC onMars Express), on behalf of the German Federal Ministry forEconomic Affairs and Energy.References: [1] G.
