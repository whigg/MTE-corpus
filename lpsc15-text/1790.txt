Introduction:  Moreux Crater (42.1° N, 315.6° W) (Fig.1), a 135 kmdiameter impact basin in the Protilus Mensae Region, is located in the northern part of Arabia Terra, at the edge of the southern highlands, and its southern portion represents the dichotomy boundary, dislocating the regional scarp [1] [2].  Fig. 1: Location map of the study area. CRISM1: HRL0000BEC3; CRISM2: HRL0000B2FF. CRISM3: FRT000189FF. First analysis of Moreux Crater reveals that the topographic setting of the crater dominates the wind flow direction, leading to the development of a sand transport pathway encircling the central peak of the crater [3]. Here we focus our attention on dark sand material arising from a crevasse (Fig.1a) in the southern portion of the investigated crater.  This example gives spectral evidences for a mineralogical correspondence between the emerged dark material and the large dark dunes on the floor of the crater. Morphometric analysis in the southern area of Moreux Crater provide further insights that the studied "dark layer" represents one of the possible local sources for the circulating dark material on the floor of Moreux Crater. Methods:  We used two stereo pairs of CTX images and another one of HiRISE centered in the Moreux Crater for the spatial analysis of the surface morphology; we produced the digital terrain models (DTMs) with the A.S.P. [4] on which the images were orthorectified and co-registered. All these data were included in a GIS environment. CRISM observations provided compositional constraints on the dark sediments. CRISM data were processed and analyzed as described in [5]. Analysis of the southern portion of Moreux Crater. According to [6], [7], the southern portion of the crater is characterized by a flow of ice rich debris feature (Fig.2) that have provided erosion/deposition of the crater surface over the rim and the wall.  Fig.2: 3d perspective view of a CTX image realized with A.S.P. showing a flow feature. CTX image P15_006845_2222_XN_42N316W. The flow feature here illustrated, follows the topographic gradient of Moreux rim wall and create a sort of lobate flow along the valley [7].  The same valley is characterized by a slump deposit that incised it as illustrated in the Fig.1a. Fig.3: HiRISE image overlaying a DTM, showing the slumped deposit.

 These depositional features have incised ~10 km the Moreux wall and have a width that varies from 100 m till 200m.  HiRISE topographic profile illustrated in the Fig.4 shows the absence of possible obstacles in the path over which the flow has taken places, but it highlights possible accumulation zones downslopes of the crater rim.  Fig.4: HiRISE Topographic profile relative to the Fig. 3.  Analysis of CRISM data:  CRISM spectra extracted from the large dark dunes on the floor of the crater (CRISM1 and CRISM 2 of the Fig.1) exhibits strong mafic signatures. Spectra extracted from the north dark dune field (Fig.5) and the westerly barchans dunes have a predominant and wide absorption band ~ 1250 μm (this band is a mix of three absorptions mid in 850, 1050 and 1250 μm [8]) compatible with olivine signatures.  Fig.5: A) HRL000BEC3 CRISM tile located to the north of the central peak (see Fig. B) The red square indicate where the spectrum have been extrapolated and compared to the spectra of pyroxene from the standard spectral library. Fayalite mineral absorption is also compatible with the shape of the extracted spectra of the dunes [9]. Other spectral analysis reveal the presence of highcalcium pyroxene consistent with a band around 2.1 μm. Our last observations reveal that the pyroxene is the prevailing mineral of the Moreux large dark dunes. On the eastern downslope wall, we observed a slumped deposit well documented by HiRISE image.  This area is characterized by a contemporary coverage by HiRISE dataset and CRISM observation (CRISM3 in the Fig.1). CRISM spectra extracted from this last data reveal that the incisions illustrated in the Fig.3 are consistent with the pyroxene spectral band.  Conclusions:   Collectively, our preliminary study is in agreement with the composition of the majority of the dark dunes on the martian surface [10].  A combined analysis of high resolution images and mineralogical data emphasizes that the aeolian dark material can be deposited into the crevasses of the slump deposits (acting as sediment trap) in the downslope wall eastern portion of the crater. Subsequently these "dark layers", such as one of the possible local sources, may be eroded and accumulated on the crater floor. This first analysis gives further constraints to the previously obtained results [3] and it highlights that Moreux dark dunes encircle the central peak of the crater.
