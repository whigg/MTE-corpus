Late giant impacts are necessary for the creation of terrestrial core dynamos. Otherwise, stable compositional stratification of the core naturally occurs. Introduction: The light element composition and structure of terrestrial planetary cores is unknown. Earth's core is approximately 32% of its total mass and is likely composed of  ~90% iron and nickel, however the remaining ~10% consisting of light elements cannot be directly inferred from seismological measurements because composition and temperature are degenerate [1,2]. Possible light element compositions include major contributions from Si, O, S, C, and/or H [3]. The structure of these light elements in the outer core is also controversial [3]; they may be well-mixed or arranged in a stratified layer possibly corresponding to the ~150 km thick F-layer [4]. However, too much stratification in a planetary core could prevent a dynamo [5].  We approach core composition and stratification from an ab initio modeling perspective. We model the accretion of the terrestrial planets using an N-body numerical simulation. Afterwards, we assign compositions and oxidation states to each planetary building block, i.e. the planetesimals and embryos. As these bodies collide and grow, we use a sophisticated planetary differentiation model based on high pressure laboratory experimets to track element partitioning between the growing mantle and core [6].  Grand Tack model: The terrestrial planet formation model which meets the most constraints is the Grand Tack, named for the inward-then-outward gasdriven migration of Jupiter and Saturn. Jupiter goes deep within the terrestrial region (~1.5 AU) truncating the inner protoplanetary disk of planetesimals and embryos at ~1.1 AU. The Grand Tack model explains the low mass of Mars [7], the delivery of asteroidal water to the Earth [8], the compositional structure of the asteroid belt [7], and is compatible with giant planet dynamics in a gas disk and the evolution of the Solar System in the Nice model, which takes place ~500 million years later [9]. Models without giant planet migration cannot reproduce all of these features. We use numerical Grand Tack N-body simulations from [7,8,10]. All Earth-like planets must be within a factor of two of mass of Earth and have a late accreted mass less than 1% of its final mass. Late accretion is the additional mass added to the planet after the last giant (embryo) impact [11].  65 70 75 80 85 90 95 1000500100015002000250030003500Iron and Nickel Hwt%LRadiusHkmL Figure 1 - Raw iron and nickel contents of the cores of five Earth-like planets as a function of radius, i.e. each line. Each core accretion event has a distinct composition and so without mixing the core has many discontinuous layers.  Planetary differentiation model: Since each planetary building block is assigned a CI-like composition (for non-volatile elements) and an oxidation state that varies with distance from the Sun, core formation after each accretion event can be modeled in detail for 14 elements including Fe, Ni, Si, O, and H using mass balance and lab-based partitioning data. Sulfur and carbon are currently not included in the model due to complex composition dependent partitioning. In each simulated planetary system, the mantle of the identified Earth-like planet is fitted to the Earth's mantle by varying the parameters of a protoplanetary disk oxidation state model. This planetary differentiation model is described in detail and applied to systems similar to those presented in [6]. The best fit protoplanetary disk oxidation state models for each system are very similar to one another and produce very good fits to the Earth's mantle composition. After each planetary accretion event, metallic melt is sequestered into the core—only a portion of the mantle is assumed to equilibrate with the projectile core material after each impact. Since the oxidation state of the accreted material is known, the oxygen fugacity is not a free parameter. The pressure of equi1882.pdf

libration is a free parameter that after fitting to match the mantle composition is approximately 2/3 of the core mantle boundary pressure. The temperature of  equilibration is assumed to lie between the peridotite liquidus and solidus. These parameters then determine what light elements (Si, O, and H) are partitioned into the core as dissolved species in the metallic liquids.   65 70 75 80 85 90 95 1000500100015002000250030003500Iron and Nickel Hwt%LRadiusHkmL Figure 2 - Iron and nickel compositions of Earth-like planet cores as a function of radius after mixing according to density instabilities. Metal wt% is used as a proxy for density and so higher metal wt% layers above lower metal wt% layers are mixed to their massweighted average composition.  Results: As core formation progresses, we find that the temperatures and pressures at which metal-silicate equilibration occurs generally increase. Since the light elements oxygen and silicon partition increasingly into batches of metallic liquid at higher pressures and temperatures, the outer layers of the core are decreasingly dominated by iron and nickel and have relatively low densities. This is shown clearly in Figure 1 for five Earth-like planets. While there is a strong trend towards an increasing light element composition, the compositions and oxidation states of the impactors adds considerable variation. Using the iron and nickel weight percent as a proxy for density, we assess after each accretion event whether the new layer to the core would mix with the existing top layer  (if the additional core material is more dense) or not. After this procedure, the compositional density stratification remains, as shown in Figure 2. This stratified region is considerably larger than the F-layer and may be large enough to prevent the onset of a dynamo in the Earth.  However, we have not considered the role of giant impacts. If projectiles larger than about 10% the size of the Earth are capable of thoroughly mixing the core from kinetic energy alone, then the entire core forms a single homogenous layer as shown in Figure 3. This result is consistent across all five Earth-like planets because the definition of an Earth-like planet requires a small late veneer, i.e. a late last giant impact. Thus, the last giant impact of the Earth may have been a necessary condition for the onset of a core dynamo.   If a late giant impact does not occur on a terrestrial planet, then its core may be expected to be compositionally stratified and no core dynamo would be expected to develop. We hypothesize that this may be a natural explanation for the lack of a core-generated magnetic field on Venus.  65 70 75 80 85 90 95 1000500100015002000250030003500Iron and Nickel Hwt%LRadiusHkmL Figure 3 - Iron and nickel compositions Earth-like planet cores as a function of radius after mixing according to density instabilities and giant impacts.
