 TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL VARIATION OF THE ORGANIC PARTICLES IN THE PROTO-SOLAR DISK   M. Numata1 and H. Nagahara1, 1Department of Earth and Planetary Science, the University of Tokyo   Introduction: More than 80 distinct amino acids are discovered in meteorites, which, in addition to their precursors, are suggested to be extraterrestrial origin (e.g., [1-3]). Even the detection of glycine, the simplest amino acid, has been claimed in samples from comet 81P/Wild 2 returned by NASA's Stardust spacecraft [4]. These discoveries suggest that interstellar chemistry can produce such complex molecules. Motivated by these studies, some observational search for complex molecules in the interstellar medium reported to detect acetic acid [5], acetamide [6], aminoacetonitrile [7], and ethyl formate [8] in Sagittarius B2 molecular cloud. More recently, ALMA observation is expected to find more complexity of such organic materials [9]. Organic materials in the asteroids and comets may be partially derived from molecular clouds and partially processed in proto-solar disk. It is one of the critical problems whether organic materials in the interstellar dusts formed in molecular cloud could survive and accreted to planetesimals. Interstellar dusts in molecular clouds consist of silicates, organic materials, ices, and carbonaceous particles [10]. Interstellar dusts were incorporated into the proto-solar molecular cloud and were heated and evaporated in the proto solar nebula. Since the degree of evaporation of interstellar dusts depends on temperature and pressure conditions of the solar nebula, the distribution and chemical compositions of the dusts in the solar nebula would vary from place to place and with time. Nakano et al. [11] carried out evaporation experiments of mixture of molecular cloud and diffuse cloud organic analogs, and showed that the C and N contents in carbonaceous chondrites cannot be explained by the heating of interstellar organic dusts before accretion to parent bodies. In this study, we calculated when and where these molecular-cloud-organic materials evaporate and how they distribute, which were not considered in [11].  Purpose: We calculated disk evolution and particle motion simultaneously in order to investigate temperature change of individual particles as a function of time and space, which enables us to trace the change of average chemical composition of organics. The results would give critical information on the chemical composition of precursor of organics in chondrite parent bodies. The fundamental difference from the chemical network reactions on the surface of solid materials at lower temperatures of molecular clouds is that the reactions in this work are thermal processes at higher temperatures (T>297K).  Model: We calculate evolution of a viscous disk with special interests on the location of individual particles-in order to know the chemical change of organic materials. The disk evolution model and particle-tracking model by Ciesla [12, 13] were applied.  Disk temperature is determined by balancing vertical energy flux assuming that all of the energy dissipation occurs at the midplane [14]. We use alpha-prescription of Shakura & Sunyaev [15] for viscosity. The initial gas density is assumed to distribute as a self-similar solution [16] and particles containing organic materials are released at each 10AU from 10A to 100AU at t = 0. Disk vertical temperature gradient is neglected. Particles are supposed to be small enough to well couple with gas and they are thermally equilibrated. The temperature that each particle experienced is estimated on the basis of radial temperature distribution.  The starting material is assumed to be "Greeberg particle", which consists of silicate core and organics and ice mantle [17], and the chemical composition is taken from that for 297K of [11]. When heated, the C and N composition of particles varies according to [11], but do not vary if temperature decreases; that is, the organic grains keeps the composition for the highest temperature they experienced. By summing up all the grains with different thermal history located at every 1AU at a certain time, the local bulk chemical composition of organics in the disk is obtained. Results and discussion: The temporal change of gas density distribution, gas temperature and organic particle distribution is shown in Fig. 1, which shows that particles initially located in the low-temperature outer region drift inward, and that thermally unprocessed organic particles were present in the inner region after 106 years because the temperature of disk decreases with time where particles from outer regions move.    Figure 2 shows the temporal-spatial variation of C and N contents and C/N ratio of organic particles, which include all the particles from different initial locations and different thermal histories due to turbulent motion of the gas. At 104 years, organic materials do not exist within 4AU, and those at 4-7AU are partially evaporated to be poor in C and N because many of the grains have experienced high temperature (Fig. 1b), which have turned into simple silicate grains. The increase of C/N ratio at 4-6AU shows the mixing of raw materials keeping the composition of diffuse cloud origin transported from outer regions, which  hardly evaporate until 450K. The decrease of C/N ratio at 6-7AU indicates partially evaporated molecular cloud materials in this region. The inner edge of organic materials keeping the initial C and N contents tend to move to the inner region of the disk. At 106 years, only particles at 1-3AU are partially evaporated.    Conclusions: Silicate-organics complex grains from a molecular cloud origin were partially evaporated to be poor in organic materials inside 5AU at the early stage of the proto-solar disk. As temperature decreases with time, primitive grains are transported inward and chemical composition of organic materials in the inner regions of the disk changed from fractionated to unfractionated composition with disk evolution. A small amount of diffuse cloud organic materials survive at the most inner region and partially evaporated molecular cloud organic materials and diffuse cloud organic materials are mixed at C/N ratio-decreasing region. This result shows that composition of organic materials accrete to a planetesimal depend on when the planetesimal is formed.     References: [1] Ehrenfreund, P. et al. (2001) ApJ, 550, 95-99.
