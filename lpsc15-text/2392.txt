Introduction:  An artificial impact experiment on the asteroid surface and its observation are scheduled as one of the main events of Hayabusa2 in the asteroid rendezvous phase [1]. The scentific observation is conducted by a deployable camera unit (DCAM3), especially by a scientific-camera system in DCAM3. The camera system was designed and developed for the close-range visible-light observation of the collisional event. The impact is a common phenomenon in the planetary formation history of the solar system. For example,  in the early stage, impacts of dust aggregates might form planetesimals. In the late stage, the giant impacts might trigger formation of the Moon. Impacts between asteroids produce a fraction of meteorites and change their orbits into the Earrh. While many studies of the impact theory have been conducted so far, its experimental verification is still poor, especially in the microgravity and the actual celestial bodies in space because of technical difficulties. Hayabusa2 is a Japanese asteroid exploration mission conducted by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, which was successfully launched in Dec 3, 2014. The spacecraft will arraive at C-type near-earth asteroid 1999JU3 in 2018 and start scientific observations during the rendevous phase of around 1.5 years. Landing of small rovers, three times of touch-downs and sampling of soil, and the impact experiment are scheduled between the remote-sensing observations of the asteroid surface. The space craft will leave the asteroid in 2019, and come back to the Earth in 20202021 with the cupsuled samples (Fig. 1).  The impact experiment is conducted by Small Carry-on Impactor (SCI) onboard Hayabusa2 [2]. The SCI is separated from the mother ship and explodes above the surface of the asteroid. The explosion forms a hemispherical projectile of 2 kg from a copper plate and immediately accerelates it upto 2 km/s. The impact of the projectile will make a crater with a diameter of 210 m and an ejecta curtain with a visible scale of approximately 10-100 m on the asteroid. The Deployable Camera 3 (DCAM3) is a small separable camera unit for simultaneous close-range observations of the impact event. The DCAM3 is detached from the mother ship and placed near the impact point, while the mother ship is escaping to aboide colliding with debris of the impactor or ejecta. Scientific Objectives:  Scientific objectives of DCAM3 are summarized as (1) clarifying the subsurface structure, and (2) constructing the impactscaling rule applicable to not only the surface of asteroid 1999JU3, but also generally celestial bodies in space. The size and shape of the crater and ejecta depend on the mechanical profile of the asteroid's subsurface layer, mainly sizes of constituent particles or rocks. The impact observation provides information of inner structure of the asteroid. Moreover, the tiny bodies like 1999JU3 have a large advantage to investigate the effect of gravity and relatively-big scale on the crater formation process, because it is quite difficult to study effects of these parameters on the earth. For these objectives and the subsequent remote-sensings and sampling, (3) identification of detailed positions of the shooting point of the SCI and the impact point is also important.          2014 LaunchScience  ObservationSampling  Mission2015 Earth Swing-­by2018 Arrival at 1999JU3SCI Experiment2019 Departure2020 Back to the Earth2021 Sample ReturnCruising(Ion  engine)CurationInitial  Analysis  Impact SCI to the surface of asteroid andObservation of an artificial crater and state of thesurfacePinpoint touch down demonstration(Optional) Collecting samples from the bottom of theartificial crater or ejector on the surfaceRemote  Sensing  using  ONC-­T,  NIRS3,  TIR,  LIDARClose-­up  ObservationDropping  exploration  rovers  (MINERVA,  MASCOT)Determine  touch-­down  pointCruising(Ion  engine)Capsule  Reentry  Touch downCollecting Samples Fig.2 はやぶさ 2ミッション概要     �．分離カメラシステム��JAXAが 2010年に打ち上げた IKAROSでは,20m級のソーラー電力セイル全景を軌道上で撮像するために,深宇宙で母船からカメラを分離して,撮像した画像を無線で伝送する分離カメラ（DCAM）が搭載され,成功を収めている．Fig.3に IKAROSで搭載された分離カメラを,Fig.4 に分離カメラによって撮像されたIKAROSの全景写真の例を示す．  はやぶさ 2 では,IKAROS で開発された分離カメラ技術をベースとし,母船ではなく小惑星上で行われている衝突実験を観測するために開発されている機器である．  SCI による衝突実験は,火薬を用いて 2km/s まで加速した約 2kg のライナ（銅製）を小惑星表面に衝突させる実験で非常に危険なため,はやぶさ 2 母船は確実に安全な小惑星の裏側まで退避する必要がある．このため,母船から直接,衝突実験を観測できる術はなく,分離カメラによる観測は重要となる．      Fig.3 IKAROSに搭載された分離カメラ     Fig.4 撮像された IKAROS全景写真  ���分離カメラによる観測計画������退避計画と $#!-�分離ポイント�� はやぶさ 2に搭載される分離カメラ(DCAM3)は Fig.5に示すよう,太陽指向面（+Z パネル）に搭載される．    衝突実験は小惑星表面から高度数 100m のところでSCIを分離し,母船は安全な小惑星の裏（SCIの発火点から見えない領域）まで退避する．Fig.6 に退避計画の一例を示す．   1999JU3の重力定数 GMは 11～92の範囲であると考えられている．この重力定数は SCI 分離後に SCI の位置に大きな影響を与え,結果として Fig.6の発火点分散にあるよう,広い範囲に分散することを考慮して計画をたてる必要がある．SCI 分離時に姿勢変動分散も考えると,小惑星表面へのライナ着弾点も広い分散となる．SCI 分離から約 15 分後に DCAM3 を Fig.6 に示す地点で光軸が小惑星側に向くよう分離し,DCAM3 分離後約 25分で SCIが発火するよう計画している．   重力定数は,実際に小惑星に到着してみないと分からないため,分散をもった中でも確実に母船が退避し,かつ DCAM3 によって衝突現象を観測できるよう計画を立てる必要がある．    㻿ampler Horn㻿olar Array PaddleHGAMGA㻿㼀㼀DCAM3LIDE㻾Capsule 1m Fig.5 DCAM3搭載位置      SCI発火点分散ライナ着弾点分散はやぶさ2退避軌道DCAM3分離ポイントDCAM3分 Fig.6 衝突実験時の計画例      �����分離カメラシステムの視野設計�   前述の通り,1999JU3 の重力定数に幅があるため,これは SCI の分離後位置分散だけでなく,母船の退避軌道の分散,DCAM3 分離後の位置分散にも影響を与え,分離カメラの光学視野はそれらを全て考慮する必3.DCAM3システム概要 DCAM3 3.1DCAM3搭載位置 DCAM3-ANT DCAM3-ANT2 CAM-H ※CAM-Cは内部搭載 Fig. 1: Summary of the mission schedule of Hayabusa2 and its impact experiment.

System Configuration and Observation Plan:  The DCAM3 is a miniaturized detachable camera inherited from DCAM1,2 in the Japanese IKAROS mission [3]. The layout of DCAM3 system on the mother ship is shown in Fig. 2.  The DCAM3 system consist of the deployable camera and separation unit (DCAM3), receiver units and antennas (DCAM3-ANT and DCAM3-ANT2) for radio communication from DCAM3, and a control unit (CAM-C). The total system of DCAM3 is distinguished into two categolies: a monitoring camera DCAM3-A and a scientific camera DCAM3-D. The scientific observations are performed by "DCAM3-D" that is a wide-angle high-resolution camera and its fast digital transmission component in the DCAM3 body. Radio signals from the DCAM3-D are received by the DCAM3-ANT2 flat antenna. Fig. 3 shows an arrangement plan of the SCI, DCAM3, and the mother ship in the impact experiment. DCAM3 is separated at around 1 km far from the impact point and stay during the event. The observation is continued for about two hours from just before the impact moment, until power of the internal batteries is lost. Buffered image data in memories in the DCAM3 are sent to the mother ship as soon as possible. The mother ship escapes to 20 km far at maximum of the opposite side of the asteroid, keeping the receiving antenna pointed to the DCAM3. Instrument Performance:  Observation objects of the camera are the spreading ejecta (ejecta angle and size), and a relative position of the SCI to the asteroid. Although time scale of the ejecta-spreading depends on the asteroid surface material, it is estimated from 1 second at minimum (hard surface) to several hundred seconds (powdered surface). The DCAM3-D has the enough performance of time and spatial resolution to determine the size and the angle of the ejecta curtain, and the speed of the ejecta spreading or fragment spattering. In addition, low-speed ejecta (dust) spreading will possibly be observed around the DCAM3 in a few hours after the impact. Main specifications of the DCAM3-D camera are summarized in Table 1. The motion of DCAM3 unit also affect the observation performance. The attitude of the unit is stabilized by spin of about 100 deg/sec. It suppress the total attitude instability within 20 deg. DCAM3-D camera has a wide field-of-view to cover this instability and  constantly catch the impact point in the view. The exposure time and optics brightness were designed to obtain clear images on the spinning unit.  References:  [1] T. Saiki et al. (2013) Proc. Int. Symp. Space Tech. Sci., 29. [2] M.
