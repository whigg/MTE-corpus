MODELING THE CHELYABINSK IMPACT, II. D. G. Korycansky, CODEP, Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences,University of California, Santa Cruz CA 95064 .Figure 1: Timestep at t = 7.5s (z = 64 km) of a CTH simulamtion of the Chelyabinsk impact. Density is shown on alogarithmic scale (10−8 < ρ < 1 gm s−3). Simulation parameters include moderate resolution (R6.25) in a domain of size0.5×0.2×0.2 km. The impactor is modeled as basalt sphereof 20 m diameter with zero material strength.On February 15th, 2013, a large meteor entered the atmosphere over the Chelyabinsk, Russia. Although it did not strikethe Earth’s surface, the blow-up of the object was impressive.There were numerous witnesses (cf. youtube videos providedin many cases by dashboard-mounted cameras in vehicles),and the fireball was seen over several Russian cities. A gooddeal of damage was done by the shock wave from the exploding bolide: broken window glass in buildings and numerousinjuries therefrom, although fortunately no fatalities seem tohave occurred. The impact was likely the largest known eventsince the Tunguska impact over a century ago.Subsequent analysis of the event, including orbit analysisand recovery of meteorite fragments, suggest that the impactorwas ∼ 17−20 m in diameter, striking the atmosphere at 18.6km s−1 at an angle of 75 degrees from the vertical [1]. Theobject composition was chondritic of the LL5 type [2] with abulk density of∼ 3.3 gm cm−3. Further discussion and analysisof the impact observations can be found in the discussion by[3].The event underscores the potential hazard posed by theimpact of asteroids on the Earth. Even non-fatal impacts ofsmall objects can cause significant amounts of damage. Assuch, these events need to be understood and the hazards theypose need to be characterized for mitigation purposes.Beyond the hazard aspect, terrestrial meteor impacts area fascinating example of complex physical processes in thenatural world. They present strong challenges for modeling ofthe type described in this abstract.

Given the parameters of the event(object size, velocity, impact angle, composition, and materialproperties), it should be possible to match the observations, inparticular the energy deposition along the bolide’s track.Hydrodynamic modelingSimulation of the Chelyabinsk impact is challenging. Modeling an object of this size demands high resolution (grid cells ∆xof order a meter or smaller); combined with the velocity vi ofthe impact, the Courant condition for the simulation requirestimesteps ∆t ≤ ∆x/vi ∼ 10−5 s. The challenge is increasedby the high inclination of the bolide’s path, which increasesthe timescale of the event by a factor ∼ 4 from a vertical impact starting at z = 100 km height, to ∼ 10 s, thus requiringapproximately 106 timesteps for a single calculation.We report results from attempts at modeling the impactusing the CTH hydrocode at low-to-moderate resolution (gridcells ∆x 1.5–3 m in size). Developed at Sandia National Laboratory, CTH[4] is a highly advanced code widely used in theplanetary science community. It utilizes adaptive mesh refinement to concentrate computational resources at locationsof physical interest in the simulation, such as shock frontsand material interfaces. In addition, it makes use of materialstrength models and advanced tabular equations of state such asANEOS and the SESAME library from Los Alamos NationalLaboratory.The impactor is modeled as a 10-meter radius basalt spheremoving at vi = 18 km s−1, into an atmospheric profile (verticalscale height H = 10 km) at an impact angle of 74◦ from thevertical). We use the SESAME equation of state with a basicmaterial strength model (GEO) that is included in CTH. Theimpact initial height at t = 0 is z = 100 km. In this calculation we find the impactor loses mass and energy primarilyby ablation as opposed to fragmentation to large pieces, hydrodynamic instability or spreading by aerodynamic pressuregradients (“pancaking”). Fig. 1 shows density on a logarithmic scale along one of the mid-planes of the computation. Wehave run six cases so far, testing various combinations of material strength model, resolution, and computational domain size.The baseline case is one in which the impactor has zero strengthand the domain is 0.5×0.2×0.2 km in size. The impactor ismade of basalt as modeled using the SESAME EOS. The maximum resolution is ∆ = 3.2 m or 3.125 resolution elements forthe impactor radius of 10 m (“R3.125” resolution).Figs. 2-4 show the mass m in the computational domain(the “box”) , along with the kinetic energy deposition depositiondE/dz, where E = mv2/2 is the kinetic energy. The quantitiesare plotted as function of (true) height z above the ground. Thethree different plots are tests of physical and computational parameter relative to changes from the baseline case. In Fig 2, theeffects of impactor material strength are shown with cases formaximum material strength Y = 0, 109, and 1011 dyne cm−2.(In the latter two cases loss of strength occurs at T = 1500 K inthe material.) In Fig 3, the baseline case is compared againstone with 2× higher resolution (R6.25). Finally in Fig 4, theeffects of increasing the domain size to 1× 0.2× 0.2 km areshown. In general, the effects of including the (more realistic)properties in the calculation–especially computational properties of higher resolution and larger domain–lead to the impactorpenetrating farther down into the atmosphere with maximumenergy deposition at a lower height (∼ 40 km opposed to 50km). It seems likely that both aspects of the simulations stillneed improvement before convergence is reached for thoseproperties.AcknowledgmentsThe work was supported by NASA Planetary AtmospheresProgram award NNX11AD87G and NSF Planetary Astronomyaward AST-1109729.
