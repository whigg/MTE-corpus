Introduction: Impact craters and their ejecta are the most common features on the solid surfaces of planetary bodies, but the details of how ejecta is emplaced and modified is one of the least understood processes. On airless bodies like the Moon, it is generally accepted that ejecta is emplaced ballistically, creating a radial ejecta deposit with a characteristic topographic profile [e.g., 1-3]. On Mars, the atmosphere and presence of subsurface volatiles are thought to be responsible for layered ejecta deposits (originally called "fluidized", "lobate", or "rampart") in addition to radial facies [4]. Databases of Martian craters suggest that layered ejecta is common, identified at 40% [5] to 90% [6] of craters >3 km diameter that possess discernible ejecta blankets. The formation of layered ejecta morphologies on Mars continues to be debated, and it has been hypothesized to be formed by interaction of ejecta with volatiles derived from the target and/or the atmosphere [e.g. 3-4, 7-9]. Almost all Martian craters, however,  have been modified by the planet's active surface processes, which complicates the process of identifying the physical properties related to ejecta emplacement. It is essential, therefore, to characterize the deposits of pristine Martian craters: the first step in this process is to identify the youngest and least-modified craters,  and the second step is to quantify the effects of modification.  Method: Candidate craters for this study were identified using criteria outlined in our companion abstract [10], using data from published Martian crater databases [5,6] and examination of global imagery in JMARS [11]. Craters were placed into preliminary classes based on general criteria related to crater age and ejecta modification, such as preserved ejecta rays, impact melt deposits, high depth-to-Diameter (d/D) ratio, and a lack of overprinting craters. [12-18]. Our examination of study craters includes: . thermophysical mapping of crater, ejecta, and underlying surface (based on variations in THEMISderived quantitative thermal inertia, e.g. [19]) . mapping of visible morphologic units, including underlying surface,  using high-resolution imagery (based on visible albedo and texture in CTX image mosaics, and HiRISE images where coverage is available) . correlation of morphologic maps, thermophysical maps, and elevation data (MOLA, HRSC) Basic mapping is undertaken in ENVI and ArcGIS, with final correlation of maps via overlays in ArcGIS to characterize each crater via utilization of all three datasets. These maps are used to examine the relationships between meter- to decameter-scale visible morphologic units with thermophysical units.  The thermophysical properties of a surface provide information about the near subsurface (down to a diurnal skin depth: decameter scale) and reflect physical properties of the material. Characterization of these physical properties will rely on correlations with morphologic units, as surface properties must be consistent with near-subsurface thermophysical properties. The character of the underlying target surface is also correlated with the newly updated geologic map of Mars [20]. Example Results: Candidate craters from two of the four classes discussed by [21] are presented here. "Pristine" craters (example in Figure 1) possess the characteristics previously listed as indicative of the youngest craters, and they typically have a distinct thermophysical signature that indicates a low amount of post-impact modification, although pitted impact melt deposits observed on crater floors often have lower than expected thermal inertias, probably due to infilling of dust trapped within the crater. "Modified" craters (Figures 2 and 3) have some of the morphologies associated with young craters (such as high d/D ratios and sharp morphologies), but often have muted thermophysical signatures due to dust deposition or lack preserved rays and pitted melt deposits. "Wellpreserved" craters (not shown) appear modified in visible images and lack the characteristics associated with fresh craters, but may still have distinct thermophysical signatures similar to those observed at younger deposits.  This preservation may be due to target properties or to the character of the modifying process: further analysis is needed to better quantify these results. Initial Conclusions: Examination and classification of craters and their ejecta deposits on Mars will need to rely on analyses from multiple datasets, such as those presented here and in [10]. These results suggest that no single criterion can be used to identify the least modified craters, and that preservation of ejecta deposits and the age of the crater are not necessarily correlation.    Further detailed examination of crater deposits is necessary to identify those deposits that represent the youngest and least-modified craters on Mars. The ultimate goal of these detailed analyses of craters and ejecta deposits is identification and characterization of physical properties associated with pristine deposits, which can then be used as a baseline for examining processes related to crater emplacement and modification.

Piatek et al., "Pristine" Martian Craters: Part 2 Figure 1: Pristine crater Resen (7.5 km diameter) lacks visible rays, but has pitted impact melt deposits indicating a young age. In the thermal image (right), the ejecta is distinct and extends beyond layered deposits seen in the visible image. The lower thermal inertia crater floor is likely due to dust coverage. Figure 3: Rayed crater Corinto (13.5 km diameter) contains many features associated with "pristine" craters (sharp features, preserved crater rays and secondaries), but the ejecta deposits near the crater are thermally indistinct (right), likely due to dust cover. Figure 2: Crater Kontum (22 km diameter) lacks rays, but has preserved pitted melt deposits. The ejecta has some thermal contrast with the background, but is not as distinct as the pristine example in Figure 1.
