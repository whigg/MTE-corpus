Introduction: Although rare for Earth and other planetary bodies, impact cratering is a common geologic process in planetary evolution history. The Moon is pockmarked with literally billions of craters, which range in size from microscopic pits on the surfaces of rock specimens to huge, circular impact basins with hundreds or even thounds of kilometers in diameter. Recognition and evaluation of the impact processes can provide an essential interpretive tool for understanding planets and their geologic evolution [1]. The regular and irregular shape and morphology of crater in different ages retain key information (e.g., impact direction and velocity) of the impact processes during their formation and clues of latter on geologic events. Those events include post-impacting, space weathering, mass wasting and magma filling, etc., which modified the margin of rim and terrains around the crater. Mass wasting is material downslope movement driven by gravity, which tends to erase surface topographic differences and form gentle reliefs[2]. Effects of continuous space weathering resulted in degradation of a crater's rim, make the boundary smooth and invisible, and reduced the ratio between crater's diameter and depth. Some post-impact events occurred nearby or overlapped a crater increased vertical variations among elevation of the crater's boundary and make the margin irregular.       In this paper, we developed a mathematic method to extract the true margins of lunar impact craters, then using new statistics measurements of crater's shape and relief to analyze its suffered possible geological processes. Methods:   (1) Crater boundary extraction        A digital elevation model (DEM) is a 3D representation of a terrain's surface for a planet (including Earth), Moon, or asteroids which is gernerated from terrain elevation data. We use the DEM data from Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA).  The data is downloaded from (http://wms.lroc.asu.edu/lroc/) with spatial resolution of 500m. It is a lunar global image in gray level, i.e., the pixel values stands for its elevation on the lunar globe. This  gray level image is converted to a color image using the HSV color transformation algorithm. Then the color image is embossed to make the boundaries of craters more apparent and we identified and digitalized the boundaries of craters whose diameters larger than 80 km in ArcGIS software.        (2) Fourier descriptor of crater margin        The identified every crater's boundary can be expressed as coordinates pairs P0(x0, y0), P1(x1, y1), ..., Pk1(xk-1, yk-1) starting at an arbitrary point P0 (x0, y0). The location of the center of the crater C is calculated from its centroid, 𝐶𝑥 = 𝑥𝑖 𝑘−1 𝑖=0 𝑘 , 𝐶𝑦 = 𝑦𝑖 𝑘−1 𝑖=0 𝑘 The shape of a depression's boundary is described by the polar function r θ  with the origin located at C. In order to extract depressions' shapes based on just a few points we calculate its Fourier expansion [3]:  𝑎𝑛 = 𝑠𝑖𝑛 (𝑛∗𝜃𝑖) 𝑘−1 𝑖=0 𝑘 ; 𝑏𝑛 = 𝑐𝑜𝑠 (𝑛∗𝜃𝑖) 𝑘−1 𝑖=0 𝑘 ; 𝑟0 =  𝑘 𝜋 . The fourier coefficients ai, and bi pertain to its shape. The polar angle (𝜃) of each point Pi can be computed as 𝜃𝑖 =  𝑎𝑡𝑎𝑛 𝑃𝑖(𝑦)−𝐶(𝑦) 𝑃𝑖(𝑥)−𝐶(𝑥) . The parameters 𝑆2 =  𝑎2 2 + 𝑏2 2 describes elongation of crater's planar shape, and 𝑆3 =  𝑎3 2 + 𝑏3 2  describes its lumpiness. The results of fourier transform describing carter's boundary are shown in Fig.1.   Fig.1 The fourier transform describing results of a crater, white line is the crater's identified boundary by manual, while yellow line with n=8,m=4; black line n=12, m=12 and blue line n=48, m=48. With the increasements of n and m, the describing result is well.     (3) Statistic measurements of shape and relief     After representing a crater's boundary, we can calculate radius ri from the center to boundary in every direction (Fig.2): 𝑟𝑖 = 𝑟0 ∗ (1 +  𝑎𝑗 𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝑖 ∗ ∆𝜃) + 𝑏𝑗 𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝑖 ∗ ∆𝜃 𝑛 𝑗=1 )), ∆𝜃 ∗ 𝑚 = 2𝜋, i = 0, 1, ..., m.  Fig.2 The ri and Pi are the radius and vertice of every direction from the center of a crater, while ∆θ = 15° , i = 0,1,..., 23. Red line and  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation yellow line are the longest and shortest ridus. The blue line is the fourier descriptor of the crater, n=48, m=48.      Meanwhile, we can obtained the elevation (Ei) of every points (Pi) in craters' boundary from the LOLA DEM data. Then we use statistical moments of graylevel histogram of ri and Ei to describe crater's morphology. Let z be a random variable denoting gray levels and let p(zi), i = 0, 1, 2, ... , L-1, be the corresponding histogram, where L is the number of distinct gray levels. The nth moment of z about the mean is [4]:  𝜇𝑛 𝑧 =    𝑧𝑖 − 𝑚 𝑛𝑝(𝑧𝑖) 𝐿−1 𝑖=0 ,  where m is the mean value of z: 𝑚 =   𝑧𝑖𝑝(𝑧𝑖) 𝐿−1 𝑖=0 . The second moment is an important factor of texture description, because the variance 𝜎2 𝑧 =  𝜇2(𝑧). So we can establish descriptors of relative smoothness of lunar surface as:  𝑅 = 1 − 11+𝜎2(𝑧) . The radius and elevation roughness of a crater are marked as Rr and Re. Results and Discussions:   (1) New shape and statistics measurements  Based on our new crater measurement methods in shape and morphology, we have obtained general statistics of some  lunar craters (Tab.1).  (2) Shape and morphology  The parameter S2 shows the elongation of crater's boundary, the Clavius Crater has largest S2 which may be due to the oblique impact. Along the direction of the impact event, radius of a crater is often larger than radius perpendicular to the impact direction. The parameter S3 describes crater's lumpiness, from the Fig. 3 and Tab.1 we can see the Richardson Crater has max S3 value whose boundary was transformed to a crescent shape by post Maxwell Crater event. Thus post impact events which located at the same size crater's boundary may be cause the high S3 value. The Milne Crater has smallest Re value, it's a Pre-Nectarian crater. Under the continuous effect of space weather process or secondary impacts, elevation variations in this carter's boundary are earsed and invisible. Galois Crater has the same old age, but its Re has the higher value compared with Milne Crater. This may be due to the different locations of the two craters, Galois Crater is in highland region, surrounded by many other craters, such as Korolev Crater lies in its north and South PoleAitken Basin in its south. The pre-impact events change the initial terrains and cause large topographic relief, while different-sized and different-distance postimpact result in asymmetrical distributions of ejecta. Thus Galois Crater saved a high elevation roughness of boundary under the long-time erosion effect. Langrenus H Crater has the highest Re value, this crater located in the border region of highland and Oceanus Procellarum, the west part boundary has lower elevation while east part has higher elevation, so the elevation differences caused highest Re. Magma filling process of lunar surface can alter the terrain or relief of crater to change the roughness of elevation. The Eratosthenian Langrenus Crater has smallest Rr value, this is may be this younger crater suffered less post-impact events and it is nearby the Fecunditatis mare which has a releatively flat relief, so it has a approximate regular circle shape. Lastly, We found that the standard deviation of radius (rSTD) in all directions  had a relationship with crater's size, the larger the crater's diameter, the higher rSTD value. The reason may be that the larger impact crater's rim is eroded by space weathering and mass wasting process more easily. Caters with greater diameter tend to have more sharper boundary and steeper slope, thus their rim is instable and more easilyto be modified with changes of the  shape and margins of the crater.
