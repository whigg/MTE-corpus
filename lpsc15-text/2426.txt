New models of global-scale multiphase subsurface transport of H2O on Mars elucidate structural properties of the subsurface that allow retention of groundwater throughout the Amazonian epoch. Our previous baseline model [1] predicted that nearly complete sublimation of tropical ground ice in turn allowed pole-to-equator groundwater flow and further escape, eventually leaving only a thick wedge of midto-high latitude ice and no groundwater anywhere. We have subsequently found three configurations in which the initial sublimation is retarded: more uniform porosity with depth, smaller pore size, or higher tortuosity.  The last two are geologically unlikely.  A porosity scale height of ~8 km, however, is plausible. This sequesters more H2O at depth, but more importantly decreases the loss rate by smaller porosity near the surface. At present, the model predicts that groundwater is restricted to depths >8 km and latitudes <30. Highly saline groundwater could exist closer to the surface, sourcing at least some recurring slope lineae [2-4]. Frozen groundwater that participated in a NoachianHesperian hydrologic cycle is likely the source of D/H ~3 enrichments in Gale crater rocks [5] and SNC glasses [6]. Model. We used the computer code MarsFlo [1,7], a three-phase simulator for water migration in partially frozen porous media. Conservation of H2O (as ice, liquid and vapor) and CO2 (in the gas phase and dissolved in liquid water) are coupled to a heat transport equation. Multiphase flows are described by generalizations of Darcy's Law and the van Genuchten relative permeability and capillary pressure relationships. Classical binary diffusion and Knudsen flow describe the gas-phase diffusive transport of H2O and CO2 [8]. Diffusion coefficients are calculated from temperature, pressure, and tortuosity based on the local gas content and porosity [9]. The equation of state and thermophysical properties are efficiently provided by lookup tables. The model domain is a 2D cross-section of a spherical Mars extending from equator to pole and to a depth of 20 km. The vertical discretization varies from 100 to 1000 m. and the horizontal discretization is 5. The permeability was limited to 10-10 m2 near the Martian surface and decreases with depth according to [10,11], after rescaling depth inversely with gravity [12,13]. Porosity was then calculated from permeability using the classical Kozeny-Karman relationship.  The total available pore volume in the model is equivalent to 560 m GEL [14]. The baseline model adopts surface porosity 0.2, scale height 2.8 km, pore radius 10 m, and tortuosity 3.  The model start is assumed to be the switch from a denser and warmer atmosphere to the present cold and dry conditions, taken here to be the end of the Hesperian epoch at 3 Ga. The basal heat flow was parameterized from the Ur = 1 curve in [15] as q (mW/m2) = 12.4exp(t/6.23) + 2.0 exp(t/1.36), where t is the age in Ga. The surface was treated as an open boundary with free exchange of heat and mass to the atmosphere.  Atmospheric vapor as a function of obliquity and surface temperature as functions of obliquity and latitude were derived from [16].  We showed previously [1] that excursions to low obliquity drive ground-ice sublimation; characteristic loss time scales of tens to hundreds of millions of years would then require that no such duration of low obliquity ever occurred, in contrast to simulation results [17]. Therefore we simply held the obliquity constant at the present value of 25.2. Results. The sudden imposition of subfreezing surface temperature initiates global subsurface freezing, which reaches greater depths at higher latitudes (Fig. 1). At low latitudes, however, strong ice sublimation begins thinning the ice layer, and in the baseline model (Column 1) all tropical ice is eventually sublimated. This leads to groundwater flow toward the equator, where it too evaporates and is lost.  If the scale height of porosity compaction is increased (Column 2), pore size is decreased (Column 3), or tortuosity increased (Column 4), binary diffusion is slowed and the ground-ice wedge is eroded but not breached over 3 Gyr. Then this allows preservation of groundwater on Mars, albeit at great depth and low latitude only.  Table 1. Model Summary  Baseline Scaled Porosity Total H2O      Remaining 0.32 0.83 Liquid Remaining 10-5 0.22 Discussion. The high tortuosity (9) or small pore radius (1 m) that lead to groundwater retention are geologically unreasonable for the large-scale crust.  However, a scale height 3x longer (8.5 km) than that suggested earlier (2.8 km, [14]) is consistent with a crustal history dominated by accretion without a steep megaregolith gradient. Loss is retarded partly in this case because more H2O is sequestered at depth, but more because less porosity at shallower depth inhibits the early rapid diffusion. We have yet to assess the effect of saline groundwater: it may accelerate loss if the ground-ice wedge is not present. This model does not explain the presence, perhaps localized, of subsurface water sources for recurring slope lineae [2-4]. 2426.pdf

The recent measurement of D/H enrichment ~3 in 3-Ga sedimentary rocks of Gale crater [5] not only indicates that the atmosphere was strongly fractionated at this time, but its match to the subsurface reservoir that interacted with SNCs [6] indicates that this former surface water is now ground water or ice. Robust assessment of groundwater volume on Mars requires a deep geophysical sounding capability [13]. This work was supported by the NASA MFR Program, NNX12AH99G. References.

Panels extend from equator (left) to pole (right) and 10 km of the modeled 20 km depth is shown. Duration is from the end of Hesperian  (time zero) to the present (3 Gyr). "Baseline" approximates nominal model in [1]; "scaled porosity" increases scale height 3x while proportionalely reducing surface porosity (thus maintaining same pore volume); "1 m pore radius" varies from nominal 10 m; "greater tortuosity" = 9 compared to nominal 3. More uniform porosity with depth (column 2) is the most plausible of these models and retards secular loss, by both sequestering more H2O at depth and decreasing the near-surface  porosity and associated loss rate. Even in "successful" models, (fresh) groundwater is predicted to lie at depths >8 km and latitudes <30.   Green = ice, blue = water, red = H2O saturated void, black = CO2-saturated void.
