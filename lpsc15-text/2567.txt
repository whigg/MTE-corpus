Introduction:  Layered ejecta morphologies account for ~89% of all craters ≥ 5 km in diameter on Mars that display some form of ejecta [1]. Of these, three types of layered ejecta morphologies have been recognized: single (SLE), double (DLE) and multiple (MLE) layered ejecta [2]. It is generally accepted that layered ejecta morphologies are the result of volatile content within the target [3] and/or the atmosphere [4] which can mobilize ejecta allowing it to travel across the surface as a ground hugging flow [3]. Because layered ejecta morphologies have been recognized on airless bodies (e.g. Ganymede [5]), volatile content within the target has been proposed to be the dominant variable responsible for layered ejecta morphologies. If this is true, the extent an ejecta blanket travels is likely a function of volatile concentration (e.g., greater concentration = longer runout). This seems to be consistent with previous observations on Mars [6, 7, 8]. The strength and cohesiveness of the uppermost target (e.g., basaltic rock vs unconsolidated sediment) have also been suggested to effect runout distance [9]. Here we examine the morphometric differences of SLEs between volcanic and non-volcanic targets to determine what effect the nature of the target has on SLE parameters. Because SLEs make up 86% of all layered ejecta morphologies recognized on Mars and are distributed globally [10, 11], they are an ideal target for this comparative study. Methods:  SLE craters were selected from a pool of 15,500 classified SLEs from Robbins Crater Database [12]. Using this database and the geologic map of Mars [13, 14], the 5 best representations of SLEs (e.g., [2]) were selected from five different volcanic regions  (25 total): Northern Tharsis, Elysium, Syrtis Major, Southern Tharsis, and Hesperia. Crater diameters range from 3 to 18 km and are located from ~35° S to ~50° N latitude.  The target for these regions is interpreted to be similar within each region and is dominantly basaltic lava [13, 14]. A similar number of SLEs (22) located on targets interpreted to be unconsolidated sediments were also selected for analysis and are largely confined to the northern lowlands [13, 14]. Latitude ranges for these craters are ~15° to ~75° N and range from 3 to 16 km in diameter.  All SLEs selected for analysis are located within a range of low to high latitudes and have similar crater diameters making our sample size ideal for an accurate latitudinal comparison study. Analysis of SLEs were done using Java Missonplanning and Analysis for Remote Sensing (JMARS) software [15] and included the use of CTX and THEMIS VIS imagery. After measuring the parameters (e.g., area, perimeter) of each SLE blanket, ejecta mobility (EM) and lobateness (Γ) were calculated using the respective formulas (e.g., [6, 16]). Results:    Figure 1: Ejecta mobility (EM) of volcanic and non-volcanic SLEs plotted against latitude.   Figure 2: Lobateness (Γ) of volcanic and non-volcanic SLEs plotted against latitude.  Volcanic SLEs: The highest EM values for volcanic region SLEs in this study are situated at the highest latitudes. Run-out distances of the SLEs increase at a very similar rate between volcanic regions concurrent with increasing latitude (Fig. 1).  Elysium has a slightly more pronounced increase and is systematic with their location (nearest to the pole). This difference is  is also seen in lobateness trends (Fig. 2). Though the lobateness rate decreases consistently between the these five regions with increasing latitudes, Elysium slightly decreases more. Non-volcanic SLEs: In comparison to volcanic SLEs, non-volcanic SLEs located in Acidalia and Chryse Planitia along with Utopia, display a similar pattern but with slightly higher rates of both increasing EM values (Fig. 1) and decreasing lobateness poleward (Fig. 2). Interestingly, Utopia SLEs display a slightly more distinct variation in rates of increasing EM ratios and decreasing lobateness with latitude. The difference in range of EM ratios between Utopia (0.99 to 1.77) and Acidalia Planitia and Chryse Planitia (1 to 1.59) demonstrates a prominent contrast between our nonvolcanic regions. Congruent with previous crater ejecta studies [6, 8], elevation seems to have virtually no effect on EM ratios and lobateness values of both volcanic and nonvolcanic SLEs. In addition, SLEs in each of the five volcanic regions have similar EM rates of increase and lobateness rates of decrease. Non-volcanic SLEs display the same behaviour yet more exaggerated trends of increased EM ratios and decreased lobateness poleward. SLEs in Utopia demonstrate an even more exceptional variation than the SLEs of Acidalia Planitia and Chryse Planitia. Discussion and implications:  Our results on SLEs are relatively consistent with previous studies involving layered ejecta (e.g., [6, 7, 8]) in that observed SLE blankets with greater run-out distances at increasing latitudes seem to coincide with concentrations of purported near-surface ice at higher latitudes [17]. Ejecta morphologies observed at higher latitudes in volcanic region SLEs, as well as in non-volcanic  SLEs in this study, are consistent with theories that near-surface volatile concentrations increase poleward and decrease equatorward [17]. It is possible that surficial material that is less cohesive, or more volatile-rich, is responsible for higher run-out distances of SLEs at higher latitudes [8, 9]. Another factor could be the obliquity of the planet and its affects on dust cover accumulation and ultimately erosion of ejecta structures, particularly in the planet's northern latitudes [18]. This would likely be responsible for the scarcity of well-preserved SLE samples, specifically in the most northern volcanic regions of Alba Patera within the northern Tharsis region in this study, and Elysium, as well as SLEs on non-volcanic terrains. This problem is reflected in the limited amount of properly classified SLE samples adequate for examination in this study. The dust accumulation and/or erosional forces are also likely a strong influence on the misidentification of DLEs and MLEs as SLEs in the Robbins Crater Database [12].  Conclusions:  The results of this study of SLE morphometric parameters demonstrated in both types of regions support previous studies of DLE behavior with respect to latitude [8]. Similarities are recognized in both volcanic and non-volcanic SLEs, displaying correlating ejecta flow behaviour in each region with slightly hyperbolized results of SLEs on non-volcanic terrains. Ultimately, our results support previous claims that near-suface ice resides at higher latitudes [17] and may be responsible for the observed results.  References:  [1] Barlow N. G.
