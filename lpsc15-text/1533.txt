Introduction: Evidence suggests that cold and dry conditions have persisted on Mars since the mid-to-late Hesperian period [1-3]. While it is likely that the climate conditions of Mars differed during the earlier Noachian period [e.g. 2], the exact nature of the martian climate during this earliest period of martian history remains unclear. Geological evidence has been interpreted by some previous investigators to suggest that the early Mars climate may have supported at least episodic "warm and wet" conditions [e.g. 4]. However, difficulties in reproducing a "warm and wet" early Mars climate with atmospheric General Circulation Models (GCM) [5], due to a faint young sun [6,7], have led others to propose that the early Mars climate may have instead been predominately "cold and icy" [e.g. 8]. Recent global climate modeling efforts predict generally "cold and icy" conditions, where a Late Noachian (LN) water cycle, combined with slight increases in the atmospheric pressure, results in atmosphere-surface thermal coupling, adiabatically cooling high standing areas [9,10]. As a result, water is transported to high elevation areas where cold temperatures preserve deposited ice, forming regional ice sheets that characterize the Late Noachian "icy highlands" (LNIH) Mars climate scenario [10]. However, the GCM predictions of "cold and icy" conditions give rise to a difficult paradox: How could the abundant features indicating at least transient "warm and wet" conditions for early Mars history have formed if the climate was predominantly "cold and icy"? Geological evidence unequivocably shows significant LN fluvial and lacustrine activity. Therefore, climate models which predict "cold and icy" early Mars conditions must fail to include some important processes that would allow for melting. Several studies have investigated the possibility for ice sheet basal melting [11,12] to have allowed for liquid water to be generated in spite of "cold and icy" conditions. However, broadscale ice-sheet basal melting has been shown to occur only at very significant ice thicknesses, geothermal heat fluxes, or through a combination of these factors [11,12]. Additional work has shown that the elevated geothermal heat flux values needed to induce basal melting were likely to have been achieved during the LN on highly localized scales in association with active volcanic features [12]. However, because of the limited scale, the amount of water that can be produced by this "heat-pipe drain pipe" melting is not significant [12].  Are there any other mechanisms for meltwater generation in the context of the LNIH climate scenario? Here we investigate the implications of supraglacial emplacement and loading of lava flows atop LNIH ice sheets for: (1) top-down and bottom-up ice sheet melting, (2) meltwater generation, transport, and fate (2) cryosphere thickness reduction, and ice-saturated cryosphere melting, and (3) groundwater aquifer recharge. We divide our assessment to reflect the time-line of lava flow emplacement and loading by considering: (1) Primary supraglacial lava flow emplacement (those lava flows that are  emplaced directly atop the ice sheet), and (2) Long-term loading of lava flows atop the ice sheet. Water Inventory: We assume that the growth of the LNIH regional ice sheets is a supply-limited process (since there is no mechanism to return ice to the lowlands), constrained by a supply 5X the currently observed near-surface/polar water ice budget on Mars (current inventory ~30 m GEL) [13]. Distribution of this water ice reservoir across Mars, above a predicted equilibrium line altitude of +1 km [11], results in average ice sheet thicknesses of ~700 m [11].  Primary and Subsequent Lava Flows: Intuitively, the short-term thermal interaction between a supraglacial lava flow and the underlying ice is dominated by the transfer of heat from the cooling lava to the ice below and the atmosphere above. To determine the amount of heat that is transferred to the underlying ice we implement an analytical solution of the 1-D heat conduction equation [e.g. 14]. Under nominal LN climate conditions, lava flows that are emplaced across the top of the ice sheets will not encounter a surface comprised of solid ice, but rather snow and firn [15], resulting in more rapid melting. Analysis of the heat transfer from lava flows of varying thickness indicates that thinner lava flows contribute a much higher heat flux to the ice, but over a much shorter period of time, melting less ice (Table 1). After the emplacement of the first flow, subsequent flows will contribute much less heat to the underlying ice sheet because of the intervening solidified lava. Superposed lava flows will undergo subsidence equal to the total thickness of ice melted, with the potential for fracturing, and degradation of the lava flow morphology.  1 m 10 m 20 m 10 min 8,200 (27) 900 (3) 500 (1.5) 1 hr 7,000 (22) 900 (3) 450 (1.5) 4 hr 6,000 (20) 900 (3) 450 (1.5) 12 hr 4,800 (16) 850 (3) 450 (1.5) 24 hr 3,500 (11) 800 (2.5) 450 (1.5) 7 day 20 (0.05) 700 (2) 350 (1.2) 30 day ~ 0 500 (1.5) 325 (1.0) 1 yr 0 50 (0.2) 200 (0.5) Total Ice Melted ~3 m ~30 m ~60 m  Table 1. Heat transfer rates (W/m2) at the lava-ice interface for supraglacial lava flows from 1 to 20 m thick with corresponding ice melting rates (Î¼m/s), and the total ice melted during cooling.  With respect to meltwater generation and fate, the emplacement of supraglacial lava flows has several implications: (1) Water that is produced by melting of the surficial snow and firn will infiltrate down through the permeable firn layer because the infiltration rate far exceeds the predicted melting rates. Infiltration will continue until melting stops, or until the firn layer has been removed by melting, compaction, and densification. (2) Once the firn layer is removed, meltwater will then either escape to the lava flow margins, flow down into the ice through cracks, crevasses and moulins, or pool beneath the lava flow (potentially causing phreatomagmatic eruptions). (3) Following firn layer removal, flows will melt down into solid ice, favoring the channeliza tion of meltwater along the ice sheet surface, or pooling around the lava flows, enhancing cooling rates and the potential for phreatomagmatic events. Channels may drain to the glacial margins and may erode fluvial channels into the martian surface. Lava-loading: As lava flows accumulate above the ice sheet, heat conducted down into the underlying ice will become significantly reduced such that top-down melting will become negligible. At this point, the lava flows will have formed a thermal blanket atop the ice sheets, insulating the ice sheet and acting to raise the ice-melting isotherm. If a sufficient thickness of lava is loaded atop the ice sheets, the melting isotherm may intercept the base of the ice sheet, inducing basal melting. To model the thermal evolution of the LNIH ice sheet and cryosphere in response to insulation by lava loading, we implement a semi-implicit finite difference technique to numerically solve the 1-D heat equation. We model lava loading of the LNIH ice sheets by assuming that lava flows accumulate in ~10 m increments based on flow front thicknesses associated with martian shield volcanoes [16]. Investigation of partially buried craters throughout the Tharsis region indicates lava flows accumulate to thicknesses of ~0.5-3 km [17]. Here, we adopt a maximum lava accumulation thickness of 2 km. We assume that lava  accumulation occurs over a period of ~300 Myr,  thought to be the time-scale over which phases of volcanic activity in the Tharsis region occurred [18]. We account for top-down melting of the ice sheet from lava flow emplacement with a parameterization derived from the previous analysis. We find that cryosphere reduction must occur prior to the initiation of ice sheet basal melting (Fig. 1). If the LN cryosphere was porous and saturated in ice, this would result in the melting and release of a significant amount of water to the subsurface. Under the nominal LNIH conditions (surface temperature 225 K [9,10], geothermal heat flux 55 mW/m2 [19-21]), the cryosphere will extend ~1.2 km below the surface due to the insulation of the 700 m thick LNIH ice sheets. Therefore, if ~1.5 km of lava (with an average thermal conductivity of ~2.25 W/m k; [22]) is loaded atop the ice sheet, the melting isotherm will be raised to the ground surface, thereby removing the underlying cryosphere completely (Fig. 1). Taking a consevative estimate of the martian crustal porosity structure [23], we find that if the cryosphere were ice-saturated, complete melting over an area of ~2.5x107 km2 (approximately the size of the Tharsis region; [24]), would result in the liberation of ~30 m GEL of meltwater to the subsurface. Under the same LN conditions, accumulation of  ~2 km of lava flows will result in complete thermal instability of the LNIH ice sheets and eventual melting (Fig. 1). If this occurs over the same area, then ~110 m GEL of meltwater would be produced. This is comparable to estimates of the total amount of water required for outflow channel formation (~40 m GEL; [13]), and to fill the open-basin lakes (~3 m GEL; [25]). Meltwater that is produced from basal melting of the buried LNIH ice sheets will either: (1) infiltrate down into the substrate, since predicted basal melting rates of the ice sheet are significantly below infiltration rates predicted for the martian substrate, or (2) become sequestered beneath the ice due to the presence of an impermeable underlying layer (e.g. competent bedrock). If meltwater is able to infiltrate, then the superposed sequence of lava flows will undergo subsidence, leading to fracturing and degradation of the surficial lava flow morphology. If infiltration is prevented, meltwater will pool beneath the ice sheet because the ice sheet margins will remain frozen to the base. Meltwater will then accumulate  and become pressurized from the overburden load of ice and lava. If sufficient pressure is built up, the water may fracture through the confining ice at the margins, potentially resulting in large flooding and landslide events.                  Figure 1. Thicknesses (m) of each of the layers involved in the nominal run of the lava-loading thermal model versus time.  Potential Implications: (1) Top-down melting generated by the emplacement of supraglacial lava flows is limited, but effective at removing the snow and firn layer. (2) Sufficient accumulation of lava atop the LNIH ice sheets (~1.5-2 km) can result in cryosphere removal, and ice sheet basal melting, despite "cold and icy" conditions. (3) Melting induced by this mechanism over an area the size of Tharsis could liberate up to ~30 m GEL of water from the cryosphere, and ~110 m GEL of water from the ice sheets. (4) Ice sheet basal melt is predicted to infiltrate and provide groundwater recharge unless the ice sheets are underlain by an impermeable material. (5) Subsidence from melting of subsurface ice will cause fracturing and degradation of the superposed lava flows, and may lead to flooding and landslide events. Potential geomorphic implications of this mechanism are explored more thoroughly in a related abstract [26].  References: [1] Head et al. (2003) Nature, 426, 797. [2] Bibring et al.
