Bulk carbon(Fig. 1) can range from <0.5% in the CK chondrites to> 4% in Tagish Lake [3, 4] and bulk sulfur from <1% inCKs to >5 wt% in CI chondrites [2].Figure 1: Orbital GRS experiments can measure bulk sulfur and carbon at the levels found in carbonaceous meteorites.Meteorite composition data from [1, 2, 4, 5]. Sensitivities reflect the end-of-mission energy resolution of the Odyssey GRS,FWHM=5.7 keV at 1332 keV.In order to find out whether these differences in bulkcomposition could be measured by an asteroid or cometorbiter, we have modeled the performance of an orbitalgamma-ray spectrometer (GRS) experiment in a Dawnlike orbit around various model asteroids: e.g., the orbitalaltitude was equal to the asteroid radius for 4.5 months.Because the GRS is sensitive to depths below the optical surface (to ≈20–50 cm depth depending on material density), this technique can potentially see beneath asulfur-depleted [6] or dessicated surface layer to providea better estimate of bulk composition.Monte-Carlo Model: We applied the MCNPX MonteCarlo radiation transport code [7] to simulate naturalgalactic cosmic-ray (GCR)- induced gamma-ray production in the surfaces of five model asteroids with compositions based on each of four types of carbonaceous chondrites and on a ureilite (a carbonaceous achondrite). Wethen modeled a spacecraft background based on a Dawnlike spacecraft model, also using MCNPX: backgroundspectra were produced both by direct GCR/spacecraft interactions and by the interaction of the GCR-induced asteroid neutron emission with the spacecraft. Finally, thesame Monte-Carlo code was used to model the interaction between the summed source and background spectraand the gamma-ray detector, which we based on the mostsensitive heritage flight GRS, the Mars Odyssey GammaRay Spectrometer [8]. The large detector size and highenergy resolution (0.3% at 1332 keV during its primemission) of this instrument made it the most likely ofany heritage GRS instrument to be able to detect carbon,sulfur, and other minor elements in carbonaceous asteroids (Fig. 2). However, we modeled a MESSENGERlike deck-mounted instrument configuration in which thespacecraft background is much higher than in the boommounted Mars Odyssey flight experiment.Figure 2: Detection efficiencies of two successful heritageHPGe (high-resolution) gamma-ray instruments: the 6.7-cmMars Odyssey Gamma-Ray Spectrometer and the 5-cm MESSENGER Gamma-Ray Spectrometer [9]. The larger size of theOdyssey GRS enables high sensitivity to high-energy gammaray lines, including the 4.4 MeV line of carbon and the 6.13MeV line of oxygen. Both of these lines are needed to determine carbon abundance.Doppler broadening and the detector resolution were applied to the spectra based on either the 4.1 keV primemission or the 5.7 keV end-of-mission in-flight energyresolution of the Odyssey GRS, and peak fluxes then ex1681.pdf

(Fig. 3)Figure 3: Fitting of the gamma-ray lines in the complexhydrogen region (2223 keV) of the CI chondrite model spectrum. The large Doppler-broadened peak is aluminum fromthe spacecraft background. Nevertheless, the hydrogen line isstrong enough (1.7 cpm) to be measured to well under 1% influx within 30 days, corresponding to�0.1 wt% in abundance.Note that the high energy resolution provided by the HPGe detector (0.3%) is required to distinguish these lines; scintillationdetectors such as the Dawn GRaND (>3% resolution for theCZT sensors, 10% for the BGO detector [11]) provide at least10x less energy resolution.Cosmic ray flux: The flux of galactic cosmic rays(GCRs) typically varies by more than a factor of 3 overthe course of the 11-year solar cycle [12]. To be conservative, we normalized our model GCR flux to high solarpotential (low GCR flux), comparable to that seen by theMars Odyssey GRS during its first 3 years in Mars orbit. Missions that orbit during solar minimum may thussee gamma-ray fluxes up to three times higher than thosedescribed here.Comparison with Mars Odyssey GRS flight data: Ourmodel asteroid orbiter has a less favorable geometry thanthe Odyssey experiment (0.84 sr, vs. 3.47 sr solid angle at Mars), but benefits from the absence of the Martian atmosphere, which attenuates both incoming GCRsand outgoing gamma rays. After accounting for the atmospheric effects [13] and the differences in geometryand composition, our CO chondrite model count ratesare consistent with the Mars Odyssey midlatitude flightcount rates to within±40% over a wide range of gammaray energies, which is as expected given the compositionrelated differences in neutron energy distribution.Radiation, Detector Resolution, and Science Performance: During the Odyssey mission, the GRS detecTable 1: Orbital GRS Sensitivities after 4.5 MonthsElement Energy 1σ at 4.1 keV 1σ at 5.7 keV(MeV) Resolution ResolutionH 2.223 ± 0.010 wt% ± 0.02 wt%O 6.13 ± 0.32 wt% ± 0.4 wt%S 5.42 ± 0.15 wt% ± 0.3 wt%Cl 1.95 ± 0.003 wt% ± 0.0045 wt%C 4.44 ± 0.6 wt% ± 0.6 wt%∗∗The C+O line at 4438 keV is Doppler broadened by nuclearrecoil to 69 keV (well beyond the detector resolution) so thecount rate uncertainties in that line are not affected by thedegradation in detector resolution, although other lines in thecomplex region are.tor was successfully annealed multiple times to repairdegradation in energy resolution due to space radiationexposure. The post-anneal energy resolution was slowlydegraded by accumulated radiation damage, from 4.1keV in June 2002 to 5.7 keV over May 2006-Dec. 2007(FWHM at 1332 keV). We therefore investigated the sensitivity effects of this loss of resolution by analyzingOdyssey GRS data from late in the mission and by broadening our MCNPX model asteroid spectra to 5.7 keV. Wefind that our meteorite-based asteroid models can still bedistinguished from each other within a 4.5-month mission at the degraded resolution (Table 1).References: [1] H. B. Wiik,Geochim.
