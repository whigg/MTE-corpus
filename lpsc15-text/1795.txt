Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) is often used for analyzing carbonates, and the relative sensitivity factor (RSF) of Mn to Cr is obtained using a synthetic calcite-type standard [1-3]. Recently, a large range in the RSFs of other carbonates was suggested [4]. The synthetic standard was limited to calcite-type that is only one end-member composition so far. Dolomite-type standard samples that contain similar amounts of Mg and Ca are yet to be prepared. Here, we report on the detail of preparation of Mn and Cr containing dolomite-type polycrystal that is expected to be used as a standard for SIMS. Preparation of CaMg(CO3)2:  There seem to be some difficulties on producing dolomite-type standards. The first one is the low growth rate of dolomite at mild condition of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) vessel at 473 K used for the hydrothermal method at this time. To make matters worse, Mn in solution is "negative catalyst" that delay the crystal growth [5]. The second one is low content of Cr in the crystals. We found that earlier precipitation of Cr2O3 and stichtite-type clay (Mg6Cr2(CO3)(OH)16.4H2O [6]) reduced the Cr concentration of reaction solution and prevented to partition a large amount of Cr into later forming dolomite. The third problem is low densities of produced polycrystal. In a past study, we synthesized dolomite-type samples by two step reaction where metastable Ca carbonates such as vaterite-type and aragonite-type are converted to dolomite-type in Mg containing solutions [7]. However, the product was unfortunately found to be unsuitable for a standard because stable secondary beam of SIMS was not obtained [8]. The reason seems to be low porosity of the polycrystal. In this study, we applied a conventional method for synthesis of dolomite-type [9] and used biuret as an additive of catalysis [10] to improve the growth rate. Hydrazine chloride was added in order to prevent undesirable oxidation of Mn 2+ and Cr 2+/3+ in solution. To prevent formation of stichtite-type clay and to get favorable solvent effect [11,12], some organic solvents were used instead of water.  Typical raw materials were as follows: CaCl2‧ 2H2O, MgCl2‧ 6H2O, MnCl2‧ 4H2O, CrCl3‧ 6H2O, urea, N2H4‧ HCl, NaCl, Mn metal, 36% HCl, biuret, ethylene glycol, 4.2, 4.7, 0.2, 0.29, 1.45, 5, 1.5, 0.065, 0.14, 2, 46.5 each in gram, respectively. The materials were mixed under inert gas condition and put into a PTFE vessel with a stainless jacket. After resting for 1 h during reaction of Mn and acid to produce H2 gas inside the vessel, it was transferred into an oven at 473 K and kept for 170 h. Product CaMg(CO3)2 precipitates were filtered, and washed with ethanol and distilled water and dried in a vacuum oven. Dried particles were embedded in epoxy resin and polished. Characterization of crystals:  Crystal structures were characterized using powder x-ray diffractometer (XRD). Field-emission type electron probe microscope (FE-SEM) equipped with an electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) detector was used for analyzing each grain. Measurement of Mn and Cr concentrations:  Polished sections of samples were measured using field emission type electron probe micro analyzer (FEEPMA) at acceleration voltage of 12 kV with beam current of 12 nA. Analyses were made with 5 μm diameter. Counting times were 30 s (peak) and 15 s (upper and lower background, in each) for Mn and Cr, 10 s (peak) and 5 s (background) for other emelents.  Results and discussions:  Figure 1 shows a X-ray diffraction pattern of a product. There are peaks of dolomite-type and aragonite-type. Crystallinity of dolomite-type seems low in view of the broad peaks. The components ratio of crystals was estimated to ~80% dolomite-type and ~20% aragonite-type calculated from a whole powder pattern fitting (WPPF) program of RIGAKU. The result was confirmed with an observation of SEM. Because the atomic ratio of Ca/Mg in the reagent slurry was 1.25, aragonite-type crystals were produced by excess calcium.  SEM observation showed that there were isolate spherical particles or congregated, and their sizes range from 10 to 100 μm. A few particles more than 80 μm in diameter were found in an area of 1 mm 2. Figure 2 shows one of the particles. Clear EBSD patterns were not obtained from any particles of dolomite-type in this study. This result implies each particle is composed of very fine (< 0.1 μm) crystals. In some cases, density of particles tends to be low at the center, and hollow spheres are also found. The spherical shape of particles seems to be attributed to a micelle that induces selfassembly into microsphere [12]. Further transformation from precursor phase [13] may induce hollow spheres. Figure 3 shows elemental composition of a particle (Fig. 2). Elemental compositions of most particles  show gradients inside them. Ca/Mg ratios usually become low towards the rim.  Ca/Mg atomic ratios range 1-2 in the core and 0.8-2 in the rim. Cr concentrations are nearly constant in the central part of a particle. However, near the rim where Mg concentrations are high, Cr concentrations are sometimes very high (Fig. 3, middle). The Mn/Cr ratio of this particle at the central part is homogeneous within the error (6% at 2σ). The valence of chromium is not determined so far. Divalent chromium seems preferable for a replacement of the same valence Ca or Mg. However, trivalent chromium may incorporate in analogy with europium [14]. We plan to use these particles for determination of accurate Mn/Cr relative sensitivities of SIMS in the near future. References: [1] Fujiya W. et al. (2012) Nat. Commun., 3: 627.
