METAL CONTENT OF A GIANT CLUSTER INTERPLANETARY DUST PARTICLE. A. J. Westphal, A. L. Butterworth,Z. Gainsforth, Space Sciences Laboratory, U. C. Berkeley, 7 Gauss Way, Berkeley CA 94720-7450.Introduction: Although chondritic-porous interplanetary dustparticles (CP-IDPs), collected in the stratosphere, are thoughtto originate from comets, there appear to be significant differences between them and bona fide cometary particles collected by the Stardust mission from the Jupiter-family comet81P/Wild 2. Metal content is one such difference: Wild 2contains abundant metal[1], while small CP-IDPs contain relatively little[2]. The difference may be due to intrinsic differences between Wild 2 and the CP-IDP parent bodies: such adifference might be due to radial heterogeneity in the structureof comets, or difference between comets. In principle, twoconfounding selection effects could also be responsible for thedifference: metal might be oxidized to magnetite during atmospheric entry, and metal-rich CP-IDPs might be preferentiallyselected against during high-altitude collection due to smallerresidence times in the stratosphere. Here we investigate thesetwo possible confounding effects by measuring the oxidationstate of Fe in a giant cluster IDP. The abundance of magnetitesets an upper limit on metal loss due to atmospheric oxidation during entry, and the selection effect due to residencetime should be strongly mitigated in giant cluster CP-IDPs ascompared with small (<30µm) individual CP-IDPs[2].Methods: Particles were extracted from cluster 28 from theL2071 collector at NASA/Johnson Space Center. These particles had been collected in the stratosphere in silicone oil, sowere transferred to a Nucleopore filter and were washed in hexane. The particles were then prepared for shipping by placingthe filter in its graphite frame on dry ice, and dropping a singledrop of 1-hexanol on the filter. 1-hexanol freezes above thetemperature of dry ice. The filter was placed in a glass vial andwas shipped to U. C. Berkeley packed in dry ice. After receiptin Berkeley, the filter was removed from dry ice, and placedin an N2(g) purge, and allowed to warm to room temperature.The 1-hexanol evaporated within a few hours.We analyzed the particles directly on the Nucleopore filteron beamline 10.3.2 at the Advanced Light Source at LawrenceBerkeley National Laboratory. We used a monochromatic 10keV X-ray beam, focussed to a 6µm by 6µm spot, and anX-ray fluorescence detector to identify Fe-rich particles on thefilter. We automatically collected X-ray Absorption Near-EdgeStructure (XANES) spectra for 96 of the identified particles,using the "quickXANES" mode, in which individual spectraare acquired rapidly, then summed in analysis. This approachreduces problems with sample drift during data acquisition.We maximized the number of particles analyzed by takingfewer spectra on each point (N=4) than would be acquired ina high-statistics (e.g., EXAFS) analysis, using the standardenergy profile defined for Fe K-edge XANES at 10.3.2. Because the particles were well-dispersed on the filter, given thesame available analysis time, this approach produced a betterresult than collecting a few energy steps per pixel in chemicalmapping mode [7] of a large area.Analysis: The nucleopore filter exhibited a small, uniformbackground Fe signal, which was subtracted from the particle spectra. We fit the background-subtracted spectra usinga non-negative least-squared fitting algorithm in MATLAB,lsqnonneg, to a library of 54 Fe XANES spectra. Thelibrary includes metals, sulfides, magnetite, and numerousFe2+- and Fe3+-bearing minerals and glasses. We rejected7 analyses based on their weak intensity; these particles mayhave moved during the course of the analysis. Our results wereinsensitive to the choice in brightness cut.Using the 89 measurements of metal or magnetite fractionfor the particles that passed the intensity cut, we calculatedconfidence limits in the content of the cluster IDP using aMonte Carlo bootstrap method: in 10,000 trials, we drewrandom sets from the ensemble of 89 measurements, and ineach trial, we calculated the metal or magnetite fraction. Thismethod assumes only that the distribution of content in thesubset of particles is representative of the overall distributionfor the cluster. When the resulting distribution is sorted inincreasing value, the mean is rank 5000, 2σ lower limit is rank450, and the 2σ upper limit is rank 9550.Results: Confidence limits for the metal, magnetite and combined metal and magnetite fractions are given in Table 1. Wealso compare in Fig. 1 the summed absorption spectrum,weighted by the Fe abundance for each point, to the averagedabsorption spectra in our standards library.Fe mean 2σ lower 2σ upperfraction limit limitmetal 5.6% 3.3% 8.4%magnetite 1.8% 0.8% 3.1%metal + magnetite 7.5% 4.7% 10.6%Table 1: Fe fractions in metal and magnetite in L2071 cluster28.Discussion: The fraction of Fe in metal, in magnetite, andjointly in metal and magnetite, are all significantly smaller thanthe metal fraction measured in Stardust samples of 81P/Wild2. We conclude that the formation of magnetite during atmospheric entry cannot explain the difference, because even the2σ upper limit on the joint probability is inconsistent with theconfidence interval on the metal fraction observed in Wild 2[1].The magnetite, however, may be indigenous to the particles:magnetite has been reported in cometary Wild 2 samples[6]. Ifso, the indigenous metal fraction in this particle is even more2202.pdf

Giant cluster IDPsare�100 times larger than isolated CP-IDPs identified in thestratospheric collectors, so the random fluctuations in metalcontent would be expected to be > (√100 = 10) timessmaller. A remaining possible confounding effect, however,is that metal particles in IDPs preferentially separate duringatmospheric entry. Their relatively short residence time in thestratosphere might reduce their collection efficiency, and theymight not be recognized readily on the collecting plates. An insitu synchrotron survey of apparently blank areas on collectionflags might test this hypothesis.Previously, Flynn et al. conducted surveys of four largeanhydrous cluster IDPs[3]. In all four, no metal was reportedinitially, but later a single pixel in the map of one of the four,L2009R2, was found to be consistent with Fe metal. Theresulting nominal metal fraction of L2009R2 was 14-21%,depending on which minerals were included [4], but Flynnet al. did not report statistical confidence intervals for metalcontent, so a quantitative comparison with our results is not yetpossible. A specific analysis for magnetite was not reported,but the relative large abundance of Fe3+ in one Zn-depletedIDP led to the inference that atmospheric heating might havelowered its metal content by conversion to magnetite. Settingthis particle aside, it appears that one of four giant cluster IDPssurveyed so far contains metal.The diversity of metal content among particles of definiteor probable cometary origin seems to point to a surprising diversity among comets. The collection statistics are still toopoor to test the hypothesis that there is a systematic difference between IDPs and Wild 2. If most CP-IDPs are metalpoor, in contrast to the Stardust samples from Wild 2, thismay indicate a sampling bias between CP-IDPs and Stardustsamples. Nesvorny´ et al.[5] have suggested that interplanetary dust particles principally originate from disrupted Jupiterfamily comets (JFCs). In this model, CP-IDPs sample the bulkof JFCs, including their cores. In contrast, Stardust collectedparticles from the coma of Wild 2, which probably originatewithin the thermal skin depth of the comet, no more than 10 mbelow the surface. This veneer of material may have accretedas the final stage of cometary growth, and thus have been"contaminated" with inner solar-system materials, such as microchondrules (e.g., [8]) and micro-CAIs (e.g., [9]). Thus, asystematic difference between CP-IDPs and Wild 2 samples, ifconfirmed through the analyses of many more CP-IDPs, mayshed light not only on the extent but also the relative timing oflarge-scale transport of materials in the early solar system.Acknowledgments: The ALS is supported by the Director,Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S.DOE under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231.References[1] A.
