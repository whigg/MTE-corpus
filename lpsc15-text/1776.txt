Hisaki carries the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectroscope for Exospheric Dynamics (EXCEED) to observe EUV emissions of planetary plasma and atmosphere such as Venus, Mars, and Jupiter [1].  We report here on an initial work analyzing the Venusian dayglow data measured in 2014. We focus on one of the major oxygen dayglow emissions such as OII 83.4 nm, OI 130.4 nm and OI 135.6 nm, which are mainly exited by photoelectron impacts on O atmos in the Venusian thermosphere.  EUV spectrum of Venus: Figure 1a shows a sample of the EUV spectrum of Venus observed by EXCEED aboard Hisaki. As shown in the left side of Figure 1a, the slit is aligned with the Venus-Sun line. In this spectrum many dayglow emissions are identified around Venus as seen in previous studies [2, 3], and some of which include geocoronal emissions spreading out in the slit. Figure 1b and 1c show spectra of three oxygen emissions. The red spectra are total counts integrated within a region around the Venus disk as shown by horizontal red lines in Figure 1a. The blue spectra are total counts integarated within a distant region from Venus as shown by blue lines in Figure 1a. Since the disk spectra include geocoronal emission as well as dayglow emission, we subtract the geocoronal spectrum from the disk spectrum by assuming the geocoronal spectrum is spatially uniform. This provides the dayglow spectrum as shown by the black line.  Results and discussion: Figure 2a – 2d shows a time series of the brightness of OII 83.4 nm, OI 130.4 nm, OI 135.6 nm and the solar flux for 28 - 34 nm observed by Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) observed in Mar-Apr 2014. Average brightness of each emission over the period is 0.35 kR, 4.8 kR and 1.4 kR, respectively. Comparing Figure 2a, 2b and 2c with Figure 2d, we realize that the dayglow brightness varies similarly with those of the solar flux. Since these oxygen emissions dayglow are mainly exited by photoelectron impacts on O atoms, the solar flux of the helium line (30.4 nm), which produces photoelectrons due to photoionizations of CO2 molecules and O atoms in the Venusian ionosphere, controls the dayglow emissions. Figure 2e - 2g shows relationship between the oxygen dayglow brightness and the solar flux. There is a clear correlation between them.  We are further interested in a difference from these relations. We adopt a linear fit in each emission as shown by a blue line in each panel in Figure 2, and subtract the modeled brightness from the observed one. These values indicate a difference from an average brightness at a certain solar flux. Thus, the dependence on the solar flux is removed.  Figure 3a-c shows a time series of variations of the EUV dayglow brightness from the average fitted by the solar flux ((a) OII 83.4 nm, (b) OI 130.4 nm, and (c) OI 135.6 nm). During this period, each variation looks very similar and seems to have certain periodicities. The amplitude of each variation is all less than 10 % of the average brightness for each emission. Figure 3i - 3k shows normalized power spectra for the variation of each emission calculated by the LombScargle periodogram (LSP) method [4, 5]. We see a clear significant peak at 4.5 days for OII 83.4 nm and OI 135.6 nm and 4.7 days for OI 130.4 nm. We also see secondary peaks of 2.8 days and 9.9 days for OI 130.4 nm and OI 135.6 nm in Figure 3i, 3j and 3k. Figure 3d-3h shows the solar wind parameters ((d) proton density, (e) proton speed, and (f) dynamic pressure), (g) an upper boundary of the ionosphere (ionopause) and (h) the solar zenith angle of the observed location observed by Venus Express (VEX). During this period, VEX observes two corotational interaction regions (CIRs) and 6 enhancements of the dynamic pressure as shown by orange arrows and red numbered vertical lines in the left panels of Figure 3. When the high dynamic pressure reaches, we can see that the altitude of the ionopause starts to decrease or is decreasing (high-pressure events 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6). Despite the changes of ionosheric scales, we do not find common features in each dayglow variation at the high-pressure events. Rather, these variations seem to be independent on the solar wind parameters. Since the disk brightness is derived from integrations of total disk emissions, the physical process controlling the periodic variation would be a global phenomenon. We attribute the periodic variations to 1776.pdf

changes of mixing ratios of O atoms in the Venusian thermosphere. Since the solar wind’s contribution to the periodic variations seem to be absent, atmospheric waves propagated from the middle atmosphere of Venus likely to play a role in these variations. A possible candidate is planetary-scale waves or gravity waves propagated from the middle atmosphere of Venus as shown in Forbes and Knopliv, 2007 [6] and Alexander et al., 1993 [7].
