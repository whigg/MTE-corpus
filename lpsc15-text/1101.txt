 TOWARDS MERCURY (Hg) COSMOCHEMISTRY: VARIABLE CONTRIBUTIONS OF SUPERNOVADERIVED Hg, OR MASS-INDEPENDENT FRACTIONATION BY PHOTODEGRADATION? M. M. M. Meier1, C. Cloquet1 and B.

Introduction: Mercury (Hg) is the heaviest element with seven stable isotopes, spanning a 4% range in relative mass. Five isotopes (199-202Hg,  204Hg) are produced by both the r- and s-process, while 198Hg is produced by the p- and s-process. The least abundant isotope  196Hg is produced exclusively in the p-process [1][2]. Observations of the λ3984 Hg-II-line in the spectrum of some peculiar  A-  and  B-type  stars  ("Hg-stars")  suggests strong variations in the abundance of 204Hg, to the point where it is the most abundant isotope, perhaps due to extreme mass-dependent fractionation in stellar atmospheres [3]. The high volatility of Hg makes this element a potential tracer for processes during solar system formation,  e.g.  condensation in the  nebula,  parent-body heating, volatile loss during giant impacts, and late delivery  of  volatiles  to  planets.  Both  mass-dependent (MDF)  and  mass-independent  (MIF)  fractionations have been observed in terrestrial environments, allowing to  identify sources contributing to  a given Hg inventory [4][5]. Given this potential, surprisingly little is known about Hg in meteorites. Most classes have been analyzed by Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA), which is only sensitive to the abundance of  202Hg and to the 196Hg/202Hg ratio (see compilation by [6]). Large variations in these two values found by most authors have been shown by [6] to be mostly due to interferences on 202Hg. A study of Hg isotopic composition in the meteorites Allende (CV3) and Murchison (CM2) by ICPMS [7] revealed no deviation from the terrestrial composition  within error  (~0.2-1.0‰,  depending  on  the isotope),  except  for  a  slight  200Hg deficit  in Allende. These authors also give ICP-MS-based concentrations for these two meteorites,  of ca.  30 and 300 ppb, respectively, the latter in accordance with solar estimates [2][8].  By exposing meteorite samples to  a saturated Hg atmosphere, [7] demonstrated that contrary to initially held fears, contamination of meteorite samples by terrestrial Hg is unproblematic. Samples and Methods: With a few exceptions, we used quickly recovered meteorites from large falls. All meteorites measured so far for their Hg concentration (and, in some cases, for their isotopic composition) are listed in Table 1. Concentrations were measured using a Milestone SRL Direct Mercury Analyzer (DMA-80) at SARM  CNRS  Nancy,  with  an  effective  sensitivity down to ~1 ng Hg. This instrument has shown excellent accuracy and precision for Hg concentrations in environmental sciences [9]. Prior to measurement, the samples were powdered (to  ~10  μm size). In each DMA run, aliquots of the powder with masses between a few and a few 100 mg were consumed.

The resulting solution was centrifuged to remove particulates and reacted with SnCl2 to produce gaseous Hg(0), which was then brought directly into the mass spectrometer by an Ar carrier[4]. Results  & Discussion: Concentrations vary from <10 ppb to 14'000 ppb for different meteorites, similar to what was historically observed using NAA. There is no systematic variation with class or  petrologic type: Orgueil is strongly aqueously altered, but it shares very high Hg concentrations with the nearly "pristine" Paris CM2.7  chondrite  [10].  Such  high concentrations  for Orgueil have been found before, but were dismissed by [2]  as  terrestrial  contamination.  Given  the  isotopic anomalies observed in Orgueil, Paris,  Murchison and other meteorites (see below), this seems an unlikely explanation. It  should also be noted that the Hg concentration  for  Orgueil  is  significantly different  (higher) from the solar abundance [8], in stark contrast to most other  elements.  The  Hg  concentration  we  find  for   Murchison is a factor of 10 higher than found by [7], although for Allende it is similar. For a sample that has been thermally altered, the Hg concentration in Mocs (L5/6)  is  surprisingly high.  As  shown  in  Fig.  1,  a Rayleigh  fractionation  cannot  produce  the  observed variation in concentration and mass-dependent fractionation (MDF). There is a clear correlation between the mass-independent fractionation (MIF) of the odd-numbered Hg isotopes (Δ199Hg, Δ201Hg), as shown in Fig. 2 (note that this correlation could not  have been observed by [7] (grey symbols) due to the higher uncertainties of their analysis).  When  the  data  are  normalized  to  the 202Hg/198Hg ratio (solid symbols), they plot along a line having a slope of 1.35±0.13, in very good agreement with the MIF observed in photo-degraded Methyl-Hg in terrestrial samples. However,  based on thermal release profiles,  Hg in meteorites  is probably bound in HgS [7]. Furthermore, normalization to the 200Hg/198Hg ratio  (open  symbols)  yields  a  significantly  (~1.5σ) higher slope of 1.71±0.25, which is not expected if the MIF were due to photodegradation. A possible alternative interpretation of this pattern is the addition of rprocess (supernova) material. The two trends extrapolate (Fig. 3) to supernova-produced Hg [11]. The different slopes for the 202Hg/198Hg vs. 200Hg/198Hg normalizations are predicted by the SN-addition model (closed vs. open star symbols in Fig. 3). A contribution of ca. 0.05% SN-derived Hg would be enough to change an Orgueil-like Hg-isotopic composition to  an Earth-like composition. Such a contribution however also predicts a large effect on the p-process isotope 196Hg, on the order  of a depletion of 5-20‰ (depending on the SNmodel) in Orgueil relative to Earth. Follow-up analyses of Hg in meteorites,  this time including  196Hg, are in preparation and will be presented at the meeting. References: [1] Jaschek C. and Jaschek M.
