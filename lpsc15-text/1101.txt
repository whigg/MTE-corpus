TOWARDS MERCURY (Hg) COSMOCHEMISTRY: VARIABLE CONTRIBUTIONS OF SUPERNOVADERIVED Hg, OR MASS-INDEPENDENT FRACTIONATION BY PHOTODEGRADATION? M. M. M.Meier1, C. Cloquet1 and B. Marty1,  1Centre de Recherches Pétrographiques et Géochimiques, CNRS Université deLorraine, 15 Rue Notre Dame des Pauvres, 54500 Vandœuvre-lès-Nancy, France (mmeier@crpg.cnrs-nancy.fr).Introduction: Mercury (Hg) is the heaviest elementwith seven stable isotopes, spanning a 4% range in relative mass. Five isotopes (199-202Hg,  204Hg) are producedby both the r- and s-process, while 198Hg is produced bythe p- and s-process. The least abundant isotope  196Hgis produced exclusively in the p-process [1][2]. Observations of the λ3984 Hg-II-line in the spectrum of somepeculiar  A-  and  B-type  stars  (“Hg-stars”)  suggestsstrong variations in the abundance of 204Hg, to the pointwhere it is the most abundant isotope, perhaps due toextreme mass-dependent fractionation in stellar atmospheres [3]. The high volatility of Hg makes this elementa potential tracer for processes during solar system formation,  e.g.  condensation in the  nebula,  parent-bodyheating, volatile loss during giant impacts, and late delivery  of  volatiles  to  planets.  Both  mass-dependent(MDF)  and  mass-independent  (MIF)  fractionationshave been observed in terrestrial environments, allowing to  identify sources contributing to  a given Hg inventory [4][5]. Given this potential, surprisingly little isknown about Hg in meteorites. Most classes have beenanalyzed by Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA), whichis only sensitive to the abundance of  202Hg and to the196Hg/202Hg ratio (see compilation by [6]). Large variations in these two values found by most authors havebeen shown by [6] to be mostly due to interferences on202Hg. A study of Hg isotopic composition in the meteorites Allende (CV3) and Murchison (CM2) by ICPMS [7] revealed no deviation from the terrestrial composition  within error  (~0.2-1.0‰,  depending  on  theisotope),  except  for  a  slight  200Hg deficit  in Allende.These authors also give ICP-MS-based concentrationsfor these two meteorites,  of ca.  30 and 300 ppb, respectively, the latter in accordance with solar estimates[2][8].  By exposing meteorite samples to  a saturatedHg atmosphere, [7] demonstrated that contrary to initially held fears, contamination of meteorite samples byterrestrial Hg is unproblematic.Samples and Methods: With a few exceptions, weused quickly recovered meteorites from large falls. Allmeteorites measured so far for their Hg concentration(and, in some cases, for their isotopic composition) arelisted in Table 1. Concentrations were measured using aMilestone SRL Direct Mercury Analyzer (DMA-80) atSARM  CNRS  Nancy,  with  an  effective  sensitivitydown to ~1 ng Hg. This instrument has shown excellentaccuracy and precision for Hg concentrations in environmental sciences [9]. Prior to measurement, the samples were powdered (to  ~10  μm size). In each DMArun, aliquots of the powder with masses between a fewand a few 100 mg were consumed.Table 1: Samples and Hg concentrationsMeteorite class Source ppb ±1 SD nBencubbin CBa WAM 217 ±135 2Orgueil CI1 MNHN 13600 ±5200 4Karoonda CK4 SAM 401 ±73 2Murchison CM2 CRPG 2570 ±50 2Paris CM2.7 MNHN 11800 ±2500 2Kainsaz CO3.2 ASM 267 ±29 2Allende CV3 CRPG 39 ±13 2NWA 7323 LL3 CRPG 19 ±6 2Mezö-Madaras L3.7 VNHM 3150 ±520 2Saratov L4 CRPG 18 ±1 2Ghubara L4-6 LU 44 - 1Mocs L5/6 VNHM 965 ±140 2Millbillillie Eurcrite WAM 28 ±2 2Norton County- breccia- dark phase- enstatite cryst.Aubrite UNM9462715±1±20±9222Terrestrial MORB glasses CRPG <5 to 255  For the MC-ICP-MS analysis (on a Thermo Neptune+ at CRPG CNRS Nancy), powder aliquots up to afew grams in mass were exposed to 7 ml concentrated(>65%)  HNO3 for  two  hours  at  200 bars  in a  HighPressure Asher (HPA). The resulting solution was centrifuged to remove particulates and reacted with SnCl2to produce gaseous Hg(0), which was then brought directly into the mass spectrometer by an Ar carrier[4].Results  & Discussion: Concentrations vary from<10 ppb to 14'000 ppb for different meteorites, similarto what was historically observed using NAA. There isno systematic variation with class or  petrologic type:Orgueil is strongly aqueously altered, but it shares veryhigh Hg concentrations with the nearly “pristine” ParisCM2.7  chondrite  [10].  Such  high concentrations  forOrgueil have been found before, but were dismissed by[2]  as  terrestrial  contamination.  Given  the  isotopicanomalies observed in Orgueil, Paris,  Murchison andother meteorites (see below), this seems an unlikely explanation. It  should also be noted that the Hg concentration  for  Orgueil  is  significantly different  (higher)from the solar abundance [8], in stark contrast to mostother  elements.

Murchison is a factor of 10 higher than found by [7],although for Allende it is similar. For a sample that hasbeen thermally altered, the Hg concentration in Mocs(L5/6)  is  surprisingly high.  As  shown  in  Fig.  1,  aRayleigh  fractionation  cannot  produce  the  observedvariation in concentration and mass-dependent fractionation (MDF). There is a clear correlation between the mass-independent fractionation (MIF) of the odd-numbered Hgisotopes (Δ199Hg, Δ201Hg), as shown in Fig. 2 (note thatthis correlation could not  have been observed by [7](grey symbols) due to the higher uncertainties of theiranalysis).  When  the  data  are  normalized  to  the202Hg/198Hg ratio (solid symbols), they plot along a linehaving a slope of 1.35±0.13, in very good agreementwith the MIF observed in photo-degraded Methyl-Hgin terrestrial samples. However,  based on thermal release profiles,  Hg in meteorites  is probably bound inHgS [7]. Furthermore, normalization to the 200Hg/198Hgratio  (open  symbols)  yields  a  significantly  (~1.5σ)higher slope of 1.71±0.25, which is not expected if theMIF were due to photodegradation. A possible alternative interpretation of this pattern is the addition of rprocess (supernova) material. The two trends extrapolate (Fig. 3) to supernova-produced Hg [11]. The different slopes for the 202Hg/198Hg vs. 200Hg/198Hg normalizations are predicted by the SN-addition model (closedvs. open star symbols in Fig. 3). A contribution of ca.0.05% SN-derived Hg would be enough to change anOrgueil-like Hg-isotopic composition to  an Earth-likecomposition. Such a contribution however also predictsa large effect on the p-process isotope 196Hg, on the order  of a depletion of 5-20‰ (depending on the SNmodel) in Orgueil relative to Earth. Follow-up analysesof Hg in meteorites,  this time including  196Hg, are inpreparation and will be presented at the meeting.References: [1] Jaschek C. and Jaschek M.
