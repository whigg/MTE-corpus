Pieters and Klima [9] also showed the value of using infrared spectral microscopy for characterizing the spectral properties of extraterrestrial materials.  Following these leads, we have altered hyperspectral imaging systems developed for remote sensing under funding from the Planetary Instrument Definition and Development and Mars Instrument Development Program to enable resolved microscopic spectral imaging of lunar soils at thermal, visible, and near infrared wavelengths. Instruments:  The system currently consists of three microscopic imaging spectrometers, with a fourth in development. When complete, the four-spectrometer system will collect hyperspectral imagery over wavelengths ranging from 0.5 to 4 microns and 8 to 14 microns. All of the spectrometers are positioned on a coarse motion carriage (Figure 1). The carriage moves each spectrometer in turn over a sample arrayed on a precision adjustment stage, which is scanned to collect measurements of the samples in a pushbroom approach. We collect data in the thermal infrared (8-14 microns) using a microscopic imager based on a Sagnac interferometer equipped with a 320x256 element microbolometer array and a 50 mm infrared Fourier imaging lens.  The interferometer-based system has a spectral resolution of 40 wavenumbers.  It images a field of view of 8 millimeters at 30 micron spatial resolution and scans at a rate of about 1 mm/second, which enables relatively large quantities of sample to be measured rapidly.  The system images in two modes: for emission spectroscopy, the samples are arrayed on a heated substrate in a single layer and heated to 100° C.  More temperature-sensitive (non-lunar) samples can be measured using a reflectance attachment consisting of a double ring of IR lights to illuminate the sample.  An advantage of the reflectance attachment is that improves sensitivity at the shortest wavelengths. The near-infrared (NIR, 1-2.5 microns) region is covered by a microscopic imager based on an Offner spectrograph equipped with a cooled 320x256 HgCdTe array.  Similar to the thermal infrared microscope, it images a field of view approximately 10 millimeters wide at 30 micron spatial resolution and a scan rate of about 1 mm/second.  A combination of halogen and infrared bulbs are used for illumination of samples.  In order to fully capture the 1-micron mafic bands, the NIR measurements are supplemented by a third microscopic imager that covers the 500-1000 nm wavelength range.  It is based on a diffraction grating spectrograph and a 1024x1024 CCD camera and images a field of view of 15 millimeters at approximately 30 micron spatial resolution.  Illumination is provided by a double ring of 24 halogen bulbs, but a scan rate of 0.3 mm/second is required to allow frame averaging to boost signal in this wavelength range. A microscopic imager covering the 2.4-4 micron wavelength range is currently under development.  The design consists of a Sagnac interferometer combined with a mid-wave IR microbolometer camera and custom lenses.  This spectrometer will utilize the same sample cup and stage as the rest of the system and illumination will be provided by a double row of infrared illuminators, which have peak emission at 3 microns.

Samples are arrayed on a precision adjustment stage which is scanned beneath each spectrometer in turn to collect data with a pushbroom approach.

Blue: feldspar; cyan: pyroxene; yellow: glass   Mineralogy characterization: Our method permits rapid, direct characterization of the spectral properties and mineralogy of each individual grain in a soil sample, and will allow us to develop a database of modal mineralogy for a large number of Apollo soils that can be used as a calibration/validation tool for remote sensing algorithms, and may also provide new insights into the geology of the Apollo landing sites.  Mineral detection is performed using the correlation described in [10], which is part of the Tetracorder algorithm. The algorithm measures the correlation between the test spectrum and library spectrum based on shape, and also returns a measure of the relative intensity of the test spectrum and library spectrum. We have compiled a reference library based on mineral separates measured in our laboratory along with spectra from the Arizona State Library spectral library [11].   To date we have measured four individual soils (10084,97 12001,893, 14163,882, and 61221,175) sieved to several different grain sizes. Using the thermal emission microscope, we identified minerals expected to be present in lunar soils, and using the images created by the spectrometer, built spatial maps of the minerals in the soil (Fig. 2). Grains of olivine, pyroxene, and feldspar were detected in all soils studied.   Search for rare materials: Because this method allows characterization of soils at an individual grain level, it has the potential to identify rare particles in lunar soils. The Moon is unique among terrestrial planets for its lack of an atmosphere and global hydrologic, tectonic, or volcanic processes. These factors and its position in the inner solar system mean that it is a potential repository of meteoritic material from all of the terrestrial planets. The National Research Council's 2007 report [12] on the Scientific Context for the Exploration of the Moon highlighted this unique possibility and defined the search for rare materials including those from the early Earth as a key goal for future lunar exploration. Armstrong et al. [13] estimated that Earth material could be present at the 7 ppm level in surface lunar regolith and emphasized that since a single gram of lunar fines contains over 10 million particles, the search for terran material in lunar soils should begin with the current stock of lunar samples. We will use the system, particularly the spectrometer sensitive to the three-micron region, to hunt for particles that could be sourced from the early Earth or Mars.  We are also searching for rare lunar minerals of interest for further study, including quartz and apatite. Mineral sorting and extraction: The detection of rare minerals cannot be confirmed unless the grains of interest can be removed from the sample and studied separately; in support of this goal, we have added a grain picking system based on a FemtoTools FT-G102 microgripper mounted on a Sutter MP285 micropositioning stage. We are able to manually pick up grains and are developing automated grain picking ability. Conclusions: We have developed a multiwavelength microscopic hyperspectral imaging system for a grain-by-grain study of lunar soils.  The ability of our instruments to resolve individual grains means it may provide a method for identifying and isolating meteoritic or other exotic material in samples. The ultimate goal is to do a comprehensive study of soils from each landing site without disturbing the samples, allowing removal of grains of interest for further study.
