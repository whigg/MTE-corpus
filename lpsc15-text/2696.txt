It will also mark the first heat flux measurement of another solar system body that can benefit from the advent of modern computing tools. In anticipation of the InSight Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (HP3) measurements, we are developing a series of 3-Dimensional thermal models to aid in interpretation of this unique data set.  Lander Scale Thermal Effects: InSight will robotically deploy the HP3 thermal probe and SEIS (Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure) seismometer within about 2 meters of the lander. The HP3 probe is designed to then burrow to roughly 5m depth and measure the thermal properties and temperature gradient (with an instrumented tether) as a function of depth. Thermal conductivity will be measured with an active heater within the probe. A deck mounted radiometer will monitor a several meter patch of ground to constrain surface temperature forcing. These measurements share a common characteristic: at the distance scale of meters, InSight’s scientific measurements cannot entirely escape the thermal impact of the lander itself (i.e. shadows, radiative coupling between the lander and underlying surface, obscuration of “cold” sky). Therefore, we seek to characterize the impact that the lander will have on the thermal environment at and below the Martian surface.  The InSight lander will have a net effect of both warming and cooling the Martian surface. Surface warming due to removal of high albedo dust by the thrusters will be directly measured by InSight’s deck mounted radiometer. This effect can be modeled in 1D [see 9, this meeting]. However, the actual surface temperature forcing function experienced by the subsurface probe will be modified by shadowing and thermal radiation from the lander. The lander will potentially warm the surface and instruments, both day and night, by radiating heat from its interior electronics and stored thermal energy from the sun. Additionally, the lander will cool the surface by shadowing the ground below it. These effects will cause an apparent change in the geothermal gradient, which will propagate downward with time. He we wish to predict these effects and best minimize their impact of HP3 results.        Surface temperature effects from the lander may directly impact functioning of the HP3 and SEIS instruments. Advanced modeling of temperatures in the instrument work area can help identify the best locations to mitigate these effects. Additionally, heating or cooling of the surface will propagate into the regolith, directly affecting the thermal gradient that will be measured by HP3. Though HP3 is designed to reach depth quickly to avoid this surface thermal forcing, careful modeling of the propagation of surface temperatures to depth will greatly enhance understanding of regolith thermal properties and provide a contingency plan for measuring heat flux if the probe does not reach its full depth.      Lander Modeling: To examine the effect of the lander on surface temperatures, we have used Comsol Multiphysics to create a simplified model of the lander, Martian regolith (to 6m depth), and solar insolation falling on both. This builds on past models examining the effect of a lander on heat flow measurements [1, 2]. The typical model uses ~25,000 tetrahedral elements including those in the subsurface, lander deck, body and solar panels. Models including conductive lander legs (such as shown if Figure 1, which shows results from roughly noon at Northern Winter Solstice) were used to examine the effect of thermal conduction into the ground, but this was found to be negligible and are generally neglected.        Figure 1: Sample simplified InSight lander model snapshot of roughly noontime temperatures near Northern Winter Solstice.   The regolith thermal properties model is adapted from existing team models [9]. Regolith density is modeled to increase from ~1600 to 1800 kgm-3, with a strong exponential increase in the top few cm.

held constant at 670 Jkg-1K-1. Thermal conductivity is related to density as in [9]. Regolith has a nominal 0.25 albedo. A fully temperature and pressure dependent model adapted from [3, 4] has been implemented, but was not used for these initial studies. Such models may be required for detailed thermal calculations once the thermal properties are constrained insitu. The model is run from a fixed gradient initial condition for 50 years before the addition of the lander. This should allow full equilibration to 6m depth. 20mWm-2 heat flux is assumed. The model has been run for a series of different local ground tilts, lander induced albedo changes, and several other variations for both a high conductivity (~0.05 Wm-1K-1 at depth) and low conductivity (~0.025 Wm-1K-1 at depth) case. 3D Model Results: When the lander is added, surfaces near the lander (which includes the work area where the HP3 and SIES instruments will be deployed) are calculated to reach up to 325K due to reflected light and thermal reradiation from the lander.   Figure 2 illustrates surface temperatures along a North-South transect through the lander (assumed to be pointing due South). Variations in temperatures of unaffected regolith have been removed. This figure shows that areas below the lander had maximum yearly temperatures up to roughly 20K above surrounding regolith. However, daytime shadow temperatures below the lander could dip to as much as 105K cooler than illuminated surfaces nearby. The net effect is a roughly 5K increase in mean annual temperatures near the lander (in the work area) and 10K decrease in mean annual temperatures below the lander.  Figure 2: Maximum, mean and minimum temperatures of the surface around the modeled InSight lander over a period of 1 Mars year. Unaffected regolith temperature variations have been removed, so this figure illustrates temperature deviations caused by the lander.       Effect of Lander on subsurface: We now wish to examine the propagation of thermal perturbations from the lander to depth. Cooling of the surface by the lander will cause the local thermal gradient to shallow, leading to an interpretation of an artificially high heat flux. Heating from reflected radiation and blocked “sky view” will steepen the gradient and cause apparently low geothermal heat flux. Over time, these effects will propagate more deeply. As reviewed in [9], the InSight mission wishes to limit surface effects on the measured gradient to <3 mWm-2. Figure 3 shows an example of the artificial increase above the background pre-lander heat flux for our high conductivity case directly below the lander.    Figure 3: Change in heat flux below the lander. The dotted line marks a 3mWm-2 value desired by mission planners. The colored lines mark the change in heat flux 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 sols after landing.         Figure 3 illustrates that deployment directly below the lander is a bad idea and emphasizes the need to reach depths of >3m early in the mission. In Figure 4 we map out the depth at which the surface disturbance will cause a greater than 3mWm-2 (absolute value) in measured heat flux. Again, this high conductivity case is worst scenario. The bean-shaped contour denotes the lander work area.   Figure 4: Depth of 3mWm-2 absolute disturbance 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 sols after landing. The black contours mark the instrument deployment area.        These models are currently planned to be used as part of the instrument deployment procedure for the InSight mission. Additional data, such as presence of rocks, local topography and the desired location of the SEIS instruments will be included in the HP3 deployment model.
