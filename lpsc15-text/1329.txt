NUMERICALLY SIMULATING TIDAL DISSIPATION IN THE ICY SATELLITES  Hamish C. F. C. Hay1 and Isamu Matsuyama1, 1Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721, United States (hhay@lpl.arizona.edu).   Introduction: Radiogenic heating in the outer Solar System icy satellites is considerably less significant than heat released through tidal dissipation (the conversion of deformational energy into internal energy under the action of a tidal potential). It is thought that tidal dissipation results in the formation and possible long term stability of global subsurface oceans, such as those already confirmed in several of the icy satellites. Europa has been shown to have an induced magnetic field consistent with a global layer of salty, liquid water beneath its surface [e.g., 1, 2]. This is also the case with Ganymede and Callisto, although these liquid oceans are likely to exist at least a few hundred kilometers beneath the surface [1, 2]. Saturn’s largest moon, Titan, has been interpreted to have a conductive liquid layer beneath its surface due to the presence of a Schumann-like resonance [3]. Enceladus also shows signs of a liquid ocean confined to its southern hemisphere. Evidence for this includes emission and the composition of cryovolcanic plumes from a series of tidally induced shear faults over its south pole [4], as well as a detected negative mass anomaly consistent with a subsurface ocean [5]. Tidal dissipation not only plays a role in the thermal evolution of the icy satellites, but it also affects their rotational and orbital state. Conservation of energy implies that energy released through tidal dissipation must be drawn from the orbit of the satellite. By studying and considering the effects of dissipation in the solid and liquid regions of the outer Solar System icy satellites, we hope to not only understand and help constrain their current thermal state and interior structure, but also how the satellite’s interior, rotation and orbit has evolved over time. Tidal Dissipation: Despite the overwhelming evidence for subsurface oceans in multiple icy satellites, there are as of yet no studies that consider a subsurface ocean that lies between two solid regions: the satellite’s interior and rigid outer icy shell.  Currently, the majority of dissipation studies either focus on tidal dissipation in only the solid portions of the satellite [e.g., 6, 7], or in the liquid portions, where a global surface ocean is assumed [e.g., 8, 9]. The former is not applicable to the aforementioned satellites as they all contain liquid oceans. The latter is also not applicable, as no icy satellite in the Solar System has a global surface ocean. Instead, all liquid water is held beneath a solid, icy shell.  Assuming a surface ocean is a reasonable approximation to the Earth, where the majority of dissipation occurs in the fluid regions of the planet. However, the addition of a solid lid is expected to dampen the magnitude of ocean dissipation as the resulting tidal potential will be lowered due to the rigidity and internal strength of the overlying shell. Ocean dissipation studies have also neglected several physical phenomena that have been shown to be important [9]. Matsuyama [9] developed an analytical formalism that takes into account the effects of ocean loading, self-attraction and deformation of the solid regions. By neglecting these effects, it is possible to over or underestimate tidal dissipation by several orders of magnitude. Here we write and run a numerical tidal dissipation model that is designed to eventually be applicable to a variety of icy satellites by first considering tidal dissipation from the eccentricity tide, assuming a global surface ocean and taking into account the three effects considered in [9] and mentioned above. These results will then be compared to analytical solutions for verification and evaluation. Numerical Model: Our numerical model is based on that created by Sears [8]. Thus, we use a two dimensional finite difference code to solve the mass (1) and momentum (2) shallow water conservation equations over a square grid [8]:   𝜕𝑡𝜂 + ∇ ∙ (ℎ𝒖) = 0 (1)  𝜕𝑡𝒖 + 2𝛀 × 𝒖 + 𝛼𝒖 + 𝑔∇𝜂= (1 + 𝑘2 − ℎ2)∇𝑈2 (2) where 𝜂 is the surface displacement from equilibrium, ℎ is the ocean thickness, 𝒖 is the tangential velocity, and 𝛀 is the angular velocity of the satellite. Unlike Sears [8], we use a linear rather than quadratic bottom friction term to reduce computational complexity, where 𝛼 is a linear friction coefficient. 𝑔 is the satellite’s surface gravity and 𝑘2 and ℎ2 are the degree-2 tidal Love numbers. The gradient of the tidal potential, 𝑈2, is an applied force which is subsequently reduced or enhanced by Love’s reduction factor, 1 + 𝑘2 − ℎ2 [8]. The numerical scheme is explicit and forward in time, and is outlined in several works by Zahel [e.g., 10, 11]. We use a staggered grid and solve for the northward and eastward velocity components, as well as ocean surface displacement 𝜂. The velocity components are necessarily solved for first, as only information from the 1329.pdf

previous timestep is required for their solution. The ocean displacement is then solved for as its solution requires velocity information from the current timestep. This is the basic timeloop which is repeated until the simulation ends and periodicity in the solution is achieved. From these quantities, 𝒖 and 𝜂, ocean dissipation is  derived, as in [8]. Our basic model uses a grid spacing of 4 degrees in both latitude and longitude, following [8]. Each primary node, spaced every 4 degrees, holds surface displacement information, while velocity information is staggered 2 degrees from the primary node, normal to the velocity component. Methodology: Initially, a series of models will be run in line with those performed by Sears [8]. This is to verify the numerical results of our model and test for solution convergence. These will also be compared to analytical solutions from [9]. Following this, the addition of the three physical phenomena examined by Matsuyama [9] (ocean loading, self-attraction and deformation of the solid regions) shall be added to equations 1 and 2. This will enhance our dissipation model by including additional physics that are important when considering dissipation. It will also allow us to numerically verify the results in [9]. Conclusion: The additional effects of ocean loading, self-attraction and deformation of the solid regions considered by Matsuyama [9] shift tidal dissipation resonances to greater ocean thicknesses. Neglecting these effects can therefore lead us to severely over or underestimate tidal dissipation for a given ocean thickness. Here we numerically attempt to verify these results through the addition of these effects into a two dimensional finite difference tidal dissipation model.  This work is therefore a stepping stone to applying the effects of a solid lid to our tidal dissipation code. This is a particularly important challenge for the future as it will ideally result in a tidal dissipation model that is finally applicable to the icy satellites of the outer Solar System. We can therefore expect to help constrain properties of these satellites, such as their thermal and orbital history, as well as their internal structure.    References: [1] Zimmer C. et al.
