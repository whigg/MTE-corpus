Introduction: NASA's Mini-RF instrument on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) and the Arecibo Observatory (AO) in Puerto Rico have been operating in a bistatic architecture (AO serves as the transmitter and Mini-RF serves as the receiver) over approx. a 2.5 year period in an effort to understand the scattering properties of lunar terrains as a function of bistatic (phase) angle. In that time, 24 observations of the surface have been acquired of the lunar nearside and poles (Fig. 1) and include mare materials, highland materials, pyroclastic deposits, and a variety of craters (polar and non-polar). The primary motivation for acquiring these data is to characterize/differentiate the Circular Polarization Ratio (CPR) response of surfaces that are smooth versus rough at S-band wavelengths (12.6 cm) from surfaces that harbor water ice. Background: Radar observations of planetary surfaces provide important information on the structure (i.e., roughness) and dielectric properties of surface and buried materials [1-4]. These data can be acquired using a monostatic architecture, where a single antenna serves as the signal transmitter and receiver, or they can be acquired using a bistatic architecture, where a signal is transmitted from one location and received at another. The former provides information on the scattering properties of a target surface at 0° bistatic (phase) angle. The latter provides the same information but over a variety of angles. Laboratory data and analog experiments, at optical wavelengths, have shown that the scattering properties of lunar materials can be sensitive to variations in phase angle [5-7]. This sensitivity manifests as an opposition effect and likely involves contributions from shadow hiding at low angles and coherent backscatter near 0° [5]. Analog experiments and theoretical work have shown that water ice is also sensitive to variations in phase angle, with an opposition effect that it is tied primarily to coherent backscatter [8-10]. Differences in the character of the opposition response of these materials offer an opportunity to differentiate between them, an issue that has been problematic for radar studies of the Moon that use a monostatic architecture  [11,12]. Observations: CPR information is commonly used in analyses of planetary radar data [1-4], and is a representation of surface roughness at the wavelength scale of the radar (i.e., surfaces that are smoother at the wavelength scale will have lower CPR values and surfaces that are rougher will have higher CPR values). High CPR values can also serve as an indicator of the presence of water ice [13]. We use CPR as a function of bistatic (phase) angle to explore the opposition response of lunar materials at S-band (12.6 cm) wavelengths (Fig. 2).   Fig.1. Bistatic radar coverage of the lunar (a) nearside (90°W to 90°E) and (b) south pole (60°S to 90°S).  Data for the south polar crater Cabeus have been acquired on four occasions and these data cover a bistatic angle range of ~0° to 18°. The floor of Cabeus crater shows a CPR enhancement with respect to  surrounding highland materials at near 0° and a CPR suppression when viewed at angles > ~2° (Fig. 2a). Data for the non-polar crater Kepler have been acquired on two occasions and cover a bistatic angle range of ~0° to 22°. Isolating the response of Kepler's ejecta blanket from the surrounding mare deposits (Fig. 2b), it is clear that the mare deposits have an nearly uniform CPR for phase angles < ~17° while materials associated with the ejecta blanket show a steady and significant increase in CPR for phase angles < ~5°.  Data for the Aristarchus pyroclastic deposit have been acquired on two occasions and cover a bistatic angle range of ~1° to 6°. The CPR response of the deposit is uniform over the bistatic angle range investigated.  Results: Mini-RF has acquired a significant amount of bistatic radar data of the lunar surface in an effort to understand the scattering properties of lunar terrains as a function of phase angle at S-band wavelengths (12.6 cm). Observations of lunar crater ejecta appear consistent with laboratory data and analog experiments at optical wavelengths [5-7]. This information is providing insight into to the relative contributions of coherent backscatter and shadow hiding to the lunar opposition effect - at radar wavelengths. Observations of the floor of the south polar crater Cabeus indicate scattering behavior consistent with the presence of water ice [8-10].  References: [1] Campbell et al.
