Introduction: Due to the inherent non-uniquness when inverting magnetic field data for magnetization, the exact distribution and intensity of magnetization on Mars is unknown. Here, we present a map showing the necessary magnetization to explain the observed field by using the formalism developed by [1]. For this purpose, we use the magnetic field model of [2] and obtain magnetization intensities of +/- 14.8 A/m when assuming a 40 km thick magnetized layer [3].  Theory: Inverting the magnetic field of crustal origin for the magnetization distribution that generates it suffers from severe non-uniqueness. The reason for this are the so-called annihilators, i.e. structures that produce no visible magnetic field [4]. A study by Gubbins et al. [1] has used complex vector Spherical Harmonics in order to separate the magnetization distribution into the part that contributes to the visible crustal magnetic field and the part that does not. This allows the direct conversion of the crustal magnetic field to the magnetization distribution that generates it. We base our results on this study, but our formalism relies on the real vector Spherical Harmonics (SH). In this case the visible magnetization, 𝐼, is given by 𝐼(𝜃, 𝜙) = ∑ ∑ [𝑔𝐼,𝑙𝑚𝑌𝑙,𝑙−1𝑚,𝑐 (𝜃, 𝜙) + ℎ𝐼,𝑙𝑚 𝑌𝑙,𝑙−1𝑚,𝑠 (𝜃, 𝜙)]𝑙𝑚=0∞𝑙=1  where 𝑌𝑙,𝑙−1𝑚,𝑐 and 𝑌𝑙,𝑙−1𝑚,𝑠  are the real vector SH and 𝑔𝐼,𝑙𝑚, ℎ𝐼,𝑙𝑚  are the SH coefficients given by {𝑔𝐼,𝑙𝑚ℎ𝐼,𝑙𝑚 } =𝑅𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑠𝜇0√2𝑙 + 1𝑙{𝑔𝑙𝑚ℎ𝑙𝑚 } with  the SH coefficients of the crustal field and 𝑅𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑠 = 3393.5 km is the reference radius of Mars. Results: Here, we present the magnetization required to explain the observed field obtained from a published lithospheric field model [2], which is shown in Fig. 1. Note that the chosen color bar is highly nonlinear and the magnetization at the site of the large impact basins is very weak, probably below the noise level of the model. Overall, obtained equivalent vertically integrated magnetizations amount to −4.80𝐸5/3.86𝐸5 A for the horizontally north (X), −1.97𝐸5/2.95𝐸5 A for the horizontally east (Y), and −5.78𝐸5/3.45𝐸5 A for the vertically down (Z) components. Assuming that the magnetized layer is 40 km thick, this translates to a lithospheric magnetization density of  −12.0/9.7, −4.9/7.4, and −14.5/8.6 A/m for the X, Y, and Z components, respectively. Also, a maximum intensity of 14.8 A/m is obtained. Figure 1: Horizontally north, east, and vertically down components of the magnetization model derived in this study. The magnetization is calculated for a 40 km thick equivalent layer and given in A/m on a nonlinear scale.  Discussion: Previous studies investigating the global distribution of magnetization used assumptions on the directions of the magnetization [5,6] or minimized the overall magnetization of the respective model  [3,7]. These studies resulted in maximum magnetizations of 12-35 A/m for a 50 km thick magnetized layer, translating to 15-44 A/m for a 40 km thick magnetized layer. Hence, the maximum intensity of magnetization obtained in this study is at the lower end of the previously published model. This is not surprising, as we retrieved only the part of magnetization which is necessary to describe the field.  The magnetization map can be further used to study the correlation between the magnetization and the age  of impact craters in order to constrain the lifetime of the Martian dynamo. Indeed, signatures of impact craters with diameters down to 150 km  are visible on the magnetic field model from which this magnetization model has been obtained [2], implying that the resolution of the magnetization map is sufficient to resolve the signature of such craters as well. 2478.pdf
