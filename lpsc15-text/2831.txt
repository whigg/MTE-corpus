Furthermore, thesemodels suggest  that  there  is  sufficient  heat  availablethat a liquid water layer could survive under an icy exterior to the present day.  Given its similarities to someof the icy satellite in the Solar System, it has been suggested that Ceres could experience cryovolcanic processes.  Recent observations with the Herschel SpaceObservatory suggest  water  vapor emanating from localized  sources  on  the  surface  of  Ceres  [6],  whichcould be evidence for ongoing cryovolcanic processes,and possibly for a linkage between the surface and thesubsurface ocean.  Here we discuss a possible mechanism for driving cryovolcanism on Ceres.Model: Because ice takes up a larger volume than theequivalent mass of water, the freezing of liquid wateronto the base of an icy shell will cause the shell to expand  slightly  and  lead  to  tensile  stress  in  the  shell[7-9].  This also has the effect of increasing the pressure in the ocean, possibly to the point of driving liquid to the surface [8].We use the model of [8] to calculate ocean pressurization  and  shell  tensile  stresses  for  plausiblecooling/freezing  histories  of  Ceres.   Figure  1 showsthe  ocean  pressurization  for  given  amounts  of  shellthickening for Ceres, as well as Europa and Enceladusfor comparison.  For Europa (r = 1560 km) and Enceladus (r = 252 km), we use the same initial conditionsas [8] and reproduce their results exactly.  For Ceres (r= 475 km), which is intermediate in size between thosebodies,  we  assume  as  our  initial  condition  that  therocky  core  is  ~300  km in  radius  with  an  overlyingocean and an icy shell 25 km thick.  This correspondsto the state of Ceres 500 Myr after its formation in themodels of [5].  In the models of [5], the shell thickensover the subsequent 4 Gyr at an approximately linearrate of ~20 km/Gyr.Figure 1:   Pressure generated in a subsurface oceandue to thickening of the overlying ice layer.  Pex,ocean isthe excess pressure generated in the ocean due to shellthickening, and Pex,crit is the excess pressure at whichwater can be driven  to the surface. Two endmember cases are shown, the first assumesthat only the upper 1 km of the ice layer behaves elastically, regardless of the overall shell thickness, and thesecond assumes that the upper 1/3 of the ice layer behaves elastically.  Pex,ocean is the excess pressure generated in the ocean due to shell thickening (i.e. The pressure  increase  beyond  the  standard  overburden  pressure), and  Pex,crit is the excess pressure at which watercan be driven all the way to the surface.  In general,this mechanism works best for smaller bodies, and ismost effective when the elastic part of the ice shell isthicker.   From  Figure  1,  ~10  km  of  thickening  ofCeres' ice shell leads to ocean pressures that exceed the2831.pdf

critical pressure for eruption when the elastic layer is1/3 of the total shell thickness.  For a more likely casewhere the elastic layer is somewhat thinner (1/5 of thetotal ice shell thickness,  estimated from the temperature profiles in [5]), ~20 km of thickening of the shellis required to exceed the critical pressure for eruption.In the models of [5], this amount of thickening wouldoccur over a period of ~1 Gyr.The tensile stress in the elastic part of the ice shellcan also be calculated from this model, and is shown inFigure 2.  Estimates of the tensile strength of ice varyfrom ~104 Pa for natural sea ice to ~106 Pa for intactsamples in the laboratory [e.g.  10,11].   For both thethin  and  thick  elastic  layer  assumptions,  the  tensilestress in Ceres' ice shell exceeds ~106 Pa after only ~1km of thickening.Figure 2: Tensile stress generated in the elastic part ofthe ice shell due to shell thickening and the pressurization of the underlying ocean.  Solid lines are for a thinelastic layer, dashed lines are for a thick elastic layer.A range of estimates for the tensile strength of ice isalso shown.While cracks could therefore be initiated relativelyeasily in the ice shell, if they are to provide a channelbetween  the  ocean  and  surface  they  must  propagatethrough the entire  shell.   Following [8]  we calculatethat  even  for  a  weak  shell  of  ~2x104 Pa  tensilestrength,  cracks  can  propagate  to  at  least  200  kmdepth, which is about the maximum possible thicknessof an ice shell for Ceres. The crack propagation depthincreases  as  the  square  of  the  tensile  strength  (andhence the peak stress at the point when the crack is initiated),  so  for  any  plausible  values  of  the  tensilestrength of ice, it should be possible for cracks to propagate through the entire ice shell.  We also note thateven if tensile cracking was not occurring, fracturingduring large impacts could potentially provide a temporary means for water to reach the surface.Eruption Volume: Using the expressions in [8] we estimate that for every 1 km of thickening of the shell,approximately 25 m of liquid could erupt over the entire surface (although this is likely an upper limit forseveral  reasons).   For a shell  thickening rate  of  ~20km/Gyr from [5],  this would translate to an eruptionrate of roughly 45 kg/s, if the release was continuous.Interestingly, this is on the same order as the Herschelestimate of 6 kg/s emanating from the surface [6].Summary and Caveats: We have shown that the pressurization of a subsurface ocean due to thickening ofthe overlying ice shell, as proposed for some icy satellites [e.g. 7-9], is also a plausible mechanism for driving  cryovolcanism  on  Ceres.   Nonetheless,  somecaveats remain.  Three primary assumptions here arethat the ice/water layers are pure,  the rocky core is incompressible, and the ice layer behaves like an intactelastic shell.  If the ice layer actually contains a significant fraction of silicates, its higher density could makeit easier to drive liquid from below up to the surface.However,  if  the  ocean  is  'muddy',  as  expected  fromsome models [e.g.  5],  then the higher density of theocean could require larger pressures to drive materialto the surface.  If the rocky core is compressible, thatcould serve to reduce the pressure in the ocean and require more shell thickening to achieve a given internalpressure.   The requirement  that  the ice layer  behavelike an intact, elastic shell could pose a problem, especially in the case where the tensile strength of ice is exceeded well before the ocean pressure is sufficient todrive material to the surface.  These caveats will be addressed in future work to be presented at the meeting.Acknowledgements: D. P.
