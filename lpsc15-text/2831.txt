Introduction: Hubble Space telescope observations of Ceres  revealed  a  gravitationally-relaxed  shape  and  a flattening consistent with a central mass concentration, rather  than  a  homogeneous  mass  distribution  [1]. Ceres' density of roughly 2100 kg/m3 suggests a significant  fraction  of  water  or  water  ice [2],  and  interior evolution models for Ceres [e.g. 2-5] suggest that differentiation is likely, forming a layered structure with a rocky  interior  (possibly  with  a  separated  iron  core), overlain by water and ice layers.  Furthermore, these models suggest  that  there  is  sufficient  heat  available that a liquid water layer could survive under an icy exterior to the present day.  Given its similarities to some of the icy satellite in the Solar System, it has been suggested that Ceres could experience cryovolcanic processes.  Recent observations with the Herschel Space Observatory suggest  water  vapor emanating from localized  sources  on  the  surface  of  Ceres  [6],  which could be evidence for ongoing cryovolcanic processes, and possibly for a linkage between the surface and the subsurface ocean.  Here we discuss a possible mechanism for driving cryovolcanism on Ceres. Model: Because ice takes up a larger volume than the equivalent mass of water, the freezing of liquid water onto the base of an icy shell will cause the shell to expand  slightly  and  lead  to  tensile  stress  in  the  shell [7-9].  This also has the effect of increasing the pressure in the ocean, possibly to the point of driving liquid to the surface [8]. We use the model of [8] to calculate ocean pressurization  and  shell  tensile  stresses  for  plausible cooling/freezing  histories  of  Ceres.   Figure  1 shows the  ocean  pressurization  for  given  amounts  of  shell thickening for Ceres, as well as Europa and Enceladus for comparison.  For Europa (r = 1560 km) and Enceladus (r = 252 km), we use the same initial conditions as [8] and reproduce their results exactly.  For Ceres (r = 475 km), which is intermediate in size between those bodies,  we  assume  as  our  initial  condition  that  the rocky  core  is  ~300  km in  radius  with  an  overlying ocean and an icy shell 25 km thick.  This corresponds to the state of Ceres 500 Myr after its formation in the models of [5].  In the models of [5], the shell thickens over the subsequent 4 Gyr at an approximately linear rate of ~20 km/Gyr. Figure 1:   Pressure generated in a subsurface ocean due to thickening of the overlying ice layer.  Pex,ocean is the excess pressure generated in the ocean due to shell thickening, and Pex,crit is the excess pressure at which water can be driven  to the surface. Two endmember cases are shown, the first assumes that only the upper 1 km of the ice layer behaves elastically, regardless of the overall shell thickness, and the second assumes that the upper 1/3 of the ice layer behaves elastically.  Pex,ocean is the excess pressure generated in the ocean due to shell thickening (i.e. The pressure  increase  beyond  the  standard  overburden  pressure), and  Pex,crit is the excess pressure at which water can be driven all the way to the surface.  In general, this mechanism works best for smaller bodies, and is most effective when the elastic part of the ice shell is thicker.   From  Figure  1,  ~10  km  of  thickening  of Ceres' ice shell leads to ocean pressures that exceed the   critical pressure for eruption when the elastic layer is 1/3 of the total shell thickness.  For a more likely case where the elastic layer is somewhat thinner (1/5 of the total ice shell thickness,  estimated from the temperature profiles in [5]), ~20 km of thickening of the shell is required to exceed the critical pressure for eruption. In the models of [5], this amount of thickening would occur over a period of ~1 Gyr. The tensile stress in the elastic part of the ice shell can also be calculated from this model, and is shown in Figure 2.  Estimates of the tensile strength of ice vary from ~104 Pa for natural sea ice to ~106 Pa for intact samples in the laboratory [e.g.  10,11].   For both the thin  and  thick  elastic  layer  assumptions,  the  tensile stress in Ceres' ice shell exceeds ~106 Pa after only ~1 km of thickening. Figure 2: Tensile stress generated in the elastic part of the ice shell due to shell thickening and the pressurization of the underlying ocean.  Solid lines are for a thin elastic layer, dashed lines are for a thick elastic layer. A range of estimates for the tensile strength of ice is also shown. While cracks could therefore be initiated relatively easily in the ice shell, if they are to provide a channel between  the  ocean  and  surface  they  must  propagate through the entire  shell.   Following [8]  we calculate that  even  for  a  weak  shell  of  ~2x104 Pa  tensile strength,  cracks  can  propagate  to  at  least  200  km depth, which is about the maximum possible thickness of an ice shell for Ceres. The crack propagation depth increases  as  the  square  of  the  tensile  strength  (and hence the peak stress at the point when the crack is initiated),  so  for  any  plausible  values  of  the  tensile strength of ice, it should be possible for cracks to propagate through the entire ice shell.  We also note that even if tensile cracking was not occurring, fracturing during large impacts could potentially provide a temporary means for water to reach the surface. Eruption Volume: Using the expressions in [8] we estimate that for every 1 km of thickening of the shell, approximately 25 m of liquid could erupt over the entire surface (although this is likely an upper limit for several  reasons).   For a shell  thickening rate  of  ~20 km/Gyr from [5],  this would translate to an eruption rate of roughly 45 kg/s, if the release was continuous. Interestingly, this is on the same order as the Herschel estimate of 6 kg/s emanating from the surface [6]. Summary and Caveats: We have shown that the pressurization of a subsurface ocean due to thickening of the overlying ice shell, as proposed for some icy satellites [e.g. 7-9], is also a plausible mechanism for driving  cryovolcanism  on  Ceres.   Nonetheless,  some caveats remain.  Three primary assumptions here are that the ice/water layers are pure,  the rocky core is incompressible, and the ice layer behaves like an intact elastic shell.  If the ice layer actually contains a significant fraction of silicates, its higher density could make it easier to drive liquid from below up to the surface. However,  if  the  ocean  is  'muddy',  as  expected  from some models [e.g.  5],  then the higher density of the ocean could require larger pressures to drive material to the surface.  If the rocky core is compressible, that could serve to reduce the pressure in the ocean and require more shell thickening to achieve a given internal pressure.   The requirement  that  the ice layer  behave like an intact, elastic shell could pose a problem, especially in the case where the tensile strength of ice is exceeded well before the ocean pressure is sufficient to drive material to the surface.  These caveats will be addressed in future work to be presented at the meeting. Acknowledgements: D. P.
