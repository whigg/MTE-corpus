Introduction: Olivine-phyric shergottites are characterized by the presence of coarse-grained olivine megacrysts, which are generally interpreted to initiate crystallization at depth and subsequently entrained by magmas ascending through the martian crust toward the surface. Here, we report the occurrence of a pyroxene megacryst within an olivine-phyric shergottite. The pyroxene shares many characeristics with those of the olivine megacrysts and allows us to place further constraints on martian magmatic plumbing-system dynamics. We report data on two sections for each of the paired meteorites LAR12095 and LAR12240. Three of the four sections analyzed are classified as olivinephyric; however, one of the section of LAR 12095 does not contain any olivine megacrysts, but does contain a single low-Ca pyroxene megacryst. The following descriptions and discussion are centered around the origin of the megacrysts within these samples. Analytical Techniques: Minerals were analysed using a CAMECA SX-100 EMP at the University of Tennessee using standard microprobe protocols. Trace element concentrations of minerals were analysed using the Agilent 7500 ce ICP-MS, attached to an Excimer 193 nm ArF GeoLasPro laser ablation (LA) system, housed at Virginia Tech, using a similar protocol to that used in Howarth et al. [1] was used. Oxygen isotope compositions of two chips from each sample were analyzed using the laser fluorination system attached to ThermoFinnigan Delta gas-source mass spectrometer  at UCLA.   Petrography: Olivine megacrysts are generally euhedral in shape, and are commonly observed as broken fragments of larger grains. The megacrysts contain rare chromite chadacrysts, and abundant melt inclusions (up to 12 in single grains). The pyroxene megacryst in sample LAR12095 is an elongate grain with tapered terminations (Fig.1b). The pyroxene contains chromite chadacrysts, but no melt inclusions are observed. Oxygen isotope compositions:  Oxygen isotope compositions of LAR 12095 (∆17O = 0.319 ± 0.020 ‰, 2SE) and 12240 (∆17O = 0.318 ± 0.020 ‰) are identical within the analytical uncertainty), both of which fall on the Mars fractionation line (∆17O = ~0.33 ‰).  These confirm the Mars origin of these meteorites. Fig. 1. Compositional Mg X-ray maps for a) LAR 12095, 20, b) LAR 12095, 14, and c) LAR 12240, 7.   Mineral Chemistry:  Olivine megacrysts in both samples are commonly zoned from Fo-rich (Fo72) to lower Fo contents at the rims (Fo60) (Fig. 1). Olivine phenocrysts overlap in composition with the olivine megacryst rims. The pyroxene megacryst has a highMg core with a composition of Wo2En78Fs20 and lowMg rim with composition Wo10En58Fs32. Similarly to the rims of olivine megacrysts, the pyroxene rim com position overlaps with the groundmass low-Ca pyroxene. All pyroxenes analyzed are LREE depleted with distinct negative-Eu anomalies (Fig. 2). The LREE are below detection in the pyroxene megacryst core, including Eu. The REEs of merrillites overlap between  both samples.  As the main host of REEs, the CIchondrite normalized REE of merrillite are similar display a pattern similar to the bulk rock with strong LREE depletion (Fig 2.). Fig. 2.

Discussion:  The REE abundances of the merrillite are consistent with LREE-depleted shergottite subgroup: e.g., ALH77005 and  LEW88516. Olivine Megacrysts. Olivine megacryst compositions in olivine-phyric shergottites range from Fo70 to Fo82 [e.g., 3,4]. The core composition of the olivine megacrysts in our samples overlap with typical megacryst compositions on the lower end and are more similar to those in LAR 06319. Using a KD = 0.35, the olivine cores were in equilibrium with a melt of Mg# 49. The margins of the olivine megacrysts have a similar composition to that of the finer-grained phenocrysts, indicating reequilibration or late-stage growth from a lower Mg# liquid parental to the groundmass minerals. Pyroxene Megacrysts. Pyroxene megacrysts are rare constituents in olivine-phyric shergottites, but have been reported in other examples, such as EET 79001 (e.g., [4, 5]). Furthermore, they are ubiquitous components of lherzolitic shergottites [e.g., 1, 2]. Pyroxene oikocrysts in lherzolitic shergottites are generally characterized by low-Ca pigeonite pyroxene cores (rarely enstatite cores) that show gradational zoning toward their margins, and a sharp compositional break to a high-Ca pyroxene rim. Furthermore, they contain abundant olivine and chromite chadacrysts. The pyroxene megacryst observed in LAR 12095 is zoned from a low-Ca enstatite composition and does not have a highCa rim. Furthermore, it does not contain olivine chadacrysts. The rim composition of the pyroxene megacryst overlaps with that of the groundmass pyroxene, indicating reequilibration/late-stage growth with a lower Mg# liquid similarly to the olivine megacrysts. The pyroxene core composition (Mg# - 80), was calculated to be in equilibrium with a melt composition of Mg# - 53.5. Therefore, both the olivine and pyroxene megacrysts observed in the LAR 12095 and LAR 12240 meteorites were crystallized from a higher Mg# liquid and subsequently entrained and transported upward in the current host magma. Implications for magma plumbing dynamics on Mars. Olivine megacrysts are commonly interpreted to represent xenocrysts, coarse-grains of material not related to the current host rock parental magma [e.g., 3,4]. A similar interpretation can be made for the pyroxene megacryst observed in LAR 12095; however, the pyroxene composition suggests that it was in equilibrium with a higher Mg# liquid relative to that of the olivine megacrysts. This is also consistent with the absence of olivine chadacrysts inside pyroxenes, which are ubiquitous in pyroxene megacrysts from lherzolitic shergottites. Therefore, either the pyroxene crystallized prior to the olivine megacrysts at depth in a magmatic staging chamber or the olivine and pyroxene megacrysts are unrelated to each other.
