Introduction:  There is an ongoing debate about whether the D enrichments in chondritic insoluble organic matter (IOM) were produced in the protosolar molecular cloud or in the solar nebula. Much of the evidence used to support a solar origin comes from an evolving picture of the IOM from electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. EPR measures the abundance of free electrons (spins/g) associated with different types of organic radicals and the energy difference between their spin states (g-factor) that is indicative of the chemical environments of the radicals. In their pioneering EPR study of Murchison and Orgueil IOM, [1] concluded from the g-factor values (2.0031) that, as in type III coals, the IOM radicals are associated with O functionality. They also concluded that the radicals must be clustered, with concentrations in the clusters that are roughly an order of magnitude higher than in bulk. For normal (spin ½) monoradicals, their concentration should be independent of temperature (Curie law behavior). However, [2, 3] reported dramatic increases in spin concentration above 130-150 K in IOM from Murchison, Orgueil and Tagish Lake. They attributed this non-Curie law behavior to the presence in the radical population of 25-40 % of biradicaloids (S=0 ground state, thermally accessible S=1 state) associated with 10-15 ring aromatic structures. Based on pyrolysis GC-irMS analysis of Orgueil IOM, [4] argued that there are modest but systematic D/H variations between benzylic, aliphatic and aromatic H, and noted that these variations inversely correlated with C-H bond energies. They suggested that this correlation reflected differing exchange rates with D-rich H3+ at ~100 K, a relatively high temperature requiring a solar rather than an interstellar origin. However, IOM pyrolysis yields are low, so the pyrolysates are not representative of the bulk IOM. [5] did not report similar D/H trends in their IOM pyrolysates, although several of their samples were much more Drich than Orgueil's IOM. Also, the abundance of H3+ and its D enrichment in disks are predicted to be much lower than in molecular clouds [6]. Nevertheless, in support of the H3+ model [7] concluded from additional EPR measurements that the D/H ratios associated with the radicals in Orgueil IOM are very high (1.5±0.5x10-2), and that the D is primarily in benzylic radicals bonded to aromatic moieties composed of 3-4 rings. Such high D/H ratios implies temperatures of ~40 K for H3+ formation, making the temperature argument for a solar origin less compelling. The makeup of D-rich radicals in Orgueil IOM has been further revised by [8] to be almost entirely composed of radicals that exhibit non-Curie behavior. The spatial concentrations of D-rich radicals have been linked to the D-rich hotspots in primitive IOM [9]. The ranges of compositions of the IOMs studied by EPR to date are limited compared to the known ranges of primitive IOM [10, 11]. The IOM in all three of the meteorites studied may also have been modified by parent body processes [10-12]. It is notable that the IOM with the highest reported spins/g, Tagish Lake, is probably the most processed and has the lowest bulk D/H. This is counterintuitive if spins/g are indicative of the extent of exchange with H3+. Hence, we have begun a survey of a much larger suite of primitive IOM samples to test the D-rich radical hypothesis. Techniques: A total of 18 IOM samples from CI, CM, CR chondrites, as well as four Tagish Lake lithologies, were selected to span the full range of IOM elemental and isotopic compositions seen amongst primitive carbonaceous chondrites [10, 11], as well as the range of alteration in their parent meteorites [13]. To avoid potential artifacts, ~2 mg of IOM were ground together with ~300 mg of BaF2 powder in a pestle and mortar, and then packed into glass EPR tubes. The samples were pumped down to moderate vacuum to remove air and adsorbed water, and then flame sealed under vacuum to prevent condensation of air at low temperatures. The EPR spectra were recorded at room temperature (RT) and 77 K on a Varian E-122 spectrometer using a TE104, E232 dual sample cavity. The modulation amplitude was 0.4 mT, the microwave frequency was 9.38 GHz and the microwave power was 2 mW. Strong pitch at RT was used as a reference. All EPR spectra were base-line corrected, double integrated and corrected for any change in cavity Q (typically 5-10 %) using the peak height of the strong pitch reference. The g-factors were computed using DPPH as a standard (2.0036). Absolute spin concentrations were determined relative to a Varian strong pitch intensity standard (3x1015 spins/cm) placed in the dual cavity along with the sample. Unlike DPPH, the strong pitch exhibits almost ideal Curie law behavior [14]. Results:  A conservative estimate of the 1σ precision of our spins/g measurements is 7 %. The uncertainties in the g-factors are ~0.0001.  The g-factors of all our samples range from 2.0029 to 2.0031. There are no correlations between the gfactors and other properties of the IOMs (e.g., O/C and δD) or their parent meteorites (e.g., petrologic type).  At RT, the spins/g in the IOMs have a limited range (N≈5x1017 to ~2x1018 spins/g). The deviations from Curie law behavior (DC=N (298 K)/N(77 K), where 1 is Curie law) are also quite limited (1.191.76). There are no correlations amongst all samples between spins/g or DC and other properties of the IOMs (e.g., Figs. 1 and 2), or with either the chondrite groups or petrologic types of their parent meteorites.   Discussion:  While we confirm that IOMs exhibit non-Curie behavior, there are significant differences between our results and those reported previously (Table 1). For instance, the absolute and relative spins/g vary by a factor of 10 in the results of [1-3], but only ~30 % in our samples. While differences in absolute spins/g could be due to the different choice of standards (DPPH vs. strong pitch), this cannot explain the stark contrast in the relative differences between samples and studies. Similarly, the values of DC tend to be lower in our samples and the variations are uncorrelated with those of [1-3]. The largest differences in spins/g are for the Tagish Lake samples. The IOM from the two studies did not come from the same lithologies. However, the T.L. old and 11v IOM samples have H/C ratios [12, 15] that straddle those of the T.L. 1 and 2 samples [3]. Hence, the differences must largely be due to differences in IOM separation and/or EPR measurement techniques.  Table 1. The RT spins/g and DC reported by [1-3] (left columns) and this work (right columns).  If the abundance of radicals, particularly those that exhibit non-Curie behavior, reflects the extent of exchange with deuterated H3+, it is surprising that we see no correlation between δD and spins/g or DC in Figs. 1 and 2. It is possible that the IOM accreted by each chondrite group experienced exchange with H3+ under different conditions. However, there are no obvious trends amongst the CMs and CRs. The only apparent trend is seen amongst the Tagish Lake lithologies with spins/g being inversely correlated with δD (and H/C). This is the opposite of what would be expected from exchange with H3+, but might be explained if radicals were being generated as parent body processes produced larger aromatic units and decreasing H/C (and δD) [12]. Also, D hotspot abundances and isotopic compositions are highest in the most D-rich IOM, yet they are neither more radical-rich nor do the show greater non-Curie behavior. Conclusions:  We do not observe the expected correlations between δD and either spins/g or non-Curie behavior if exchange with H3+ were the cause of the Denrichments in IOM.
