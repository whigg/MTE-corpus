Introduction: Typical polymict ureilites are fragmental breccias thought to represent regolith formed on the ureilite parent body (UPB) or one of its offspring [1,2]. They consist of ≥95% lithic and mineral clasts of diverse ureilite types (olivine-pyroxene rocks with Fo ~75-95), a few % feldspathic clasts thought to represent ureilitic melts [3-6], and a few % non-indigenous clasts.  The latter represent impactors, and provide information on the nebular environment in which the UPB accreted, and/or through which it (or one of its offspring) migrated [1,2,7].  Previous work on polymict ureilites has identified clasts of CC matrix-like materials, angrites and R-chondrites, as well as enstatite grains from E-chondrites or aubrites, and chondrules from type 3 ordinary chondrites (OC) [1,2]. However, the full range and abundances of foreign clast types has yet to be determined.  This information is critical to determining whether typical polymict ureilites and the anomalous Almahata Sitta share a common origin [7,8].  We describe a new chondritic clast type in DaG 319. Sample and Methods: Clast 1 in a new section of DaG 319 (_005) was studied using the Zeiss EVO50XVP SEM and Cameca SX-50 EMP at U. Mass.   Petrography: Clast 1 is ~1.3 × 1.9 mm in size (Fig. 1).  It is a breccia, consisting of a variety of "objects" in a fragmental matrix (Fig. 2).  Based on a detailed study of 34 objects, they are of 2 types: lithic and breccia.    The lithic objects studied range from ~30 to 340 µm in size, with rounded to irregular shapes (Figs. 2a-c). Their boundaries with surrounding matrix are welldefined, and they show no rims or concentric structures. Larger lithic objects (>~80 µm) consist of olivine, low-Ca pyroxene (hereafter opx, though its structural state is not known), and feldspathic matrix, with minor Fe-sulfide. They have porphyritic, barred, poikilitic, and/or myrmekitic textures (Fig. 2a,b).  Opx commonly has ≤µm-sized, aligned inclusions of chromite (Fig. 2a).  Smaller lithic objects (Fig. 2c) consist of phenocrysts or skeletal crystals of augite (with little or no olivine or opx) in feldspathic matrix.  The breccia objects studied range from ~50 to 400 µm in size.  They are fragmental breccias, consisting of rounded to irregularly shaped grains of olivine and opx ~50 to ≤ 1µm in size (Fig. 2d), with minor Fe-sulfide and rare metal.  They appear to have a cryptocrystalline matrix. Some of them contain lithic objects similar to those described above (mostly augite-bearing). The boundaries of these objects with the matrix of clast 1 range from clearly to poorly (because they closely resemble clast 1 matrix) defined.   The matrix of clast 1 is clastic (Fig. 2), consisting of rounded to irregularly shaped grains of olivine and opx (~100 to ≤1 µm), small lithic fragments (consistent with derivation from the large lithic objects), sulfides, and rare chromite and augite.  It is pervaded by iron oxides/hydroxides (similar to the host polymict ureilite), which are probably terrestrial. Mineral Compositions: Olivine compositions are FeO-rich and relatively homogeneous.  Average Fa is 26.1±0.7, with no significant difference between lithic objects, breccia objects and matrix.  Nevertheless, aberrant grains with Fa as high as 30 occur in matrix, olivine in some lithic objects is normally zoned to Fa 30, and some olivine grains in breccia objects show reverse zoning to Fa 23. MnO (0.45±0.02 wt.%) and CaO (0.11±0.04 wt.%) contents are also relatively uniform. Cr2O3 is more variable: 0.08±0.07 wt.%.  Ni is below detection limit except in a few aberrant grains.  The average opx (all analyses of objects and matrix) is Wo 1.8±0.3, Fs 22.0±1.4, with MnO = 0.45±0.02, Al2O3 = 0.16±0.14, TiO2 = 0.14±0.06 and Cr2O3 = 0.19±0.08 wt.%.  Augite in small lithic objects is Wo 43.9±0.7, Fs 9.0±0.9, with MnO = 0.22±0.02, Al2O3 = 0.62±0.26, TiO2 = 0.48±0.13, Cr2O3 = 0.87±0.14 and Na2O = 0.55±0.02 wt.%.   Analyses of feldspathic matrix in lithic objects show a near stoichiometric feldspar formula, with Ab 84.8±1.4, Or 5.3±1.5.  A few chromite grains in the matrix have Fe/Mg = 3.0, Cr#=0.876, with ~3.3 wt.% TiO2.  One metal grain has ~11 wt.% Ni.   Fig. 1.

Fayalite (Fa) in olivine vs. ferrosilite (Fs) in low-Ca pyroxene (opx) in clast 1 compared with the various equilibrated chondrite groups [9,10].         Discussion: If clast 1 is a chondrite, the homogeneity of its olivine indicates an equilibrated type (4-6), and average Fa and Fs contents indicate L/LL composition (Fig. 3).  However, the clast is a breccia, with distinct components that may be equilibrated to different degrees.  Some of the lithic objects resemble chondrules (Fig. 2a). However, for several reasons, we think that most of these objects are not chondrules: 1) many have shapes inconsistent with those of chondrules or chondrule fragments (e.g., Fig. 2b); 2) they are smaller than average OC chondrules [11]; 3) they lack rims or concentric structures, which are common in chondrules; 4) augite does not occur as a phenocryst in OC chondrules [9].  The MnO and Cr2O3 contents of olivine, and major and minor element compositions of pyroxenes, are consistent with those of equilibrated OC [9].  However, CaO contents of olivine (avg. 0.11 wt.%) are not, and are within the range of those in unequilibrated chondrules [9] or impact melts in OC [12]. Since these objects are not unequilibrated, it is likely that they are clasts of impact melts (of mixed L and LL materials; [13]), with the augite-bearing objects a distinct population.  The impact melted rocks must have been metamorphosed and equilibrated to various degrees after formation, and then shattered by subsequent impacts.    The breccia objects in clast 1 appear to represent breccias that pre-dated clast 1, and were formed from the fragmented impact melt materials. The presence of aberrant grains indicates that they are postmetamorphic breccias [14,15]. Their cryptocrystalline matrix may represent a second episode of impact melting (with olivine clasts reacting with this melt to become reverse-zoned).  Clast 1 would be a second generation breccia, also post-metamorphic because of the presence of aberrant grains and the sharp boundaries of objects with matrix [16].  It may be a regolith breccia, as the general restriction of terrestrial iron oxides to its matrix (rather than throughout the objects) suggests that the matrix was originally porous [17,18].  Clast 1 appears to be a new variant in the wide array of breccia types among type 4-6 L and LL chondrites [12-19].  Further petrologic and O-isotope studies of this clast will help determine its origin. Clasts like this can provide information about ureilite history, and reveal new meteorite types not represented in our collections. References: [1] Goodrich C.A. et al.
