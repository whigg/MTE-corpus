Introduction: Great successes of recent lunar explorations (e.g., SELENE, Chang’E, Chandrayaan-1, and LRO) provide vast amount and varieries of remote sensing data. Analysis results of those new data set provide some key evidences (e.g., pure plagioclase rocks [1], high Mg/Fe primitive plagioclase rocks[2]) for studing solidification process (i.e. crust production processs) of the Lunar Magma Ocean (LMO). Those key evidences ask us to re-consider the current understanding of the LMO solidification processs. In that study, we have to reconstruct composition and structures of primitive crust by removing influences of volcanisms and impact craterings from global geological map of the Moon. However, since an existing global geological map made in 1980s [3] and has no recent key finding, that should be revised based on the newly discovered result first.  Standing this point of view, we started a project for build a new lunar global geological map to reconstruct composition and structures of the lunar primitive crust. However, because of huge volume of recent data set, the way of fullymanual processsing by researchaers is not realistic, and then we have been trying to use some machine learning methods.  In this study, we show some classification results of SELENE Multiband Imager (MI) data applied a basic unsupervised classification method and compare them with a manul classification result for a limited area.   Data:The MI has both visible and near-infrared coverages with spectral bands at 415, 750, 900, 950 and 1,000 nm (visible) and 1,000, 1,050, 1,250 and 1,550 nm (near-infrared). For 1,000 nm band, we use visible sensor data. Based on MI reflectance map data, we made some kinds of dataset for classification as follows. 1. reflectance 2. blackness (-log(reflectance)) 3. normalized reflectance (by 750 nm) 4. band depth 5. band depth + 750 nm refrectance All five data set cover spatioal range of  N60 to S60 in latitude and 0 to 360 in longitude, and resampled in every 0.1 degrees mesh (for computational reason).  Classification Procedure: Our classification procedure is as follows, first, we extract independent components (ICs) fro the dataset by Independent Component Analysis (ICA) [4,5] and then, the ICs are classed by ISODATA classifications [6]. Independent Component Analysis.  The motivation of using ICA is emphasizing inputdata characteristics reflect geological context and reduse influence of  noise. We adopt the Kurtosis as a contrast function and compute full components (i.e. if input data has 8 bands, output ICs has 8 bands) (Figure 1) ISODATA. ISODATA is a fully unsupervised classification methods.  Naturally, nowbody knows how many geological unit/classes exist in advance.

DATA only require the accountable range (minimum and maximum number) of classes.  In this study, we set the accountable range as follows, minimum of 5 and maximum of 100.  Results: Our procedure generally works well and ~80 classes are introduced. The outcomes of each dataset show roughly same result. Because dataset 1 and 2 are original data and does not include any arbitrary operations, hereafter, we should use dataset 1 or 2 for this kinds of operation.  The classification results in mare region indicate that this procedure could detect some type of mare basalt flows. Especially high-Ti basalt in the Oceanus Procellarum and the Mare Tranquillitatis are clearly identified (Figure 2). In addition, we compare classification result of this procedure around the Aristarchus region with that of manual classification by a researcher (M.O.) (Figure 3). These two classifications agree each other generally, and we consider our procedure can useful for the first step of building luanr geological map.  References: [1] Ohtake M. et al.
