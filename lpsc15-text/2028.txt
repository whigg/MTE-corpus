Criteria for assessing whether or not the 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages of individual lunar impact glasses from the Apollo 14, 16, and 17 landing sites are reliable values for the age of the impact event in which they formed have been developed [1,2,3]. Of the >115 samples investigated, 61 (~52%) of them are likely to report an actual age. Of these, ~50% of the impact glass spheres have formation ages of ≤500 Ma, while only ~13% of the lunar impact glass shards have ages ≤500 Ma. Most of the impact glass shards have ages ≥2000 Ma, and a remnant population has ages >3500 Ma, with some as old as ~3900 Ma.   Investigation: Using the results of argon diffusion experiments of Apollo 16 impact glasses with compositions similar to the typical Apollo 16 regolith, Gombosi et al. [4] suggested that significant loss of radiogenic 40 Ar could occur in those glasses due diurnal changes in temperature near the lunar surface. Gombosi et al. [4] also proposed that melt structure, which is closely related to chemical composition, and diffusivity of radiogenic 40 Ar could be described using the fraction of non-bridging oxygens, X(NBO) [5,6]. We have suggested that shape, size, and composition together [7,8,9] can best characterize any impact glass. Thus, as a result of the Gombosi et al. [4] investigation, lunar impact glasses from all data sets [7-12] were re-assessed to determine if shape, size, and/or major-element composition might affect how well the lunar impact glass could retain argon. Of these many samples, only dust-free and inclusion-free lunar impact glasses with known sizes, shapes, and chemical compositions were evaluated. Results: As noted previously, [1,3], argon diffusion strongly depends on composition, which we have described by the fraction of non-binding oxygen atoms in a specific major element, X(NBO) [5,6]. By assuming that thermal diffusion during cosmic ray exposure (CRE) in the shallow lunar regolith was the main process for causing Ar loss in lunar glasses, a model to determine how temperature and time affect Ar diffusion was developed [2]. We found that the retention of radiogenic 40 Ar is a strong function of temperature and sample size [2]. As a result, not all lunar impact glasses will report true 40 Ar/ 39 Ar formation ages. Discussion: We have reported that glasses with the lowest values of X(NBO) (e.g., <0.21; feldspathic compositions) would be most susceptible to diffusive loss of radiogenic 40 Ar, while glasses with X(NBO) >0.21 have a distinctly older distribution of 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages [1]. Using the model that shows how argon diffusion depends on time and temperature (Figure 1), we show that samples with high X(NBO) values (i.e., more mafic compositions), larger size, and shorter CRE ages are more likely to yield reliable 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages of the impact melting event, instead of a minimum value (i.e., apparent age) caused by diffusive-loss of radiogenic 40 Ar [4].  In the set of glasses that yielded reliable 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages, there is a paucity of impact glass spheres with 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages ≥2000 Ma (Figure 2). We suggest that lunar impact glass spheres have limited lifespans prior to being broken into angular shards. If this is correct, 40 Ar/ 39 Ar age distributions of lunar impact glass spheres would be intrinsically biased toward young ages. Old impact glasses, on the other hand, are dominated by shards (Figure 2), many of which have ages ≥3500 Ma and a few as old as ≥3900 Ma. With a large compositional range (X(NBO) = 0.22-0.38), these impact glasses could represent multiple impact melting events into compositionally diverse regions, perhaps during the tail end of the late heavy bombardment.   As a result of the observations of Figures 1 and 2, we present a lunar impact flux (Figure 3) that reflects a plausible distribution of lunar impact glasses whose sizes were large enough to yield reliable 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages.    Conclusion: (i) Size, shape, chemical composition, and rates of diffusive loss of radiogenic 40 Ar are important for interpreting the reported 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages. (ii) Since impact glass spheres have short lifetimes (≤1000 Ma) before being broken into shards, lunar impact glass shards are more likely to be old. (iii) Due to their high diffusive Ar diffusion coefficients, feldspathic impact glasses have less potential for recording old 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages than do glasses with high X(NBO) values.
