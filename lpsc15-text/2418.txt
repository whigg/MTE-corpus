Calibration for the Estimation of Weight Fractions using non-linear Spectral Unmixing.  N. Mengewein, A. Grumpe, D. Rommel and C. Wöhler Image Analysis Group, TU Dortmund, 44227 Dortmund, Germany ({natascha.mengewein  arne.grumpe  daniela.rommel}@tu-dortmund.de).   Introduction: Spectral unmixing has been applied to a variety of scientific scenarios, e.g. remotely sensed spectral data of the lunar surface [e.g. 1, 2, 3]. Commonly, the spectral reflectance is modelled as a linear combination of base spectra, i.e. spectral endmembers. According to [4, p. 283ff.] the linear combination is invalid for intimate mixtures, e.g. mixtures where the light is scattered at particles of different material before it reaches the sensor.  The resulting non-linear unmixing scenario, however, may be linearised if the single-scattering albedo of the Hapke model [5] is unmixed. The resulting mixing coefficients are sometimes interpreted as weight fractions. This interpretation, however, is invalid as we will discuss in this study. We furthermore present an approach to quantify the weight and the mol fractions of the endmember minerals. Mixture model: According to [4, p. 283], the single-scattering albedo of the mixture is a weighted sum of the endmember single-scattering albedos, i.e.                           where w denotes the single-scattering albedo, Ni, σi and Qei are the amount of particles, the average particle cross-section and the average extinction coefficient, literally the average darkness of a particle, of the i-th endmember, respectively. In this study we assume a constant grain size for all particles and thus eliminate σi. Notably, the denominator acts as a normalisation factor. We collect the total amount of particles Ni and the extinction coefficient Qe1 of the first endmember from both sums. Consequently, the amount of particles is conveniently expressed by the mol fractions ni of the endmembers and the weights depend solely on the ratio qi= Qei/Qe1 of the endmember extinction coefficients:                     The absolute value of the extinction coefficient is not important and consequently, we set the extinction coefficient of the darkest mineral, i.e. ilmenite, to a value of one and estimate the ratio of each endmember with respect to the darkest one. Dataset and calibration procedure: In this study we use the endmember catalog of [6] comprised of an ilmenite, an olivine, a diallagite, an eulite, an augite, an enstatite and two different labradorites. Initially, a smoothing spline [7] is applied to all measured reflectance spectra. Single scattering albedos are then obtained by a minimisation of the squared difference between the measured and the modeled reflectance spectra. The remaining paramters of the Hapke model [5] are adopted from [8]. The wavelength range is limited from 750 to 1750 nm due to low signal to noise ratios in the upper and lower wavelength ranges. In order to estimate the extinction coefficient ratios, we create a mixture of each endmember with ilmenite using a weight fraction of 50 wt%, respectively. We compute the mixing coefficients of the singlescattering albedos using a linear least-squares optimisation with a sum-to-one constraint, i.e. the sum of the coefficients is enforced to a value of one. We then convert the weight fractions to mol fractions and solve the mixing equation for the unknown extinction coefficient ratio. The molar mass of each endmember, respectively, and the resulting extinction coefficient ratios are shown in Tab. 1. The extinction coefficient ratios are in very good agreement with the observed spectral brightness, i.e. the bright minerals enstatite and labradorite show small values.

Second, a mixture of enstatite and labradorite 2 which are an extreme case and on the opposite end of the brightness scale compared to ilmenite. Third, a mixture of augite, enstatite and labradorite 2. In this study we are interested in the accuracy of the method and thus assume the endmembers of the mixture to be known a-priori. The reflectance spectra of the mixtures and their modelled counterparts are shown in Fig. 1.   2418.pdf

The mixing coefficients of the ci Hapke model are again computed using the linear least-squares optimisation with a sum-to-one constraint. From the ratio               of the i-th and j-th coefficient and the constraint that all fractions sum to one follows that the mol fraction of the i-th endmember amounts to                  The obtained mol fractions are converted to weight fractions using the molar masses from Tab. 1. Tab. 2 summarises the weight fractions, the mixing coefficients and the estimated weight fractions. In all cases the mixing coefficients show deviations from the true weight fractions. This is especially pronounced in the presence of ilmenite. The estimated weight fractions are in good agreement with the true weight fractions. However, there is a larger residual inaccuracy for the brighter mixtures that do not contain ilmenite.

The true and estimated wt% values are in good agreement while the mixing coefficients show larger inaccuracies if ilmenite is present. Conclusion: In this study we propose a new calibration procedure for spectral unmixing algorithms using the Hapke model. The computed extinction coefficient ratios are applied to three distinct mixtures and show promising results. The estimated weight fractions are close to the true weight fractions and thus, in contrast to the mixing coefficients, have a physical interpretation. Future work will contain more calibration measurements and a further assessment of the accuracy on a wider range of mixtures.  References: [1] Mustard, J. F. and Pieters, C.
