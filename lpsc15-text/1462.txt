DETERMINATION OF PLUTO'S RADIUS DURING THE NEW HORIZONS ENCOUNTER. C. J. Thomason1*, F. Nimmo1, 1Dept. Earth and Planetary Sciences, University of California Santa Cruz, 1156 High St, SantaCruz, CA 95064, USA, (*cthomas1@es.ucsc.edu)Introduction: Pluto's mean radius  and shape arecurrently poorly constrained, but are important for understanding the interior structure [1]. To date the bestestimates of Pluto's radius come from stellar occultation events.  These measurements  are limited becauseof  Pluto's  small  angular  size  (<0.1  arcsec)  and  thesmall  angular  separation  between  Pluto  and  Charon(<1 arcsec)[1]. This is further complicated by the possibility of a transient atmosphere around Pluto. Uncertainties in the radius of Pluto tend to be ~10km. TheNew Horizons encounter will provide high resolutionimages  from  LOng-Range  Reconnaissance  Imager(LORRI) [2] permitting a much improved radius determination. Here we investigate the accuracy with whichthe radius will be recovered.Method: We wrote a MATLAB GUI named LimbDetect. The basic methodology follows that of [3] andconsists  of  four  steps: initial  guessing,  finding  theedge, removing bad picks, and fitting the ellipse.Initial guessing. In contrast to [3], LimbDetect requires an initial ellipse. LimbDetect can either take auser input guess ellipse or can determine the guess automatically. The automatic method takes advantage ofthe fact that there is a sharp brightness gradient alongthe limb. The automatic guess ellipse is the ellipse fitto all points in the largest cluster of points where theimage gradient is within 30% of the maximum value.Picking limb points. LimbDetect refines its picks ofthe edge from the initial guess by scanning the imagealong both rows and columns. Along each scan a foreground (on-body) value is calculated. This value is calculated as the mean of points within a range set by theuser in relation to the guess ellipse radius. An imagebackground value is also calculated as the median ofall points outside of the guess ellipse. For each scan,the limb location is determined by interpolation as thepoint where the DN value is some percentage of thedifference  between  the  foreground  and  backgroundvalues. This percentage is nominally 50% but can bechanged by the user.Rejecting bad points. Because LimbDetect scans inboth directions along each row and column there arealways a large number of spurious picks. In addition tomanual point removal, we have also implemented twoautomated tools that perform equally well.The primary tool is cluster filtering. This works bygrouping all of the points into clusters where each cluster is defined as the group of points each within 3 pixels  of  another  cluster  member.  The  user  can  thenchoose to keep the N clusters with the most data points.N is  usually set  to 1;  however larger  values may beused if the edge is a discontinuity along the edge (e.g.Saturn's rings transecting the limb). A secondary filtering technique uses the DN gradient. When the location of the edge is determined, thegradient  at  that  point  is  recorded.  Because  the  fluxshould fall off towards the background, any points witha  positive  gradient  are  immediately  discarded.  Aftercluster filtering the user can remove the 5% of pointswith the smallest magnitude gradient. This process canbe repeated as many times as required, and is useful forremoving points along the terminator.Ellipse fitting.  Once the edge picks are  made wehave two methods for finding the best fit ellipse. Thefirst is the analytical least-squares solution presented in[4]. When the two ellipse axes are close in magnitudethe  rotation  angle  becomes  poorly  constrained.  Because of this we have also implemented a numericalleast-squares  algorithm that  takes  as  input  a  rotationangle.Ellipse Fitting Sensitivity: One test for the stability  of  the  ellipse  is  to  systematically  remove  datapoints from a full synthetic ellipse and see how it affects the fit  ellipse parameters. Figure 1 shows the results of this test with 2000 initial data points and ±1pixel of random noise in the x and y of each data point.We define the solution score  as =0.25*(x0+y0+a+b),  where  x0,  y0 are  the  coordinates  of  thecentre of the ellipse, a and b are the ellipse major andminor axes,  and x0  etc.  denote the absolute difference between the two estimates. The analytic solutionbegins to degrade first which is to be expected since itis solving for an additional parameter (the rotation angle).  The  analytic  solution  begins  to  degrade  whenthere is less than ~40% of the ellipse while the numerical solution is stable until less than a quarter of the ellipse is present. The reason the solutions begin to degrade  is  the  solution  starts  to  become  non-unique.When fitting half an ellipse with noise, a tradeoff develops between  x0 and a and a corresponding tradeoffbetween y0 and b. Depending on the orientation of thehalf  ellipse,  one  of  these  pairs  will  be  better  constrained than the other. These tradeoffs will also occurwith real images. As the number of points is reducedthe fitting also becomes more sensitive to points nearthe edge. Because of these effects, small differences inthe edge picks can be amplified in the ellipse fits.1462.pdf

Figure 1: Quality of the ellipse fits as a function of the fraction of the ellipse used.Pick Validation: To quantify the accuracy of ourpicks we compared them with independent picks of individual  Cassini  ISS  images  of  Rhea  [5].  Table  1shows that the median distance between the two sets ofpicks was <0.25 pix with no manual removal of points,while the solution scores (see above) range from ~0.25pixel up to 3.6 pixels. This wide range of in  is due tothe sensitivities of ellipse fitting described above. Figure 3 shows that both techniques pick up the same topographic  features  along  the  limb.  Applying  theLORRI  point-spread  function  (Table1:N1514059120psf) had only a minor effect on ourability to determine the edge.Image Resolution(km/pix)Median Misfit (pix)(pix)N1514059120 2.00 0.25 1.59N1514059120psf 0.38 1.80N1499997214 2.03 0.18 0.28N1516199584 1.46 0.18 3.66SYN Basic 0.26 2.75SYN Smooth 0.27 2.09SYN Rough 0.29 4.56Table 1: Evaluation of our limb picks. Cassini images are compared to those done by Peter Thomas [6]. The limb picks shown used only cluster filtering (i.e. no user input in removing points). Synthetic images are denoted by SYN and are compared with the model limb.As an additional  test  we created  a series  of  synthetic Pluto images using a plausible photometric function [7] and point-spread function [8] and the plannedNew Horizons viewing geometry. Synthetic images included  varying  levels  of  simulated  limb  topographyalong with other complicating factors such as surfacealbedo variations,  and image noise.  The median distance between LimbDetect picks and the true limb locations was always less than half a pixel and was onaverage 0.3 pixels. The ellipse parameters were consistently correct to within 3 pixels, and within 1 pixel forthe better-constrained of the two axes. Combining images from different geometries will reduce the ellipseuncertainties.Conclusions: Through comparison with our models and published results we believe that LimbDetectcan  accurately  determine  the  location  of  a  planetarylimb to within a quarter of a pixel. The ellipse parameters fit to that limb are much less certain and depend onthe amount of surface topography as well as the illumination angle. Still we expect to be able to recover thewell defined axis to within 1 pixel and the orthogonalaxis to within 3 pixels.
