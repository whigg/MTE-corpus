Introduction: By the most accepted theory of lunar origin, a giant impact on Earth led to the formation of the Moon, and also initiated the final stage of Earth's core segregation [1]. Core formation should have removed the highly siderophile elements (HSE) from the bulk silicate Earth (BSE), yet HSE abundances are higher than expected [2]. One explanation for this overabundance is that a 'late veneer' of primitive material was added to the BSE after the core formed. To test this hypothesis, W isotopes are useful because (1) the late veneer material had different 182W/184W than the BSE, and (2) proportionally more material was added to the Earth than the Moon [2]. Thus, if a late veneer occurred, the 182W compositions of the BSE and Moon must be different. Moreover, the giant Moon-forming impact would have likely also created 182W differences because impactor mantle and core material with distinct 182W/184W mixed with protoEarth during the giant impact.  However, determining the lunar 182W/184W is complicated by cosmic ray-induced secondary neutron capture reactions. These reactions not only involve 182W production via neutron capture on 181Ta, but also neutron capture-induced burnout of 182W. Hence, the previously measured ε182W=0.09±0.10 (2 s.e.) (ε182W is the parts per 104 deviation from the 182W/184W of the present-day BSE) for the Moon [3], which was based on Ta- and thus cosmogenic-182W-free lunar metals, may have been lowered by 182W-burnout, and therefore only provides a minimum estimate. Without a suitable neutron dosimeter, the previously measured ε182W values of the lunar metals had been corrected using cosmic ray exposure ages, but these do not directly measure the neutron dose that affects W isotopes. Furthermore, the analytical precision of the previous studies was >10 ppm (2 s.e.) for individual samples, which is insufficient to resolve a small 182W anomaly of the Moon. Consequently, it has been unclear until now whether the Moon and present-day BSE differ significantly in ε182W.  To precisely determine the ε182W of the Moon, we analyzed KREEP-rich samples using improved techniques for high-precision W isotope measurements by MC-ICPMS [4] combined with a new approach for quantifying cosmogenic ε182W variations using Hf isotopes [5].  Results: The KREEP-rich samples exhibit a welldefined ε182W-ε180Hf correlation (Fig. 1), reflecting neutron capture-induced modifications of both Hf and W isotope compositions. The pre-exposure ε182W (i.e., unaffected by neutron capture) of KREEP is defined either by the intercept of the ε182W-ε180Hf correlation (Fig. 1) or by samples lacking significant ε180Hf anomalies (14321, 68115, 68815) and is +0.28±0.04 (95% conf.). We interpret this value to represent that of the bulk silicate Moon, because lunar differentiation at ~4.4 Ga [6] postdates 182Hf extinction. This is consistent with previously reported ε182W values for nonirradiated mare basalts [3], which are indistinguishable from the KREEP value determined here. Discussion: The well-resolved 182W excess of the Moon compared to the present-day BSE places important constraints on the occurrence of the late veneer as well as on its mass and timing. The mass and composition of the late veneer is constrained through absolute and relative HSE abundances and ratios of S, Se and Te in Earth's primitive mantle [2,7,8]. On this basis, the late veneer likely has a carbonaceous chondrite-like composition with a minor fraction of iron meteorite-like material [8], corresponding to ~0.35 % of Earth's mass. Mass balance considerations imply that the addition of a late veneer of this composition lowered the ε182W of the BSE by ~0.15 to ~0.40 (Fig. 2). A late veneer composed exclusively of known groups of chondrites would have resulted in an only slightly smaller but still consistent shift of ~0.1 to ~0.3 ε182W [9,10]. The corresponding effect of the late veneer on the lunar ε182W is negligible, given that the mass fraction added to the lunar mantle was an order of magnitude smaller than that added to the Earth [2].

Solid line shows a best-fit linear regression through the data points, which provides the pre-exposure ε182W at ε180Hf=0. Error bars indicate external uncertainties (95% conf. or 2 s.d.).   the present-day BSE of +0.28±0.04 can be entirely accounted for by the addition of 182W-depleted material to the BSE during late accretion, with a total mass consistent with that derived from the HSE abundances in Earth's mantle [2,8] (Fig. 2). This implies that previously accumulated HSEs in the Earth's mantle had been sequestered into Earth's core during the giant impact [2], demonstrating that the entire late veneer was added after the giant impact and the final stages of core segregation. These 182W results, therefore, provide independent evidence for the late veneer hypothesis by demonstrating that the HSE abundances in the Earth's mantle were established by addition of primitive material after the Earth's core formed. The above data suggest that the pre-late veneer BSE and the Moon have an indistinguishable ε182W. This implies that there is no resolvable radiogenic 182W difference between the Moon and the Earth, probably because the Moon formed late [3,6]—when 182Hf was already extinct—or because the BSE and Moon have very similar Hf/W. In addition, the data suggest that the giant impact did not induce a 182W anomaly in the Moon. This is not easily explained because the giant impact would have modified the ε182W of proto-Earth's mantle (1) by adding impactor mantle material, which presumably had distinct ε182W, and (2) through the (partial) equilibration of the impactor core with the proto-Earth's mantle. As such, the ε182W of the protoEarth's mantle before the giant impact was most likely different from its post-giant impact value (Fig. 3), meaning that the Moon and the post-giant impact Earth's mantle would probably not have a homogeneous ε182W. Moreover, the lunar accretion disk would have contained W-rich but 182W-depleted impactor core material, which consequently generated a  significant shift in the W isotope composition of the protolunar material. Thus, while specific impactor and proto-Earth compositions and impact conditions that match the 182W compositions of the pre-late veneer BSE and the Moon can be identified [11], it is far more likely to produce significant Earth-Moon ε182W differences, even if the Moon predominantly consists of proto-Earth material. Consequently, it would take extraordinary circumstances to generate the Earth-Moon ε182W homogeneity through mixing of proto-Earth and impactor material during the giant impact.  The ε182W homogeneity might be accounted for by post-giant impact equilibration between the lunar accretion disk and the Earth's mantle [12], but this would be difficult for a refractory element like W [13]. Other possibilities for the ε182W homogeneity might be that the Moon was formed through impact-triggered fission from a fast-spinning proto-Earth [14] or that efficient equilibration occurred during the collision of two halfEarths [15]. However, in both scenarios it still has to be evaluated as to whether equilibration between impactor and proto-Earth would be possible prior to ejection of the proto-lunar material. Either way, the EarthMoon 182W homogeneity constitutes a fundamental constraint on any successful model of lunar origin.
