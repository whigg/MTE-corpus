(akalyaan@asu.edu)    Introduction: Planet formation models rely on knowledge of the distribution of mass in protoplanetary disks (PPDs), the surface density profile Σ(r) as a function of distance r from the star. Model disks are usually evolved using the equations of [1], assuming a viscosity ν = α C H [2], where C and H are the local sound speed and disk scale height. α is a dimensionless constant, usually taken to be ~ 0.01, but in fact it should be calculated from first principles after identifying the angular momentum transport mechanism in the disk. The magnetorotational instability (MRI) is increasingly recognized as this mechanism [3]. The MRI only operates where the ionization is high enough to couple the magnetic field to the gas of the disk, and the viscosity it generates will be non-uniform throughout PPDs, with α generally low in disk interiors, and high in their outer regions. [4]. The effect of non-uniform α on disk evolution has been little considered in the literature [5]. Another process only sometimes considered in such models [6-8] is external photoevaporation of the disk by the far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation of nearby massive stars, which half of all disks are likely to experience [9]. These effects have never been considered simultaneously. In his update to the "minimum mass solar nebula", [10] argued that the solar system formed from a disk with p ≈ 2.2 between 5 AU and 30 AU, where Σ(r) ~ r-p, He constructed analytical, steadystate solutions and showed that this steep slope was attributable to external photevaporation. He also pointed out that externally photoevaporated disks could experience outward transport beyond a few AU, throughout the disk's evolution, affecting volatile transport. Here we test these ideas, building on previous work [11], presenting the first simulations that simultaneously include external photoevaporation, non-uniform α(r) due to the MRI, and a calculation of ionization equilibrium including dust.  Methods:  We perform 1D disk simulations, where the disk is divided into 60 radial zones between 0.1100 AU. To incorporate ionization effects and dust chemistry, we further divide each annulus into 25 vertical zones in z. At each (r,z) a simple chemical network is solved balancing ionization by stellar x rays [12] and cosmic rays [13] against recombination of Na ions and electrons in the gas phase and on grain surfaces. A grain size of a=1µm is assumed. We calculate steady-state abundances of ions and electrons, using the collision cross sections from [14], which includes the effects of grain charging. From the calculated ion abundances, we estimate α(r,z) using the formulations of [15] that include the non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic effects of ambipolar diffusion; we assume a saturated state of turbulence. From α(r,z), we calculate a vertically integrated mass-weighted <α>(r). We impose a floor of 10-5 on α in the inner disk, to assist the slow inner disk evolution. We also incorporate photoevaporation via the disk outer edge, using the treatment of [6], and evolve the disk for 5 Myr.  We perform a parameter study varying the global gas-to-dust (g/d) mass ratio in the disk, and the extent of photoevaporation via the G0 parameter (FUV flux in units of the background interstellar flux, 1.6 Habings). High g/d is a proxy for grain growth.   Figure 1: <α>(r) at times 0 Myr, 1 Myr, … , 5 Myr (from right to left) for the low-dust (g/d=10000) run.  Results:  We discuss results from three runs: 1. uniform α; 2. non-uniform α due to MRI with low dust (g/d=10000); and 3. non-uniform α due to MRI with a canonical amount of  dust (g/d=100). G0=1000 in each.  α profile: (Fig. 1) <α> calculated from MRI viscosity is found to vary significantly with r, varying from ~10-5 in the inner disk to 10-1 in the outer disk, unlike the constant value of 0.01 that is usually adopted. For the low-dust run, a sharp transition from low to high α occurs at 3AU, moving inward with time. A similar sharp transition in the high-dust run occurs farther out at 10-20 AU, also moving inward with time. This important transition region that can have significantly effects on planet growth is not seen with uniform α simulations.  Effects of dust: (Figs. 2, 3) Dust affects disk evolution by absorbing charges and drastically reducing the ion fraction in the dense disk interior. This lowers α and causes the inner disk to evolve much more slowly.  For uniform α, Σ(r) retains the shape of the initial t=0 profile (dashed curve, Fig. 2) for many Myr. In the low-dust run, infall onto the star is steady at 10-8 M ! yr-1 but the outer disk evolves very quickly, and the inner disk gains considerable mass. In the high-dust run, α is so low in the inner disk it practically doesn't evolve; infall onto the star plunges below 10-9 M ! yr-1 (Fig. 3). Mass instead accumulates in the middle disk (2 -10 AU).  Grain growth appears necessary for the inner disk to evolve. Mass may be depleted from > 10 AU and accumulate at 2-10 AU early on, then move inward as grains grow.  Effects of photoevaporation:  Fig. 3 shows profiles ofM .(r). Mass moves inward toward the star in the inner disk, but beyond the transition radius rT, typically at 8-20 AU, mass moves outward due to photoevaporation. In contrast to the uniform α case, rT moves inward with time, causing more and more mass from the inner disk to flow outward. Fig. 4 shows the average slope <p> of the surface density profile between 5-30 AU for the low-dust run, but with different values of G0. It is evident that due to more mass flowing outward, external photoevaporation causes steep slopes (<p> ≈ 2.2 for low-dust runs, ≈ 6 for high-dust runs) in the outer disk  during the first few Myr. Conclusions: From our simulations, we find that disk structure and evolution are dramatically altered when subject to non-uniform α and external photoevaporation. Combination of both effects lead to outer disks (5-30 AU) that are much more steeper than the MMSN profile, and in some annuli mass increases with time. Outward transport is more common in such disks.These aspects will have dramatic implications for planet formation.   References: [1] Lynden-Bell, D. and Pringle, J.E. (1974) MNRAS 168, 603-637.
