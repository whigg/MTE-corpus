Introduction: The recent flood of lunar data has provided unprecedented views of the Moon which have revealed that the lunar surface contains prime examples of numerous lithologies with several possible origins, inviting new research [e.g., 1 - 11]. The Copernicus lunar quadrangle (Fig. 1) is an excellent example of such a compositionally richly diverse region. However, the abundance and complexity of modern lunar data result in increasingly varied models for lunar surface processes. In an effort to provide a comprehensive understanding of the geologic evolution of the lunar crust and surface within the Copernicus quadrangle, we are integrating multiple data sets using a variety of methodologies.  Figure 1. The base image is a color-coded version of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) topographic map (100 m/pix). Also shown are features with major compositional variations that serve as key locations to investigate. Traditionally, two investigative strategies have been employed to determine the distribution and origin of specific geologic features and lithologies on the Moon: geologic/morphologic mapping and compositional mapping. Rarely have the two methods been fused for lunar science investigations with the specific intent of producing a USGS geologic map. The abundance of high-resolution lunar data, in combination with the integration of end-member mapping methodologies, has the potential to provide significant new constraints on the formation and evolution of the lunar crust, to establish a comprehensive geologic and stratigraphic context wherein subsequent studies can be conducted, and to delineate refined approaches for the systematic production of geologic maps of the Moon.  This mapping project addresses several major lunar science issues including: 1) examination of the heterogeneity of lunar crustal materials and their vertical and horizontal distribution, 2) spatial and temporal variation of lunar lithologies, 3) refinements of the geologic and stratigraphic architecture of referent lunar materials, and 4) efficiency assessments of lunar mapping methods, including the role of data set type and resolution within the 1:2.5M scale quad-based mapping scheme. The new constraints on the composition and structure of the lunar crust resulting from this work will improve estimates of the bulk composition of the Moon and allow new tests of models for its origin and evolution. Current Mapping Efforts: To improve our understanding of the evolution of the lunar crust within the Copernicus quad we are using compositional data sets, such as the Lunar Prospector Gamma Ray and Neutron Spectrometer elemental data, to address two areas of interest that exhibit anomalous compositional characteristics (i.e., low iron abundances and elevated thorium abundances) compared to the surrounding terrain.  Timocharis crater. The first area of interest is dominated by Timocharis crater (Fig. 2), a 34 km diameter crater located in eastern Mare Imbrium (at 26.72°N and -13.1°E), which has slumped interior walls, a central peak, and ~1 km of rim relief. Using highresolution data from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera we conducted an initial morphologic study of Timocharis crater, which revealed several unique features that could be the sources of the anomalous geochemical signatures seen in the region [12]. The unique features include an unusually shaped central peak that has a central pit and may have experienced an impact event, and several small (≤ 1.25 km diameter), higheralbedo, domical features at the base of the western crater wall with meter- to decimeter-sized rocky debris superposed on the finer-grained, surface materials. Using forward modeling approaches to estimate the thorium and iron abundances of individual features within the crater, we found that the exposed lithologies in the center of the crater are consistent with monzodiorites from the lunar sample suite. Monzodiorites are the intrusive equivalents of rhyodacite, indicating the presence of a compositionally evolved lithology (12-18   wt.% FeO, 1-3 wt.% TiO2, and 10-44 ppm Th) that is distinctly different from the major rock types found in the mare or highlands. The identification of this lithology in Timocharis crater is also intriguing because the composition is consistent with lithologies found in the adjacent Apennine Bench Formation [4]. These results suggest that there is a regional distribution of monzodiorite likely excavated by Timocharis, that may be composed of impact melt derived from the origin of Imbrium basin.  Schröter F Satellite Feature. The second region of interest for compositional mapping is Schröter F, a purported 29 km diameter satellite feature located at 7.4°N and -5.9°E. Preliminary characterization of the site suggests the feature is a perched basalt pond (Clementine and Kaguya Multiband Imager spectral ratio maps confirm a mafic mineralogy). Lunar Prospector Gamma Ray Spectrometer (LP-GRS) thorium data indicate that there is a significant thorium enhancement (i.e., > 10 ppm Th) centered on this feature. The surface of the feature appears to have fewer craters compared to the surrounding terrain. Given this observation we conducted crater counting modeling of the unit [e.g., 13, 14], and determined that the feature has a 3.6 Ga emplacement age and a 1.3 Ga resurfacing age. The resurfacing age is controlled primarily by the youngest, freshest craters; these appear to have unexpectedly subdued morphologies, possibly reflecting rheologic controls on the feature. Additional constraints on the material and compositional properties of the feature can be derived from the observation that it overlies two regional grabens or fissures that appear to intersect under Schröter F. We are currently engaged in forward modeling of the thorium and iron data to assess the composition of the feature and thus to determine whether it is a likely source of the geochemical anomaly observed in the region.
