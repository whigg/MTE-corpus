 1 THE MARGINAL CASE FOR SULFUR-DRIVEN WARMING IN THE EARLY MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE. L. Kerber1, F. Forget2, R. Wordsworth3, 1Jet Propulsion Laboratory (4800 Oak Grove Dr. Pasadena, CA 91109, kerber@jpl.nasa.gov), 2Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique du CNRS, Université Paris 6, Paris, France, 3Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, 29 Oxford Street Cambridge, MA 02138  Introduction:  A successful working model for the early Martian atmosphere and hydrosphere must be able not only to produce conditions suitable for liquid water at the surface, but also to explain how the nature of this aqueous activity changed over time and eventually diminished. There are two major endmember hypotheses: first, that early Mars was wet and warm, with a sustained greenhouse that made it possible for liquid water to be stable on the surface for extended periods [e.g., 1, 2-4], and second, that early Mars was generally cold, and that most of the aqueous alteration took place underground [5,6] or during transient warm periods tied to impact cratering [7], or volcanism [8]. In both cases, volcanic gases (especially SO2) have been suggested as a possible way of creating either a sustained or transient greenhouse. Several researchers have tested the addition of SO2 to climate models in order to assess whether it would provide an adequate amount of greenhouse warming to allow liquid water to flow across the surface [9-12], with differing results.  Here we reconsider the efficacy of a sulfurinduced greenhouse in early Noachian history using the LMD (Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique) 3-D Generic Climate Model (LMD-GCM), exploring the effects of SO2, H2S gases and sulfate and sulfur aerosols on the surface temperature. We expand upon earlier works, using improved CO2 spectroscopy, radiatively active CO2 ice clouds, and more complete S8 optical properties. The goals for this work are to determine:  (1) Whether (and by how much) SO2 and H2S were capable of warming the early Martian surface. (2) How SO2-derived warming varies depending on location on the planet, and how that compares to the spatial distribution of valley networks and aqueous mineral deposits.   (3) Whether (and by how much) sulfate and elemental sulfur aerosols were capable of cooling the Martian surface. Methods: The GCM used in this study was developed for general planetary applications, and includes generalized radiative transfer and cloud physics [e.g., 13]. The model was adapted specifically to early Mars conditions and used by Forget et al. [14] to explore the effects of a CO2 atmosphere from 0.1 to 7 bars, including the effects of different obliquities, orbital parameters, cloud microphysical parameters, atmospheric dust loading, and surface properties (see also [13]).  Control simulations were run at 0.5 bars with a 32x32x15 grid, corresponding to a resolution of 11.25º longitude by 5.625º latitude in the horizontal with 15 vertical levels from the surface to ~50 km. Simulations with H2O were run with a relative humidity profile derived from the full, self-consistent water cycle (including CO2 and water ice clouds) used in [13]. The relative humidity in this profile is 45% near the surface with the hygropause near 8 km. Results: Sulfur-bearing gases do significantly warm the surface given high enough concentrations. Even in the cases where large amounts of SO2 and H2S (and H2O) are added to the atmosphere, however, the annual global average surface temperature does not rise above freezing (given a faint young Sun). H2S provides significantly less warming than SO2 (Fig. 1)  Effect of Sulfur Gases on the Early Martian Atmosphere21022023024025026027010 100 1000 10000ppmv of gasAnnual Average Surface Temperature (K)H2SSO2H2S + H2OSO2 + H2SSO2 + H2OSO2 + H2S + H2O Figure 1.   The Effect of Pressure The pressure of the Martian atmosphere during this time is not well known, so a default value is usually selected either because it is "reasonable" based on the limited constraints available, or because it maximizes warming. However, the choice of background pressure can affect the result significantly, to the same order as a difference between 0 and 10000 ppm of SO2. We modeled a large range of atmospheric pressures, from 5 mbars to 2 bars. Within this range, higher pressures yield higher temperatures, although annual average temperatures still did not exceed 273 K for the tested cases. A given temperature can be reached with a much lower SO2 mixing ratio in a high pressure atmosphere, though a given mixing ratio actually requires more SO2 in a thick atmosphere compared to a thin one.

  2 While average temperatures might not allow melting, regional and seasonal temperatures can be much higher. Figure 2 shows maps of average annual surface temperature for different scenarios: CO2 only, H2O+CO2, CO2+SO2 (100 ppmv), and CO2+H2O+SO2 (100 ppmv). Significant warming is observed in Hellas Basin and around 30ºN. These locations change depending on assumed orbital parameters such as longitude of perihelion and obliquity.  Figure 2.   The Effect of Sulfur and Sulfate Aerosols Aerosol simulations were first run in a dry CO2 atmosphere with well-mixed 1 μm H2SO4 or S8 particles with opacities ranging from τ= 0.2 to 10 (at 550 nm). These produced cooling from a few degrees to ~23 K for H2SO4 τ= 10. A single layer of H2SO4 aerosols of the same opacity produced similar results.

While a significant amount of SO2 gas is required to create a moderate amount of surface warming, only a very small amount of aerosol is needed for dramatic cooling. For example, if 100 ppmv of SO2 was released into the atmosphere, and only 0.04% of it became 0.1-μm H2SO4 particles, the entire warming effect of the SO2 would be cancelled out. Figure 3 shows the cooling effects of sulfate and sulfur aerosols versus the mixing ratio in ppmv of equivalent H2SO4 or S8 gas. Each line ends at the mixing ratio which creates an optical depth of 10 (at 550 nm). The green line shows the combined effect of 100 ppmv of SO2 with rising amounts of H2SO4 aerosol. The warming from the SO2 is quickly canceled out by small amounts of H2SO4 aerosol. Large (10 μm), warming aerosols, require larger concentrations in order to arrive at an optical depth of 10 (still less than 5 ppmv).  Conclusions: From these results we can make several conclusions: (1) SO2 and H2S gases, considered alone, would warm the surface of Mars. A hot, enduring greenhouse is unlikely, but concentrations of SO2 up to several hundreds to thousands of ppmv would be sufficient to bring temperatures above freezing for certain regions during certain portions of the year. This is true of atmospheres up to 2 bars (the thickest atmosphere tested).  (2)  Depending on assumed orbital parameters, the areas which spend the greatest time above 273K change. For example, using an eccentricity of zero leads to greater warming taking place in the northern lowlands, while a high eccentricity and a modern-day longitude of perihelion leads to greatest warming in the southern highlands close to the equator.   (3) Even a small amount (<0.05 ppmv) of H2SO4 production in common size ranges would cancel out SO2-derived warming. S8 would cause cooling in the small particle range, but warming if all of the particles could grow to more than 3 μm.   References: [1] Baker, V.R. et al. (1991) Nature 352, 589-594.
