( Email: jxxia@mail.ustc.edu.cn)  Introduction: The silicate Earth is depleted in Cr relative to chondrites [1]. The missing Cr could have been partitioned into the Earth's core.. Recent measurements of the Cr isotope composition of chondrites showed that δ53Cr of chondrites varied from -0.4 to 0.2‰ [3] relative to the NIST SRM 979 standard, which are systematically lighter than the value of the bulk silicate Earth (BSE, -0.12±0.10‰) [4, 5]. The heavier Cr isotope composition of the BSE was attributed to partitioning of isotopically light Cr into the core if core segregation occurred at a relatively low temperature [3]. However, only a limited number of samples from each major mantle reservoir have been studied so far. Considering the potential importance of Cr isotope composition in resolving the Earth's evolution, further investigation of the Cr isotope fractionation behavior in mantle-derived rocks during high temperature processes is needed to constrain the Cr isotope composition of the BSE. Methods: Twenty two well-studied Hawaiian Oceanic Island Basalts (OIBs) from Kilauea Iki, Koolau and Mauna Kea [6-8] and twenty nine mantle xenoliths from different geological settings (Central Mongolia, North China Craton, South Africa [9-12]) were studied for Cr stable isotope compositions. Samples containing chromites and spinels were fused with lithium borates following the procedure described in [13]. Other samples were digested with the conventional HNO3-HF digestion method. Sample solutions containing about 1μg Cr were mixed with an appropriate amount of 50Cr54Cr double spike before column chemistry. Chemical separation procedures followed those described in [13]. The Cr isotope compositions were measured on a Thermo Finnigan Triton multi-collector thermal ionization mass spectrometer at DTM following the procedure described in [13], except that each spiked sample was only analyzed once.  Within each analytical session, spiked NIST SRM 979 Cr standard was loaded on two filaments and measured at least three times. The resulting 2 standard deviation for these standard measurements is usually 0.02 ~ 0.03‰ on δ53Cr.  The internal errors (2s.e.) for individual sample analyses were usually slightly larger (0.02 ~ 0.06‰). The long-term reproducibility of NIST SRM 979 standard over a period of one year is 0.035‰. We also measured the δ53Cr for NIST SRM 3112a Cr standard and we found a difference of -0.09±0.02‰, which is consistent with the value of  -0.07±0.02‰ reported by [4].   Fig. 1. δ53Cr vs whole rock Al2O3 for all mantle xenoliths  Results and Discussions: As shown in Fig. 1, the δ53Cr values of mantle peridotites are widely dispersed ranging from -0.40±0.01‰ to +0.12±0.03‰. One pyroxenite vein from Shavaryn has the most negative δ53Cr (-0.77±0.06‰) currently found in natural systems [4, 5]. The δ53Cr values of mantle xenoliths from Shavaryn are negatively correlated with the whole rock Al2O3 (Fig. 1) and CaO contents. The peridotite xenoliths from Shavaryn are largely unmetasomatised spinel lherzolites that range from fertile to just slightly meltdepleted compositions. Thus the variation in δ53Cr is not the result of metasomatism. Two possible processes include diffusion and partial melting that might contribute to the δ53Cr variation. The lack of correlation between δ53Cr and the Cr content indicates that diffusion is not likely the cause. Studies [14] have shown that Al2O3 could be a better indicator of the degree of partial melting than the Mg# or MgO content. The negative correlations of δ53Cr with both the Al2O3 and CaO contents suggest that partial melting preferentially incorporates light Cr isotopes into the melt, leaving heavy Cr isotopes in the residue rocks. So far this unique, large Cr isotope fractionation seems to only occurr in Shavaryn xenoliths. The exact mechanism is not yet fully understood. 2505.pdf

There is no correlation between δ53Cr and Al2O3 or CaO for mantle xenoliths from Haer and Hannuoba. The variation in δ53Cr in these xenoliths could be influenced by metasomatism [10]. The South African, the samples form a trend below the regression line defined by Shavaryn xenoliths. We found that their δ53Cr values are correlated with the LOI index and the TiO2/ Al2O3 ratio, indicating that their δ53Cr values are controlled by secondary alteration, such as weathering.    Fig. 2. Correlation of δ53Cr with Fe(T) for Hawaiian basalts  The Cr isotope composition of Hawaiian basalts show a variation with δ53Cr ranging from -0.21±0.01‰ to 0.00±0.04‰ (Fig. 2.). Compared to the relative homogenous Cr isotope composition of Koolau and Mauna Kea basalts, δ53Cr values of Kilauea basalts are positively correlated with Fe(T) (Fig.2.) and MgO content while negatively correlated with the Al2O3, CaO, Na2O and SiO2 contents. Negative correlations were observed between δ57Fe and MgO and between δ57Fe and Fe (T) for the same set of samples, which was interpreted to reflect fractional crystallization [6]. Unlike Fe isotopes, the major valence state of Cr in minerals is Cr3+, thus Cr is incompatible in olivine. At terrestrial oxygen fugacity, Cr mostly occurs as Cr3+, but it was found that at 1200℃-1400℃, Cr2+ was a significant oxidation state in the melt [15]. If so, at high temperature there might be both Cr2+ and Cr3+ in the melt while the crystallizing solids contain only Cr3+.  In this case, the solids would be expected to be enriched in heavy Cr isotopes. This is consistent with the result of [5] that the δ53Cr of mantle-derived chromites are systematically heavier than major mantle-derived igneous rocks. The correlations of δ53Cr with Fe(T) are consistent with fractional crystallization of chromites. Thermal or kinetic diffusion during fractional crystallization would lead to light Cr isotope enrichment in early crystals, and thus is not likely responsible for the positive correlation of δ53Cr with the MgO content and Fe(T). The relative homogenous δ53Cr of Koolau and Mauna Kea basalts might reflect the absence of chromite during fractional crystallization. To further constrain the Cr isotope composition of the silicate Earth, we correct the δ53Cr values of mantle peridotites from Shavaryn by fractional melting modelling and get an average value of  -0.19±0.12‰ (2SD) for all mantle xenoliths studied, except for South African mantle xenoliths. After correcting for the effect of fractional crystallization of chromites, we get an average δ53Cr value of -0.17±0.03‰ for Hawaiian basalts. Thus the new δ53Cr of the silicate Earth should be slightly lighter than the value (-0.12±0.10‰) suggested  previously [4, 5]. Conclusions:  Our new data show that: 1) Negative correlations of δ53Cr with both Al2O3 and CaO for mantle xenoliths from Shavaryn indicate that partial melting may play an important role in Cr isotope fractionation of mantle peridotites, although the mechanism needs to be further explored. 2) The co-variations of δ53Cr with MgO and Fe(T) for Kilauea Iki samples might reflect Cr isotope fractionation during fractional crystallization of chromite. 3) The Cr isotope variations in Shavaryn xenolithes and Kilauea basalts demonstrate that Cr isotope fractionation during igneous processes could be much more pronounced than previously assumed [4, 5].
