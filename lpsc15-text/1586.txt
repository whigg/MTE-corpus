Introduction: Mars' magnetotail is one of the main pathways for escape of planetary ions. The spatial and the velocity distribution of both planetary and solar-wind origin ions observed in the magnetotail provides information that can lead to the understanding of the physical processes that control particle transport around Mars. In this paper, we will present MAVEN observations of Marsward-traveling ions in the nearMars magnetotail. Tailward ion fluxes observed in the tail are often associated with escaping ions from the Martian ionosphere [e.g., 1], while ions with Marsward (sunward) velocities have not yet been studied in detail. Such planetward ions are commonly observed in the Venusian tail, and their sunward acceleration is attributed to magnetic reconnection between the oppositly directed lobe filed lines and/or planetward magnetic stress exerted by field lines tightely wrapped about the planet [2, 3, 4, 5]. Similarly, observations of planetward ions in the Martian tail have important implications for the structure and dynamics of the Martian magnetotail as well as for mass, momentum, and energy transfer between the solar wind and Martian magnetosphere. Observations: Marsward-traveling ions have been frequently observed by MAVEN in the Martian magnetotail. Figure 1 shows an example of such observations.

As MAVEN penetrates through the flank magnetosheath into the nightside magnetoail region, ion and magnetic field data exhibit a gradual transition from heated solar wind plasma with turbulent magnetic fields to mainly lowenergy, planetary ions with relatively smooth field variation. The STATIC and SWIA data clearly show the presence of multi-species, multi-component plasma in the magnetotail. The intense fluxes of both light and heavy ions with energies below 10 eV can be associated with planetary origin. Meanwhile, the directional SWIA energy spectra reveal substantial flux of Marsward-traveling ions with energies of 25—1000 eV in the tail region. The mass-separated STATIC energy spectra indicate that the 100—1000 eV ions consist primarily of light ions. Possible scenarios for generation of such Marsward-traveling light ions include that (i) sheath ions of solar wind origin leak into the magnetotail region and (ii) planetary ions that have once escaped from Mars are returned back to the planet by some mass-dependent mechanisms. Further analysis and discussion will be presented at the conference. References: [1] Fedrov A. et al. (2008) Planet. Space Sci., 56, 812-817. [2] Zhang T. L. et al. (2010) Geophys. Res.
