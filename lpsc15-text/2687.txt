CONSTRAINING THE ORIGIN OF APOLLO 17’S STATION 8 BOULDER: IMPLICATIONS FOR THE ORIGIN OF THE SCULPTURED HILLS AND THE Mg-SUITE.  N. E. Petro1, R. L. Klima2, and L. R. Ostrach1 1NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Planetary Geodynamics Laboratory, 2JHU/APL. (Noah.E.Petro@nasa.gov)   Introduction:  The small boulder sampled by the Apollo 17 crew at Station 8 is considered to be one of the best examples of the Mg-suite [1, 2]. However, the source of the boulder is enigmatic as it lacks a telltale boulder trail suggesting that the rock was emplaced ballistically [3]. We have previously used data from the Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) to identify potential source regions of the boulder in the immediate vicinity of the Apollo 17 landing site [4, 5]. While that search has shown that there is a diversity of mafic mineralogies in the Sculptured Hills (Figure 1), as suggested by Robinson and Jolliff [6] using Clementine UVVIS data, there are no obvious source craters associated with those exposures. In addition to the lack of a source crater, the pyroxene compositions of the exposures do not appear to be similar to that of the samples from Station 8 (78235-78238) [7].  Figure 1.

Here we identify potential source craters for the  Station 8 boulder on the basis of size (derived from the size of the boulder) and composition. By constraining possible source craters we place additional limitations on the origin of the Sculptured Hills [8]. The significance of the Station 8 boulder is in understanding both the origin of the Sculptured Hills as well as the Mg-Suite [9]. Constraining the Source of the Station 8 Boulder: Source Crater Size: The dimensions of the Station 8 boulder have been reported as 30 x 55 x 55 cm [1, 7], suggesting a volume of roughly 0.21 m3. In order to constrain the potential size of the source crater, we must first estimate the mass of the boulder [10, 11]. Assuming an upper limit density of 2840 kg/m3 [12] we assume a mass of 603 kg. We use the relationship derived by Gault and Heitowit [10], ml ~ 0.8 Me 0.8 where ml is the mass of the largest fragment ejected and Me is the total mass ejected by a crater. From that we estimate the size of the crater based on the volume of ejecta [13]. Based on our estimated mass we predict the smallest possible source crater to be ~1.5 km in diameter. Other relationships between block size and source crater sizes need to be evaluated [e.g., 11], yet the 1.5 km size provides a viable initial constraint. Source Crater Location: The position of the Station 8 boulder on the surface (Figure 2), perched ~20 meters above the valley floor [1, 3, 7], suggested that the delivery to the site was relatively low velocity and possibly “close” to the sample site [3] as the boulder did not disintegrate or form a secondary crater on impact.  Figure 2. Apollo image AS17-146-22365, showing the boulder prior to being sampling and being rolled over. There is no apparent crater associated with the boulder, and no boulder track. Crater Age/Blockiness: Jackson et al. [3] reported exposure ages for both the top and bottom of the boulder at 0.75 my, suggesting that prior to being introduced to the sampling site it resided elsewhere for approximately as long as it had been sitting on the surface prior to sampling. These ages suggests that the source crater should be optically immature (< 1 Ga) 2687.pdf

[14] and may be associated with a crater within a crater. It is likely that such a young source crater(s) would still retain some boulders at or near its rim. Both of these constraints are easily evaluated using derived parameters from near-IR [14, 15] or far-IR [16] spectral data. Possible Source Craters: Using the constraints described above we can begin to identify possible source craters that are young, blocky, and “close”. We define “close” here as being within ~50km, though this may be too far for a rock of the size of the boulder to travel without breaking apart on impact and not make a noticeable crater. At low impact velocities (<<1 km/s) and grazing angles (~>60º from vertical) such conditions are met [17]. The constraint of a dual crater scenario can be evaluated, but only once possible source craters are identified. Ultimately, any source crater should satisfy these criteria, then, once evaluated by M3 data, should exhibit a spectral signature of pyroxene compositions consistent with those measured in samples taken from the boulder. For example, samples of the boulder (78235) indicate that the modal mineralogy consists of 32-53.6% orthopyroxene and 68-39.2% plagioclase [18]. A preliminary survey of a broad region to the east and northeast of the Taurus-Littrow valley has been conducted (Figure 3). The Diviner-derived rock abundance map shows several craters within the Sculptured Hills [8] that are blocky, for example the two craters on the northern rim of the Taurus crater (28 km in diameter) while the OMAT parameter also indicates that there are several fresh exposures in the region. But, can a crater ~60 km from Station 8 deliver a boulder “safely” to the site? While there are a number of rocky surfaces in the immediate vicinity of Station 8, these are all associated with rockslide outcrops along the ridge of the North Massif. Therefore, the likelihood of impact survival needs to be assessed and tied to impact scaling models [17]. Implications: The origin of the Station 8 boulder has been enigmatic since its sampling over 42 years ago, but now with a wide-array of remote sensing data of the lunar surface we can identify potential source craters. We have previously shown [4, 5] that the Sculptured Hills immediately near Station 8 have a range of mafic compositions, yet none of the exposures appear to 1) be compositionally similar to the boulder, and 2) have a potential source crater that would deliver the sample to Station 8. We must assess the composition of any possible sources (see above) to identify pyroxene compositions that are favorable for the composition of the boulder. Data from M3 has been used widely to identify small blocky areas with “exotic” compositions, relative to the surround regolith [19-21]. As such we will also be able to identify a wider spatial range of compositions in the Sculptured Hills.  Figure 3. Data for the Apollo 17 region.
