Introduction: Highly siderophile elements (HSE: Re, Os, Ir, Ru, Rh, Pd, Pt, and Au) track initial metalsilicate partitioning and later differentiation and postcore formation additions to differentiated parent bodies (e.g., [1]). The resultant fractionations from these processses have led to variations in Os isotopes and HSE abundances in planetary mantles and their partial melt derivatives, providing important information about global-scale planetary processes. Previous studies of martian meteorites have led to the conclusion that HSE abundances in the martian mantle are roughly equivalent to terrestrial abundances, with Os isotopic compositions of martian meteorites being consistent with broadly chondritic Re-Os isotope evolution for the martian mantle [2-4]. The mantle and magmatic processes that established HSE in martian meteorites may therefore have been generally similar to processes that acted on terrestrial volcanic rocks [5]. To provide further constraints on martian mantle evolution, and as an update to prior studies [3,4], we report new 187Re-187Os and highly siderophile element (HSE: Os, Ir, Ru, Pt, Pd, Re) abundances, along with complementary major- and trace-element abundance data on nine shergottite meteorites spanning the known range of bulk compositions. Three new samples were obtained from the Meteorite Working Group (Larkman Nunatak [LAR] 12095,14, LAR 12240,7 and LAR 12011,12), with the remainder coming from the Royal Ontario Museum's collection (Northwest Africa [NWA] 3171, NWA 5298, NWA 7042, NWA 7257), including the newly described NWA 8679 [6]. A piece of Nakhla was also included in for comparison. Methods: Samples were analyzed at the Scripps Isotope Geochemistry Laboratory (SIGL) for trace and HSE abundances and 187Os/188Os using methods similar to those outlined in [4]. Results: New trace element abundances for the shergottites that we measured neatly fall into the previously defined depleted, intermediate and enriched groups (Fig. 1). These results confirm the paired (e.g. [7]) and depleted nature of LAR 12240 and LAR 12095 [8], and the identification of NWA 8679 as an enriched shergottite.  Using prior logic [5], the HSE in Fig. 2 are arranged to extend from left to right in the order of increasing compatibility. The HSE patterns for the shergottites generally compare well with previously reported data, with nearly identical abundances obtained for DaG 476 to those reported previously [4]. Depleted shergottites LAR 12011 and LAR 12095 and the intermediate shergottite NWA 7042 have similar, broadly chondrite-relative HSE patterns.     Figure 1. CI-chondrite normalized rare earth element abundances for nine shergottites and Nakhla. Enriched shergottites are in red (NWA 7257, NWA 5298, NWA 3171, LAR 12011 and NWA 8679); the intermediate shergottite NWA 7042 is in yellow, and depleted shergottites are shown in green (DaG 476, LAR 12240 and LAR 12095). Also shown is clinopyroxenite, Nakhla. By contrast, the enriched shergottites that we measured show strongly fractionated HSE patterns, with low abundances of Os, Ir, and Ru (IPGE) and comparatively higher Pt and Pd (PPGE) abundances. This IPGE/PPGE fractionation behaviour is reminiscent of those observed in terrestrial continental flood basalt provinces (e.g., [9]).   Figure 2. Highly siderophile abundance patterns for shergottites, normalized to CI chondrite, Orgueil [10].   New 187Re-187Os data are presented in Fig. 3. NWA 8679 has the highest measured 187Os/188Os and 187Re/188Os of the dataset and corresponds to a very young age (<200 Ma), likely attributed to Re-Os disturbance for the sample. The 187Re-187Os systematics of NWA 3171 are consistent with a 225 Ma age if the initial 187Os/188Os was ~0.14. The other samples appear to fall along a ~474 Ma isochron. If only the enriched and intermediate samples are regressed, they define an imprecise age of ~500 Ma with an initial chondritic source Os value of -0.4 ±1, possibly suggesting derivation from a chondritic source. Only three of the samples have been dated, and NWA 3171 has Os of +23 at 225 Ma [11], DaG 476 has Os of +5.4 at 474 Ma [12] and NWA 5298 has Os  of +10.3 at 187 Ma [13]).     Figure 3. 187Re/188Os versus 187Os/188Os plot for the nine shergottites measured in this study, plotted using the same symbols as Fig 1 and 2. Also shown are 225 Ma (Ar-Ar age of NWA 3171 [11]), 474 Ma (Sm-Nd age of DaG 476 [12]) and 4 Ga reference isochrons tied to chondritic 187Os/188Os at 474 Ma.  Discussion: Six of the nine shergottites included in this study are hot desert finds and although the trace element abundance data shows signs of terrestrial weathering in some samples (e.g., high Ba in NWA 7042) we do not find a correlation between alteration evident from diagnostic trace elements and disturbance of the Re-Os isotope system. Care was taken during selection of NWA samples to remove all weathering or fusion crust surfaces and prepare thin slices of meteoritic material, and this processing procedure may have led to the low Re abundances that we measured in some samples compared with prior studies [3,4]. The new HSE abundance data for the enriched shergottites that we have measured are potentially consistent with increasing PPGE + Re/IPGEs with decreasing MgO, as seen in many terrestrial continental flood basalt provinces [9]. LAR 12240 has the highest absolute HSE abundances, with NWA 5298 being the most fractionated of the enriched shergottites and having very high Pt and Pd contents (Fig. 2). These variations are consistent with more compatible HSE (Os, Ir, Ru) being depleted relative to Pt, Pd and Re during fractional crystallization and sulphide segregation and with early-formed HSE bearing phases fractionating Ir/Os during early cumulate genesis. This relationship requires high sulphide partition coefficients for IPGE relative to PPGE during basaltic martian magmatic evolution. The high Pt and Pd in NWA 5298 also indicates that these elements behaved moderately incompatibly during fractional crystallization processes in the lava flows, dykes or sills from which these meteorites originated. Major-element analyses of samples are ongoing to confirm if fractional crystallization processes can explain the trends. For the samples that have been dated by Ar-Ar, PbPb, or Sm-Nd isotope methods, the new results support the relationship outlined in [3], of shergottites from long-term depleted sources having lower 187Os/188Os compared with enriched shergottite meteorites. The significance of the correspondence of samples lying along an isochron tied to the DaG 476 Sm-Nd age in Fig. 3 is unclear, but all of these sample yieldOs of -1 to +7, projected to 500 Ma. While speculative, this relationship may relate to similar ages for some of these meteorites to DaG 476, or for a common melt differentiation event in shergottite sources at this time, in Mars. These observations would also support a broadly chondritic evolution of Re/Os in the martian mantle. The new HSE data are consistent with chondriterelative abundances of these elements in martian mantle sources, as suggested previously [4,5]. The high HSE abundances measured in shergottites probably cannot be accounted for by high pressure-temperature metal-silicate partitioning at the base of a magma ocean, as has been postulated in some models for Earth. If late accretionary sources are responsible for HSE delivery, this process must have occurred prior to the crystallization of the martian mantle to explain chondritic HSE abundances and near-chondritic Re/Os evolution.
