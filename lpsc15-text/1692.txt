Introduction:  Lunar light plains are smooth plains deposits that occur in crater floors and other topographic lows in the highlands and exhibit albedo values comparable to surrounding terrain [e.g., 1,2]. Though initially interpreted as volcanic in origin, Apollo 16 samples from the Cayley formation [3] led to the interpretation that most light plains formed from the deposition of fluidized basin ejecta [e.g., 1]. If this is the case, then the light plains are composed of a mixture of basin ejecta and local material [4]. Some light plains host dark halo craters (craters that excavated material of higher FeO content), indicating that the ejecta covered mare deposits. Such buried mare deposits are called cryptomaria [5, 6]. Given the regional context, cryptomare deposits can be used to constrain the source of light plains material, whether it be from nearby craters (<227 km diameter [7]) or more distant large basins [5, 6]. Here we examine the distribution, variability, and possible origin of light plains southwest of the Orientale basin. Data and Methods: To determine the distribution of these light plains, we defined a study area from the southwest rim of the Orientale basin extending into the eastern portion of the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin (Fig. 1). Light plains deposits within this area were mapped and their morphology assessed from a LROC Wide Angle Camera (WAC) global mosaic (100 meter pixel scale) [8] and a map of the standard deviation of slope as an indication of roughness, derived from the Global Lunar DTM (GLD100) [9]. The study area was divided into four bins, each equal to one basin radius (465 km) in width, to determine how the light plains are distributed as a function of distance from the Orientale basin rim. The area of light plains within each bin were normalized to the total bin area to yield the percentage of light plains per bin. Compositional information (LROC WAC ultraviolet-visible ratios [10] and Clementine based FeO values [11]) was extracted to identify cryptomare and heterogeneities amongst light plains deposits.   Results: Comparison with Previous Work. We identified more light plains relative to prior work [2, 12-13] and we also found many small previously unmapped light plains deposits within the following units: Hevelius Formation and Orientale secondary materials [2, 13], Hertzsprung basin materials [2], rolling terra [12], terra materials [12], and basin materials [12]. Larger light plains deposits (not previously mapped) were identified within previously undivided units of terra material [2, 13] and other materials [12].   Figure 1. The light plains (red) within the study area (outlined in blue) were mapped using an LROC WAC monochrome mosaic. Distribution of Light Plains. Closest to the rim of Orientale, the light plains are scarce due to the predominance of the Hevelius Formation [2]. The abundance increases from ~0.4% to ~6% and ~13% at 1, 2, and 3 basin radii respectively, and then it decreases to ~11% at 4 basin radii. The overall areal distribution with respect to the rim of Orientale is similar to the distribution of light plains in the region northwest of Orientale [14], but the abundance is lower (9% of the study area as opposed to 12%) in the southwest. In some cases, the light plains cluster around large Orientale secondary chains, consistent with findings in the light plains to the northwest of Orientale [14]. Morphologic Relationships. Consistent with previous work [2], the light plains in the study area display gradational relationships with the Hevelius Formation like those found in the light plains to the northwest of Orientale [14]. Compositional Variation. The average UV ratio value of the light plains within the study area is 0.71, which is comparable to the global average for the highlands at 0.70. The average UV ratio is identical for the light plains in the study area both within SPA’s interior and the light plains outside of SPA. The average FeO content for the light plains within SPA is 11 wt. %, whereas the average for the light plains exterior to SPA is 6 wt. %, higher than the average FeO of 4.5 wt. % for the highlands.

display either an overall increased FeO content or small craters that excavated material of increased FeO content. These three deposits are are consistent with buried mare deposits [15-17].  Figure 2. Three previously mapped light plains deposits (outlined in red) interpreted as covering mare deposits (cryptomaria)  within SPA [15-17]: (1) East of White, (2) East of Hendrix, and (3) Northeast of Bhabha. Discussion: The overall increase in the abundance of light plains relative to exisiting maps is likely due to increased resolution of the WAC basemap (with ideal lighting conditions) and roughness maps derived from new topographic datasets. The lower abundance (-3%) of light plains in our study area relative to the region northwest of Orientale may be due to burial by subsequent mare emplacement within SPA, which accounts for ~2% of the study area (Figure 3). With respect to the rim of Orientale, the distribution is consistent with most of the light plains in this area havng formed as part of the Orientale basin-forming event.  Higher average FeO content is expected for light plains within SPA due to the incorporation of local material [4] because the average highlands within SPA are more mafic than typical highland terrain. The existence of cryptomaria within the light plains of SPA is a potentially useful tool for determining if some of the light plains within the study area are the result of many regional impacts or only the Orientale event. There are a few nearby impacts (ex. White) that could have contributed to the light plains deposits associated with cryptomaria, but no single impact or combination of small impacts fully accounts for them. Based on the location of these deposits and nearby impacts, it is likely that we are looking at a combination of ejecta from local impacts and distal Orientale ejecta mixed with local material, though more quantitative evidence is needed.
