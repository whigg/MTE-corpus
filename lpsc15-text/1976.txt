Introduction:  Knowledge of the thermal interia will provide essential information to understand the basaltic volcanism of the Moon [1, 2]. One of the scientific objectives of Chinese Chang’E mission is to evaluate the thermal emission features of the Moon surface with the microwave radiometer (CELMS) data. As a key element, cold behavior is essential to characterize the thermal behaviors of the Moon surface [2, 3]. The cold behavior, “Cold Spot”, is first fully studied by Bandfield et al. using the Diviner data from Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) [2]. However, due mainly to the shallow penetration depth, the observations at infrared band are strongly influenced by the surface parameters of the Moon [4].  The penetration depth of the CELMS data can be up to about 10 m in 3 GHz [5], and the CELMS data are sensitive to the substrate temperature, which provide a potential chance to study the cold behavior of the Moon surface. “Cold Spots” had been found at the brightness map generated with microwave sounder (CELMS) data from Chang’E-1 satellite [3]. The data processing method is excellent and is also introduced and improved in this paper. Methodology:  In this paper, the total 2394 tracks of swath data by microwave sounder onboard Chang’E-2 satellite from October of 2010 to May of 2011 are collected. The CELMS data are heavily affected by the observation time and surface geolocation [2, 6]. The brightness temperature in different observation time will weaken the difference resulted from the lunar regolith layer thickness, components, and surface properties, which will be disadvantageous for the application of CELMS data [6, 7]. To eliminate the influence from the observation time, the hour angle correction is introduced to generate the brightness temperature map at 3.0 GHz, 7.8 GHz, 19.35 GHz and 37 GHz at midnight. The spatial resolution is 1°×1°. TB is sensitive to the substrate temperature and TB at midnight denotes the microwave thermal features of the lunar regolith, which is selected in our research [8]. However, the variation of TB with latitude from Equator to the polar regions is up to 200 K at 3 GHz. This TB variation is much larger than that resulted from (FeO + TiO2) abundance (FTA), internal thermal state and other parameters. To eliminate the latitude effect of the CELMS data, the standard TB of every latitude is proposed according to the following criterions: (1) FTA <5%; (2) surface slope <2°; (3) surface roughness <0.5. FTA is generated with the method provided by Lucey et al. [9] and the Clementine five-band UV/VIS data produced by U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) (http://webgis.wr.usgs. gov/pigwad/down /moon_dl.htm).The surface roughness and slope are estimated with the LOLA data download from http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu /missions/lro/lola.htm and the method by Smith et al. [10] and Rosenburg et al.[11]. Once the standard TB is identified, it can be employed to generate the normalized TB (nTB) by dividing the observed TB by the standard TB at the same latitude, which is expected to eliminate to the variation of the observed TB with the latitude (Fig.1). Considering the extreme lighting conditions due to the lunar topography, it is difficult to properly calibrate the Clementine UV/VIS data and CELMS data at the high latitude regions. Therefore, only nTB within 60° from the north hemisphere to the south is presented.

Even at Copernicus Crater, Kepler Crater and Aristarchus Crater expressing the high nTB, the center of these craters still indicates low nTB. On the surface, the cold spot is always related to the large craters. But there is no clear relationship between the large craters and the low nTB, 1976.pdf

even if the craters fairly near the aforementioned craters don’t yet present low nTB’s.  Bandfield et al [2] pointed out that all such regions with “Cold Spots” occur with high rock abundance and they concluded that it is likely the rock abundance resulting in the “Cold Spot” at midnight. However, the regions with high rock abundance is widely spread on Moon [2], whereas “Cold Spots” are not always correspondent to the regions with high rock abundance. This may expresses that rock abundance doesn’t play an important role on “Cold Spots”. Whereas, it is interesting that several craters of this kind, e.g. Tycho crater, Jackson crater, Copernicus crater, Kepler crater and Aristarchus crater, are all formed at the last 100 M years [12], which indicates, to some extent, that the formation mechanism of these craters and their influence on the structure of the upper Moon crust may play a dominant role on the “Cold Spot”. Moreover, another interesting phenomenon occurs at the far side of the Moon. Here, Tsiolkovskiy Crater (21.2°S/128.9°E), King Crater (5°N/120.5°E) and Fabry Crater (42.9°N/100.7°E) are all showing low nTB abnormality. Meanwhile, the three craters are connected by a belt with low nTB, which forms a hidden linear structure with about 2,000 km long. There is not any topography features responsible for this structure. The scale shows that it is likely to be a global hidden structure. The hidden linear structure also exists at the east side of South-Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin, and the southeast side of Mare Imbrium along Montes Apenninus. Also, the region near Tycho Crater presents a short but wide hidden structure in northeast direction comprising at least 22 craters with low nTB abnormality. Until now, the hidden structures are fully studied with the topography data [2, 12]. But no materials can interpret the aforementioned hidden structures. Their formation mechanism and their influence on the Moon topography evolution deserve to be further studied.  Furthermore, Fig.1 shows that there also exists several hidden circular structures. The most apparent circular structure occurs surround Mare Humboldtianum. The distribution of nTB indicates that there are two concentric circular hidden structures indicated by a series of “Cold Spots”. Compton crater (55.3°N / 103.8°E) and the north side of Schrodinger basin also present as the circular structure. Whereas, a circular indicated by several low nTB abnormality and the regions with low nTB centered at (170°E/53°N) doesn’t have any surface topographic features, which implies that it is a hidden circular structure. Meanwhile, Mare Orientale and Mare Humboldtianum both show multiple rings in the topography map. But only four low nTB abnormalities occur surrounding the center of Mare Orientale, which is much different from the surroundings of Mare Humboldtitanum. Combined with the ages of the the maria, the nTB maps of the three maria may hint the different evolution phases of the Moon, which gives rise to a new perspective for the lunar mare evolution.
