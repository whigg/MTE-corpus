TOPOGRAPHY ON THE CRUST-MANTLE BOUNDARY IN LUNAR BASINS DUE TO BOTH GENETIC AND EVOLUTIONARY PROCESSES.  J. A. Balcerski1, S. A. Hauck, II1, and A. J. Dombard2, 1Dept. of Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106 (jeffab@case.edu), 2Dept. of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL 60607   Introduction:  The dynamics of the crust-mantle interface (Moho) underlying lunar impact basins has received considerable study, particularly those with strong positive free-air gravity anomalies associated with the locations of large basins (“mascons”) [e.g. 18]. These gravity anomalies, detected via orbital spacecraft observation, indicate that after surface topography and mare loads are accounted for, many lunar basin subsurfaces exist in a wide range of topographic configurations. These states range from a bulls-eye pattern of concentric positive and negative gravity anomalies concentrated in the basin center, to a singular broad and subdued positive anomaly occupying most of the basin interior [10-15]. The subsurface basin topographies are of particular interest because they are used to infer a preserved state of isostatic (dis)equilibrium, and they have been qualitatively observed to correlate with basin age via the structural evolution of a topographically relaxing basin [e.g. 78,11]. The physical mechanisms of structural relaxation that operate to drive vertical isostatic adjustment also act laterally to remove surface and subsurface topography, albeit over dramatically different time scales [e.g. 7,16]. In particular, lateral flow of crustal or mantle material is strongly affected by temperature, stress, and strain rate [e.g. 17-19]. Thus, interpretation of the above Moho features as evolutionary requires developing models that promote topographic relaxation over geologic time (i.e. enhanced thermal environment, weaker rheology, volatile content, higher driving stresses, etc). However, recent hydrocode simulations of basin-forming impacts have revealed significant dependence of basin structure on initial target conditions, including background temperature and crustal thickness [20]. This leads to the question of whether lunar basin Moho topography might be at least in part, genetic rather than evolutionary. Process:  We first generated a catalog of profiles of lunar impact basin Moho, including vertical magnitude and total width of the central uplift. The total width was determined by the distance from the basin center to the first major positive inflection in the topography. The vertical magnitude is the elevation difference between this inflection and the height of the Moho at the basin center. To obtain these measurements, we used a single-layer, spherical harmonic crustal thickness model complete through degree and order 310, which was produced from GRAIL and LOLA mission data [21]. In this catalog, we included only those basins that have a distinctly uplifted central Moho, and excluded those pre-Nectarian basins that have a flat or negatively depressed Moho. In order to reduce local variations in topography we calculated an azimuthally averaged profile for each from expansions of the spherical harmonic model.  Results:  Figure 1 shows characteristics of the central Moho uplift compared to the basin diameter (a,b) and average crustal thickness at a distance of two basin radii (c). Age of the basin is indicated by the symbols with stars (Pre-Nectarian), pluses (Nectarian), or inverted triangles (Imbrium). We observe that the vertical magnitudes of the central rise have more dependence upon basin age than diameter (panel a), with those of the Pre-Nectarian and Nectarian ages having discernably different medians. It is noteworthy that there is neither an obvious trend line nor clustering present in either of these two ages. When we compare total width of the uplift to basin diameter, there is a clear relationship that appears independent of age, except in the case of three Pre-Nectarian outliers (panel b). We note that all three of these basins lie on the lunar near-side, in close proximity to the Procellarum KREEP Terrane. In panel c, we normalize the uplift width by crater diameter, and compare it to the local crustal thickness. With the exception of the same outliers as panel b, the variation in uplift width with respect to basin size appears uncorrelated with either age or crustal thickness. Discussion: The scatter that is present in Figure 1a suggests that basins of similar ages do not converge toward the same structural configuration. This may be expected if each basin was emplaced in different thermal and material environments. However, given the lunar dichotomy of crustal thickness and radiogenic heat production, we might expect that basin relaxation should generally evolve toward two major end-state modes, rather than a continuous spectrum of states. This trend is not observed in the measurements of either the vertical magnitude or width of the central Moho uplift. If the mascon Moho uplift is indeed the result of both varying impact and relaxation processes, it becomes challenging to use models of either to recover information on initial thermal and mechanical condi3002.pdf

tions. However, experience with numerical modeling of relaxation processes suggests that models can provide bounds on the conditions required to relax and remove the basin subsurface topography. Thus, a combination of evolutionary and genetic modeling approaches may result in a more accurate description of the lunar environment at the time of basin emplacement. Conclusion: The lack of a clear dependence of the horizontal and vertical magnitude of basin Moho topography upon age suggests that the present-day shape of the basin subsurface may not simply represent an evolutionary stage or state. It is more likely that present-day topography is a result of limited basin relaxation operating on a wide variety of initial configurations generated by the impact event. The use of relaxation models to determine the degree to which these initial states are preserved will can provide constraints to numerical models of impact processes. Further, since structural evolution is driven in large part by the initial conditions, it is likely that the range of observed isostatic states of lunar basins may be developed or preserved by a range of mechanisms.
