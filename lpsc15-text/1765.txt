Introduction:  The Chang’e-3(CE-3) Yutu rover is designed to explore an area of 3 km2 during its 3month lifetime, with a maximum traveling distance of 10 km. The Lunar Penetrating Radar (LPR) onboard of the rover, similar to Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), is the first instrument to operate on the lunar surface which utilizes the Ultra-Wideband (UWB) impulse technique. This has the goal of detecting the topography of a specific area and the subsurface geological structure in detail [1]. In order for LPR to detect both the thickness of regolith and the geological structure in the subsurface of the regolith, the LPR incorporates two detection channels: the first one is designed to detect the structure of the shallow region of lunar crust; the center frequency of the transmitted unipolar pulse signal is 60 MHz. The second channel is designed to detect the thickness of lunar regolith; the center frequency of the transmitted bipolar pulse signal is 500 MHz, as shown in Figure 1. At 500 MHz, LPR is able to survey a depth range of 30 m in the lunar regolith with a range resolution of < 30 cm. In this paper, the emphasis mainly focuses on shallow structure under the lunar surface; the second data channel at 500 MHz is applicable.   Figure 1. Illustration of the two radar channels on the LPR.  Route of the Yutu Rover: The landing site of CE3 is 44.1260N, 19.5014W in Mare Imbrium, about 40 km south of the crater Laplace F. The Yutu rover was successfully deployed from the lander and touched the lunar surface on 2013 December 14 [2]. During the Yutu rover’s traverse, exploration points are designated and set for scientific studies. Also, a number of navigation points are set at short distance steps along the path of the scientific exploration points so that the progress of the Yutu rover can be periodically verified along its route. These points are labeled N0101, N0102, etc. Figure 2 shows the trajectory of the Yutu rover’s traverse. The background image is the topography that was photographed by a descending camera attached to the CE-3 lander while it descended. The roadmap of the Yutu rover’s traverse is denoted by the purple line. The red star represents the CE-3 lander’s landing location, the blue asterisks are the scientific exploration points and the brown circles with plus signs are the navigation points.   Figure 2. The roadmap of the Yutu rover.  Data Processing and Analysis of the LPR :  The LPR started working on 2013 Dec. 15. Until 2014 Jan. 15, LPR had worked for 277 min. 10 171 and 19 934 track data were obtained for the first and second channels respectively. Among these data, 1340 and 2531 track data are valid while the Yutu rover was maneuvering. Others are duplicated and similar when Yutu was stationary [3]. 1765.pdf

Zero position of the lunar surface.  The zero positon of lunar surface for LPR refers to the received moment that the scattered electromagnetic wave reflected from the lunar surface was received by the antenna. It helps to determine exact position of the subsurface reflected layer. As shown in figure 3, let’s take the A-Scan of LPR data at navigation point N010 for example. The first trough represented the delay time that direct wave propagates between transmit and receive antenna. The second trough represented the delay time of lunar surface reflected signal, which is 28.75 ns.   Figure 3. The A-Scan of LPR data at navigation point N0105.  Data processing of LPR. Data processing has been done in order to eliminate the effect of the instrument, which include convert the unsigned numbers to signed numbers, normalization, elimination of variable gain and the effect of instrument drift, band-pass filtering, and data splicing based on speed normalization [3]. It should be note that, as shown in Figure 4, the rover skidded between navigation point N0202 to N0203, and would reflected in the radar image.  Figure 4. The N0202-N0203 topography that was photographed by a terrain camera.   B-scan result of the LPR channel 2. Figure 5 shows simulated images of the B-scan for the detection route which was produced by echo signals from LPR observation data received at the surface from distinct points N0105 to N0208 collected during several normal working periods of the rover. That many reflections took place with a range of time delays between 0~80 ns. There are relatively obvious boundaries found at about 50 ns, which indicate that there are many layers present in the regolith. The dielectric permittivity of the regolith was set to be 2.5 and the thickness was calculated to be 4.74m. The calculated result is roughly in accordance with values published in previous studies [4-6]. References: [1] Fang G. Y. et al. (2014) RAA, 14, 1607–1622. [2] Li C. L. et al.
