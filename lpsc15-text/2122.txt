 GEOLOGIC MAPPING OF THE TYRRHENUS MONS LAVA FLOW FIELD, MARS. David A. Crown and Scott C. Mest, Planetary Science Institute, 1700 E. Ft. Lowell Rd., Suite 106, Tucson, AZ 85719, crown@psi.edu.   Introduction: The ancient, eroded Martian volcano Tyrrhenus Mons is one of the areally extensive, low relief highland paterae found in the circum-Hellas highlands [1-4]. The main edifice of Tyrrhenus Mons is 215 x 350 km; its summit rises only 1.5 km above the surrounding plains resulting in flank slopes of ~1° [5]. The volcano displays a central caldera complex (41 x 55 km), and relatively flatlying, layered deposits heavily dissected by radial valleys characterize its flanks [5-8]. Recent images confirm earlier suggestions that the flanks of Tyrrhenus Mons are composed of friable deposits dissected by fluvial processes. Formation of Tyrrhenus Mons has been attributed to large explosive eruptions in the Late Noachian Epoch that emplaced thick sequences of pyroclastic flow deposits around the volcano's summit for hundreds of kilometers [6, 9-10]. Subsequent effusive activity occurred in the summit region and also formed a large field of lava flows that extends to the southwest toward Hellas basin [6, 11]. Background: Lava flow lobes were previously recognized southwest of Tyrrhenus Mons, although this region was initially considered to be part of Hesperia Planum, with no direct connection to eruptive vents associated with Tyrrhenus Mons [12]. Systematic mapping studies using Viking Orbiter images defined the boundaries of the flow field and analyzed its surface morphology [6, 11, 13]. Viking-based mapping indicated that the flow field extended for 1000+ km southwest from the volcano's summit, was connected to the central caldera complex via a prominent sinuous rille, and exhibited a series of lava flow lobes (with typical lengths > 50 km) and volcanic channels. Age estimates for various parts of the flow field from superposed craters ranged from middle Hesperian to Early Amazonian [13-14]; a recent analysis using craters ≥ 5 km in diameter suggests a Hesperian age for the entire flow field [15]. Geologic Mapping: As part of a geologic mapping study across the upper reaches of Dao and Niger Valles [16], we are examining the volcanic landforms and geologic evolution of the Tyrrhenus Mons flow field. Digital geologic mapping using ArcGIS incorporates THEMIS IR (100 m/pixel) and CTX (5 m/pixel) images as well as constraints from MOLA topography. This effort has resulted in a detailed map of the flow field showing its spatial extent and the distribution of volcanic and erosional features. Geologic Mapping Results: Mapping progress todate has included delineation of the boundaries of the flow field, identification and mapping of volcanic and erosional channels within the flow field, and mapping and analysis of lava flow lobes [17]. The high spatial resolution of CTX images, in particular, reveals a variety of previously unrecognized geologic features and allows investigation of the spatial and temporal relationships between volcanic and erosional events. Lava Flow Lobes. THEMIS IR and CTX images allow improved discrimination of the numerous flow lobes that are observed in the flow field, including refinement of the margins of previously known flows [11] and identification of additional and smaller lobes. Flow lobes have elongate, broad, and digitate forms. Lobes may have central channels and display lateral levees. Lobe widths are relatively uniform in medial and distal zones but flow widening is also observed [18]. Lobe margins range from subtle to well-defined and variations are observed both within an individual flow and between different flows. Some steep-sided margins are evident, similar to those attributed to flow inflation in other regions [e.g., 19]. Several lobes appear to be segmented, suggesting stagnation of the front followed by renewed advance. Volcanic Channels. A prominent sinuous rille extending from Tyrrhenus Mons' summit caldera defines the northern margin of the flow field. The rille changes to a leveed channel at the base of the volcano and discontinuous segments can be observed at distances of up to 650 km from the summit, suggesting it served as a major distributary feature [11]. Flows both emanate from and bury channel segments. Smaller volcanic channels are common throughout the flow field; some occur in segments along crests of local topographic highs and may delineate lava tubes. Erosional Channels. Numerous channels are found throughout the flow field, with concentrations noted SW of Bombala crater and in the plains between Dao Vallis and the eroded highlands of Promethei Terra. Scour marks, lateral benches or terraces, variations in channel width and depth, braided morphologies, and sinuous planforms are attributed to fluvial processes with contributions from local mass-wasting. In addition, segmented channels consisting of sometimes discontinuous chains of elongate troughs and pits define curvilinear pathways that may delineate sapping channels. These are distinct from features interpreted to be lava tubes because there is no apparent association with flow lobes and because they appear to cross-cut flow lobes and wrinkle ridges within the flow field and extend beyond flow field margins.  Future Work: THEMIS and CTX images provide important insights into the distribution, nature, and diversity of volcanic and erosional features that characterize the Tyrrhenus Mons flow field and surrounding regions. Further geologic mapping studies, including analyses of indvidual flow lobes and derivation of flow age estimates, will provide constraints on the volcanic and geologic evolution of Tyrrhenus Mons and the timing and nature of fluvial activity in eastern Hellas.
