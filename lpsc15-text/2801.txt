Introduction:  Volcanism  is  a  major  feature  of many  planetary  surfaces,  including  the  surface  of Mars. Understanding the geologic history of Mars thus requires understanding of rates of volcanism, and how these rates have changed through time. Here,  we use small volcanic vents to constrain the recurrence rate of volcanism for a volcano cluster within the caldera of Arsia Mons. Over one thousand small volcanic vents have been observed on Mars with the help of recent image and altimetry data. From these observations, a detailed catalog has been developed of small vents in the Tharsis Volcanic Province, enabling vent fields to be characterized and compared [1].  These mapped small volcanic vents have likely erupted since at least the earliest Hesperian period in some regions [2] and have continued to form in other areas to the late Amazonian, as recent  as  several  tens  of  millions  of  years  ago  [3]. These  volcanic  vents  are  often  found  in  distributed volcano clusters and their edifice morphologies, either as low shields with single flow fronts or as high sloped (~6 degrees) cones [4], are indicative of "monogenetic" volcanism. Martian distributed volcanic fields are composed of tens to hundreds of small volcanic vents that each erupt lava flows, form lava flow fields, and build volcano edifices.  The eruptive history of  these clusters  is  uncertain,  but  by analogy to Earth monogenetic volcanic fields, each edifice likely represents a single eruptive episode, meaning that cumulatively the volcanic  field  provides  a  record  of  volcanism for  a long period of time. One  such  field,  Syria  Planum,  produced  263 mapped volcanic  vents  over  a  time span  as  great  as 700 million years,  as estimated from crater  retention rate modeling for five geologic units in the area [2]. The recurrence rate  for  the creation of new vents in this  area  might  therefore  be  an  average  of  one  new vent every 375,000 years. However, this assumes that the volcano cluster at Syria was uniformly active for its entire history. A more accurate estimate of the rate of volcanism during a large, distributed magma generation can be gained by mapping stratigraphic relationships and modeling ages with crater  counts for  individual edifices in a field. Arsia Mons: An isolated volcano cluster exists in the  caldera  of  Arsia  Mons  consisting  of  29  mapped volcanic vents (Fig. 1). The vents cover ~6700 sq. km (70%) of the 100 km diameter caldera with associated lava flows. Edifices constructed from lava flows have been outlined using images from the Context Imager (CTX) and gridded data from the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA). Edifice perimeters are selected at the edge of the farthest lava flow that can be directly traced to its corresponding vent. Lava flows that were emplaced in the same direction but which are covered by more recent flows were not  assigned to a mapped vent. Stratigraphy:  Outlined lava flows abut each other and clearly embay or are embayed by flows from other vents.  A complete table of  stratigraphic relationships has been created (Fig. 2) using CTX images to identify embaying  features,  such  as  lava  infilling  craters  or grabens that cut stratigraphically lower flows. A total of 47 stratigraphic relationships connecting the 29 volcanic vents.  Of the 47 mapped stratigraphic relationships, 17 are redundant (i.e. other relationships indirectly link volcanic edifices stratigraphically). Fig. 1.

Vents are black dots and are labeled, corresponding to vent numbers in other figures. Crater Age-dating:  In addition to stratigraphic information,  craters  with  diameters  >60m  have  been counted within edifice perimeters with CTX images to provide  age  estimates.  Craterstats2  is  used  to  model ages  based  on  crater  counts  binned  by diameter  [5].  Ages and uncertainty are estimated for each volcanic edifice.  Our results show that the Arsia Caldera volcano cluster was likely formed over the past 500 Ma (Fig. 3). Recurrence Rate Estimation:  We have produced an algorithm to assess the recurrence interval of volcanic events in a distributed volcanic field by estimating the range of potential ages for each mapped event. Called the Volcanic Event Recurrence Rate (VERRM) model, Fig.  2.  Mapped  stratigraphic  relationships  between vents are symbolized here as lines. "Redundant" lines that have been mapped are in gray. Vent numbers that are  higher  in  the  chart  are  stratigraphically  higher than connected vents that are lower. the  code  accepts  stratigraphic  information  and  other date models, in this case crater age-dating estimates, in order to create a recurrence rate estimate for eruptions in an entire volcanic field. VERRM runs in a Monte Carlo fashion,  seeking to assign ages to all  volcanic events in a consistent way that does not violate information gained from stratigraphic or age model data. By creating thousands of potential age models for events in an entire field, the uncertainty in the recurrence rate of volcanism, here defined as the rate of formation of a new mapped vent, is elucidated. VERRM  first  identifies  vents  that  have  a  high number of stratigraphic relationships with other vents, and  assigns  dates  to  these  vents  first,  based  on modeled  age  results.  In  this  case  ages  are  assigned from crater-count derived dates using a random normal distribution with 1σ being the standard uncertainty reported from craterstats2. The model then assigns dates to neighboring vents with their modeled ages, but only accepts dates that do not violate stratigraphic information.  The ultimate output  is  a  potential  age  for  each volcanic event. By performing this thousands of times, the  range  of  potential  ages  for  each  volcano  is modeled. The  potential  ages  of  volcanic  events  from  the VERRM algorithm are plotted on the right of Fig. 3. We  find  that  the  modal  recurrence  interval  of  the youngest  20  events  is  one  event  per  ~11 Ma.  Older vents  have  longer  intervals  between  eruptions,  possibly due to missing vents. Conclusions: Recent volcanism in the Arsia Mons caldera peaked between 100 and 200 Ma, as evidenced by crater retention rates. Stratigraphy can further constrain event dates. On Arsia Mons, vents have recently been created over time at a rate of ~11 Ma. References: [1] Bleacher J. E. et al. (2009) JVGR, 185, 96-102. [2] Richardson J. A., Bleacher, J. E., and Glaze, L. S.
