Automatic Crater Classification according to their morphological types using SIFT and Sparse Coding  Suchit S. Purohit1 and Savita R. Gandhi2, 1Department Of Computer Science,Gujarat University,Ahmedabad,Gujarat,India. Suchit.s.purohit@ieee.org.2Department Of Computer Science,Gujarat University,Ahmedabad,Gujarat, India.drsavitagandhi@gmail.com  Introduction:  Realizing the importance of study of craters and automation of crater detection process, there has been a great enthusiasm for developing crater detection algorithms (CDA) in past decade. However no work is reported till now in the area of automatically classifying the craters according to their morphology. Motivated from this fact, we are proposing our own algorithm to classify the craters according to their morphology like central dome, and multiring. The proposed approach uses sparsely coded SIFT representation of image along with SVM classification hence offering  a supervised classification framework which does not demand much of training data and gives accurate results even when distribution of training and test data is different. The proposition has been implemented and tested on Lunar and Mars images and the technique is found to be robust in presence of noise, occlusion, different3D viewing angle, transformations and various illumination effects. This abstract presents our propositions for crater classification, view of implemented model in MATLAB, results and comparative analysis of our technique with other classification approaches. Related Work:  We have performed extensive literature survey of existing approaches for crater detection and presented in our Survey paper [1].The Survey consists of description, strengths and limitations of CDA's developed till date of publishing of survey paper. We have concluded that supervised and unsupervised or combination of both the approaches is used for automatically detecting the craters. Majority of algorithms are tested on Mars and Lunar optical images though work has also been reported on DEM images of other planets. Unsupervised approaches use Hough Transform and its variants, edge detectors whereas supervised learning methods use SVM, neural networks, Adaboost, Fuzzy logic, template matching. We We have implemented widely used unsupervised and supervised techniques like Hough Transform, template matching and AdaBoost for crater detection and integrated them in the form of an interactive program in MATLAB to provide a common computation environment to the researchers new to this field so that they can validate and compare the results presented by authors of those techniques. On testing the techniques using this program, it is found that unsupervised techniques can detect only large craters and do not work when craters have irregular geometry, broken rims "as seen in Fig.1(A)".Supervised learning methods can detect sub-km craters but require lot of training data. Moreover accuracy falls when distribution of test data is different from training data. One of the supervised techniques, "Template Matching" requires lots of templates to accommodate detection of craters of different sizes and shapes "as seen in Fig.1(B)".    To the best of our knowledge, only [2] shows a crater classification approach which classifies a crater into flat floor or round floor only. Morever, no algorithm for automatically classifying the craters according to the morphology like central dome, central pit or multiring exists. This motivated us to develop an algorithm for crater classification.   A    B Figure 1: Crater Detection Using (A)Hough Transform with Shadow Removal and (B)Template Matching  Proposed Framework:  We propose here a crater classification algorithm which uses sparsely coded SIFT (Scale Invariant feature transform) [3] representation of images classified using SVM classifier. The SIFT representation introduces invariance against transformations like scaling, changing illumination effects, varying viewing angle and robustness against against clutter, occlusion and noise. Satellite  clutter, occlusion and noise. Satellite images are more prone to these distortions hence SIFT representation makes the algorithm more robust. SIFT descriptor calculates value of 4X4 grid around feature points from eight directions, which is 128-bit feature vector and many features are detected from each image. To quantize numerous feature vectors, sparse coding is applied to SIFT features using learned dictionaries[4] in such a way so as to reduce the reconstruction error. The reason for applying sparse coding is to convert the image feature into high dimensional space, improve discriminative ability, achieve low reconstruction error and finally owing to the fact that image patches itself are sparse signals with respect to fixed basis like Fourier etc.[5] The sparsely coded features are pooled to con2317.pdf

vert them into a single vector and are fed to the SVM classifier. To validate the outperformance of our framework, we have also implemented other classification approaches like pixel representation + SVM, SIFT+Bag-of-words for quantization, SIFT+Sparse coding +knn classifier. Our approach which uses SIFT+Sparse Coding +SVM, is found to outperform in terms of accuracy and reduced false alarms.  Results and Conclusions: We have implemented proposed framework in MATLAB providing interactive software which performs a 2 stage classification. When an image is fed to the classifier, it first classifies into a crater or non-crater image. Only cratered images are fed to intraclass classifier which classifies it into central dome or central pit crater(Fig 3). The dataset for training and testing is taken from lpi.usra.edu. The classified images are used as ground truth for our classifier. The software is tested with as few as 35 images for training and test images entirely different from training images. Results of all the approaches are shown in Table 1. From the analysis of results it can be proved that our approach gives best results in terms of accuracy even when the test data is entirely out of the training data. The approach is robust even in the presence of induced salt and pepper noise with 80 % density, partial occlusion and poor illumination (Fig. 2). The results also prove superiority of SVM as compared with KNN, the very reason for our choice of SVM.
