Classic examples of these "scallops" (Fig. 1) typically show a distinct north-south orientation, and have a shallow slope facing the equator and a modestly steeper pole-facing scarp. Complex landscapes can develop by interaction of many scallops. Most recent workers have attributed these features to sublimation [2-4], but some have argued that they indicate substantial melting, based on proposed terrestrial analogs [5-6].   Figure 1: Simple scalloped depression in Utopia Planitia (HiRISE image PSP_001582_2245). Note north-south orientation and arcuate ridge parallel to the scarp. A landscape evolution model incorporating sublimation and diffusive mass movement readily reproduces the basic shape of a scalloped depression [8-9]. However, many details have yet to be investigated. In particular, some landforms in the mid-latitudes are observed with shapes resembling classic scallops, but lacking the typical poleward orientation. Additionally, arcuate ridges paralleling the poleward scarp are observed. This abstract investigates several hypotheses for the formation of each of these features.  Model:  The sublimation model used here has been described elsewhere [8-9]. Briefly, ice loss rates are determined for a suite of ice table depths, slopes, and orientations using a thermal model and an assumed atmospheric water content. These rates are used to drive evolution of the surface. Thermokarst collapse is initiated in the model by arbitrary disturbances to the equilibrium lag. Where the ice content exceeds the pore space of desiccated soil, the surface will collapse as ice is lost. The surface topography and ice depths are adjusted in a time-marching solution describing the evolution of the landscape.  Figure 2: Arcuate mid-latitude features resembling scalloped depressions, but not oriented towards the pole. Nearby "expanded" craters [10] suggest that these are also thermokarst features. (HiRISE image ESP_016080_2310.) East-west asymmetry: Two hypotheses for the origin of asymmetry are being investigated. The first is the presence of a regional slope, which introduces slope asymmetry when a symmetric initial disturbance is imposed. The second is the effect of wind. Although the model handles ice loss primarily by diffusion through a lag (independent of wind speed), sublimation rates are reduced to match forced-convection loss rates [11] if those are less than the diffusion loss rate. This normally only occurs for very thin lags; however, the area of Fig. 2 has a high albedo and low thermal inertia, conducive to a shallow ice table.  Forced convection models are normally directionless, assuming flat surface. It is possible that slopes facing the wind could have enhanced sublimation. This is heuristically investigated by introducing a multiplicative factor based on the east/west slope component. Initial results indicate that both slopes and the directionally-modified forced convection model can produce some deflection of an otherwise symmetric fea ture, but the effect is weak in cases examined to date. A broader range of results will be presented at the meeting. An additional hypothesis, not yet incorporated in the model, is that eolian erosion of the lag introduces directional sublimation. Finally, the ice-loss look-up tables assume east-west symmetry of loss rates, consistent with model ice-table depths [12], and tests indicate that this factor has a negligible effect. Arcuate ridges: Two hypotheses have been proposed for the origin or arcuate ridges like those in Fig. 1. The first is that layering in the substrate produces the ridges [13]; the alternative is that orbital variations do so [3]. In both cases the ridges are produced by varying the relative rates of vertical and lateral erosion.  Layering has been included in the model by introducing vertical variations in the regolith content of the clean ice. Initial runs show that this causes some effect on the morphology of scalloped depressions, but so far only modest enhancements of the regolith content and perfectly horizontal layers have been tested. An initial examination of orbital variations has been conducted by changing the ice-loss lookup table over time to simulate the variation of obliquity between 15° and 35°. This produces a strong effect on the morphology of scalloped depressions, resembling arcuate ridges in some respects (Fig. 3). Moreover, the final landform produced from the same initial conditions is variable depending on the starting point in the obliquity cycle. Sublimation rates and directionality vary distinctly with obliquity.   Figure 3: Development of complex concentric internal morphology in a scalloped depression as a result of obliquity variations. However, Fig. 3 is likely to exaggerate the morphological effects, because the look-up tables for ice loss are necessarily quantized to discrete obliquity values. Hence, the transitions in ice loss are sharper in the model than in reality.   Discussion:  A range of effects influencing the morphology of Martian sublimation thermokarst landforms is being investigated. All of the factors considered to date are physically reasonable effects and probably operate under some conditions. Moreover, it may be difficult to isolate single variables in nature. At present, the strongest variations in modeled scalloped depression morphology arise from variations in the orbit, which are certainly occurring [14], but there is also observational evidence for material layering in the vicinity of scalloped depressions [13]. Initial investigations have produced only minimal deflections from east-west symmetry; if we are unable to find conditions where these deflections are stronger, it may be necessary to consider alternate hypotheses. Significant sublimation thermokarst landforms can develop in geologically short time periods; however, a significant unknown which affects the absolute rates of evolution is the rate of diffusive mass movement. Additional results will be presented at the meeting.   Acknowledgements: This project has been supported by MFRP grant NNH13AV59I.  References: [1] Costard F. M. and Kargel J. S.
