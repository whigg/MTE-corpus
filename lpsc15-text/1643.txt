Sci., Tokyo Institute of Technology.Introduction Mars currently has a cold and dry surface environment with a small amount of water-ice observed at the polar caps [1]. On the contrary, increasingevidence suggests that the early Mars sustained a warmclimate with a large amount of liquid water [e.g., 2],though it is controversial whether the warm climate wasepisodic or permanent [3, 4]. Impact erosion and thermal/nonthermal escape have possibly contributed to theloss of the early atmosphere and hydrosphere [5]. However, the timing of the escape and the relative importanceof each process are poorly constrained.The thermal/nonthermal escape induce isotopic fractionation that leaves behind heavier isotopes in the atmosphere and hydrosphere, whereas the impact erosion removes a fraction of atmosphere without the isotopic fractionation. The early evolution of the atmosphere and hydrosphere is constrained by the isotopic data of the martian meteorite Allan Hills 84001 (ALH 84001), whichhas a crystallization age of 4:1 Ga [6]. A high hydrogenisotope ratio (D/H = 2-4 times the Martian primordialwater) at 4:1 Ga [7, 8] suggests that a larger amount ofwater was lost during the first 0.4 billion years than thelater periods by the thermal/nonthermal escape [9]. Onthe other hand, isotope ratios of nitrogen and noble gasesat 4:1 Ga show unfractionated values, implying that theatmosphere was lost after 4:1 Ga [10, 11].We study the evolution of the martian atmosphereand hydrosphere considering their isotopic ratios. Comparing our results with isotopic data at 4:1 Ga recordedin the martian meteorite ALH 84001, we propose a scenario that the loss of atmosphere and hydrosphere hadproceeded before 4:1 Ga. An efficient isotopic fractionation of nitrogen and noble gases due to the thermal/nonthermal escape started after the impact erosionof the thick early atmosphere during the heavy bombardment period.Model We calculate the evolution of the total amountsof the atmosphere and hydrosphere and their isotopiccompositions individually, considering the impact erosion and thermal/nonthermal escape (Fig. 1).First, we calculate the evolution of the total atmospheric pressure due to the impact erosion using astochastic bombardment model [12]. We calculate thesurface age using the cumulative number of impacts andan empirical curve obtained from the lunar craters [13].The total pressure of 6 mbar or 100 mbar (correspondshydrosphereatmosphereexobasehomopausehomogeneousisotopic separationvapor-liquidequilibriumimpact erosion(without fractionation)thermal/nonthermal escape(with isotopic fractionation)Figure 1: Schematic illustration of our model.

The evolution iscalculated backward from present to 4.5 Ga assuming aCO2-dominated atmosphere. The erosion efficiency ateach impact is calculated using a modified sector blowoff model [15]. The momentum of an expanding silicate vapor is calculated using the entropy method [e.g.,16, 17] and thermodynamic data for forsterite [18].Second, we calculate the evolution of the isotope ratios of the minor volatile elements (D=H, 15N=14N, and38Ar=36Ar) due to the thermal/nonthermal escape. Theinitial surfacial water of 100 m GEL, which is almostequivalent to the minimum estimate of the paleo-ocean[26], is assumed. We assume the escape rates of the ionpick-up, sputtering, and photochemical escape given by[19, 20]. Hydrogen is lost by the Jeans escape whose escape rate is regulated by the loss of oxygen [21]. Oxygenis assumed to be lost by the ion pick-up [22]. Nitrogen islost by the sputtering [19] and photochemical escape [23]and argon by the sputtering. The fractionation factor ofhydrogen is assumed to be 0.016 [24, 25]. We adapt thefractionation factors of other species tabulated in [19].Results The evolution of the total atmospheric pressure due to the impact erosion is shown in Fig 2a. Thetotal pressure decreases in several orders of magnitudeduring the first several hundred million years which corresponds to the heavy bombardment period, whereas thechange is relatively insignificant after this period. Forboth cases (6 mbar and 100 mbar), the total pressure ex1643.pdf

Because the early atmosphere is much thicker than that of the current Mars, thedifference in the current total pressure does not affect thetotal pressure during the early period (> 4 Ga).The evolution of the isotope ratios due to the thermal/nonthermal escape is shown in Fig. 2b. The nitrogenand argon isotope ratios start to increase as the total pressure decreases. On the contrary, the D/H ratio increasesindependently because the major reservoir of hydrogenis the hydrosphere. The obtained nitrogen and argon isotope ratios agree with the isotopic data of ALH 84001 at4.1 Ga, whereas the D/H ratio is lower than the data.Discussion The discrepancy in the hydrogen isotoperatios can be explained by some additional mechanismsof the oxygen loss because the escape rate of hydrogenis determined by the escape rate of oxygen in our model.Cold ion flow can be a dominant mechanism of oxygenloss in the early Mars [30]. Also, the oxidation of surfacematerial would act as another oxygen sink [9].Estimates of atmospheric nitrogen isotope composition of ALH 84001 vary significantly (� 7 per mil [10]to > 200 per mil [31, 32]). Identification of the actualnitrogen isotope ratio at 4:1 Ga would help to constrainthe early evolution of the martian surface environment.References[1] Christensen, P. R. (2006) Elements, 2,151-155.
