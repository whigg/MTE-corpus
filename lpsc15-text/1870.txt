FROM APPLIED FIELD AND LABORATORY GEOLOGY TO PLANETARY SCIENCE - AND BACK.    M. Boros-Olah1 and A. Kereszturi1,2, 1Nagy Karoly Astronomical Foundation, 2Research Center for Astronomy and Earth Science (Email: boros.olah.monika@gmail.com ).  Introduction: Several well known connections exist between Earth and planerary sciences [1-10]. Such interdisciplinary relations are aimed to exploit at the MTA CSFK (RCAES) in Hungary as a recently formed joint instiute. This abstract is to present those fields where the work has started (for specific details see cited references) and are prespectivitc using such synergy with the available facilites and background knowledge. The common issue of these topics is their analog aspect what covers wide range of activites (from remote sensing, across field work to micro scale laboratory analysis). Tthe new issue is that fresh knowledge and experience from planetary science might improve and provide feedback to classical Earth sciences too.  Main topics of analog research where planetar science related knowledge helps Earth sciences can be seen in the Table 1. Several example exist where mission related information supported our knowledge in geology (surface modification from ephemeral flow events, low temperature alteration processes, handling of small specimen with minimizing the contamination). Specific interactions: The development and improvement during the analog activities improve mission related technology. Hyperspectral band shape positions got more accurate by standard production for planetary missions, in the mineral scale infrared analysis improved the understanding on how elemental substitution distorts crystalline structures in meteorite minerals, temperature, and compositional constrains of isotopic exchange also got improvement from laboratory analysis to understand processes in meteorites and hydrothermal fluids on Mars. In these cases "reverse" spinoff applications in modern geologic field and laboratory activites can be seen.  Figure 1. Ideal workflow that starts from geological field work, though laboratory and related technology development supports Mars surface activity - the later improves Earth geological methods Acknowledgment: The support of the OTKA PD 105970 is acknowledged.
