The spacecraft landed on high-Ti basalts [1-3] (Fig. 1) that have a model age (based upon crater counts) of approximately 2.35-2.95 Ga [4-6]. These basalts overlie low-Ti basalts that have a model age of approximately 3.5 Ga [4]. The landing site is generally flat and punctuated by small craters, with the CE-3 spacecraft landing on the ejecta blanket of and approximately 50 m from an ~450 m diameter crater (Fig. 2) [7-9]. The deployment of the “Yutu” rover allowed an examination of the immediate area around the lander. The instrumentation on the rover is defined in [10] and here we focus on the data from the rover mounted X-ray Spectrometer (XRS). This follows the status report by [11]. XRS Analysis. The XRS covers the energy range of 0.5-20 keV to measure elemental chemistry. XRS testing and data processing are described in [12-14]. During the two lunar days on the Moon, the lunar regolith at two detection points (N0108, N0205; Fig. 2) was analyzed by the XRS. At N0108, the spectra of two sampling points (Sol_01 and Sol_02; the horizontal distance between them is ~10cm) were accumulated for 46 and 33 minutes, respectively. At N0205 (~30 meters to the west of N0108, Fig. 2), data for the lunar regolith were accumulated for ~1 hour (Sol_03). Results.  The three data analyses are all within error of each other. The regolith at the CE-3 landing site contains approximately 4.7 wt% TiO2, 12-12.6 wt% Al2O3, 21.3-22.1 wt% FeO, 8.3-9.1 wt% MgO, ~10.1 wr% CaO, and ~0.12 wt% K2O. Discussion: From Clementine, Lunar Prospector, and Chang’E 1 orbital data, the spacecraft landed on regolith containing 5.2-7.8 wt% TiO2, 10.3-12.6 wt% Al2O3, 16.4-20.9 wt% FeO, 7-10.3 wt% MgO, and 11.1-11.3 wr% CaO [1-3]. With ground truth at a much smaller special scale from the Yutu rover, it is remarkable that the only discrepancies evident between orbital and CE-3 data are in TiO2 and FeO. The orbital data yield higher abundances than from the XRS for TiO2 and the opposite for FeO. This could be due to dilution by addition of highlands material through subsequent impacts in this area and although the XRS data indicate relatively high Al2O3, but XRS and orbital data are in good agreement [3]. In addition, there are no crater  Fig. 1. M3 image shows the CE-3 landing site.   Fig. 2. Traverse map of Yutu Rover. Yellow stars indicate XRS analysis points.

rays passing over the landing site, which is remote from any highlands region. Finally, images of basalts at the landing site clearly show the relatively high abundance of plagioclase in these coarse-grained rocks (Fig. 3), which supports a primary igneous origin for the high-Al signature. The discrepancies in TiO2 and FeO could also be explained through dilution by low-Ti basaltic material, as the landing site is close to low-Ti basaltic material (Fig. 1). The regolith analyses in terms of FeO and TiO2 could be generated by a mixture of low-Ti (represented by Apollo 15 basalts or basaltic lunar meteorites) and high-Ti basalts (represented by Apollo 17 basalts (tie-line in Fig. 4a). However, such a relationship is not seen in Fig. 4b where the low-Ti endmember would be more akin to the Apollo 14 high-Al basalts.  The lack of consistency in mixing relationships and the relative uniformity of the regolith at the CE-3 landing site (at the 30 m scale) is consistent with the regolith being derived from the material beneath. This implies that the regolith composition measured by the XRS is that of the lava flow. Assuming that XRS data represent a basalt composition, it is similar to the Apollo 12 ilmenite basalts (Fig. 4a) but are higher in Al2O3 (Fig. 4b). In looking at the data, there is not an exact match with a returned sample (or lunar meteorite) for all elements quantified. It would appear that the CE-3 XRS data represent a new type of mare basalt. Mare Basalt Classification. Mare basalts are classified based upon chemical composition [15]. The primary discriminator is TiO2, followed by Al2O3, with K2O being the tertiary criterion. In this classification, there were Very Low-Ti (VLT), Low-Ti, and High-Ti basalts, divided at 1wt% and 6 wt% TiO2. Within each of these groups are high- and low-Al (divided at 11 wt% Al2O3, and within each of these groups are high- and low-K (divided at 2000 ppm K).  Subsequent to this work, the Apollo 12 ilmenite basalts were linked with the high-Ti basalts [16]. Therefore, we propose a modification of the mare basalt primary classification that keeps the Al2O3 and K subdivisions as originally described. Here the TiO2 subdivisions are as follows: VLT basalts contain <1 wt%; Low-Ti basalts contain 1-4 wt%; Mid-Ti basalts contain 4-6 wt%; High-Ti basalts contain >6 wt%. In this classification, the Apollo 12 ilmenite basalts fall in the Mid-Ti, Low-Al, LowK group. The CE-3 basalts fall the Mid-Ti, High-Al, Low-K group and represent a type of basalt heretofore not recognized on the surface of the Moon. References: [1] Lucey P.G. et al.
