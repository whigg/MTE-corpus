[1,2] demonstrated the dependency of vanadium partitioning into spinel in a Yamato 980459 (Y98)-composition melt on oxygen fugacity. They determined that partitioning of V into spinel (as V3+ in the octahedral site as in magnesiocoulsonite, see Fig. 1a) decreases markedly in melts buffered at IW-1 through FMQ.  Papike et al. [1,2] suggested that this fO2 dependency was the result of changing V valence in the melt, with V3+ overwhelmingly preferred to V4+ in the spinel structure. As fO2 is increased from IW-1 to FMQ, the amount of V3+/VTotal drops from 0.90 to ~0.05, resulting in a drop in DVspinel/melt from 45.2 to 6.2. At fO2s >FMQ, however, there is a slight increase in the partition coefficient, from 6.2 to 7.6, between FMQ and FMQ+1. Papike et al. [2] speculated that this increase was real, and was determined by changing crystal chemical characteristics of spinels over this range in fO2. The region in fO2 space between FMQ and FMQ+1 is characterized by a drastic increase in the magnetite component, a change that results in an increase in the proportion of inverse domains in the spinel. This reorientation of the structure seems to make the incorporation of V4+ more permissible (Fig. 1c). In order to build on the study of Papike et al. [1,2], we've made direct measurements on spinels of the same composition, and a protracted crystallization history (to maximize grain size), using X-Ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) to determine the valence ratio of V3+/V4+.  Experimental Approach: To investigate the effects of fO2 on the valence of V in spinel, we conducted a 1-bar gas mixing experiment. This experiments was designed for the purpose of growing a spinel of sufficient size to be analyzed using XANES (i.e., >10 μm). Spinel was grown from a melt under controlled redox conditions, specifically IW+2.2 (Fig. 2). The starting material consisted of a glass powder with a composition patterned after the whole rock composition of Yamato 980459 (Y98). The experiment was carried out in the one-bar gas mixing laboratory at the University of New Mexico.    The experiment was run at superliquidus conditions before being cooled to a final temperature of 1200˚C, at a cooling rate of 0.5 ºC/min. XANES Data Acquisition:  Vanadium K-edge XANES data were acquired with the x-ray microprobe of GSECARS beamline 13-ID-E at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory, Illinois. The x-ray source at APS beamline 13-ID-E was a 72-pole, 33 mm period undulator. The beam was focused to final spot size of approximately 5μm by 5μm with dynamically configured Kirkpatrick-Baez focusing mirrors.       All spectra were acquired in fluorescence mode utilizing a cryogenically cooled Si(311) monochromator and a silicon-drift solid state detector offset at a 45° angle from the sample.  Results & Discussion: We have calculated the mean valence of V in the experimental spinels using the pre-edge feature in the V K-edge XANES spectra (Fig. 3a,b) and the calibration of [3]. The calculated mean V valence values range from ~ 2.6-2.7. Taken at face value, these low values suggest that the spinels V content is comprised of approximately 70% V3+ and 30% V2+, which is certainly incorrect.  These low values are quite inconsistent with V partitioning data and Figure 1. Spinel structural diagrams. a. The normal spinel structure represents magnesiocoulsonite, IVMgVIV3+2O4. b. The inverse spinel structure (magnetite, IVFe3+ VI(Fe2+Fe3+)O4). c. The V-inverse synthetic spinel structure (IVFe2+ VI(Fe2+V4+)O4). As in [2].  V valence modeling for Y98 melts [2].  Previous studies of V valence in basaltic melts suggest that the mean V valence in the melt is defined by binary mixtures of V3+ and V4+ at oxygen fugacities between IW and FMQ. Based on these results, there is little evidence supporting a significant presence of V2+ in the melt, therefore, the low V valence values in the spinels cannot have been inherited from the melt. Alternatively, the low intensity of the pre-edge feature used to calculate the V-valence may result from structural factors in the spinel. It has been noted in previous studies [4] that the pre-edge feature in the V XANES spectra is not only related to its formal valence state, but is also influenced by its coordination symmetry. Additionally, the probability of the 1s-3d electron transition responsible for the pre-edge absorption feature is nearly zero for the case of perfect regular octahedral symmetry [4]. Therefore, the low intensity of the pre-edge feature suggests that V3+ resides in highly symmetrical octahedral sites in spinel. Despite the fact that V valence modeling suggests that the melt contains ~82% V4+ at fO2 conditions of IW+2.2 [2], the total magnetite (i.e., inverse) component is what is controlling the partitioning of V into the spinel.  At this fO2, the magnetite mole fraction, relative to chromite and spinel is 9%. This sets an upper limit on the amount of V4+ which might be accommodated in the spinel, and is not strongly displaced from the error of the XANES measurements, which is likely 5-6%. Based on our observations, the valence ratio of V in spinel is not a useful oxybarometer at fO2s <FMQ, though it may prove more valuable at higher fO2s,  where there is a more substantial inverse component, and consequently, potentially a mixture of V4+ and V3+.  At fO2s lower than this, the slight variations in V3+/VTotal in the spinels are un-resolvable with the XANES technique. Conveniently, [1,2] demonstrated that over this same range (i.e., at fO2s from IW-1 to FMQ), V spinel-melt partitioning can be used for the same purpose. These measurements also  provide an important  insight into the site occupancy of V3+ in spinel. The observation that the mean V valence is <3 is likely the result of the highly symmetric nature of the crystallographic site it occupies in the spinel structure.  References: [1] Papike et al.
