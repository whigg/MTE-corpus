Introduction:  The Noachian southern highlands of Mars bear old crustal material that appears mostly unaltered [1, 2, 3], but contains abundant occurances of phyllosilicate-rich materials [4]. Phyllosilicates are of particular interest, as they require the presence of water and may indicate habitable environments. Most phyllosilicates may have formed early in Mars' history during the Noachian period [4]. However, a set of Hesperian-aged impact craters, Toro [5]  and Majuro [6] bear evidence for impact-induced hydrothermal activity in the southern highlands. Additional studies also indicate that alteration of Noachian materials could be produced over long periods of time [7].    Phyllosilicate outcrops in the northern plains are exclusively found in and around impact craters. This could lead to the conclusion that they might form excavation products of preexisting, buried deposits, exposed by impacting and erosion [8, 4, 9]. Nevertheless, when investigating alteration associated with impact craters, pre-, syn- and post-impact scenarios should be considered [10, 7]. Here we report on a set of impact sites, located in the northern plains of Mars, that contain uplifted, stratified, phyllosilicate-rich material. These craters were previously described by [8], but here we conduct a further investigation to test the theory of impact excavation of old preexisting strata versus impact-induced hydrothermal activity. This can be achieved as coverage of high resolution data has increased since the initial study.  Data Sets and Methods:  HRSC, CTX, and HiRISE data was used for visual interpretation. Digital terrain models (DTM) were produced from HRSC data [11, 12] (orbits h7540-Bamberg and h3304-Micoud) with a resolution of ~50 m per pixel, to better assess the stratigraphic context. The data were incorporated into a Geographic Information System (GIS)-project using the ESRI ArcGIS software. Processed HRSC DTMs, geometrically corrected CTX and HiRISE image data, and CRISM spectral parameter maps were displayed in ArcScene. We used CRISM image FRT0000942F with a spatial resolution of ~18 m/px [8]. The analyses are focused on spectra from ~1-2.6 μm where hydrated minerals such as phyllosilicates exhibit representative absorptions. The band near ~1.9 μm is indicative of H2O in minerals, whereas OH combination bands in clay minerals have diagnostic absorptions at ~2.1-2.5 μm [13]. CRISM Analysis Toolkit (CAT) and its associated tools were used in ENVI to minimize instrumental and atmospheric effects and convert the data to I/F [8, 14]. Spectra were collected for 5x5 pixel spots and ratioed in column to emphasize the spectral features.  Observation and Results: The 55-km diameter Bamberg crater is located at ~39.5 °N and 357 °E ~60 km north of the highlands/lowlands transition in the southern Acidalia Planitia region, close to the transition to Arabia Terra (Fig.1A). The impact crater has well preserved terraced walls and a distinct ejecta blanket. The most prominent feature of the crater is the central uplift, which displays an asymmetric central pit structure. Some sporadic outcrops of breccia can be recognized on the northern wall of the pit (Fig.1 D). Upon closer inspection, layered strata are observed. This layered material displays a phyllosilicate signature in CRISM spectra (Fig. 1B/C/E). Ratioed spectra of the hydrated outcrops show absorptions at ~1.41, 1.91 and 2.29 μm, which best match the Fe-smectite nontronite. HiRISE images also reveal irregular layering within isolated blocks a few 100s of meters in size, and with layers as thin as 1-2 meters visible cropping out at the -4600 m level (Fig. D and E). Intact layered blocks were mapped and a detailed stratigraphic column was compiled. Brecciated phyllosilicate-rich material can be traced down into the central pit to -5050 m. Surprisingly, the phyllosilicates appear to be bound to specific horizons, often following morphologic features such as escarpments and spurs. Chlorite and mixed-layered smectite/chlorite (S/C) are also observed within the central peak, but are not associated with the layered blocks. Micoud crater also contains isolated layered, phyllosilicate-rich blocks, similar to those found in Bamberg crater.
