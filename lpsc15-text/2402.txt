Introduction:  The Rumuruti chondrites (RCs) are a group of meteorites that are distinguished from the enstatite, ordinary (OCs), and carbonaceous (CCs) chondrites by their bulk oxygen isotope values [1], and high oxidation [2] and sulfidation [3] states, as well as other properties. Understanding if these oxygen and sulfur fugacity enhancements were pre-accretionary or part of post-accretionary processing will help elucidate the distribution of volatiles in the early Solar System. Unaltered, petrologic type-3 material is rare in the RCs, and has only been found in clasts of brecciated stones [1, 4]. Two alternate hypotheses on the nature of primitive RC material have been proposed: a) the parent body was both mineralogically and texturally closest to type 3 CCs, and included a mixture of reduced chondrules, occasional metal grains, and oxidized matrix [4], and b) the primitive RC components were most similar to the H chondrites, with a matrix/chondrule ratio more similar to the CCs [5]. We report on a 3 x 7.4-mm, unequilibrated clast in Mount Prestrud (PRE) 95404 [6]. Methods:  All measurements were made on thin section PRE 95404,19. Microprobe analyses were made using the Cameca SX100 at the University of Arizona according to standard procedures. The Cr2O3 content of silicates was analyzed simultaneously on two spectrometers to amplify the counts.  Oxygen isotope data were collected with the Cameca ims 1280 ion microprobe at the University of Hawaii. Olivine data were calibrated using San Carlos olivine, and orthopyroxene data with 313 orthopyroxene [7]. After data collection, each spot was examined to ensure it was free from cracks and sampled only a single mineral phase. Data that did not meet these criteria were rejected. Clast Results: The clast has a primitive texture characterized by chondrules embedded in a finegrained matrix. It is easily distinguishable from the adjacent R4 clast and contains dark, opaque matrix and sharp chondrule-matrix boundaries (Figure 1). Clear, isotropic glass is present in some chondrules, though some devitrification is evident. Metal is absent from the sample. Sulfides are abundant and primarily occur as large, spheroidal assemblages composed of pyrrhotite and pentlandite.  The clast is composed of 20 vol% chondrules and coarse grains, 8% sulfides, 63% matrix, and 9% other phases, including oxides and phosphates. No CAIs were observed. One ~5 µm metal alloy grain composed of Au, Pd, Fe, and Cu was observed embedded in pyrrhotite. No other metal grains were observed.  Figure 1. Composite X-ray maps of silicate and sulfide chondrules from PRE 95404,19. Silicate chondrules (a,c) are shown with FeMgSi in RGB, and sulfide chondrules (b,d) have FeSNi in RGB.  Mineral compositions also suggest that the clast is highly unequilibrated. Olivine compositions range from Fa0.5 to Fa43 (n = 120, σ = 9.6). The Cr2O3 content of 119 randomly selected olivine grains > 15 µm diameter with FeO wt% > 2 was measured, yielding a mean of 0.08 wt% and σ = 0.20. This mean Cr2O3 wt% is comparable with samples that are ≥3.2, and the σ value is comparable to OCs with petrologic types from 3.05 to 3.10 [8]. Since this scale was designed for the OCs, its application to the RCs is not yet established. However, based on these numbers we conclude that the clast is R3.2 or lower, making it the one of the most unequilibrated RC samples known. The clast exhibits minimal terrestrial weathering. Silicate Chondrules: Silicate chondrules include a mixture of type I and type II porphyritic chondrules, and rare (~15%) non-porphyritic chondrules. Together, these chondrules are between 110 and 750 µm in diameter (average = 320 µm), and are mainly composed of olivine (average Fa26) and orthopyroxene (average Fs13). Minor blebs of sulfide are found in chondrules with a maximum diameter of 190 µm (30% the diameter of the host chondrule) and average diameter of 50 µm (10% of the host diameter). Some chondrules are partially rimmed by sulfide.  2402.pdf

Sulfides: Sulfide assemblages primarily exist as rounded objects ranging from 90 to 480 µm (average = 210 µm). Of the 37 assemblages observed, 9 of them are associated with coarse-grained silicate chondrules or fragments (Fig. 1d). Opposite the point of contact, the sulfides retain a rounded, elliptical shape. Where the silicate is, the sulfides are concave or otherwise deformed. These associations suggest deformation of a plastic sulfide sphere, similar to formation of compound silicate chondrules. Based on the petrology of these compound objects, as well as the shape, size, and prevalence of free-standing sulfides within the primitive clast, we propose that these objects are sulfide chondrules that formed when free-floating, molten, Fe-,S-,Ni-rich droplets cooled and crystallized.  Sulfide chondrules are primarily composed of pyrrhotite (average Fe0.95S) and pentlandite (average Fe5.0Ni3.7Co0.2S8.1) with accessory grains (~10 µm) that EDS analyses indicate are magnetite. Cu-rich lamellae (~10 µm wide) are common. Morphologies range from concentric layers of pyrrhotite and pentlandite to swirled mixing of the two phases (Fig. 1b). Some sulfide chondrules are surrounded by a “fizzed” ring of fine-grained sulfides intermixed with fine-grained silicate material. In every sulfide-silicate compound except one, the silicate chondrule is porphyritic and does not appear to have been deformed. One compound exists as a sulfide chondrule and a deformed radial pyroxene chondrule. Figure 2. Oxygen isotope data from silicate grains in primitive clasts in PRE 95404 and NWA 753. Open symbols are data from [10] and [11].  The dashed orange circle indicates the UOC region [9]. Oxygen Isotope Results: Oxygen isotope data provide additional insight into the origin of this material (Figure 2). Most points fall within the range for silicates in unequilibrated ordinary chondrites (UOCs) [9], and are more 16O-rich than the average bulk RC values [1]. These data are in accord with previous reports [10, 11]. Relict and refractory olivine grains are more 16O-rich than chondrule olivines, and plot between the TF and CCAM lines. Discussion: The clast shares traits with both UOCs and CCs [4, 5], and appears to sample a region of the early solar system unrepresented in other planetary materials. It is related to the UOCs in both its oxygen isotopes and distribution of chondrule textures [12]. Like the CCs, the clast has matrix that is more oxidized than the chondrules, a high matrix/chondrule ratio, and intermediate chondrule size [13].  The presence of liquid sulfide droplets that persisted long enough to crystallize suggests enhanced sulfur fugacity compared to the canonical nebula. The frequency of compound silicate-sulfide chondrules (24%) suggests that the dust/gas ratio during sulfide chondrule formation is 100-300 times solar [14]. These values are in agreement with the dust enhancements necessary to stabilize an iron sulfide melt, which range from 150 to 300 times solar at total pressures between 1 bar and 10-4 bar respectively, and at the Fe-FeS eutectic temperature, 1260 K [15]. The absence of Fe metal suggests that the assemblages reached a peak temperature above 1260 K. We predict that RC porphyritic chondrules formed in an oxygen isotope reservoir similar to the UOCs. The presence of compound sulfide-porphyritic silicate chondrules suggests that during subsequent sulfide chondrule formation, porphyritic chondrules were a major component of the surrounding dust, and some were involved in collisions with plastic sulfide chondrules. Non-porphyritic chondrules, which experienced higher temperatures than porphyritic chondrules [16], may have formed in a separate region, with some minor mixing with solidified sulfide chondrules during formation. These components accreted along with oxidized matrix and other minor components to form the primitive RC parent body.
