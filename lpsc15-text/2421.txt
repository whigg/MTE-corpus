  DECODING THE REDOX HISTORY RECORDED IN THE OLIVINE MEGACRYSTS OF YAMATO 980459  WITH CHROMIUM K-EDGE XANES. A.S. Bell1 (asbell@unm.edu),  P.V. Burger1, C.K. Shearer1, and J.J.

Therefore, high spatial resolution x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) measurements of Cr valence in olivine phenocrysts may capture the fO2 evolution of olivinephyric, martian basalts. In this way, these measurements can potentially serve as a window into the relationship between the pristine fO2 of mantle derived magmas and how the Cr valence ratio in olivine may have been altered by processes such as crustal assimilation and degassing. Although Cr valence measurements in olivine are not in and of themselves direct measurements of magmatic fO2, the Cr2+/Crtotal values can be converted to magmatic fO2 values, provided that partitioning behavior and Cr redox systematics are calibrated for the olivine-melt system of interest.        The olivine megacrysts of Yamato 980459 are ideal candidates for a detailed Cr valence study because: (1) Y98 is believed to represent a nearprimary, partial melt of the martian mantle, therefore olivine in this sample has the greatest potential to preserve the fO2 of its mantle source; (2) the olivine megacrysts preserve complex and protracted growth histories that that have been suggested to record a late- stage oxidation event [2,3]; and (3) we have developed an extensive database of redox controlled experiments that have been conducted  for the purpose of understanding the phase equilibria of Y98 (and potentially other olivine-phyric martian basalts), its olivine-melt Cr partitioning systematics, as well as the effects of temperature and melt composition on the equilibrium Cr valence ratio in coexisting olivine and melt.    XANES Data Acquisition and Reduction:  Chromium K-edge XANES data were acquired with the x-ray microprobe of GSECARS beamline 13-ID-E at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory, Illinois. The x-ray source at APS beamline 13-ID-E was a 72-pole, 33 mm period undulator. The beam was focused to final spot size of approximately 5μm by 5μm with dynamically configured Kirkpatrick-Baez focusing mirrors.       All spectra were acquired in fluorescence mode utilizing a cryogenically cooled Si (311) monochromater and a silicon-drift solid state detector offset at a 45° angle from the sample. Spectra were acquired in three distinct crystallographic orientations and merged in order to mitigate the effects of crystalline anisotropy on the intensity of the peak associated with the 1s-4s transition [1, 4].       Results: We have obtained Cr K-edge spectra for an olivine megacryst as well as for a smaller "ground mass" olivine phenocryst. The analytical transects were specifically targeted to sample a region from Mg-rich core to the ferroan rim. Figure 1 shows the location of the analytical transect in the megacryst, superimposed on a composite backscattered electron      image and phosphorus x-ray map. The P-map has been obtained in order to help place the valence measurements into an "olivine-growth stratigraphy. The   calculated Cr2+/Crtotal values obtained for the megacryst are plotted as a function of position in Figure 2. Beginning in the core of the megacryst, the measured Cr2+/Crtotal values are effectively constant within the uncertainty of the measurements, for a Figure 1 is a composite backscattered electron image and phosphorus WDS x-ray map showing the location of the XANES spot analyses on an olivine megacryst in Y98.  Figure 2 shows the XANES measured Cr valence ratios for the Y98 olivine megacryst depicted in Fig. 1.

  distance of approximately 300 µm (corresponding to spots P2-P5). The XANES spectra corresponding to spots P7-P10 show a monotonic decrease in the  calculated Cr2+/Crtotal from 0.77 to 0.39 (Figure 2).  Data from a groundmass phenocryst indicate that the measured Cr2+/Crtotal values are significantly lower than those observed in the megacryst transect, with values ranging from a maximum of 0.48 to a minimum of 0.20.    Interpreting the Cr valence Measurements: Valence ratios of heterovalent elements in melts are not only controlled by fO2, but can also be significantly influenced by temperature, melt composition, and pressure. Therefore, in order to correctly interpret to redox evolution recorded by the measured Cr valence values, the effects of all of these variables must be quantified for the Y98 system.        The crystallization depths for Y98 have been estimated to be relatively shallow, corresponding to pressures of less than 300 MPa [5]. Based on these estimates, it is unlikely that magma ascent and decompression plays a significant role in modifying the Cr2+/Crtotal recorded in conjugate olivine-melt pairs.       The effects of decreasing temperature may have a significant influence on the Cr valence ratio of the melt. For example, decreasing temperature has been shown to increase the equilibrium valence ratio for   V4+/V5+ in silicate melts [6]. In other words, at constant a fO2 value, decreasing temperature stabilizes the oxidized half of the redox couple. To test the extent to which this may be true for Cr redox ratio, we have performed a series of experiments on the Y98 bulk composition, as well a low liquidus CMAS bulk composition. These experiments indicate that the effects of temperature on the Cr valence ratio of the melt are relatively minor, such that a 100˚C decrease in temperature depresses Cr2+/Crtotal by approximately 5%.  Coincidentally, at fO2 values along the IW buffer curve, the decrease in Cr2+/Crtotal caused by decreasing temperature is nearly offset by the temperature dependent decrease of the buffer curve-defined fO2 value. The results of these experiments are depicted in Figure 3; they suggest that the temperature effects on the Cr valence ratios of melt-olivine pairs are of relatively little consequence, at least relative to the effects of changing fO2.       Variable melt composition may also affect the Cr2+/Crtotal of the Y98 melt. As the extent of crystallization increases, the composition of the residual liquid becomes enriched in the CaO and Al2O3 components, while becoming depleted with respect the MgO.  The effect of changing melt composition on the valence ratios of heterovalent elements may be rationalized in terms of melt's optical basicity; numerous studies have demonstrated that melts with higher values of optical basicity preferentially shift redox equilibria so that the cation       of the higher valence state is preferentially stabilized [3]. Our calculations indicate that the optical bacisity of the Y98 melt slightly decreases with increasing crystallization from a value of 0.62 at 1400˚C to 0.57 at 1200˚C. This suggests that the effect of changing melt composition may in fact cause a small increase in the Cr2+/Crtotal; this effect is the opposite of the trend observed in the megacryst analytical transect, lending additional credence to the interpretation that the Cr valence ratio reflects a late-stage magmatic oxidation event.    The fO2 values recorded by Y98 Olivines: Based on the conclusions of the previous section, we interpret the decrease in Cr2+/Crtotal observed in the megacryst rim to be representative of a late-stage oxidation event. We calculate the fO2 in the core of the megacryst to be at or slightly below the IW buffer, perhaps as low as ΔIW+0 (±0.2). As Y98 represents a primary mantle melt, this value likely represents the best estimate for the fO2 of the depleted martian mantle.       The decreasing Cr2+/Crtotal values preserved in the olivine rim suggest that the fO2 increased from an initial value of ΔIW to a maximum of ΔIW+2. Recent SIMS work on olivine-hosted melt inclusions and groundmass glass suggests that the residual late stage melt experienced significant hydrogen and carbon loss due to shallow degassing [5]; therefore,  the late stage oxidation event recorded in the olivine m degassing of the residual Y98 liquid.
