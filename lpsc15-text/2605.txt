Introduction: The origin of pallasite meteorites, which are composed of iron-nickel metal and olivine, has posed a paradox since the metal and silicate should have segregated prior to solidification. Prior hypotheses have focused on formation near the core-mantle boundary of a differentiated asteroid [1]. Paleomagnetic evidence of an ancient dynamo, from minute magnetic recorders contained within olivine grains, requires an alternative model for the origin of Main Group pallasites [2]. Thellier and Total Thermal Remanent Magnetization paleointensity results, combined with thermal modeling, have motivated a model for pallasite formation where a differentiated impactor collides with a differentiated target protoplanetary body which hosts a dynamo. Iron-nickel metal from the impactor core is injected as dikes into the silicate (olivine) mantle of the target body. Minute fractures in olivine crystals (which subsequently heal) allow for the injection of FeNi which record the target body dynamo on cooling. This process of pallasite formation – through the injection of an impactor’s core metal into a target asteroid’s mantle – has also been suggested for the Eagle Station parent body [3, 4]. Here we consider mesosiderites, brecciated stony iron meteorites composed of iron-nickel metal and silicate phases [5, 6]. These bear some similarities with pallasites [7], in being mixtures of silicates and ironnickel metal, but inferred formation mechanisms differ drastically. For example, the metal and silicate components have been interpreted to represent the reassembly of a protoplantetary body which had a molten core prior to impact [8]. A relatively large target body (~200400 km diameter) has been inferred on the basis of cooling rate data and modeling [8]. Limited paleomagnetic data exists for mesosiderite meteorites [9-12]; the most comprehensive study previously reported has been on the Estherville mesosiderite. Results from mutually oriented alternating field and thermal demagnetization experiments of metal and silicate fractions from the Estherville mesosiderite show a range of magnetic stability and scattered remanent directions, predominantly carried by kamacite and tetrataenite [12]. On the basis of these results, Collinson [12] suggested that the magnetization was acquired prior to formation of the meteorite. We propose, alternatively, that the incoherence in previously published mesosiderite paleomagnetic data may reflect variations in the recording fidelity of the different phases of silicate and FeNi metal found within these meteorites. We describe preliminary data aimed at testing this hypothesis.   Figure 1. Mesosiderite NWA 8368 with a large olivine grain highlighted.  Methods: We report magnetic data from a sample of the mesosiderite, Northwest Africa (NWA) 8368 (Figure 1). Paleomagnetic data is isolated from the meteorite by focusing on single silicate crystals [13], which can contain small single-domain-like magnetic inclusions that are capable of recording magnetizations on billion-year time scales [14, 15]. NWA 8368 contains mm- to cm-scale olivine grains (Figure 1). We selected the olivine grains for study to minimize contributions from multi-domain magnetic carriers which have relatively short relaxation times and are prone to carrying spurious magnetizations. Mutually oriented olivine samples, ~1-2 mm on a side, were prepared from ~1 mm-thick thin-sections for demagnetization experiments. All paleomagnetic measurements were done with a 3-component high-sensitivity DC SQUID magnetometer in a magnetically shielded room at the University of Rochester's paleomagnetic laboratory. Samples were first demagnetized in steps in an alternating field up to 10 mT, and then stepwise thermally demagnetized using a CO2 laser [14]. Findings: In contrast to prior studies of olivine from pallasite meteorites [2-4], olivine from NWA 8368 typically contains large (many tens of microns to ~150 µm) inclusions visible under low magnification (e.g. 10x) which we infer to be FeNi metal and/or sulfides.

NWA 8368 (Figure 2) demonstrate the presence of a low-unblocking temperature (LBT) component of magnetization. We tentatively interpret the LBT component to be recorded by the large inclusions; it may be a viscous overprint. We also see a different component of magnetization, isolated at higher unblocking temperatures (HBT). Our magnetic data to date suggests that a common direction may be preserved by the HBT component, however it is not fully defined, presumably because of the presence of non-ideal magnetic inclusions.    Figure 2. Orthogonal vector plots of CO2 laser thermal demagnetizations from two mutually oriented olivine samples from the interior of NWA 8368. Red lines, inclination; blue lines, declination. Labeled points are °C. Dashed red arrow highlights a low-unblocking temperature component of magnetization (LBT), while the green arrow highlights a higher unblocking temperature component (HBT).  Discussion: Future work will focus on a more thorough isolation of subsamples lacking large multidomain magnetic inclusions from NWA 8368, continued demagnetization experiments on mutually oriented olivine crystals to define remanent components of magnetization, and electron microscopy compositional analysis to characterize magnetic carriers within the olivine grains. If coherency of magnetic directions is demonstrated in future studies, it would suggest that mesosiderite meteorites could have formed by FeNi metal injection from an impactor into a parent body target in a similar manner as Main Group and Eagle Station pallasites. However, mesosiderite meteorites would represent shallower penetration depths within a parent body. Conversely, lack of coherency of magnetizations would support disruption/reassembly scenarios for the mesosiderite parent body.  References: [1] Wasson, J. T. & Choi B. G. (2003) Geochim. Cosmochim.
