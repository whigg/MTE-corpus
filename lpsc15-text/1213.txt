Introduction: Meteorites provide the information about the bulk composition of its parent  asteroids or planets.The  parent  body  suffer  violent  collisions  reequilibrating thermodynamically its minerals phases at various  pressures.  The  process  of  crystallization  and amorphization  provides  some  information  about  the impact processes as well as environmental conditions on the parent  body.  High-pressure laboratory experimentation,therefore,  provides  a  tool  to  measure  the pressure  of  transition.  Here  we report  high  pressure XRD and Mössbauer spectroscopic measurements on Piplia Kalan meteorite , a eucrite  which fell in Pali district  of Rajasthan during the year  1996 [1].  The elemental anlysis using XRF showed (in weight %) Si= 22.82; Fe=15.25; Mg=3.92;Al=6.55;Ca=7.35 and Ti= 0.50   classifying  it  as  a  eucrite.  EPMA  showed pyroxene content as En32-36Fs60-65Wo2-5 and plagioclase feldspar to be anorthite rich ( 90mol%).         Method: In-situ high-pressure x-ray diffraction experiment was carried out up to 16GPa in an angledispersive  mode  using  monochromatic  x-rays (λ=0.6255Å) at EDXRD beam line located at a bending magnet port BL-11 at INDUS 2 Synchrotron source at  RRCAT,  Indore  (India)  and  Mao-Bell  DAC with diamond  culet  ~  400  μm.Sample  chamber  was  preindented  tungsten  carbide  gasket  with  200  μm hole filled with silicon oil as pressure transmitter, 2D diffraction images were recorded using MAR345 image plate  detector  with  beam  dimension 200x200μm.Sample-detector  distance,  detector  tilt-rotation and x-ray wavelength were corrected using CeO2 powder as calibrant [2]. For Mössbauer spectroscopic measurements (up to 8GPa),Merrill Bassett DAC was used  with  sample  assembly consisting of   tantalum gasket with 200 μm hole containing ruby crystals for pressure measurements and 4:1 ethanol:methanol mixture  as  pressure  transmitting  medium.The  data  were collected using 10mCi point source, Si-PIN noise less solid  state  detector  and  CMCA-550  data  acquisition module[3].  Results and Discussions: Fig. 1 compares XRD pattern of the DAC encapsualted sample with that of the raw  powder.The  dominant  minerals  are anorthite,monoclinic  ferrosilite  and  clinoenstatite.Inspite of  variation in the intensity due to the presence of very few grains inside DAC, the  peaks due to dominant minerals could be seen prominently[4]. 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 0500 An Fs + C EN Fs + C EN An CE NF s + C EN Fs Fs 2. 13 2. 472. 52 2. 57 2. 883. 00 An 3. 19A nA nA n3. 61 3. 76 4. 034. 59 6. 46 Au Gasket Au in Dac Fine powder In te ns ity ( a rb . u ni ts )Angle(2Theta) An- Anorthite CEN- Clino enstatite Fs- Ferrosilite Fig. 1.

XRD patterns of Piplia Kalan meteorite at               various  pressures inside DAC. Fig.2 displays pressure dependent XRD patterns of the  Piplia  Kalan  meteorite  at  various  pressures.  The variations  in  the  pattern  between ambient  and  5GPa could be explained by P21/c to C2/c  displacive phase transition in ferrosilite  and  pyroxene [5,6].Terrestrial anorthite because of its sensitivity towards the pressure has shown an onset of amorphization between 10 to 14 GPa  followed by a total irreversible amorphization at about 20GPa [4,7].The prominent peaks corresponding to the mineral  marked as 'An' in the figure indicate loss of  intensity around 5 GPa , eventually becoming amorphous at  12GPa.  At 16 GPa ,  amorphization of  other components are also visible through broadening of peaks. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 -0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 M1 Is om er S hi ft (m m/s )Pressure (GPa) M2 Fig.3  Pressure  -dependentvariation  in  isomer shift  in Piplia Kalan meteorite.      Pigeonite rich pyroxene have two inequivalent distinctive  octahedral  sites  M1 and  M2 ,  Fe  preferring more  distorted  M2  site.  Mössbauer  spectroscopy,  a sensitive tool to probe Fe nuclei through its parameters- isomer shift and quadrupole splitting is sensitive towards applied pressure.Isomer shift at ambient pressure suggested divalent Fe preferring occupation in M2 site but it showed large variation with pressure while M1 site remained almost undisturbed ( Fig 3.). Table 2: Pressure dependent variation in Isomer shift for Piplia Kalan meteorite at various pressure ranges. Pressure range ((GPa) Site Pressure coefficient of Isomer shift  δ(IS)/δP ( mm/s/GPa) Ambient - 2.9 GPa M1 M2      +   1.7 x10-3      -    4.82x10-3 2.9 - 3.8 GPa M1 M2       -    7.4x10-2       -    1.30 3.8-6.5 GPa M1 M2       +   3.3x10-3           +   1.81x10-2 6.5 -7.9 GPa M1 M2        +   4.28x10-3       -    7.21x10-2 The  pressure  coefficient  of  isomer  shift  δ(IS)/δP between  2.9 to 3.8GPa  showed largest slope fro both M1 and M2 sites(Fig 3,Table 2).  This negative pressure coefficient accompanied by inversion in the population could be corresponding to P21/c to C2/c phase transition seen by XRD[8].The positive  pressure coefficient between 3.8 to 6.5GPa conjugated with sharpness  of  peaks  in  XRD  patterns  could  suggest reaarangement of atoms in the various lattice planes.Though  Fe-free  anorthite  could  not  be  detected  by Mössbauer technique , however any changes in the environment would appear as changes in the Mössbauer parameters. The onset of amorphization by  anorthite , thus could  be  visualized  as  negatice  pressure  coefficient  above 6.5 GPa ( Table 2).       A case study on Lohawat Howardite meteorite - another  member of  HED (Howardite-Eucrite-Diogenite) family originated from the same asteroid 4-Vesta showed interesting results .The chemical composition of the sample was orthopyroxene ( En34Fs65Wo1) with 94% anorthite rich plagioclase. High pressure study on the  sample  showed  interesting pressure-induced  irreversible  amorphization  in  anorthite   at  2.8GPa  followed by reversible crystallization in pyroxenes at 5.6 GPa [9].         Both Lohawat and Piplia Kalan meteorites,having the same origin are classified as Howardite and eucrite respectively. Both contained plagioclase feldspar with 90%  anorthite.The  response  of  the  mineral  with  applied pressure in these samples, different from the terrestrial  behavior,  facilitated  in  estimating  the  peak shock pressure  experienced  by the  meteorites  during ejection from the parent body. Irrevesible amorphization took place at ~ 3GPa  and 12 GPa in Lohawat and Piplia Kalan meteorites respectively instead of 20 GPa reported for terrestrial anorthite.       Interestingly,  in  Lohawat  meteorite  orthopyroxene  did  not  respond  to  the  pressure  up  to 9GPa  while  monoclinic  pyroxene  and  ferrosilite  in Piplia Kan meteorite revealed a displacive phase transitions at very low pressure of 3.5GPa.  Our pressure  dependent  study on  the  meteorites demonstrate that  such studies not only could provide estimation of peak shock pressure  but also would suggest  environmental  information  about  the  genesis. Sensitivity of aniorthite mineral plays an important role in estimating the peak shock pressure  due to  impact processes.
