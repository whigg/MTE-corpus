Introduction:  Cassini observations discovered a dynamic plume on the south pole of Enceladus in 2005 [e.g., 1] and the plume is regarded as a major source of plasma, neutral gas and dust in E ring [e.g., 2-4]. The plume as observed by the Cassini Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) is composed of H2O (91%), CO or N2 (3.3%), CO2 (3.1%) and CH4 (1.6%) [5]. The Cassini INMS also detected the ion count rate for m/q (mass per charge) and ions of 18, 19, 36 and 37 amu were observed in the plume [6]. These species are thought to be molecular ions such as H2O+ (m/q = 18), H3O+ (19), and cluster ions such as H2O+-H2O (36) and H3O+-H2O (37). They also showed that the H3O+ generated by ion-neutral reactions is dominant in the plume. The energy distribution in the plume was examined by the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS). The ion energy was between 10 and 100 eV outside the plume, however, it decreased to a few eV in the plume [7]. We have investigated the charcteristics of water group ions in the vicinity of Enceladus using test particle and Monte Carlo methods including collisional processes such as charge exchange and ion-neutral chemical reaction, and compared them with observations of the INMS and CAPS.  E03 & E07 Flybys:  The INMS detected the ion species on E03 and E07 flybys (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 shows the Cassini orbits with Enceladus coordinate system superposed on the Omidi’s electric field we used as background fields [8], energy spectrogram observed by the CAPS and the count rate of H3O+ (m/q = 19) observed by the INMS for E03 and E07 flybys.  We compare our results with the CAPS and INMS results, and discuss them. Model:  We use test particle and Monte Carlo methods to investigate the distribution of water group ions around the Enceladus plume. The number of particles is 1,000,000 and the Enceladus coordinate system is adopted in this model. The positive X is the direction of co-rotation and the positive Y is toward to Saturn with a focus on Enceladus. A box size for simulation is 10 RE × 10 RE × 15 RE (-5 RE ≤ X ≤ 5 RE, -5 RE ≤ Y ≤ 5 RE and -10 RE ≤ Z ≤ 5 RE) where RE is the radius of Enceladus (252 km). Particles are set at X = 5 RE (front model) with the reduced co-rotation speed [9-11]. We calculated energy distribution and ion components with three cases of electric field: (1) the Omidi’s electric field, (2) the reduced Ey from Omidi’s field which is 25% of the Omidi’s Ey, and (3) the reduced Ey & Ez from Omdi’s field (Ez = -10 µV/m). H2O+-H2O reactions: The H2O+ is given as the initial input of ion since most of H3O+ which is dominant in the plume are created by H2O+ [6]. The following H2O+-H2O reactions are used: € H2O+ +H2O→H2O +H2O+H2O+ +H2O→OH +H3O+ The cross section for the charge exchange reaction is a constant 10-15 cm-2 and for the chemical reaction depends on the ion energy [12]. Plume model: We assume that H2O+-H2O reactions only occur in the plume to investigate the ion distribution of the plume. We use one single plume model  [13]. The density in the plume nplume is written by € nplume r,θ( ) = n0REr# $ % & ' ( 2exp − θHθ# $ % & ' ( 2−r − REHd* + , , - . / /  where n0 is the H2O density at the center of plume on the Enceladus’ surface and it is € 2.5 ×109  cm-3, r is the radial distance from the center of Enceladus, θ is the angular distance from the center of plume, Hθ the angular width of the plume and it is € 12°, and Hd is the depletion length scale and we set it 948 km which equals to four times of the Hill radius [13, 14]. Energy distribution and species:  Fig. 2 shows the calculated energy-flux distribution for E03. We will also show E07 results. The plume region for E03 is about from 19:07 to 19:08, and for E07 is about from 19:42 to 19:43. The energy distribution of plasma is a few tens to hundreds of eV outside plume in each Figure 1.

case. We couldn’t find low energy ions for cases (1) and (2) in the plume region. However, ion energy decreased to a few eV (Fig. 2) when the z-component electric field was considered. To obtain the low energy flux, the ion needs to move with ~10 km/s downward (-z direction) because Cassini was almost moving the negative z direction. The gas speed of the neutral plume is 19:05 19:06 19:07 19:08 19:09012345E03, Reduced Ey & Ez, log(Φ0) [#/m2/s/eV]  H2O++H3O+88.599.51010.511about 400 m/s. Therefore, another mechanism was needed to explain the fast downward velocity of ion. We focused on the z component of electric field and could obtain the low energy ion by reducing this field. The cause of the reduced Ez could be dust effect, the density gradient of electron or the Enceladus charging. On the other hand, we were able to obtain low energy ions for E07 in all cases (not shown here). The dominant ion species was H3O+. This is consistent with INMS observations [6]. Chemical reaction vs. Photoionization: We examine what ions are dominant in the plume by using two models: (1) ions generated by only photoionization in the plume (photo-plume model) and (2) ions from the magnetosphere.  19:05 19:06 19:07 19:08 19:0903691215x 1011Flux [#/m2 /s]E03, Reduced Ey & Ez, Charge Exchangea: H2O++H3O+19:05 19:06 19:07 19:08 19:0903691215x 1011Flux [#/m2 /s]E03, Reduced Ey & Ez, Photoionizationb: H2O++H3O+Fig. 3 shows the calculated total ion flux with reduced Ey & Ez case for E03 orbit. The total flux of front model (panel a) is a order of magnitude larger than that of photo-plume model (panel b). The plume ion is dominated by the magnetospheric ion which is originally generated from the plume gas. Interpretation of INMS data: We compare our results with INMS observations for E03 and E07 flybys. Fig. 4 shows the calculated ion flux per 1 eV with reduced Ey & Ez case for E03 and E07 flybys.

Only energies less than 30 eV were detected within 10 degree. The energy range for E03 is somewhat larger than that for E07 because the s/c velocity of E03 is faster than velocity of E07. The INMS would observe around 20 eV for E03 and 6 eV for E07 because a center of a field of view is about 20 eV for E03 and about 5.6 eV for E07. We will translate the fluxes to count rates and compare with INMS results. Summary: We investigated the energy distribution and the total flux of water group ions around the Enceladus plume. Charge exchange and chemical reactions are considered in this model. Our main results are that: (1) low energy ions were found in the plume when the negative z-component electric field was taken into account, and the dust and density gradient of electron can generate a polarization electric field in the plume, (2) the dominat ion in the plume is H3O+ generated by a chemical reaction, and (3) photoionization is not effective for the generation of ions in the plume.
