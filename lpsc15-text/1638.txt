Zhang1, 1National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences(20A Datun Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 10012, China, licl@nao.cas.cn).   Introduction: Recent ten years lunar mission, has mapped lunar surface in different resolution, and acquired high quality topography data, including Japanese SELENE(2007.9), Chinese Chang'E-1(2007.10), Chang'E-2(2010.10), Indian Chandrayaan-1(2008.3) and US Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter(2009.6) etc. Haruyama[1], Scholten[2], Smith[3] and Li[4] have respectively used these data sets to produce the global lunar topographic maps. These maps are usually used as base map for lunar science and lunar missions. They accurately describle lunar morphology and have opened a new era for our understanding the moon.  On October 1st, 2010, Chang'E-2 (or CE2) was successfully launched. This is the Chinese second lunar exploration. Its main objective is to acquire 1.5m and 7m spatial resolution images at 15km and 100km orbit height. These high spatial resolution images have be used to select landing site and plan Yutu rover scientific exploration route for Chang'E-3. In this presentation, we will introduce Chang'E-2 stereo camera, its topographic data processing and products that will be released. CE2 Stereo Camera and Data:  Stereo camera is one of main payloads of the CE2, which uses the linear pushbroom scanning technique to capture two-line imagery of forward view and backward view along the satellite flight direction, stereo view angle is 7.98deg and -17.2deg respectively. The CCD detector of the camera used time delayed and integration CCD(TDI CCD), which allows five integration grade such as 16, 32, 48, 64 and 96, three gain such as 0.7, 1.0 and 2.0. The setting of integration grade is determined by the gain setting, solar illumination condition, the average reflectance of lunar surface and other factors. The spectral range of CCD stereo camera is 450~ 52m. The image width is 9.2km and 43km, the spatial resolution is 1.5m and 7m with the orbit altitude of 15km and 100km respectively. The first two-line imagery strip was acquired on October 24th, 2010. Up to May 23rd, 2011, CE2 stereo camera has returned more than 600 imagery strips with 7m spatial resolution to earth covering the 100% lunar surface. We have selected 384 imagery strips of them to generate the global topographic map. These images have been archived with Planetary Data System (PDS) format after radiometric calibration, photometric correction and geometric processing by Ground Research and Application System(GRAS), which is the important component for the implementation of the CE2 mission. Data Processing:  The global topographic data processing include data organization, global adjustment, DEM(Digital Elevation Model) and DOM(Digital Orthophoto Map) generation. Now, we have generated the DEM and DOM products for the whole lunar surface. Their ground spatial resolutions are both 7m. (1) Data Organization:  We have selected 384 imagery strips for data processing. The original imagery strip covers lunar surface between 90 degrees north and 90 degrees south, about 5,455km length. Due to wide coverage, big size, and computational complexity of image data, the global surface is cut apart into 382 small blocks. The original imagery strips are split up into 6682 small image sections by the block border. There are suitable overlaps between different sections.  (2) Global Adjustment: The object of the global adjustment is to achieve a pixel mosaic level for the topographic products. About 4,365,729 connection points(or homologous points) over the neighboring image sections are extracted by using image matching[5]. A combined block adjustment method based on independent models adjustment and bundle adjustment is used to construct RPC models for every image section with 5 LRRR(Lunar Laser Ranging Retroreflector) locations as control points. The planimetric displacement and height difference between neighboring image sections are both less than two pixels(<14m). The global adjustment has achieved seamless connection and absolute orientation for all image sections. (3) DEM and DOM Generation:  The RPC model of each image section is used to generate DEM and DOM on our digital photogrammetric workstation. The spatial resolutions of DEM and DOM are both 7m. Finally, for data easy saving and management, the global surface is cut apart into 844 subdivisions(Figure.1). DEM and DOM of each image section is mosaicked and cut respectively in each subdivision. Results and Validation:  We have finished the lunar global topographic map products, called as "CE2 Orthophoto Map(CE2DOM2014,Figure.2a) and CE2 Elevation Model (CE2DEM2014,Figure.2b)". The products include DOM and DEM of 844 subdivisions(Figure.2c). Their spatial resolutions are both 7m. The internal precision  is less than two pixels(ï¼œ14m). Each product file of DEM and DOM are respectively 1638.pdf

stored by 32bit floating number and 8bit integer number. The file sizes are respectively about 3.5GB and 900MB. The total data products exceed 3.9TB. They very detailed and accurately portray morphological features of lunar surface. The products will be released in the future.

Figure.2c Color-coded topography and shaded relief Maps of subdivisions(Left subdivision code is F117, in mare, and Aristarchus crater at the map center. Right code is F117, in highland, Tycho crater at the map upright corner). In order to validate and value CE2 global topographic map products, we compare our results with five LRRR locations, LRO WAC DEM and LOLA DEM. The results shows:1) Comparison with LRRR, the planimetric displacement is 21m~97m, height difference is 2m~19m. Comparison with LRO WAC DEM, average of height difference is 51m, stdv is 113m (Figure.3a). 3). Comparison with LOLA DEM, average of height difference is 43m, stdv is 110m (Figure.3b).  Figure.3a Height Difference between CE2DEM2014 and LRO WAC DEM.  Figure.3b Height Difference between CE2DEM2014 and LRO LOLA DEM. Conclusion:  We have generated the CE2 lunar global topographic map products, called as "CE2DOM2014 and CE2DEM2014". The products are a global and seamless data sets. Their internal precision is very good, and also have a good external precision compared with LRRR locations, LRO WAC DEM and LOLA DEM. The data sets have been archived with Planetary Data System (PDS) format and will be released in the future. We hope the CE2 lunar global topographic map products will be used for future lunar science and lunar missions planning.   Reference: [1] Haruyamal J. et al. (2014) LPS XLV, Abstract1304#.
