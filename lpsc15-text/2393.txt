This is particularly true for the earliest stages of core formation, when chondritic material reached and exceeded the solidus temperature and early partial melting occurred.   Further, most experimental work on core formation has centered on relatively reduced meteorites, including the ordinary and enstatite chondrites.   Given the suggestion that the CV chondrites might have originated from a differentiated asteroid [1], the early partial melting of CV chondrites is of particular interest. Previous experiments [2] included partial melting of the CV chondrite Allende at 1130-1325C.  These authors were primarily interested in silicate melting and used long experimental run times, leading to volatile loss, including loss of sulfides.   Likewise, annealing experiments of [3] at 1050 and 1150C for 4 days suffered from sulfur loss.  As we are primarily interested in melting of the metal-sulfide-magnetite component, we have performed low-temperature, shortduration disequilibrium melting experiments of Allende and Vigarano to bracket the onset of partial melting and retain sulfides.    Experimental Technique:  We performed partial melting experiments in a Deltech 1 atm gas mixing furnaces using a CO-CO2 mixture to control oxygen fugacity and standard techniques for monitoring temperature and O2.   Allende and Vigarano sample the oxidized and reduced CV chondrites, respectively.  Temperatures of 1050, 1100, and 1150C were used.  These experiments complement and extend the temperature range examined by [2].  Experiments were run for 4 hours on chips of 93-161 mg.   Chips were selected to provide insights into the physical processes occurring during early partial melting. To date, we have performed all of our experiments at IW-1, as were some of the experiments of [2].   More oxidizing experiments (IW+1) are planned.  Imaging, elemental mapping, and semi-quantitative analyses were conducted using an FEI Nova NanoSEM 600. Results:  As expected, all of the charges exhibited significant evidence of partial melting, which becomes more abundant at higher temperature, and reactions. The most dramatic change in the experiments was the abundance of Fe,Ni metal.  In all charges, Fe,Ni metal was observed, often in association with iron sulfide in textures indicative of Fe,Ni-FeS cotectic melting (Fig. 1) and commonly as µm-wide veins cross cutting larger mafic silicate grains, indicative of partial melting and melt migration.   [2] reported metal abundances in their Allende IW-1 charge of ~6.5 wt.% and our charges are similarly rich in metal.   CV chondrite mineralogy differs between the oxidized and reduced subgroup, but contain 0.3-6.1% magnetite, 2.4-8.1% sulfide (often Ni-rich), and 0.2-2.2% Fe,Ni metal [4].  In contrast, we find only rare magnetite in the experiments and a metal-sulfide ratio consistently higher than observed in unheated CV chondrites.   The presence of 5-15 wt.% Ni in the metal and absence of Ni in the sulfides in the experiments suggests its formation was not solely due to reduction of either of FeO from silicates or magnetite, but likely a complex reduction (driven by the imposed O2) between magnetite, Nibearing sulfides and metal. Silicate partial melting is present in all experiments and pockets large enough to semi-quantitatively analyze were present at 1100C.   Allende melts in our 1150C charge were similar in composition to those reported by [2] in their Allende 1160 IW-1 charge, although somewhat higher in Na2O and P2O5.   Like [2], we observed abundant hercynitic spinel in association with silicate melt, but also observed calcium phosphate, plagioclase, mafic silicates, metal and sulfide in association with these melts (Fig. 2).   As suggested by [2], spinel is likely stabilized by the Al2O3 component of the silicate melt.   CV chondrite magnetites contain ~1-2 wt.% Cr2O3, which is effectively excluded from metal and sulfide at IW-1 and is subsequently incorporated into spinel during melting.   As expected, phosphates are present in early partial melts, both contributing P2O5 to the silicate melt and crystallizing as phosphates. Magnetite, although exceptionally rare in the experimental charges owing to its reduction to metal, exhibits some interesting features.   In our Allende 1150C charge, we observed an ~10 µm particle entirely enclosed in olivine consisting of Mg-bearing magnetite, phosphate, spinel, pentlandite and a Ni-rich pyrrhotite (Fig. 3).    Similar assemblages have been noted by others [5] and it is possible that this assemblage is primary, having formed as an immiscible melt.  Experimental remelting of the particle is possible and the formation of spinel in the absence of silicate melt is noteworthy.  In the 1100C Vigarano charge, we ob  served a chondrule olivine cross cut by a segmented vein consisting of magnetite, metal and sulfide.  The cross-cutting texture suggests melting and melt migration of a metal-sulfide-magnetite melt during the experimental heating.   Melting in the Fe-Ni-S-O system can begin at 915C [6], well below the temperature inferred for even a relatively Ni-rich Fe-S system (~950C) and the experimental temperature. Conclusions:  Melting of the metal-sulfidemagnetite component of CV chondrites produces melts which could ultimately form the core of a differentiated parent body of CV chondrite parentage.  The nature of that core could depend dramatically on oxidation conditions, with reducing conditions producing abundant metal and iron sulfides, perhaps accompanied by significant abundances of spinel that might form a distinct lithology.  Oxidizing conditions might well form a melt in the Fe-Ni-S-O system including magnetite, perhaps producing a type of core not previously envisioned.        References: [1] Elkins-Tanton et al.
