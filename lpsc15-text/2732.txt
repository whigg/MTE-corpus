Introduction:  The notion that the chemical composition of terrestrial planets can be made by mixing primitive chondrites in various proportions forms the backbone of much of today's planetary geochemistry. A lingering issue, however, is that the meteorites that are most often considered for explaining the chemical composition  of  the  Earth  [1]  also  display  isotopic anomalies relative to terrestrial rocks, and so they cannot be viable building blocks for the Earth [2-7]. The only meteorite group that  approximately matches the terrestrial  composition  are  enstatite  chondrites  [8,9], but these meteorites also have low Mg/Si and δ30Si values, so that one would have to assume unfeasibly large amounts of Si hidden in the core or the mantle [10,11]. These observations urge the use of  caution when taking chondrites as proxies for the bulk isotopic composition of the terrestrial planets. For example, using ordinary chondrites as proxy for the 142Nd/144Nd of the bulk Earth might lead to incorrect interpretations of the 142Nd rock record to determine accretion and differentiation timescales of the Earth [12]. Likewise, taking the Si isotope composition of ordinary and carbonaceous chondrites  as  representative  for  the  bulk  Earth  may lead to wrong assumptions about the Earth's Mg/Si ratio and the amount of Si in Earth's core [13]. If known chondrite types are not always good isotopic proxies  for  the planetary materials that  formed the Earth,  are there any meteorites that are?  The ungrouped (paired) primitive achondrites NWA 5363 and NWA 5400  are  relatively  oxidized  (~IW-1),  metalbearing ultramafic stones with terrestrial O and Cr isotope  compositions  [14-16];  thus  they  may  represent primitive samples of the elusive terrestrial reservoir. As part of our ongoing effort to better constrain the isotopic composition of the bulk Earth and the genetic relations of  meteorites and the Earth-forming reservoir we  present  here  a  comprehensive  petrographic,  elemental and multi-isotopic (O, Ca, Ti, Cr, Ni, Mo, Ru, W) study of the NWA 5363/NWA 5400 meteorites, as well as isotope data for the chondrites Pillistfer (EL6), Allegan (H6) and Allende (CV3). Our results do not support the idea of a common reservoir for the NWA 5363/NWA 5400 parent body and the Earth. Analytical  Methods:  About  3-5 gram pieces  of the meteorite samples were cleaned with grinding paper and ultrasonication in methanol, and subsequently crushed and powdered in an agate mortar at the Origins Lab. Aliquots of the powders were distributed to the collaborators and digested and processed together with a terrestrial  rock  standard (BHVO-2 or  DTS-2) according to previously established methods. Bulk major and trace element analysis were obtained through SARM in  Nancy, France.  Oxygen  was  analyzed  by laser-fluorination GC-Gas-MS in Göttingen, Ca and Cr by TIMS at JPL and USTC, Ti, Ni, Mo, Ru and W by MC-ICP-MS in Chicago and Münster. Epoxy-mounted thick-sections of NWA 5363 and NWA 5400 were investigated by SEM at the Field Museum. Results:  Petrography. The texture of NWA 5363 and NWA 5400 is granuloplastic with triple junctions. In both meteorites olivine (Fa30) is dominant (~80%) followed by Ca-poor pyroxene (En73Fs25Wo2), Ca-rich pyroxene  (En45Fs10Wo45),  and  minor  chlorapatite, troilite,  chromite  (Cr/Cr+Al=82),  (oxidized)  FeNimetal grains  and traces  of plagioclase (Ab72An27Or1). Both meteorites  show significant  terrestrial  alteration (Fe-oxide  veins),  with  NWA 5363  being  better  preserved than NWA 5400. Major  and trace  elements. Relative to  chondritic abundances,  the  NWA  samples  are  depleted  in lithophile Al, Na, K, Ti, HFSEs and REEs, thus showing clear evidence for the extraction of a partial silicate melt, consistent with the almost complete absence of plagioclase. Molybdenum, W and the HSE on the other hand show strong enrichments relative to chondrites. Elements tracing desert weathering like U and Ba are significantly  enriched  relative  to  chondrites,  with NWA 5400 showing the higher enrichments. Isotopic compositions: Oxygen.  The δ18O and Δ17O values of NWA 5363 (5.7±0.7; -0.096±0.020; 2σ) and NWA 5400 (6.7±0.7; -0.139±0.032) are within uncertainty indistinguishable from the BHVO-2 (5.7± 0.7;  -0.088±0.032) and San Carlos olivine (5.3±0.7; -0.102±0.012) standard measurements.  These  results  confirm  earlier  O  isotope measurements  that  found  no  Δ17O  anomalies  in  the  NWA 5363/NWA 5400 samples [15-17]. On a 1σ level the Δ17O values of NWA 5363 and NWA 5400 are distinct. This most likely reflects the effects of desert alteration on NWA 5400. Our measurement of Pillistfer confirms a  significant  (~50 ppm) difference  in  Δ17O between  enstatite  chondrites  and  the  Earth,  leaving NWA5363 as the only known meteorite with identical Δ17O as the Earth. Calcium. Our data shows a common, and relative to the Earth, slightly anomalous Ca isotope composition of NWA 5363 and NWA 5400 (ε48Ca = -0.55±0.22 and -0.48±0.40). Titanium.  The  Ti  isotope  compositions  of  NWA 5363 and NWA 5400 are within uncertainty identical (ε50Ti = -0.95±0.17 and -1.01±0.13) to each other, but significantly different from the Earth. Chromium. New Cr data will  be presented at  the conference. Shukulyukov et al. [16] reported a terrestrial ε54Cr of 0.07±0.11 for NWA 5400. Nickel. The Ni isotope compositions of NWA 5363 and NWA 5400 are indistinguishable from each other (ε64Ni = 0.05±0.19 and 0.03±0.08) and within uncertainty identical to the terrestrial composition (ε64Ni=0). Molybdenum. NWA 5363  is  characterized  by  a small deficit in s-process Mo (ε92Mo=0.53±0.22), similar to ordinary chondrites and possibly enstatite chondrites. Ruthenium. Like for Mo, the Ru isotope composition of NWA 5363 exhibits a s-process deficit (ε100Ru= -0.34±0.13) similar to ordinary chondrites. Tungsten. NWA 5363 and NWA 5400 exhibit identical  and  highly  unradiogenic  ε182W values  of  -3.26 ±0.08  and  -3.18±0.08.  Together  with  their  low 180Hf/184W (0.02), this equates to a two-stage model age of  Hf/W fractionation  from a chondritic  reservoir  of 1.2±0.5 Ma after CAI. Discussion: Our new petrographic,  elemental and isotopic data confirm that NWA 5363 and NWA 5400 are  paired  primitive  achondritic  meteorites  from  an early-formed  relatively  oxidized  asteroidal  parent body. The mineral assemblage is interpreted as representing a restite after partial melting and extraction of a small amount of silicate melt from a fertile (chondritic) source rock within ~1.5 Myr of the start of the solar  system.  The  high  concentrations  of  refractory siderophile elements (Mo, W, HSE) in the restite requires  the presence of  metal  during  silicate melt  extraction and indicates the absence of a planetary-wide metal-silicate  fractionation  event  on  the  NWA 5363/ NWA 5400 parent body. The O, Cr, and Ni isotopic compositions of NWA 5363/NWA 5400 are indistinguishable from the terrestrial isotope abundances, suggesting a close genetic relationship between the nebular reservoirs from which the NWA parent body and the Earth accreted. In fact, the NWA 5363/NWA 5400 meteorites are currently the only known extraterrestrial  materials  with  an O isotopic  composition  identical  to  the  bulk  Earth.  However, our new Ca, Ti, Mo and Ru isotope data also reveal significant differences between the isotopic makeup of NWA 5363/NWA 5400 and the Earth. Thus, although  the  NWA  5363/NWA  5400  meteorites  are highly interesting samples of a unique partially differentiated asteroidal parent body, they are not sampling the  terrestrial  planetary  reservoir  and  are  not  the Rosetta stones to decipher the isotopic composition of the bulk Earth.
