Theonly meteorite group that  approximately matches theterrestrial  composition  are  enstatite  chondrites  [8,9],but these meteorites also have low Mg/Si and δ30Si values, so that one would have to assume unfeasibly largeamounts of Si hidden in the core or the mantle [10,11].These observations urge the use of  caution whentaking chondrites as proxies for the bulk isotopic composition of the terrestrial planets. For example, usingordinary chondrites as proxy for the 142Nd/144Nd of thebulk Earth might lead to incorrect interpretations of the142Nd rock record to determine accretion and differentiation timescales of the Earth [12]. Likewise, taking theSi isotope composition of ordinary and carbonaceouschondrites  as  representative  for  the  bulk  Earth  maylead to wrong assumptions about the Earth's Mg/Si ratio and the amount of Si in Earth's core [13].If known chondrite types are not always good isotopic proxies  for  the planetary materials that  formedthe Earth,  are there any meteorites that are?  The ungrouped (paired) primitive achondrites NWA 5363 andNWA 5400  are  relatively  oxidized  (~IW-1),  metalbearing ultramafic stones with terrestrial O and Cr isotope  compositions  [14-16];  thus  they  may  representprimitive samples of the elusive terrestrial reservoir. Aspart of our ongoing effort to better constrain the isotopic composition of the bulk Earth and the genetic relations of  meteorites and the Earth-forming reservoirwe  present  here  a  comprehensive  petrographic,  elemental and multi-isotopic (O, Ca, Ti, Cr, Ni, Mo, Ru,W) study of the NWA 5363/NWA 5400 meteorites, aswell as isotope data for the chondrites Pillistfer (EL6),Allegan (H6) and Allende (CV3). Our results do notsupport the idea of a common reservoir for the NWA5363/NWA 5400 parent body and the Earth.Analytical  Methods:  About  3-5 gram pieces  ofthe meteorite samples were cleaned with grinding paper and ultrasonication in methanol, and subsequentlycrushed and powdered in an agate mortar at the Origins Lab. Aliquots of the powders were distributed tothe collaborators and digested and processed togetherwith a terrestrial  rock  standard (BHVO-2 or  DTS-2)according to previously established methods. Bulk major and trace element analysis were obtained throughSARM in  Nancy, France.  Oxygen  was  analyzed  bylaser-fluorination GC-Gas-MS in Göttingen, Ca and Crby TIMS at JPL and USTC, Ti, Ni, Mo, Ru and W byMC-ICP-MS in Chicago and Münster. Epoxy-mountedthick-sections of NWA 5363 and NWA 5400 were investigated by SEM at the Field Museum.Results:  Petrography. The texture of NWA 5363and NWA 5400 is granuloplastic with triple junctions.In both meteorites olivine (Fa30) is dominant (~80%)followed by Ca-poor pyroxene (En73Fs25Wo2), Ca-richpyroxene  (En45Fs10Wo45),  and  minor  chlorapatite,troilite,  chromite  (Cr/Cr+Al=82),  (oxidized)  FeNimetal grains  and traces  of plagioclase (Ab72An27Or1).Both meteorites  show significant  terrestrial  alteration(Fe-oxide  veins),  with  NWA 5363  being  better  preserved than NWA 5400. Major  and trace  elements. Relative to  chondriticabundances,  the  NWA  samples  are  depleted  inlithophile Al, Na, K, Ti, HFSEs and REEs, thus showing clear evidence for the extraction of a partial silicatemelt, consistent with the almost complete absence ofplagioclase. Molybdenum, W and the HSE on the otherhand show strong enrichments relative to chondrites.Elements tracing desert weathering like U and Ba aresignificantly  enriched  relative  to  chondrites,  withNWA 5400 showing the higher enrichments. Isotopic compositions: Oxygen.  The δ18O and Δ17O values of NWA 5363(5.7±0.7; -0.096±0.020; 2σ) and NWA 5400 (6.7±0.7;-0.139±0.032) are within uncertainty indistinguishablefrom the BHVO-2 (5.7± 0.7;  -0.088±0.032) and SanCarlos olivine (5.3±0.7; -0.102±0.012) standard measurements.  These  results  confirm  earlier  O  isotopemeasurements  that  found  no  Δ17O  anomalies  in  the2732.pdf

NWA 5363/NWA 5400 samples [15-17]. On a 1σ levelthe Δ17O values of NWA 5363 and NWA 5400 are distinct. This most likely reflects the effects of desert alteration on NWA 5400. Our measurement of Pillistferconfirms a  significant  (~50 ppm) difference  in  Δ17Obetween  enstatite  chondrites  and  the  Earth,  leavingNWA5363 as the only known meteorite with identicalΔ17O as the Earth.Calcium. Our data shows a common, and relativeto the Earth, slightly anomalous Ca isotope composition of NWA 5363 and NWA 5400 (ε48Ca = -0.55±0.22and -0.48±0.40). Titanium.  The  Ti  isotope  compositions  of  NWA5363 and NWA 5400 are within uncertainty identical(ε50Ti = -0.95±0.17 and -1.01±0.13) to each other, butsignificantly different from the Earth. Chromium. New Cr data will  be presented at  theconference. Shukulyukov et al. [16] reported a terrestrial ε54Cr of 0.07±0.11 for NWA 5400.Nickel. The Ni isotope compositions of NWA 5363and NWA 5400 are indistinguishable from each other(ε64Ni = 0.05±0.19 and 0.03±0.08) and within uncertainty identical to the terrestrial composition (ε64Ni=0).Molybdenum. NWA 5363  is  characterized  by  asmall deficit in s-process Mo (ε92Mo=0.53±0.22), similar to ordinary chondrites and possibly enstatite chondrites.Ruthenium. Like for Mo, the Ru isotope composition of NWA 5363 exhibits a s-process deficit (ε100Ru=-0.34±0.13) similar to ordinary chondrites. Tungsten. NWA 5363 and NWA 5400 exhibit identical  and  highly  unradiogenic  ε182W values  of  -3.26±0.08  and  -3.18±0.08.  Together  with  their  low180Hf/184W (0.02), this equates to a two-stage model ageof  Hf/W fractionation  from a chondritic  reservoir  of1.2±0.5 Ma after CAI.Discussion: Our new petrographic,  elemental andisotopic data confirm that NWA 5363 and NWA 5400are  paired  primitive  achondritic  meteorites  from  anearly-formed  relatively  oxidized  asteroidal  parentbody. The mineral assemblage is interpreted as representing a restite after partial melting and extraction ofa small amount of silicate melt from a fertile (chondritic) source rock within ~1.5 Myr of the start of thesolar  system.  The  high  concentrations  of  refractorysiderophile elements (Mo, W, HSE) in the restite requires  the presence of  metal  during  silicate melt  extraction and indicates the absence of a planetary-widemetal-silicate  fractionation  event  on  the  NWA 5363/NWA 5400 parent body. The O, Cr, and Ni isotopic compositions of NWA5363/NWA 5400 are indistinguishable from the terrestrial isotope abundances, suggesting a close genetic relationship between the nebular reservoirs from whichthe NWA parent body and the Earth accreted. In fact,the NWA 5363/NWA 5400 meteorites are currently theonly known extraterrestrial  materials  with  an O isotopic  composition  identical  to  the  bulk  Earth.  However, our new Ca, Ti, Mo and Ru isotope data also reveal significant differences between the isotopic makeup of NWA 5363/NWA 5400 and the Earth. Thus, although  the  NWA  5363/NWA  5400  meteorites  arehighly interesting samples of a unique partially differentiated asteroidal parent body, they are not samplingthe  terrestrial  planetary  reservoir  and  are  not  theRosetta stones to decipher the isotopic composition ofthe bulk Earth.References: [1] Allègre C.
