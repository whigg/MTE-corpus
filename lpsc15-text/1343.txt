Introduction:  Applying the method of phase-ratios to ground-based observations, we have found several  regions  displaying  anomalous  photometric  functions (photometric anomalies) [1,2] in the S-W portion of the lunar disk. In these areas we do not observe the typical  inverse correlation between albedo and steepness  of  the  brightness  phase  curve.  These  regions demonstrate too great a slope of the phase curve, which implies higher surface roughness. No abnormal thermal inertia, magnetic, chemical/mineral features are associated with the regions. We have suggested [1,2] these anomalies could result from bombardment of the lunar surface by a swarm of small impactors. We here  study a  photometrically anomalous area centered at 21.6S, 17.7W (40 km in size) and suggest an  alternative  interpretation  of  the anomaly.  We use images acquired  with the LROC WAC camera (near nadir observations). The spectral range of this camera (415...689 nm) allows us to estimate the chemical composition and surface roughness of this and neighboring areas. WAC seamless albedo and   mosaics:  To map the normal albedo and surface roughness of the studied area, we use all available images to find parameters of the phase function for each point of the scene. Building the seamless photometric mosaics is a difficult task [3], as  many  things  should  be  taken  into  account,  e.g., (1) variations of phase angle within one frame are 60°; (2) the surface is observed in different filters at different phase angles, and the difference for neighboring filters is 2.232º; and (3) the position of the same point of the surface in different filters differs due to the parallactic effect. To bring the diverse images to the same photometric conditions we use the following formula [2]: A(α, i, e) = An exp(-μα) D(α, i, e),                       (1) where A is the apparent albedo (radiance factor),  An is the diffuse albedo (the normal albedo, if the opposition effect is absent),  μ is the phase-curve slope, and  D is Akimov's disk function. We do not consider the opposition effect,  since the latitude of  the studied area  is rather large, near 22ºS. For each point of the lunar surface, the parameters An and  μ are calculated using the least-square method for several tens (up to 50) of source WAC images at the required wavelengths. Resulting maps are presented in Figs. 1 and 2 in the cylindrical equiangular projection with a  resolution of 0.004°  per  pixel  (~120 m). The Library of Planetary Cartography [4] is used for calculations  of  the  selenographic  coordinates  for source WAC images represented at tilted perspective projection. This allows calculation of photometric angles,  taking  into  account  parallax  and  local  surface slope.  The  large,  light-colored  spot  in  the  center  of Fig. 2  (outlined) clearly  confirms  the  existence  of  a photometric anomaly found in [1]. On the other hand, the  anomaly area  is  not  found  on  topography maps (Fig. 3)  [5].  Moreover,  on  high-resolution  images (~1 m/pix) from LROC NAC camera, the boundary of the anomaly is not detected at all. Photometric reduction of the WAC data:  Several algorithms for the assessment of the chemical/mineral composition of the lunar soils require representation of photometric data in the LSCC [6] standard. The radiometric calibration of LSCC and, hence, Clementine data are significantly different from other calibrations [see, e.g., 2]. We use Eq. (1) to calculate An(415 nm) and  An(750  nm) at  α =  30°.  Then the  obtained An(415 nm) and An(750 nm) values we multiply by empirical  coefficients  1.723  and  1.345,  respectively,  to take into account the difference of radiometric calibration of the Clementine UVVIS and WAC VIS data. Note for obtaining the albedo at 750 nm, we use maps of linear regression coefficients for An(λ) and μ(λ) constructed using 5 WAC VIS filters. Estimating TiO2 abundance:  We exploit Lucey's approach [7].  Using the corrected  WAC  An(415 nm) and  An(750 nm) images, we calculate the TiO2 abundance with the following equation [7]:    (2) The map calculated with Eq. (2) is shown in Fig. 4. As one can see, low concentrations of titanium dioxide are in the anomaly area.  The values are more typical for highlands than for maria.  Discussion:  We have proposed that similar photometric  anomalies  could  result  from bombardment  of the lunar surface by a swarm of small meteoroids [1,2]. For anomalies with diffuse boundaries this may be true, but in Fig. 2 one can see sharp borders. Moreover, this anomaly also is distinct in titanium abundance. Thus, in 5.98 415 750 2750 ( / ) 0.42(%) 3.71 arctan A ATiO Aì üé ù-ï ï= í ýê ú ï ïë ûî þ   this case we deal with a structure and composition feature that does not relate to a swarm impact. We may suggest that this area is a shallow flooding of  an  elevated  formation  of  highland  composition, which is  partially  denuded  by meteoroid  impacts.  A mixture of mare and highland materials can explain the composition difference  between the area  and its  surroundings,  since  the  highland  material  has  low TiO2 abundance. We attribute the higher surface roughness to the fact that the highland material extracted by impacts may include rocks and fragments with sizes that are smaller than 1 m. Conclusions:  The structure and composition feature can be related to a shallow flooding of an elevated highland area partially denuded by impacts and to stirring of the highland and mare material at the formation of the regolith layer. Anomalous behavior of the phase function may be explained by the difference of surface structure in the area and surrounding regions on the scale of less than 1 m,  imperceptible  in  the  camera  image  LROC NAC. This may be due to the presence in the regolith of excavated rocks and their fragments from the highland material background. References: [1] Shkuratov  et  al  (2010)  Icarus, 208, 20-30.
