In these areas we do not observe thetypical  inverse correlation between albedo and steepness  of  the  brightness  phase  curve.  These  regionsdemonstrate too great a slope of the phase curve, whichimplies higher surface roughness. No abnormal thermalinertia, magnetic, chemical/mineral features are associated with the regions. We have suggested [1,2] theseanomalies could result from bombardment of the lunarsurface by a swarm of small impactors. We here  study a  photometrically anomalous areacentered at 21.6S, 17.7W (40 km in size) and suggestan  alternative  interpretation  of  the anomaly.  We useimages acquired  with the LROC WAC camera (nearnadir observations). The spectral range of this camera(415...689 nm) allows us to estimate the chemical composition and surface roughness of this and neighboringareas. WAC seamless albedo and   mosaics:  To mapthe normal albedo and surface roughness of the studiedarea, we use all available images to find parameters ofthe phase function for each point of the scene. Buildingthe seamless photometric mosaics is a difficult task [3],as  many  things  should  be  taken  into  account,  e.g.,(1) variations of phase angle within one frame are 60°;(2) the surface is observed in different filters at different phase angles, and the difference for neighboring filters is 2.232º; and (3) the position of the same point ofthe surface in different filters differs due to the parallactic effect. To bring the diverse images to the samephotometric conditions we use the following formula[2]:A(α, i, e) = An exp(-μα) D(α, i, e),                       (1)where A is the apparent albedo (radiance factor),  An isthe diffuse albedo (the normal albedo, if the oppositioneffect is absent),  μ is the phase-curve slope, and  D isAkimov's disk function. We do not consider the opposition effect,  since the latitude of  the studied area  israther large, near 22ºS. For each point of the lunar surface, the parametersAn and  μ are calculated using the least-square methodfor several tens (up to 50) of source WAC images atthe required wavelengths. Resulting maps are presentedin Figs. 1 and 2 in the cylindrical equiangular projection with a  resolution of 0.004°  per  pixel  (~120 m).The Library of Planetary Cartography [4] is used forcalculations  of  the  selenographic  coordinates  forsource WAC images represented at tilted perspectiveprojection. This allows calculation of photometric angles,  taking  into  account  parallax  and  local  surfaceslope.  The  large,  light-colored  spot  in  the  center  ofFig. 2  (outlined) clearly  confirms  the  existence  of  aphotometric anomaly found in [1]. On the other hand,the  anomaly area  is  not  found  on  topography maps(Fig. 3)  [5].  Moreover,  on  high-resolution  images(~1 m/pix) from LROC NAC camera, the boundary ofthe anomaly is not detected at all. Photometric reduction of the WAC data:  Several algorithms for the assessment of the chemical/mineral composition of the lunar soils require representation of photometric data in the LSCC [6] standard. Theradiometric calibration of LSCC and, hence, Clementine data are significantly different from other calibrations [see, e.g., 2]. We use Eq. (1) to calculate An(415nm) and  An(750  nm) at  α =  30°.  Then the  obtainedAn(415 nm) and An(750 nm) values we multiply by empirical  coefficients  1.723  and  1.345,  respectively,  totake into account the difference of radiometric calibration of the Clementine UVVIS and WAC VIS data. Note for obtaining the albedo at 750 nm, we usemaps of linear regression coefficients for An(λ) and μ(λ)constructed using 5 WAC VIS filters.Estimating TiO2 abundance:  We exploit Lucey'sapproach [7].  Using the corrected  WAC  An(415 nm)and  An(750 nm) images, we calculate the TiO2 abundance with the following equation [7]:    (2)The map calculated with Eq. (2) is shown in Fig. 4. Asone can see, low concentrations of titanium dioxide arein the anomaly area.  The values are more typical forhighlands than for maria.  Discussion:  We have proposed that similar photometric  anomalies  could  result  from bombardment  ofthe lunar surface by a swarm of small meteoroids [1,2].For anomalies with diffuse boundaries this may be true,but in Fig. 2 one can see sharp borders. Moreover, thisanomaly also is distinct in titanium abundance. Thus, in5.98415 7502750( / ) 0.42(%) 3.71 arctan A ATiOAì üé ù-ï ï= í ýê úï ïë ûî þ1343.pdf

this case we deal with a structure and composition feature that does not relate to a swarm impact. We may suggest that this area is a shallow floodingof  an  elevated  formation  of  highland  composition,which is  partially  denuded  by meteoroid  impacts.  Amixture of mare and highland materials can explain thecomposition difference  between the area  and its  surroundings,  since  the  highland  material  has  low TiO2abundance. We attribute the higher surface roughnessto the fact that the highland material extracted by impacts may include rocks and fragments with sizes thatare smaller than 1 m. Conclusions:  The structure and composition feature can be related to a shallow flooding of an elevatedhighland area partially denuded by impacts and to stirring of the highland and mare material at the formationof the regolith layer. Anomalous behavior of the phase function may beexplained by the difference of surface structure in thearea and surrounding regions on the scale of less than 1m,  imperceptible  in  the  camera  image  LROC NAC.This may be due to the presence in the regolith of excavated rocks and their fragments from the highland material background.
