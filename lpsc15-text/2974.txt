UNEQUILIBRATED SPINELS IN STARDUST TRACK C2062,2,162 (CECIL). Zack Gainsforth1, Anna Butterworth1, Andrew J. Westphal1 , 1 Space Sciences Laboratory, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley CA 94720, USA, .IntroductionSpinels found in comet Wild 2 samples returned by theStardust mission have multiple formation pathways. In type IIchondrule objects, spinels can crystallize from liquidus and canbe found embedded within other olivines or as standalone crystallites in the chondrule [1, 2]. On the other hand, magnetitesin Track 80 probably formed via an aqueous pathway[4]. Magnesiospinel is also thought to form via a condensation pathway(e.g. [5]). While most condensation calculations do not predict Fe-, Cr-rich spinels, they occur nevertheless as presolargrains[7] suggesting that a condensation pathway for Fe-, Crrich spinel exists.Because many spinels in unequilibrated assemblages donot have clear relationships to the phases around them, petrographic work becomes difficult or impossible in many cases.Therefore, understanding their history requires obtaining allthe necessary information from the crystal itself. Luckily,spinel is especially well suited to this since it contains multiplecrystalline sites which can accommodate Ti, V, and Fe in multiple oxidation states. Because of this, spinel can be a sensitiveindicator of oxygen fugacity over a range of more than 15 logunits[9], and can even record changing fugacities during theformation/alteration of a single grain[8].However, in Stardust, the spinels are nm in size, requiring quantitative analysis to be done largely with TransmissionElectron Microscopy (TEM) and soft X-ray techniques. Whilehard X-ray barometers have been used for some time on meteoritic materials, the same calibrations do not translate directlyto soft X-ray or TEM. Therefore, we are still in the early daysof characterizing nano-spinels from Stardust as we simultaneously acquire measurements and develop progressively morerobust calibrations to understand the measurements. Here weshow progress in analyzing oxidation state and site occupancyof cations in Stardust nano-spinels.ExperimentalCecil is a terminal particle from Stardust track C2062,2,162which was embedded in epoxy and ultramicrotomed onto TEMgrids. TEM analysis was done at the National Center for Electron Microscopy at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratoryusing an FEI Titan TEM at 80 keV with a 0.6 sr EDS detector, and a Zeiss Libra 200 MC at 200 keV with an in-columnOmega energy filter for imaging and diffraction. EDS mapping was done at about 30 kcps for two hours to acquire a stackwith 2.3·108 counts.Atom Location by Channeling Enhanced Microanalysis(ALCHEMI) is a technique for isolating the crystallographicsites for atoms[11]. It can be used, for instance, to differentiatebetween the octahedral and tetrahedral sites in spinel, andworks by causing the electron wave in a TEM to constructivelyor destructively interfere on specific crystallographic sites bycarefully tilting the electron beam or sample. We acquired2D ALCHEMI near the spinel 111 zone axis by tilting thebeam axis and acquiring a twenty second EDS spectrum ateach beam tilt from -3 to +3 nm−1 on two orthogonal tilt axes.The number of counts in each peak of each spectrum was fitusing a Python script and used to generate ratio images suchas shown in Fig. 2. The patterns can be used to statisticallyquantify site occupancy of the various cations[10].The ultramicrotomed slices were also imaged using Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscopy (STXM) at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) in Berkeley, CA to acquire Fe-Land Ti-L edge XANES. Fe3+/∑Fe was computed using thecalibration of van Aken[6], though it is known that crystallographic effects can lead to large errors. For example, Fig.2c of van Aken[6] shows spectra for two spinels, both withFe3+/∑Fe = 2/3, yet with different XANES. We note thatwhile a better calibration is needed, in the standards we haveinvestigated, the van Aken calibration has always worked withan accuracy better than 30%. We did not attempt to quantifythe Ti oxidation state since existing calibrations did not givecorrect results on a chromite standard.ObservationsCecil is an unequilibrated assemblage containing a likelyigneous object alongside primitive, possibly nebular nanosulfides[3], olivines, pyroxenes and spinels embedded in aglassy matrix. The spinels are mostly <= 200 nm in size andvaried in composition.One spinel was embedded in SiO2-rich material, 200 nmin diameter and comprised several euhedral grains orientedwithin a few degrees of each other based on electron diffraction. TEM/EDS shows an average composition in oxide wt %of TiO2 = 3.52, Al2O3=18.08, Cr2O3 = 40.25, V2O3 = 1.37,FeO = 31.33, MgO = 4.38, MnO = 0.79. However, the crystalis highly inhomogenous. In Fig. 1, the blue band correspondsto a Ti-, Fe-, Cr-rich, Al-poor region with composition in oxidewt % of TiO2 = 4.64, Al2O3=11.97, Cr2O3 = 43.43, V2O3 =1.54, FeO = 33.46, MgO = 3.79, MnO = 0.83.

of TiO2 = 2.46, Al2O3=21.06, Cr2O3 = 39.38, V2O3 = 1.20,FeO = 30.04, MgO = 5.10, MnO = 0.70. Notice that the Tiand Al contents vary by almost a factor of two. From Fe-Ledge XANES, we estimate Fe3+/∑Fe < 8%, consistent withno Fe3+.A second spinel was 50 nm in diameter and single crystalline, possibly associated with sulfide, Fig. 2. TEM/EDSgives a composition in oxide wt % of TiO2 = 1.14, Al2O3=37.14,Cr2O3 = 17.02, FeO = 12.79, MgO = 30.99, ZnO = 0.92. Notice that the composition is dramatically different than theprevious spinel. We acquired an ALCHEMI stack along the111 zone of the spinel, shown in Fig. 2. The O/Ti and O/Crmaps show a similar pattern with the highest cation detectionat (-3, -3) nm−1 beam tilt, and the lowest cation detection at(0, +3) nm−1 beam tilt. The Ti image is noisier than the Crimage as a consequence of the low concentration of Ti in thesample (≈1 ox wt % TiO2). Thus, while it is not possiblefrom this stack to assign an accurate site occupancy for the Ti,it is clear that at least some of the Ti occupies the same siteas the Cr. This is actually not expected; usual stoichiometrycalculations place all Ti as Ti4+ in the octahedral site and theCr3+ in the tetrahedral site. Fig. 2 also shows an O/Mg image.While the Mg concentration is lower than Cr, and therefore theimage is noisier, it still shows a statistically significant difference from the O/Cr image with the lowest Mg detection at(-3, -3) nm−1 beam tilt, which shows the highest Ti and Crdetection. Therefore, the Mg occupies a different site from theCr as is expected. For comparison, a zoomin of the Ti, Cr andFe peaks for the spectra acquired at (-3, -3) and (0, +3) nm−1are shown and demonstrate a 2X difference in the detection forthe three cations. The spectra are normalized to the oxygenpeak (not shown). Al has a similar crystallographic orientation to Cr, while Fe shows a slightly different dependence thaneither Mg or Cr alone (not shown). Fe likely occupies multipleFigure 2: ALCHEMI tilt images giving oxygen/cation countratios for Ti (A), Cr (B) and Mg (C).

The tilt positions are shown in theO/Mg image (C).crystallographic sites.Discussion and Future WorkIt is too early to make meaningful conclusions about whatthese spinels are telling us about comet Wild 2 and early solarformation processes. However, the variation in compositionbetween and within spinels in Cecil demonstrate at least thatit is highly unequilibrated.The spinel shown in Fig. 1 is poor in Mg, but rich in Cr,Fe and Al. It is contains multiple domains containing Ti andAl concentrations varying by a factor of two. It is plausiblethat the Cecil grain formed from a high fugacity nebular condensation/alteration process. However, the low Fe3+ contentmeasured by XANES suggests a negligible magnetite component and probably restricts the oxygen fugacity below theFMQ buffer. A better restriction on the oxygen fugacity shouldbe possible when an accurate Ti-L edge barometer becomesavailable.Fig. 2 shows a spinel with a drastically different composition and which is found in association with a sulfide, thoughit is hard to make a conclusive link because of the process ofultramicrotomy. The different chemical composition suggestsa different formation mechanism from the first spinel, or atleast demonstrates different conditions during formation. Understanding the affinity of Ti to the Cr crystallographic site inthe spinel measured by ALCHEMI is important since the current Ti-oxidation measurement methods are dependent on thecrystallographic symmetries around the Ti atom. Therefore,this study demonstrates that quantitative analysis of Ti-L edgespectra from Stardust grains will also require an independentmeasurement of the Ti site occupancy (such as using ALCHEMI). Likely, this restriction generalizes to all nano-phasespinels in astromaterials unless their formation environment isalready demonstrated to be in a calibrated regime (e.g. igneousspinels in achondrites). In the future, it may be possible to determine both the crystallographic site and the oxidation statefrom Ti-L edge XANES, but only after clean XANES spectrafrom each oxidation/crystallographic symmetry combinationhave been independently determined.AcknowledgmentsThe ALS and NCEM are supported by the Director, Officeof Energy Research, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences Division of the U.S. Department of Energy, underContract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231.References[1] Joswiak, D., et al., (2012) Meteoritics & Planet.
