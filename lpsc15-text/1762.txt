Introduction: We report the classification of a large number of well-preserved cosmic spherules (melted micrometeorites) extracted from the finegrained granitic-gneissic detritus collected in December 2012 at the top of the Widerøefjellet Mountain (2750 m a.s.l.) in East Antarctica (Fig.1). This material was recently reported to derive from a new micrometeorite accumulation trap [1].   Samples: A total of 1.6 kg of sediment was defrosted at the Belgian Antarctic research Station during the field expedition. It was then processed by washing and sieving to separate the following six size fractions: < 125 μm, 125-200 μm, 200-400 μm, 400-800 μm, 800-2000 μm, and > 2000 μm. A total of 1361 cosmic spherules with excellent preservation (< 10 % show surface alteration products such us jarosite) were handpicked using a Stereo Microscope. All of the subtypes described by [2] have been identified amongst the cosmic spherules recovered so far (Fig.2).   Bulk chemistry: The cosmic origin of the spherules was confirmed and these were classified on the basis of their surface chemical composition. Standardless analyses of scanned areas of variable sizes were performed on the surfaces of the cosmic spherules with an Analytical SEM JEOL JSM-300 or a FE-SEM JEOL JSM-7000F both equipped with an Electron Dispersive System (EDS) (Table 1).  Results: In total, 406 melted micrometeorites were identified in the 125-200 μm size fraction, 828 in the 200-400 μm fraction, and 127 in the 400-800 μm fraction. No cosmic spherules were found in the 8002000 μm and > 2000 μm fractions. This observation is in contradiction with the results of [3]. The smallest size fraction (< 125 μm) will additionally be separated magnetically as the extremely small size of the grains does not easily permit the identification of micrometeorites under the stereo microscope. Preliminary study of this magnetic fraction has revealed the presence of potential unmelted micrometeorites although their identification is made difficult due to abundant black, angular, Fe-rich terrestrial grains of the metatonalitic host rock (mainly biotite). Our results (Fig.3) indicate that 39% of the extracted cosmic spherules are barredolivine (BO-type), 28% crypto-crystalline (C-type), 17% glassy (V-type), 10% porphyritic-olivine (POtype), 5% iron (I-Type), and finally 1% G-Type cosmic spherules. An interesting feature emphasized by SEM imaging is that a small proportion of the spherules exhibits a Fe-Ni metal bead at one end almost exiting the spherule, whilst other spherules show one or more sub-spherical void(s) likely due to the loss of the metal bead during atmospheric entry. The metal beads for the spherules characterized so far are usually 50-100µm in size. Statistically, 7% of the BO-type spherules contain a metal bead, 18% for C-type, 8% for V-type, and 6% for PO-type. No metal beads were observed in G-type spherules. A new micrometeorite collection: The finding of such a high abundance of cosmic spherules at the Widerøefjellet site places it together with other welldocumented Antarctic accumulation traps such as the Transantarctic Mountains (TAM; [3]), the Cap Prudhomme (CP; [4]), the South Pole Water Well (SPWW; [5]), and the CONCORDIA [6] collection.

Our research goals are to keep on extracting microparticles from the remainder of the sediment to implement the Sør Rondane Mountains collection and to chemically investigate the internal structure of selected polished cosmic spherules in order to obtain useful insights about their formation. Moreover, chemical investigation of the metal beads is also planned.  References: [1] Huber M. S. et al. (2014) LPSC XLV #2108. [2] Genge et al. (2008) Meteoritics and Planet. Sci., 43, 497-515.
