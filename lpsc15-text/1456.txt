PETROGRAPHICAL AND MINERALOGICAL DIVERSITY BETWEEN FRESH AND IMPACTMELTED DOMAINS OF OLIVINE-PHYRIC SHERGOTTITE TISSINT. A. Basu Sarbadhikari; PLANEX, Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad 380009, India (amitbs@prl.res.in)  Introduction:  Martian meteorite Tissint, an olivine-phyric shergottite, suffered a prolonged and intense history of impact melting and subsequent recrystallization, forming high-pressure neomineralization [1-4] and possible chemical diversity within dominant phases. In this study, we report the chemical variation of the dominant mineral phases, e.g., olivine, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, maskelynite between fresh and impact-melted domains, as these variations are quite significant compared to the other Martian meteorites.  Petrography and Major Element Composition: Shock features are pervasive in both the studied grains. Megacrystic olivine, pyroxenes and chromite grains are pervaded by fractures. Plagioclase grains have been completely converted into maskelynite. In some portion obscured grain boundaries are observed, giving rise to patchy appearance of the constituent minerals. Shock-induced melt pockets are present as patches with obscured grain boundaries. Interestingly, planar deformation or lineations were observed in the olivine grains from fresh domains (Fig. 1a).  The cores of all megacrystic olivines are strained, similar to the lattice strain described by [5] and these cores also contain micron- to submicron-sized exsolution of chromite. These micron- to submicron-sized chromites are not observed in the olivines of the impact-melt domains (Fig. 1b). A few olivine phenocrysts of Tissint in this study preserve a primary magmatic grain boundary (Fig. 1a). Similar observation was made from another olivinephyric shergottite, LAR 06319 [6]. The primary magmatic grain boundary separates the inner core and mantle of olivine (Fo80-50), containing micron to submicron chromite inclusions, to the outer inclusion free Fe-rich (Fo50-45) rim. Analyses of major-element compositions of the mineral phases were conducted using a Cameca SX100 electron microprobe at the Physical Research Laboratory. Total range of olivine compositions is Fo80–18, similar to that observed in earlier studies [1,7]. The Fe-rich olivines are lowest in magnesian number (Fo18) than the other olivine-phyric and lherzolitic shergottites (Fig. 2a) and are observed in shockinduced melt domains. The most Fe-rich olivines, which occur in impact-melt domains and at the rim of the phenocrystic olivine, range in composition of Fo5018. Pyroxenes become increasingly Fe-rich from core to rim, in general, where Mg-rich orthopyroxene (Wo5.8En70, Mg# 74), pigeonite (Wo9En66, Mg# 71) and augite (Wo21En55, Mg# 70) tend to become Fe-rich pigeonite (Wo15-19En39, Mg# 48) and augite (Wo2136En23-56, Mg# 29-50). Similar to the Fe-rich olivines, most Fe-bearing pyroxenes (mostly augitic) occur in the impact-melt domains with a range between Mg# 50-29. Plots of molar Ti versus Al demonstrate that the pyroxenes crystallized over an extended temperature interval, and are mostly plotted along the 1/8 ratio line, while others have higher Ti-Al ratio (Fig. 2b). Some of the intermediate to late-stage pigeonite and augite     Fig. 1: BSE images of olivines from fresh (a) and impact-melt (b) domains.

grains or part of them from the impact-melt domains have significant amount of VIAl (0.020 – 0.055 p.f.u.). On the other hand, pyroxenes from fresh domains, away from the impact-induced portions, are either devoid of or having very little VIAl in their stoichiometry.   Discussion:  The reason for the presence of micron- to submicron-sized chromite inclusions in the olivines is unclear but that has previously been attributed to conversion of Fe2+ to Fe3+ by structural H (e.g., [8]) or by the change from Fe2+ to Fe–Ni metal [5]; all by shock effects in other Martian meteorites (e.g., LAR 06319: [9]). Absence of the micron- to submicron-sized chromite inclusions in the impactmelt domain olivines indicates the following possibilities: 1) two-stage shock events, in which the first one was less-pervasive compared to the latter event, and formed the deformational patterns within the olivine megacrysts, without any change of chemical composition. The second event was localized and melted the significant portion (30-40 vol%) of Tissint bulk, and that re-crystallized Fe-rich end members of the most dominant phases. 2) There was heterogeneous distribution of a severe impact pulse, forming features of planar deformation to melting in Tissint, as also proposed by [10]. Whatever be the case, the impact melting could have converted the partially melted domain relatively more Fe-rich compared to the host sample. The partial melting perhaps taken into account the contribution of the numerous micron to submicron chromite inclusions of olivine, which re-crystallized more Fe-rich olivine and pyroxene. The Fe-rich rim of the olivine, which consists of a primary magmatic boundary, is not in equilibrium with the Tissint bulk at any stage of crystallization. Although at this stage we cannot predict the formation process of this magmatic boundary, it appears to have re-crystallized as an overgrowth from the impact-induced partial melt. Low amount of VIAl in the pyroxenes of the fresh domains indicates a relatively slow cooling rate (<0.5oC/hr), while the higher VIAl content in most of the Fe-rich pyroxenes of the impact-melt domains indicates much faster cooling rate (in the order of ~ 60150oC/h). Higher Al-content and the presence of VIAl in the pyroxenes are perhaps contributed from the maskelynites of the impact-melt domains. Conclusions: Tissint represents partially remelted and subsequently re-crystallized basaltic material of impact source regions of the shergottites from Mars. Further study can ensure detailed understanding of the impact-induced melting and related neo-mineralization of the Martian crustal materials, in general.
