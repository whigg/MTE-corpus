Both the radars are sending circular polarized signal and receiving Linear horizontal and linear vertical polarization. Scientists believe that CPR>1 shows presence of water ice but Arecibo observatory created a controversy that high value of CPR may be due to either roughness or presence of water ice. Thus in this paper, along with CPR other polarization parameters like DoP, relative phase between LH-LV components are used to distinguish icy radar signatures from that of non-icy region. Results show that some craters near the poles contain material with high RF backscatter, which are known as high ratios of circular polarization. These anomalous craters, which have permanently dark floors show high CPR in their interiors and low CPR at outer rim. These results are consistent with the presence of pure water ice inside the crater up. In this paper, the total amount of water ice has been estimated using Chandrayaan-1 Mini-SAR and LRO Mini-RF data. In future, this work can be expanded by covering nature, distribution and concentration of water ice at lunar poles.   Introduction: Chandrayaan-1 Mini-SAR and LRO Mini-RF are the first two radars which orbited Lunar Surface in 2008 and 2009 respectively. Chandryaan-1 Mini-SAR has mapped 90% of lunar poles during its operational phase. LRO Mini-RF is still operational and  mapping complete lunar surface. The focus of this paper is to quantify the presence of water ice in permanently shadowed region (PSR) over lunar surface using these two radar datasets. Lunar South Pole is of special interest to scientists because of the postulation that there is a presence of water ice in permanently shadowed regions of this pole. These PSR remain shadowed for longer duration as compared PSR of Lunar North Pole.   Mosaicking [1,2] of Radar Datasets: It is an art of combining multiple images into a single composite image. It can be used to combine pixel-based images for publication or map composition, or as a means for combining georeferenced images into an image covering a larger geographical area. Data strips obtained from Chandrayaan-1 Mini-SAR and LRO Mini-RF are mosaicked together to obtain complete  maps of lunar poles. The incidence angle of Mini-SAR Mini-RF mosaics are 35° and 51˚ respectively. The Mini-RF mosaic is prepared at ICRS using software tools. Figure 1 illustrates mosaic of (a) Mini-SAR (b) Mini-RF at a resolution of 60m/pixel                                                                                 Methodology: Necessary conditions for detection of water ice over lunar poles using Chandrayaan-1 Mini-SAR and LRO Mini-RF are explained below. The conditions for water ice availability are [3] a) CPR values>1  b) Low values of Backscattered Coefficients and c) Volume Scattering should lie between 0 to 80 or 100 to 180.                  Figure 2: Methodology adopted for calculating the water ice using Chandrayaan-1 MiniSAR and LRO Mini-RF  CPR values>1 : CPR is used in this present study to find the evidence of subsurface scattering which is due to in-homogeneity  in dielectric properties of subsurface due to the presence of water-ice. Volumetric water-ice reflections are known to have CPR greater than unity, while surface scattering from dry regolith has CPR less than unity [4] .

Low values of Backscattered Coefficient [3] :  Few craters in polar regions have been analyzed to observe  CPR variation within or outside regions of these craters. There are some regions outside of craters which show low values of CPR, higher values of m and average values of δ. Observed values of δ are close to -90° suggesting scattering from rough surface of lunar regolith. The values of stokes parameters over impact ejecta are showing low CPR with high m values and intermediate values of δ. These ranges of CPR, m & δ are indicating contributions from both rough surface and double-bounce scattering. The impact ejecta are also characterized by very high radar intensities. Since high values of scattering coefficient represent scattering from rocky surface and ejecta deposits. Thus areas with low values of backscattering coefficient i.e. less than -16 dB, are considered as possible sites for water-ice detection. Elevated CPR values due to surface roughness are eliminated by considering moderate rough surface for water ice detection.   Volume and Double bounce Scattering [3] : Apart from CPR, parameters like degree of polarization (m) and relative LH-LV phase (δ) are also important to study the scattering mechanisms associated with lunar regolith. The m-χ together indicate the type of scattering mechanism associated with the target as δ values close to -90° and +90° indicates „surface‟ and „double-bounce‟ scatterings respectively, and all other values of δ indicate „diffused‟ scattering mechanism.  Results: Water ice detection methodology has been implemented over Chandrayaan-1 Mini-SAR and LRO Mini-RF mosaics of Lunar north and south poles with total polar coverage between 70°-90°  latitude. For this purpose, three important polarization parameters which have been discussed earlier have been calculated from stokes parameters. In figure 3(a) & (b) we can see the pixel satisfying the methodology conditions for detection of water ice. The purple color in the mosaics shows the presence of the water ice over lunar poles using the data of Chandrayaan-1 Mini-SAR and LRO Mini-RF. Total area covered for water ice detection using Chandrayaan-1 Mini-SAR and LRO Mini-RF is summarized in table 1.                                      Table:1 Total area coverage of water ice using Chandrayaan-1 Mini-SAR and LRO MiniRF over lunar poles with coverage between 70°-90°  latitude.  Conclusion: Total coverage of PSR with water ice possibility is 14173.52 Km 2 in north pole and  16703.83 Km 2 in south pole according to LOLA PSR maps.  The areas estimated by Water ice detection methodology in Mini-SAR data are 27.52 km 2 in North Polar Region and 19.10 Km2 in South Polar region. The areas estimated by Water ice detection methodology using Mini-RF datasets are  1814.91 km 2 in North Pole and 661.53 km 2 in South Pole. This large variation for water ice over Lunar Poles may be due to the area covered by both the SAR. Mini-SAR has not covered many known craters such as Shackleton, Faustini and many shadowed area in South Pole and many shadowed area in North Pole. While Mini-RF is continuously mapping Lunar Poles till date and the areas which were not covered by Mini-SAR are covered by Mini-RF. Many unknown facts and discoveries can be revealed by Mini-RF datasets with better accuracy.  References: [1] Isis 3 Lecture Steven Lambright (Tammy Becker), USGS Astrology Science Centre.
