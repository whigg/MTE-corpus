Most  of  the  work  thus  far  has  been  fromground-based optical surveys such as the Catalina SkySurvey and LINEAR.  These surveys have found over90% objects down to a 1 km diameter and have shownall known objects do not pose any significant impactthreat.   Smaller  objects  are  correspondingly  smallerthreats but there are more of them and fewer of themhave so far been discovered.  The next generation ofsurveys will extend their reach down to much smallersizes.  From an impact risk perspective, those objectsas small as 30-40m are still of interest (similar in sizeto the Tunguska bolide).  Smaller objects than this arelargely of interest from a space resource or in situ analysis efforts.A recent  mission concept  promoted  by the  B612Foundation  and  Ball  Aerospace  calls  for  an  infraredsurvey telescope in a  Venus-like orbit,  known as  theSentinel Mission[4].  This wide-field facility has beendesigned to complete the inventory down to a 140 mdiameter  while  also  providing  substantial  constraintson the NEO population down to a Tunguska-sized object.   We have recently developed a suite of tools toprovide survey modeling for this class of survey telescope.  The purpose of the tool is to uncover hiddencomplexities that govern mission design and operationwhile also working to quantitatively understand the orbit quality provided on its catalog of objects withoutadditional followup assets.Baseline  Mission:  The  baseline  mission  designcalls for a 6.5 year survey lifetime and is modeled hereat 100% of the time used for surveying.  The heliocentric orbital elements for the spacecraft are  a=0.66AU,e=0.091,  i=0.27°,  =162°,  =90°,  M=12°,Epoch=2018-07-15 5:00 TDB.  The angular elementswere arbitrary choices.  This orbit is achieved using aVenus gravity assist that lowers the aphelion distance.The telescope can be pointed at any location in thesky where the angle to  the Sun is  greater  than 80°.The camera has a field-of-view of 11 square degreeswith a filling factor of 96%.  The image scale is 2.15arcsec/pixel.  The detectors are sensitive from 5 to 10.2micrometers.  The integration time per pointing is 180seconds.  With this camera, it takes 7 days to cover theavailable sky.The  survey  reference  design  calls  for  4  distinctpointings to each location in the sky during a singlepass through the available sky.  The 4 observations fora given location will be spread over 48 hours.  Eachobject could thus be seen every 28 days with this cadence.  This sequence of four observations is continuously repleated for the available sky.Survey Model: This survey model is a statisticallybased tool for establishing completeness as a functionof object size and survey duration.  Effects modeled include the ability to adjust the field-of-regard (includesall pointing restrictions), field-of-view, focal plane array fill factor, and the observatory orbit.  Consequencestracked  include  time-tagged  detection  times  fromwhich orbit  quality can be derived and efficiency bydynamical class.  The dominant noise term in the simulations comes from the noise in the background fluxcaused by thermal emission from zodiacal dust.  Themodel  used  is  sufficient  for  the  study of  reasonablylow-inclination spacecraft orbits such as are being considered.  Results to date are based on the 2002 BottkeNEA orbit distribution model[1] and a recent size distribution[2].  The system can work with any orbit distribution model and with any size-frequency distribution.  This tool also serves to quantify the amount ofdata that will also be collected on main-belt objects bysimply testing against the known catalog of bodies.The model uses a simple estimation of the thermalflux that mimics an average over all possible rotationpole  positions.   Effects  of  solar  phase  angle  are  included.   A uniform albedo  of  10%  was  used.   Thesource flux is thus only a function of geometry and target size.  The source flux is further reduced if the targetis moving rapidly.  The detection process requires a 5sigma excess in signal in a 2-pixel diameter detectionkernel.  Objects moving slower than 0.57 degrees/daywill  no incur  any trailing losses.   An object  movingtwice this rate will appear to be half as bright in the detection kernel.The  dominant  noise  source  is  background  signalfrom the zodiacal dust.  A simplified dust distributionwas used  with line-of-sight integration of the thermalemission from the dust where the dust is assumed to bein  thermal  equilibrium at  each  point.   The  detectornoise is included but is unimportant in comparison.Orbit Estimation: In addition to studying the detection characteristics of the survey, we analyzed synthetic astrometry for NEOs to assess the quality of the1656.pdf

orbit that can be expected.  These results clearly showthe benefit of a self-followup survey such as Sentinel.Most objects discovered will be seen in multiple observing epochs and the resulting orbits will precludelosing track of them for many decades to come.  All ofthe ephemeris calculations,  including investigation oforbit determination quality, are done with the OpenOrbsoftware package[5].To illustrate the orbit quality versus number of observations,  consider  a  representative  object.   At  anygiven point in the survey one can take the given observations and estimate the error on some future position.The error at the time of the next observation can givesome insight on the challenge of linking to the new observations.  Within a single observing cycle there is aneed to  connect two pairs  that  will be  2 days  apart.The first pair has an arc-length of 1 hour that can beused to estimate its future position.  At 2 days, the positional  error  is 3-4 arc-minutes.  Using motion vectorand orbital motion constraints this is an easy linkage tomake.  Given the first set one now has a 2-day arc andcan then predict the position 26 days later for the nextopportunity.  At this linkage step, the positional error isthe largest in the process and is 2-3 degrees.  However,it is still a reasonable linkage problem if all constraintsare  used.   At  this  point,  with  two  observing  cycleslinked the object is considered to be found.   An objectin this category will be easy to find again even thoughthe orbital elements are somewhat uncertain.  This is agood enough determination that the error ellipse nearlycollapses down to a line-of-variations and has a 10 arcminute uncertainty after 1 year.Getting  just  one  more  observing  cycle  makes  ahuge difference in the determined orbit  quality.   Theworst case is if the only other recovery is in the nextcycle and you have a 58 day arc.  In this case, the positional uncertainty is well under an arc-minute after 10years.  Based on these results, the survey discovery results were tabulated on the basis of the number of cycles observed.  Three categories were kept, 1-cycle, 2cycle, and 3 or more cycles.  The official completenessvalues used for the mission design are based on 2-cycleobservations.Results:  The bottom line result of the survey output for the baseline mission as applied to NEOs, is thatSentinel will reach 74% completion for D>140m objects in 6.5 years and will provide high-quality orbitsfor all of these.  The total number of objects that arepredicted to be seen is about 31,000.  The size at which90% completion is seen is for D>240m.  The completion level is a few points higher if the sample of objectsis restricted to PHOs (potentially hazardous objects).If  the sample is  restricted to virtual  impactors[3]  thecompletion level rises to 89% in the same time frame.We ran comparison tests for alternate spacecraft orbits that include a near-Earth orbit (like L1 or L2) oranother with perihelion near Venus and aphelion nearthe Earth.  A summary graph for two representative target sizes is shown in Fig. 1.  For NEOs and PHOs (notshown), the survey results are similar but there is a distinct advantage to the Venus-like orbit for virtual impactors at the D=140m.  An Earth-Sun L1/L2 orbit withthe same mission design only gets a 70% completionrate  on  D=140m impactors.   This  is  due  to  the  impactors having, in general, much longer synodic periods relative to the Earth and thus making it harder toget the same completeness in the same time.  The advantage disappears at smaller sizes because the detections require the targets to be much closer to the observatory.   At  this  smaller,  more incompletely surveyedsize (D=30m), the objects detected are largely uncorrelated between the two locations indicating that a combined survey would be nearly a factor of two more effective.References:[1] Bottke, W.
