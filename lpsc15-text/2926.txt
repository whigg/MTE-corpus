I-Xe SYSTEM IN CHONDRULES FROM CR2 CHONDRITE NWA 721.  O. V. Pravdivtseva1, A. P. Meshik1, C. M. Hohenberg1 and A. N.

Introduction:  CR carbonaceous chondrites are among the most primitive meteorites in our collections [1, 2]. Although they experienced various degrees of aqueous alteration, most of them avoided thermal and shock metamorphism, and, therefore, could have preserved primary isotopic records in their components. The previously reported 26Al-26Mg systematics of CR chondrules [3–5] indicate that only ~35% of them show resolvable excesses of 26Mg*. The inferred initial 26Al/27Al ratios [(26Al/27Al)0] in CR chondrules range from (1.0±0.4)×106 to (6.3±0.9)×106  [3–5] which is significantly lower than (26Al/27Al)0 in the majority of chondrules from UOCs, COs, and Acfer 094 [6, 7]. Assuming homogeneous distribution of 26Al in the protoplanetary disk at the canonical level [(26Al/27Al)0 ~ 5.2×10‒5], the inferred (26Al/27Al)0 in CR chondrules imply that they represent several generations; the majority characterized by low (26Al/27Al)0 (<3×106)  [3–5].  A weighted mean (26Al/27Al)0 of 22 CR chondrules corresponded to a formation age of 3.4 (+0.2, -0.1) Myr after CV CAIs [4].  Here we present I-Xe isotope systematics of 5 chondrules from the CR2 chondrite NWA 721. The IXe systematics is known to be affected by aqueous alteration [8], and thus can potentially provide information on the onset of aqueous alteration in the CR chondrites, which is still poorly constrained [9, 10]. Chondrules were split into fragments, thus I-Xe and Pb-Pb systematics in the same chondrule could be potentially studied in the future. Results and Discussion: Three of the studied NWA 721 chondrules, #1, #2, and #3 (Table 1) are of the most abundant type I, (magnesium-rich, porphyritic olivine-pyroxene). Two of them are surrounded by coarse-grained igneous rims, typical for CR chondrules (Fig. 1). Two chondrules, A3 and X are anorthite-rich; they consist of low- and high-Ca pyroxenes, anorthitic plagioclase, olivine, Cr-bearing spinel, FeNi-metal, and crystalline mesostasis. In order to convert 127I into 128Xe, samples were irradiated at the University of Missouri Research Reactor receiving 2×1019 thermal neutrons/cm2. Xenon was extracted by step-wise pyrolysis in a low blank W-coil, and its isotopic composition was measured using BaurSigner discrimination-free ion source massspectrometer.  Fig. 1. Combined x-ray elemental map in Mg (red), Ca (green), Al K (blue) of chondrule #2 from the CR chondrite NWA 721. The chondrule consists of magnesian olivine (ol), low-Ca pyroxene (px), glassy mesostasis (mes), high-Ca pyroxene (cpx), and Fe,Nimetal nodules (met). It is surrounded by a coarsegrained igneous rim (IR).  Table 1.

Rare earth element abundances in plagioclase in a single anorthite-rich Renazzo CR chondrule were shown to be 20 times of the CI chondrites value [1]. As a result barium appears to be the more probable parent for 131*Xe. All NWA 271 chondrules contain compatible concentrations of U-fission xenon. Four of the NWA 721 chondrules studied here have no detectable 129*Xe. 2926.pdf
