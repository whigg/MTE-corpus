Grimm3. 1Space Sciences Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, (heidi.fuqua@ssl.berkeley.edu), 2Department of Earth & Planetary Science, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, 3Department of Space Studies, Southwest Research Institute, 1050 Walnut St. #300, Boulder, CO 80302.  Introduction:  In support of nightside time domain Electromagnetic Sounding with ARTEMIS, we study the influence of the wake fields on a poloidal field placed at the center of the Moon representative of an induced dipole in a plasma hybrid model. This exercise seeks to define confining effects as boundary conditions acting on induced fields to improve upon nightside time domain vacuum theory applied during Apollo [1,2]. When the Moon is exposed directly to the Solar Wind (SW), spatial and time varying magnetic field signals induce telluric currents within conducting layers resisting the passing perturbation. Isolating geophysical magnetic induction from the plasma effects, such as dayside confinement and diamagnetic wake current systems, is the first step to performing Electromagnetic (EM) Sounding constraining electrical conductivity as a function of depth [4]. Nightside time domain EM sounding was performed during the Apollo missions using the orbiting Explorer 35 magnetometer and the Apollo 12 Lunar Surface Magnetometer [1]. This method required the surface measurement to be within the lunar wake cavity, measuring the total magnetic field, and Explorer 35 to be well outside of any lunar effects, providing measurement of the upstream driving event within the Solar Wind. This analysis assumed vacuum symmetry neglecting confinement and diamagnetic effects. Hybrid Model: Our plasma hybrid model [5] solves kinetic Maxwell’s equations for positively charged particles while the electrons act as a collective fluid. The Moon is considered a non-conducting plasma absorber with a dipolar magnetic field placed at the center. We varied the orientation of this dipole with respect to the Solar Wind conditions and Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) orientation. This dipole field is representative of a time decaying induced dipole. The magnitude of the dipole is sized conservatively, consistent with Apollo and Lunar Prospector lobe measurements [6,7], for the purpose of bounding field interaction physics and not predicting ARTEMIS observations.  We use a right-handed coordinate system centered at the Moon, with the +X axis directed toward the Sun. Here the solar wind flows along the -X axis, and the IMF is in the XY plane. The simulation cell size is 160km, 0.09RL where RL=1730 km is the lunar radius.  Two example runs are provided in Figure 1 for the antiparallel (IMF is antiparallel to the SW, and Bdipole is 0o) and perpendicular cases (IMF is perpendicular to the SW, and Bdipole is    -45o). The plot displays field lines and magnitude of the poloidal lunar dipolar field minus the wake fields demonstrating the effects of distortion and confinement. Wake current systems vary greatly based on Solar Wind conditions [3]. While dayside confinement of the poloidal field is seen in the hybrid simulations as predicted by Apollo, the nightside elongation into the downstream wake cavity varies with Solar Wind conditions and dipole orientation. A dipole field leakage into the rarefaction regions of the wake is also a prominent feature.    Figure 1. Hybrid model results showing the distortion of a dipolar field within the lunar wake. (Top) IMF is antiparallel to SW, (Bottom) IMF is perpendicular to SW with -45o dipole. Scale bar indicates field magnitude.  Vacuum Forward Model:  The vacuum response of the Moon to a spatially uniform time-varying magnetic field has been calculated using the COMSOL Multiphysics 4.4 AC/DC Module (http://www.comsol.co.in/acdc-module). This is a commercial finite element analysis software that solves 2728.pdf

the magnetic diffusion equation: 𝛁𝟐𝑩 = 𝜎𝜇! 𝝏𝑩𝝏𝒕 . The upper probe FGM data is fed as an input into the model. This calculation is performed in 3D. The global Cartesian coordinates are (X,Y,Z) centered at the center of the Moon in a Selenographic coordinate system. The model Moon is a sphere of radius Rm = 1,738 km with 3 layers of constant conducting representing a differentiated lunar interior. These layers consist of a resistive crust (depth > 0.7 Rm , σ = 10-9 mhos/m), conducting mantle (depth = 0.3-0.7 Rm, σ = 10-4 mhos/m), and a highly conducting core (depth < 400km, σ = 10-2 mhos/m) [1, 4]. A boundary layer mesh has been added. We also explore a radially varying exponential conductivity: σ(r) = 10-4(r/Rm) [4]. Inversion: A Gauss-Newton inversion routine has been developed and coupled to our forward model to estimate the sensitivity of the ARTEMIS data to the lunar conductivity structure, and producing best-fit layered and radial conductivity models.
