Prior studies of the cohesion of regolith in theplanetary environment have assumed spherical grains[2, 3, 4]. Discrete element method (DEM) models forthe strength of rubble pile asteroids by [4] rely heavilyon the assumption that grains are spherical particles todetermine the cohesive force between them. The grainsreturned from the asteroid Itokawa by the Hayabusamissions are very angular [5]. Similarly, micrographsclearly show that grains on the Moon are highly aspherical [6]. We investigate the effect of non-spherical grainson cohesion. We approximate cohesion between irregular grains as cohesion between ellipsoids. The cohesiveforce between particles is calculated using the methodgiven by [2]. The cohesion between ellipsoids is nondimensionalized by equal volume spheres. Expandingupon the work by [3], the electric field required for lofting particles on the Moon is calculated. We find thatasphericity can modify the cohesive force by a factor of1/3 to 4 and the electric field required for lofting by 1/2to 2. Thus, models of asteroid strength and evolutionwill be affected by these new estimates of cohesion.Theory:Cohesion. The parametric equation for an ellipse is:x(t) = a · cos(t) (1)y(t) = b · sin(t) (2)where a and b are the major and minor axis, respectively,and t is the angle. The radius of curvature for a givenparametric equation is:R=(x′2 + y′2)3/2x′y′′− y′x′ (3)By differentiating Eqn 1 and Eqn 2 with respect to t, wemay then obtain a radius of curvature of the ellipse:Re =(a2 sin2 t+b2 cos2 t)3/2ab (4)We can rewrite this replacing the minor axis, b, with therelation, b =√a2(1− e2) where e is the eccentricity ofthe cross-sectional ellipse. Eccentricity ranges from 0for a sphere to 1 for a parabola, with increasing valuesdescribing more ’needle-like’ grains. Rewriting Eqn 4:Re =(a2 sin2 t+a2(1− e2)cos2 t)3/2a√a2(1− e2) (5)For cohesion between two grains, [2] showed that the reduced radius of curvature between two contacting bodiesis proportional to the force required to separate them:Fco =A210/3z2R1R2R1 +R2(6)where A is the Hamaker constant (4.3× 10−20 Joulesfrom [7] for lunar regolith), z is the equilibrium distance(where the potential energy of the grain interaction is ata minimum) typically between 1 and 5 A˚, and R1 and R2are the local radii of curvature for bodies 1 and 2, respectively. Substituting Eqn 5 (the radius of curvature for anellipsoid) into the expression for the cohesion (Eqn 6),we can calculate the cohesion between two ellipsoidalgrains of varying size, shape, and relative orientation.We propose to characterize the magnitude of the variation in the cohesion for ellipsoidal grains as comparedto the traditionally considered spherical grains. First, wecompare the ellipsoids to spheres of the same volume.Since the ellipsoid and sphere have the same volume,the radius of the sphere can be defined in terms of parameters of the ellipse (a,e):Rs = a(1− e2)1/3 (7)We calculate the cohesion between two identical ellipsoids (Fcoe ∝ Re and R1 = R2) and two identical spheres(Fcos ∝ Rs). The ratio of the cohesion in ellipsoids to thatof spheres is then:FcoeFcos=ReRs(8)Using Eqn 5 and Eqn 7 where the radius of the sphereis by definition the radius of curvature, we produce thenon-dimensional relation for cohesion of like ellipsoidsin contact to their volume-equivalent spheres in contact:FcoeFcos=(1− e2 cos2 t)3/2(1− e2)5/6 (9)Eqn 9 shows that the ratio between the cohesion in theellipsoids and spheres is only dependent on the orientation of the ellipsoids and their eccentricity, but it is notdependent on the size of the particles. We define orientation of the ellipsoid at t = 0 to be an ellipse whosesemi-major axis is along the x-axis of an xy plane thatsorigin is coincident to the ellipse’s origin. An orientation of t = pi/2 is an ellipse whose semi-minor axis isalong the x-axis of the previously described plane.Electric Field. [3] shows that electrostatic dust loftingcan occur if the electrostatic force is greater than the cohesion and gravity holding the grain on the surface:FE ≥ Fgrav+Fco (10)2002.pdf

where FE is the electric force (FE = E2Aε), A is thesurface area of the grain, ε0 is the permitivitty of freespace, E is the electric field required to loft a particle,Fgrav is the local surface gravity, and Fco is the cohesiveforce calculated in the last section. Expanding the electrostatic term:E ≥√Fgrav+FcoAε0(11)The ratio of the electrostatic force required for lofting ofthe ellipsoidal grains as compared to the spheres is:EeEs≥√AsAe√Fgrav+FcoeFgrav+Fcos(12)Note that Fgrav will be equivalent for the sphere and ellipsoid cases as we defined them to have equivalent volumes.Results: From Eqn 6, we find that the maximum cohesion will occur with a rotation of both bodies by pi/2with respect to the major axis (the contact point beingat the semi-minor axis) and the minimum cohesion at arotation of 0 (the contact point being at the semi-majoraxis). These two orientations bound the range of cohesive strengths for ellipsoids of a constant size. In Figure 1, we show the amplification of the cohesion between ellipsoids as compared to spheres (see Eqn 12).As eccentricity tends towards zero, the ellipsoids become more spherical and ratio of cohesive force approaches 1. Conversely, as eccentricity increases, theellipsoid models will deviate from the circular case asthey start to approximate plate-plate contacts. Figure 1also represents the ratio of bond numbers, which is thestrength of the cohesive force as related to gravity.Figure 1: Ratio of cohesion for two ellipsoids in contact as comparedto two spheres in contact. As eccentricity increases the objects behaveas plates in contact, as eccentricity decreases, they behave as spheresin contact (solid lines denote max cohesion orientation, dashed linesdenote min cohesion orientation)Figure 2: Ratio of electric fields required for lofting for ellipsoids tospheres in contact (solid lines denote max cohesion case, dashed linesdenote min cohesion case)The influence of grain shape on the electric field required to electrostatically loft grains is given by Eqn 12and is shown in Figure 2. The electric field ratios for themin and max cohesion orientations approach a constantvalue at large grain sizes, where gravity dominates. Overthe size domain, highly eccentric ellipsoids show significant deviation from the estimates of the sphere-spherecohesion (see Figure 1). In Figure 2, highly eccentric ellipsoids require a weaker electric field than their sphereanalogues in the gravity-dominated regime. To understand this we look at the non-dimensional electric fieldequation and investigate the ratio of surface areas. Inthe gravity dominated regime the amplification of the required electric field is dominated by the root ratio of surface areas. For our non-dimensional investigation, thereis no difference between modeling our bodies as likespheres/ellipsoids or as the body-plate contacts wherethe plate is a fixed, rigid surface and the grain rests onit. Further investigation will calculate the cohesion between unlike ellipsoids in contact.Conclusion: Considering grains as ellipsoids insteadof spheres modifies the cohesive force by a factor of 1/3to 4 and the required electric field for lofting by 1/2 to2. Geometry plays a significant role in these early estimates of cohesion and shows a need to consider morecomplex geometries of grains to characterize the surfaces of moons and asteroids.References: [1] Scheeres, D.J. et al.
