Lowell Suite 106, Tucson, AZ 85719, buxner@psi.edu, jgrier@psi.edu).    Introduction: Over the past decade, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) has funded four Education and Public Outreach (E/PO) Forums aligned with each of its science divisions: Astrophysics, Earth Science, Heliophysics, and Planetary Science. Together, these Forums help organize individual division E/PO programs into a coordinated, effective, efficient, nationwide effort that shares the scientific discoveries of NASA across a broad array of audiences. This poster will describe the work of the Planetary Science Forum to support scientists and engineers in becoming involved in E/PO through people, events, and resources found on the SMD E/PO online community workspace, http://smdepo.org.  The community workspace: The workspace has content broken up into tabs for easy navigation: Feed, Calendar, Topics, Projects, and People. The Feed tab shows posts by the Forums and community members with news and announcements, such as funding opportunities, resources, and conferences, workshops, and other events. The Calendar tab shows these events in a calendar form. The Topics tab contains related content grouped together as individual topics, including special collections, such as activity snapshots highlighting SMD E/PO community activities, and collections of resources about engaging diverse audiences or addressing misconceptions in Earth and Space Science. The Projects tab contains links to individual SMD E/PO project descriptions, including overviews, audiences served, reports, evaluation information, contact information, websites, and other features. The People tab contains information about SMD E/PO community members. The content shown in any tab can be further refined by using filters found on the left sidebar. Scientists can search for something specific by typing in a word or phrase in the Keyword box, search for content in a certain date range, or select one or more items from the tags lists. All content on the workspace is tagged; users can select an audience (general public, educators, scientists, students, etc.), an event type (e.g., conference, workshop, telecon), a resource / program type (evaluation, internship, meeting notes, NASA product, professional development, website, etc.), and/or a type of news (e.g., NASA HQ, Forum news, budgets, Higher Education Working Group) from the filters. The more filters selected, the fewer posts will be visible, enabling scientists to quickly find exactly the content they need. Find events and opportunities: One avenue for scientists and engineers to assist in E/PO efforts is to participate in an existing event or opportunity; these can be found on the workspace as posts or calendar events.  Find E/PO projects: Scientists can use existing SMD E/PO projects to become involved in E/PO either by collaborating with an E/PO professional on one of their projects or by using them for inspiration and ideas for scientists' own projects. The SMD E/PO portfolio includes products, events, and programs aligned with priority areas identified by the federal Committee on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math Education (CoSTEM). This portfolio of activities engages audiences in the story, the science, and the adventure of NASA's scientific explorations of our home planet, the solar system, and the universe beyond.  The individual projects on the Projects tab contain a wealth of information, all organized by CoSTEM goals. As on the other tabs, the list of projects can be narrowed using the filters on the left sidebar, but with different filters than the Feed, Calendar, and Topics tabs. The Keyword search is still available, but scientists can also search for projects by SMD division, CoSTEM priority, and the primary and secondary audiences that the project serves. Viewing a project will show contact information, the project website, a description of the project, audience metrics, and evaluation data. Find people: Searching on the People tab allows access to educational professionals with experience working with the audience in which the scientist is interested, or who are local to the scientist and can help them design or implement their programs, or who can help to disseminate their products. The People tab gives a list of SMD E/PO community members for all           http://smdepo.org/ divisions (Astrophysics, Earth Science, Heliophysics, and Planetary Science). The SMD E/PO community consists of individuals who develop and implement education and public outreach activities using SMD's content, expertise, and facilities; they can help scientists get involved in existing E/PO projects and opportunties, or provide insight and resources to help them with their own. Like the other tabs, this list can be narrowed down using filters, but several of the filters are different. Scientists can search for E/PO professionals by keyword, their division, their institution, which audiences they serve, which types of programs they do, or which science and education meetings they attend. Clicking on a community member's profile will provide their contact information. Learn how to get involved: In in addition to the opportunities and events in the Feed, Calendar, and Topics tabs, the workspace houses several resources to help scientists become involved in E/PO, including quick guides on where to start and how to increase their efficiency and impact to make the most of the time they spend on E/PO. There are also E/PO resource samplers for both Planetary Science and Astrophysics that list several sample activities scientists could do with various audiences, separated by topic (such as volcanism, ice in the solar system, and astrobiology for Planetary Science and different wavelengths of light for Astrophysics). Secure vs. public: Much of the content on the workspace is visible to the public, but there is a significant amount of information that is only available on the secure portion of the workspace. Accessing the secure side requires an account; requesting one is quick and easy. In the top right corner of the page is a "Log In" link; click it, click "Request an account," and fill out a very short form to request a workspace account. All scientists who would like to get involved with SMD E/PO are invited to join the workspace.
