It is made mostly of relatively large (0.5mm diameter) chondrules, with about 27% fine grained matrix by surface area [2,3]. While the chondrules record significant (>1700K) heating events [4], the matrix remained relatively cold [5]. The observed mean size of the chondrules is too small to meet the requirements of modern theories of how planetesimals formed from dust [6]. Further, under the assumption that chondrules were made by the melting of free-floating clumps of dust in the Solar Nebula, the ratio of the matrix to chondrules can be used to constrain the fraction of the ambient material that was  converted into chondrules [7]. Matrix Processing:  Studies of noble gasses contained in presolar nano-diamonds have shown that about half of Semarkona's matrix remained below at most 800K [5]. The possibility of parent body processing means that this temperature is an upper limit for the temperature experienced by the free-floating dust before it was incorporated into Semarkona as matrix. Models of chondrule formation by melting of freefloating dust in the Solar Nebula act by "flash" heating the ambient gas, for example through shocks [8] or the action of electrical currents [9]. While the peak temperature reached in the core of a chondrule formation event must have been able to melt proto-chondrules in whole or in part [10], these formation event cores were surrounded by warm cocoons, with temperatures above 800K but below the chondrule melting temperature [9,10]. By assuming a relation between the sizes of these warm cocoons  and the core chondrule melting regions we can constrain the fraction of the ambient dust that could have been processed into chondrules.  In Figure 1, the x-axis is g, the size of the cocoon divided by the size of the chondrule melting region. The chondrule-c and matrix-m curves are the fraction of the ambient dust converted into chondrules and left as protomatrix, respectively. We can see that unless the cocoons are very small compared with the chondrule forming regions (g<1), only a modest fraction of the ambient dust could have been melted to form chondrules.  Current models of melting regions [9,11] suggest g>1, so most of the ambient dust must have remained unprocessed.  0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 g0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Processing fractions filtering f chondrule c matrix m Fig. 1: Processing fractions for Semarkona as a function of g, the relative size of warm (>800K) noble-gas releasing cocoons to hot (>1700K) chondrule forming regions.  In green/dashed the fraction of ambient dust converted to chondrules, in red/dash-dotted the fraction of ambient dust left as proto-matrix and in blue/solid the fraction of proto-matrix finally incorporated into Semarkona.  Dust Filtering: Semarkona is mostly formed of chondrules, not fine grained matrix [1,2].  However, as noted above most of the ambient dust was not converted into chondrules.  It follows that at some stage of Semarkona's parent body's formation, fine grained (proto-matrix) dust must have been filtered out, or equivalently chondrules must have been concentrated.  In Figure 1, the filtering curve denotes the fraction of potential matrix material that could have been incorporated into Semarkona, which drops with the fraction of dust converted into chondrules.  For popular chondrule formation processes [9,11], with a significant value of g, most of the proto-matrix must have been filtered out. Chondrule Agglomerations: While Semarkona has relatively large chondrules [3], they are still small from an aerodynamical perspective. Models of the Solar Nebula [12,13] suggest that at an orbital postion of 2.5AU, the Stokes numbers of naked Semarkona chondrules were low: St<0.001. This means that naked chondrules would have been extremely well coupled to the gas.  Modern theories of planetesimal formation such as the Streaming Instability [6] require larger dust grains (St > 0.01), and that those grains have been concentrated to significantly (factors of 2 or more) super Solar solid-to-gas mass ratios [14,15]. Semarkona's chondrules are therefore too small to have lead to Semarkona's parent body forming without an intermediate coaggulation phase forming chondrule-matrixchondrule agglomerations of about a cm in diameter. Such agglomerations have been found in the meteoritical record [16]. Chondrule Melting Location: Large enoughclusters of chondrules would instigate collective behavior through dynamics such as the Streaming Instability and hence lead to the gravitational collapse of dust clouds to form planetesimals. Such clusters exist, but they are a modest part of the meteoritical record. Almost entirely absent from the meteoritical record is the result of melting of such chondrule agglomerations. It follows that cm-sized agglomerations must have either come together outside of any chondrule melting region, or have rapidly exited such regions before they could have been melted. Large (>1.0mm) chondrules are extremely rare in all chondrites. While the maximum fraction of dust converted into chondrules is modest (Fig. 1), it is still respectable. Furthermore the evidence that many individual chondrules experienced multiple heating events is quite strong [17], and yet chondrule agglomerations, while required for planetesimal formation [6], were not melted. This need to remove chondrules or chondrule agglomerations from the chondrule melting region is exacerbated by the small size of the chondrules: as noted above Semarkona's chondrules are small enough to have been extremely well coupled to the Solar Nebula's gas, and hence would have taken tens of thousands of years to transport radially a significant fraction of their orbital position [7]. This suggests that chondrule melting regions (i.e. regions where chondrule melting events occurred) were highly localized.  Further, vertical chondrule transport was much faster than radial transport because of the shorter distances involved, and the gravitational pull towards the midplane. Chondrules and chondrule agglomerations would naturally have settled towards the midplane on modest time scales due to their larger size and higher densities than those of the unmelted and vertically well mixed dust [18].  This suggests that chondrule melting was restricted to the upper layers of the Solar Nebula.
