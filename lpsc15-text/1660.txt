Introduction: The magma ocean model for Vesta petrogenesis implies the formation of a mantle mainly made of olivine and harzburgite [1], [2], [3]. Starting the evolution of Vesta from a chondritic-like composition, the final depth of the mantle should be at about 50/60km [4]. According to numerical simulations based on this scenario, olivine should be present on the surface of Vesta in the south hemisphere exposed by the two consequent impacts events Veneneia and Rheasilvia [5]. Although surficial processes like subsequent impacts and space weathering did reshaped the regolith distribution, the expectation was still to find the highest concentration of ultramafic lithology (orthopyroxene, harzburgite and olivine) associated with the giant impact basins in the South Pole. The identification of olivine when combined with pyroxene has always been controversial with reflectance spectroscopy in the VIS/NIR range [6], [7]. Both minerals have a diagnostic feature at about 1 um but the crystal structure of olivine has a lower absorption coefficient relative to that of pyroxene. The direct consequence is that it is difficult to detect olivine in concentrations <25% in the presence of abundant orthopyroxene. Measurements and data analysis: Dawn spacecraft mapped Vestan surface acquiring VIS/NIR spectra between 90°S-lat and 80°N-lat with resolutions ranging from 70m to 800m [8], [9]. Several methods have been applied to find olivine-rich terrains. The first detection was based on direct comparison of spectra from vestan surface with laboratory mixtures of pyroxene and olivine in combination with pyroxene band parameters (i.e. band area ratio and band center) [10]. However, this method is able to detect olivine only when in high concentration with respect to pyroxene (roughly >70% vol.). Other studies used spectral indicators designed to detect lower concentration olivine [11], [12]. Using these methods some additional olivine-rich locations were identified but the detections do not always agree emphasizing the difficulty of these analysis. Also modeling of spectra with MGM [13] and scattering techniques [14] have been used providing additional but also in this case potentially controversial information on olivine distribution on Vestan surface. In summary, the only locations where almost all the techniques used so far agree are Bellicia and Arruntia craters. These are located in the northern hemisphere respectively at 37°N-lat 47°E-lon and 39°N-lat 72°Elon in Claudia Coordinate System [10], [11], [12]. Other locations are either below the detection threshold or not analyzed or not recognized as olivine-rich terrains in one or more of the different methods used. In particular Ruesch et al. [11] identified locations within  0°E-lon and 60°E-lon spanning from equatorial to mid latitudes in the northern hemisphere where a region of higher concentration of lower crust/upper mantle pyroxene has been found [15]. Palomba et al. [12] identified mainly locations above latitude 35°N while Poulet et al. [14] favors an homogeneous distribution of olivine all across the surface with a concentration of about 20% in volume with respect to pyroxene. However, none of these identifications is clearly associated with either Veneneia or Rheasilvia.  Discussion and conclusions: The presence and eventually the distribution of pyroxene and olivine on asteroid Vesta has been considered for years as a proxy for the internal structure of this terrestrial proto-planet.  Pyroxenes have a distribution in line with the lower layers of the crust being concentrated within the basins in the south pole with, however, the occurrence of a orthopyroxene-rich stripe extending from the south pole to the north between 0°E-lon and 60°E-lon. Olivine, on the contrary, is either evenly distributed all across the surface in low concentration or located in regions difficult to associate directly with the giant impacts in the South Pole. In particular, the geological mapping of the region where Bellicia and Arruntia are located did not revealed any evidence of ejecta from Rheasilvia [16].  Particularly interesting is a region rich in orthopyroxene located in a strip extending roughly from 0°Elon and 60°E-lon where Ruesch et al. [11] found most of the olivine-rich terrains. The nature and origin of this compositional unit is not clear. It could be a region generally enriched in Rheasilvia ejecta. However, it is worth to notice that it broadly corresponds to a region with thinner crust when compared with average Vesta [17] where the major difference between the thikness  of the crust and the composition is that the compositional unit extends from south to north while the low thickness region starts north of Matronalia Rupes. Therefore, this region could be a consequence of the underlying internal structure rather than the surficial collisional history. Raymond et al., for instance, interpreted this region as an evidence for plutonic intrusions within the crust [18].  Concluding, while the olivine has been indeed detected on Vesta's surface, its distribution has posed some additional questions on the origin of this mineral and the mechanisms that can have brought it in its present locations.
