A WAVE MODULATION NATURE OF THE 3D STRUCTURAL LATTICE OF THECHURYUMOV-GERASIMENKO COMET ICY CORE; Kochemasov G.G., IGEM of the RussianAcademy of Sciences, 35 Staromonetny, 119017 Moscow, kochem.36@mail.ru:An action of the inertia-gravity forces is demonstratedin convexo-concave shape of the comet as well as inshapes of other documented small cosmic bodies [1-4]. These forces origin is due to movements of allcosmic bodies in non-circular keplerian orbits.Periodical changes of bodies accelerations causearising inertia waves to warp bodies, and theirrotations distribute these warpings into fourinterfering ortho- and diagonal directions [1-4]. Thewarping waves form a harmonic row starting from thefundamental wave 1 followed by the first overtonewave 2 and so on. Interference of the fundamentalwaves of four directions inevitably causes onehemisphere to upraise (bulge) and the opposite onesubside (press in). Produced convexo-concave shapeshows a deep cracking of the expanding convexhemisphere and compacting the squeezing oppositeone. Some examples are in Fig. 1, 2.    Another typeof warping waves is inversely proportion in lengthsand amplitudes to orbital frequencies of bodies:smaller frequency larger waves and, vice versa, largerfrequency smaller waves [1-2]. An etalon may beEarth: 1/1year frequency- πR/2 waves (πR/4 or a halfwave tectonic granule), or the Sun’s photosphere: 1/1month frequency – πR/60 granulation. The Ch-Gcomet 6.6 years – 2398 days, 57552 hours - orbitingperiod (1/57552 hours fr.) gives 1.65 πR tectonicgranule – too large to observe directly. Butmodulations by this small frequency the much higherrotation frequency of the comet (1/12.5 hours) givestwo side frequencies (division and multiplication ofthe higher fr. by the lower one): 1/4604 and 1/719400To them correspond two granule sizes: πR/4604 &πR/719400 (R=~ 2500-2000m) or 1.70-1.36 & 0.0110.009 m.         Rosetta ‘images reveal penetratingcomet’s body geometrically regular lattice withspacing about a few meters. Its more accuratedimension can be measured at a block of ~ 5 metersacross (Fig. 8, 9 ) where stripes width is about 1-2meters and a granule, consequently, is about 1- 2meters across. The smaller (finer) modulatedcentimeter fragment size is presented in numerous“deluvial” covers in local depressions (Fig. 3-6, 8).The coarser meter size spherical (polyhedron)boulders also are ubiquitous (Fig. 3-6, 8-9). It isimportant that only calculated two fragment sizesprevail amidst derbies released from outcropsappeared as 3D “ wafer cakes”.References: [1] Kochemasov G.G.
