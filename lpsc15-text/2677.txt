EXPLAINING EARTH’S MISSING MODERATE VOLATILES.  A. Hubbard1 and D. S.

The degree of depletion depends strongly on the volatility of the element, from negligibly if at all depleted for Mg and Si (with 50% condensation temperatures in nebular conditions of about 1400K) to about 80% depleted for the alkali metals Na and K (with 50% condensation temperatures of about 1000K) [3].  Figure 1 illustrates the measured depletion for selected highly lithophile elements. While these depletions are clearly volatility dependent, they cannot be explained through condensation at a single temperature, which would result in a nearly step-function depletion curve. However there is also no signature of partial evaporation or condensation in the potassium isotope ratios, implying that the potassium in the solid and gas phases were in isotopic equilibrium [4].  Those observations rule out brief baking of the pre-Earth solids, which would have left those solids enriched in the heavier isotopes [5]. Solids condensing from (or in equilibrium with) the nebular gas would have had different compositions at different orbital positions, and if one could arbitrarily pick and choose from planetesimals that formed from annuli condensed at different radii one should be able to combine them to reproduce Earth’s composition. However, attempts to reproduce Earth’s moderately volatile elemental composition have failed [6,7], which is not surprising.  In simple models of the Solar nebula, temperature scales with the square root of the orbital radius [8].  The observed depletion covers elements with a range of condensation temperatures at least 1400K to 700K, or about a factor of 2, which corresponds to a factor of 4 in orbital position.  The ratio of Mars’ orbit to Venus’ is only a factor 2, so to reproduce Earth one would need to have fed significantly from outside of Mars’ feeding zone and significantly from inside of Venus’. Necessary Model Ingredients: To match the lack of an isotope signature in potassium the gas and solids must have remained in equilibrium as long as the temperature was near the potassium condensation temperature. If the total system was in equilibrium and had chondritic abundances as it cooled enough that potassium condensed, the resulting solids would have had chondritic potassium abundances. That implies both that the total system cannot have had chondritic composition over the temperature range considered (about 1400K to 700K), and that the deviation from chondritic must have increased as the temperature fell. An existing model [9] invokes accretion heating and the dissipation of the Solar nebula for volatile depletion of the terrestrial planets.  As the nebula accreted onto the Sun (or was evaporated), the accretion flow diminished so the disk cooled.  Further, if the solids remained but the gas evaporated, then the disk would have been progressively depleted in the elements remaining in the vapor phase.  While this model can reproduce Earth’s composition, it requires both an unexpected temperature history, and also that the solids remain small (so they could exchange elements with the gas) and in place. These requirements rule out the model of [10] but the picture of progressively spatially separating gas and solids as the disk cools still holds.  1700  1500  1300  1100 1000 900 800 700T(50%)0.11.0fMgSiMnLiK NaB Rb F ZnCaAlTiZr Figure 1: Squares: terrestial volatile abundances normalized to chondritic as a function of 50% condensation temperature under nebular conditions.

Separating Gas and Dust: Dust (here, including grains, chondrules and fluffy aggregates) have inertia and so can drift through gas when the gas feels a pressure gradient [11]. Even the largest grains expected in the Solar nebula and witnessed in the meteoritical record (<1cm when compact) are well coupled to the gas however, and will drift slowly. The strongest pressure gradients available in protoplanetary disks are in the vertical direction, and dust settling times can be relatively short (~century) [12].  However, for dust to settle it must start at altitude and must have had a reason to be at altitude.  Turbulence is expected in protoplanetary disks and the Solar nebula, but by mixing dust vertically turbulence prevents settling. To generate 2677.pdf

significant settling then one needs to change the aerodynamics of the dust. Compacting Dust: Dust in the Solar nebula initially grew collisionally, and hence as porous aggregates. But heating the disk enough to start to evaporate Mg and Si would lead to sintering and compaction of the dust [13]. Once compacted, the dust would be less stirred by turbulence and would settle on short but finite lifetimes of about a century. Disk Heating and FU Orionis Outburts: At the position of the Earth, the temperature of the Solar nebula is thought to have generally been mild, about 280K [8], far below the temperature needed to evaporate even the moderately volatile elements. However, protoplanetary disks are observed to undergo rare, brief accretion events such as FU Orionis and EX Lupi events [14].  During these events the accretion rate increases dramatically, and the accretion luminosity can increase significantly, heating the disk.  While EX Lupi events are short, FU Orionis events last for about a century, and can result in over 6 magnitudes of brightning, which is enough to have brough the Solar nebula’s temperature at Earth’s position to about 1400K, and subsequently have cooled on the same time scale as the (sintered and compacted) dust would have settled, as described above. Further, while only a handful of FU Orionis type objects have been observed, their brief lifetimes suggest that most protoplanetary disks undergo several FU Orionis type outbursts over their lifetime. This makes such outbursts excellent candidates for the heating which could lead to Earth’s volatile depletion. Model: Our model to explain Earth’s volatile depletion curve is sketched in Fig 2 [12]. Initially the disk was cool, and the dust porous (about 97% porosity) and vertically well mixed. At the onset of an FU Orionis outburst, the disk was heated to approximately 1400K, which evaporated the volatile elements (reaching equilibrium between the solids and the dust) and sintered the dust, reducing its porosity. Now compact, the dust began to settle to the midplane as the Solar nebula cooled, leaving evaporated volatiles behind at higher altitudes. For the less volatile elements such as Si, the dust aggregates barely had time to settle before the Si recondensed, leaving Si barely depleted. However, for more volatile elements such as Na, the dust settled for a significantly longer time, so left behind most of the Na in the upper altitudes of the Solar Nebula, and only a fraction of the Na could recondense onto the dust grains. Once the dust aggregates settled to the midplane, being compact they were significantly less well coupled to the gas, and triggered the Streaming Instability [15] which rapidly concentrated the dust further, leading to gravitational instabilities and planetesimal formation.  This locked in the volatile depletion: while the volatiles left in the gas phase eventually recondensed, the planetesimals had little aggregate surface area, and moved rapidly through the gas, and so were decoupled from the small grains.
