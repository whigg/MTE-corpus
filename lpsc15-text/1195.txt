Introduction: NWA 8632, an unpaired lunar mare basalt meteorite, is a small (23.8 gram), dense black stone lacking fusion crust found in the Chwichiya region of southern Morocco. The find site was confirmed using GPS to be at 27°20.783' N, 11°52.05' W.   Here we describe its petrographic characteristics, and compare its bulk composition with those for other mare basalts found as meteorites or returned by sampling missions to the Moon.    Figure 1.

Petrography: The specimen has a porphyritic texture and consists of subhedral zoned olivine phenolcrysts (up to 2.3 mm long, yellowish in thin section, cores Fa32.5–32.8, FeO/MnO = 90–100, rim Fa48.8, FeO/MnO = 98) within a finer grained, quenchtextured groundmass. The groundmass is composed mainly of elongate, skeletal, zoned clinopyroxene grains (clear with pink rims), smaller very ferroan olivine grains (Fa 72.6–74.1, FeO/MnO = 91–97), and interstitial regions (opaque in thin section) consisting of ilmenite needles, Ti-chromite, fine clinopyroxene, fayalite and glass. Clinopyroxene compositions include augite (Fs23.7–27.1Wo40.1-40.5, FeO/MnO = 53–55, TiO2 = 2.4–2.6 wt.%, Al2O3 = 5.9–6.1 wt.%), subcalcic augite (Fs26.6–27.0Wo30.8–36.1, FeO/MnO = 54–60, TiO2 = 1.9–2.1 wt.%, Al2O3 = 4.7–5.6 wt.%) and rims of ferroan subcalcic augite (Fs41.9Wo34.1, FeO/MnO = 63, TiO2 = 3.2 wt.%, Al2O3 = 8.1 wt.%). Plagioclase is apparently absent. Small patches and veinlets of pale yellow devitrified glass are present (see Figure 3b), and probably represent shock melting during impact-induced ejection from the Moon.    Figure 2.

Bulk Chemical Composition: We analyzed three subsamples (total 64.2 mg) by instrumental neutron activation (Table 1). Major-element concentrations were determined by EPMA of “fused beads” [1] on two of the INAA samples (Table 1). NWA 8632 is a low-Ti basalt most similar in composition to, but in detail distinct from, NWA 032/479 and Apollo 12 pigeonite basalts [2].

Compositional Relationships Among Mare Basalts: The Apollo and Luna missions to the Moon provided us with samples of mare basalts of diverse chemical types, and the burgeoning collection of mare basalts found on Earth as meteorites (now at least 10 specimens from four different countries) has added much to that knowledge. It is nevertheless remarkable that thus far not a single mare basalt meteorite matching the high-Ti samples at the Apollo 11 and Apollo 17 landing sites has been recovered (Fig. 5). In other words, if we had not gone to the Moon to obtain these rocks, we would not (yet) know about their existence from meteoritic specimens (although we could have inferred their existence from remote sensing, e.g., [3]). Thus we would be missing a significant part of the petrologic, compositional, and isotopic data on which to base models of lunar petrogenesis and evolutionary history.
