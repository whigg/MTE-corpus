Both parent and daughter nuclides of the Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd isotope systems are lithophile in character and are fractionated through processes of fractional crystallization and partial melting.  These systems therefore provide useful age information and are sensitive indicators of magmatic and mantle differentiation processes provided that model parameters such as CHUR are accurately known.   Recent Lu-Hf isotope data from early Solar System materials has shown variability in isochron slope and initial isotpe compositions [e.g. 1-4] that are not easily explained. The angrite SAH99555 [2] provide initial 176 Hf/ 177 Hf isotope ratios that are different by about 6 εHf units lower than that of ordinary chondrites and slopes that are too steep (i.e. too old apparent ages) using the 176 Lu decay constant of [5].  To further complicate issues, Bast et al. [4] and Sanborn et al. [6] get slope and intercepts on Lu-Hf isochron diagrams for the angrite D'Orbigny that do not agree.  In addition, Amelin et al. [7] show that angrite whole rock data have no evidence for anomalous slopes or isochron intercepts.  Thus, the anomalous Lu-Hf data needs a greater context and comparisons with isotope systems that may also be sensitive to analytical and/or secondary processes, such as alteration, that may have disturbed the isotope systematics of early early Solar System materials.   Here we report internal isochron Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd data for 4 non-cumulate eucrites that builds upon data presented earlier by Righter et al. [3].   Samples: CMS 04049 (CMS): Unbrecciated eucrite. Crystallization age: 4558 ± 0.6 Ma [Mn-Cr; 8].   EET 87520 (EET): Mg-rich eucrite. Crystallization age is 4546 ± 16 Ma [Pb-Pb in zircon; 9] 4547 ± 9 Ma [Sm-Nd; 10].   GRO 95533 (GRO): Brecciated eucrite. Crystalization age is 4544 ± 21 Ma [Pb-Pb in zircon; 9]. QUE 97053 (QUE): Coarse-grained (up to 2mm) unbrecciated subophitic texture mainly consisting of plagioclase and pyroxene.  Shock effects including darkening (clouding) of silicates are observed in most samples.  Methods: Roughly 2g aliquots of the eucrites were gently crushed with a boron carbide mortar and pestle and sieved.  Material in the size range of 100-200 and 200-300 mesh (~200mg) were separated by heavy liquids into plagioclase, pyroxene and oxide fractions.  After heavy liquid separation, all fractions were carefully hand picked under a binocular microscope.  About 40 mg was taken as a 'whole rock' fraction from an aliquot of the <300 mesh materials. All chemical separation procedures were carried out in clean lab facilities at the University of Houston and all isotope analyses were carried out using a Nu Plasma II MCICP-MS at University of Houston.  Total proce-dure blanks are <80 pg and <15 pg for Hf and Lu, respectively and are negligible.  All data reduction follow methods outlined in [11]. Results:  The Sm-Nd isotope data for the eucrites yield the following ages and initial isotope compositions from isochron regressions (n = number of data points used in the regression).  QUE:  4629 ± 94 Ma; ε 143 Ndi = -0.1 ± 2.3 (n = 5)  GRO:  4500 ± 110 Ma; ε 143 Ndi = +0.1 ± 2.4 (n = 4)  EET:  4537 ± 55 Ma; ε 143 Ndi = +0.2 ± 1.4 (n = 4)  CMS:  4457 ± 69 Ma; ε 143 Ndi = -0.1 ± 1.8  (n = 4)  These Sm-Nd data yield ages that are consistent with other chronometers (perhaps with the exception of CMS) and initial isotope compositions that are identical to CHUR values.  The Lu-Hf data (Figure 1) indicate some samples yield ages that are consistent with the time and duration of magmatism in the eucrite parent body (e.g. [12] GRO, EET, and CMS) whereas QUE yields an 'age' of 4736 ± 40 Ma.  The initial Hf isotope compositions are highly variable, ranging from 0.27982 to 0.27970, well below the generally accepted Lu-Hf CHUR value [13] (Figure 2).  We also observe that the initial Hf isotope compositions of the eucrites are not correlated to isochron slope nor are the Lu isotope compositions different from terrestrial standards [3].   The steep slope of QUE is consistent with results of [2] for angrite SAH 99555 where an apparent excess of 176 Hf is correlated to Lu/Hf ratios.  When plotted on the same isochron diagram, the Lu-Hf data for QUE and SAH 99555 yield an isochron 'age' of 4831 ± 58 Ma and an initial 176 Hf/ 177 Hf ratio of 0.279704 ± 0.000029.     Discussion: Secondary processes such as weathering, impact metamorphism, etc… would likely be observed as scatter about a refrence isochron; we see no such scatter that would explain the excess slope and variable initial Hf isotope compsoitions.  If there are analytical issues related to the mass spectrometry, spike subtraction, sample handling, etc… we would expect to observe systematic offsets.  The Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd analyses and data processing were done with the same procedures and reagents [e.g. 10] precluding a systematic 'lab bias' as the cause of the observed Lu-Hf isotope systematics.  It is also critical to note that the LuHf isotope systematics between QUE and SAH 99555 are identical within analytical uncertainty. Thus, these anomalous isotope systematics are here replicated in materials from a different parent body. The Lu-Hf isotope systematics of these 4 eucrites point to a process(s) that was likely active over the interval of magmatism in the eucrite (and angrite) parent bodies.  The 'excess 176 Hf' observed in QUE is anomalous with respect to the other 3 eucrites, yet the initial Hf isotope compositions are highly variable in all samples (Figure 2).  These isotope systematics have been postulated by Amelin et al. [6] to be a result of neutrino irradiation.  This mechanism, among others, are being investigated further by our group.                    References: [1] Albarède F. et al (2006) GCA 70, 1261-1270. [2] Thrane K. et al. (2010) ApJ 717, 861867.
