Introduction: Stable isotope ratios are a valuable tool in studying the formation of Solar System bodies. Primordial isotope ratios are considered to be representative of conditions in the solar nebula.  At the same time, atmospheres of several solar system bodies, such as Earth, Mars, Titan, and Pluto, have evolved since their formation. In this case, constraining the evolution of important stable isotope ratios may provide clues to their primordial conditions.  Studying the fractionation of nitrogen isotopes in evolved atmospheres may be used to evaluate the relative importance of atmospheric loss processes. 14N/15N in Titan's atmosphere was found not to evolve much over the history of the Solar System, and its N2 must have originated as protosolar NH3 [1]. Evaluation of the upper limit for 15N enrichment due to escape showed that 14N/15N fractionates more rapidly on Mars than on Titan. [2].  Atmospheric escape on Pluto could cause even greater 15N enrichment than on Mars, depending on the dominant type of escape [3]. Photochemistry can also fractionate the isotopes in planetary atmospheres. Unlike escape mechanisms, photochemical loss preferentially removes the heavy N isotope thus mitigating 15N enrichment due to escape. This fractionation occurs because the cross sections of N2 are strongly dependent on wavelength [4]. The structural complexity of the cross sections leads to different photolytic efficiency between 14N2 and 15N14N on Titan [4, 5]. This "self-shielding" of N2 at higher altitudes results in the preferential dissociation of 15N14N over 14N14N deeper in the atmosphere. Ultimately, this process increases the heavy/light ratio in the nitrogen photochemical product HCN compared to that in N2 [4].  The rate of photochemical loss and its contribution to 14N/15N  fractionation may vary from one atmosphere to the other. As a first step, we perform here a comparative planetology study of the fractionation due to photolytic loss of nitrogen in the atmospheres of Mars, Pluto and Titan.  Method: The Ion-Neutral-Thermal Model (INT12) originally developed for Titan [6, 7] is adopted for the atmospheric conditions of Mars and Pluto. The composition is simplified as a first-order approximation via a base 14N14N and 15N14N density profile for each planetary body. In addition, the simulated Mars atmosphere includes photon absorption by CO2 and CO as well. Temperature profiles are obtained from interpolation based on available measurements up to 250 km for Mars, and up to 2400 km for Pluto. The altitude range 600-1600 km is studied for Titan. A fixed temperature profile is assumed for Titan based on an average value obtained over 30 Cassini Titan flybys. In order to compare the impact of cross section selection on fractionation, simulations were run with both low and high resolution cross sections. Low resolution nitrogen photoabsorption cross sections used have a resolution of ~50 Å [8]. High resolution cross sections from [4] are averaged into 0.1 A bins. The average solar flux is then calculated at each planetary body for solar maximum conditions (F10.7cm=260 s.f.u.), for a solar zenith angle of 60°.  The photodissociative fractionation factor is determined using the ratio of the modeled loss rates of the heavy and light isotopologues of N2 as follows:  f = L( 15 N14 N) L(14 N14 N) ⋅ 1R      where R is the heavy/light isotopic ratio at the surface. The heavy isotope is preferentially lost from N2 when the fractionation factor is greater than 1.   Results and Discussion: As previously demonstrated for Titan [4], the use of high resolution cross sections results in a greater fractionation factor for the atmosphere of each planetary body. The effect of cross section selection is especially apparent in the case of Pluto, where the fractionation factor is 3.2 times greater with the use of high resolution N2 cross sections than with low resolution cross sections. The f value on Titan demonstrates a factor of 2.7 increase. Both Titan and Pluto show enrichment in the lighter isotope due to the preferential removal of the heavier isotope as a result of the increased photolytic efficiency. Clearly, the use of high resolution cross sections significantly changes the outcome of the modeled fractionation from an enhancement in the heavier isotope to an enhancement in the lighter isotope. On the other hand, the fractionation factor of Mars does not demonstrate much sensitivity to cross section resolution. In this case, photodissociation cannot effectively decrease the enrichment of 14N/15N in the heavier isotope caused by escape.   The latter effect of cross sections is also apparent from the altitude profiles of the isotopic photodissociation coefficient ratios (Fig. 1). The HR profile of Mars,   Figure 1.

Titan and Pluto demonstrates a peak at 140 km, 860 km and 500 km, respectively. There is also indication of a secondary maximum at 100 km in the case of Pluto. This may just be an artifact of the temperature profile used for Pluto, and requires further study.

LR and HR values were calculated using low resolution and high resolution photoabsorption cross sections, respectively.   Conclusions: Photolytic fractionation can be effectively modeled using high resolution N2 cross sections. Our preliminary results show that the dissociative fractionation seen at Titan and Pluto is significantly more effective than at Mars. Mars' atmosphere is predominantly CO2, where the N2 column density is almost 2 orders of magnitude lower than the total atmospheric column density. Hence, the column density of N2 is too low to provide effective isotopic self-shielding on Mars. The atmospheric profile of Mars reflects the influence of diffusive separation. This effect is also present on Titan and Pluto, but is overwhelmed by the effect of the cross sections. However, dissociative fractionation cannot be taken in isolation from the overall photochemistry. To determine overall photochemical fractionation factors, chemistry in the atmospheres of Mars, Pluto, and Titan must be included in the model, especially at and below the altitudes of maximum fractionation (Fig. 1). In addition, nitrate and nitrate mineral deposition may play an important role, and could perhaps mitigate the fractionation due to escape on Mars. An in-depth study of nitrate and nitrate mineral deposition is therefore needed to quantify its possible contribution to the photochemical fractionation of nitrogen.  A detailed study of photochemical fractionation on Pluto and Mars is currently underway. It will involve better constrained temperature and density profiles for Pluto and Mars, as well as testing the effect of the solar cycle on fractionation. The task is particularly timely in light of the upcoming arrival of the New Horizons spacecraft to the Pluto system in July 2015. Possible measurements by Alice onboard New Horizons [9] include 14N/15N in N2. Such results combined with estimates of atmospheric escape on Mars, Pluto and Titan will provide insight into the formation conditions and origin of these planetary bodies. References: [1] Mandt K.
