BOPPS RAPID RESPONSE PLANETARY SCIENCE: FIRST RESULTS.  A. F. Cheng1, C.A. Hibbitts1, P. Bernasconi1, and E. F. Young2, 1JHU/APL, Laurel, Maryland (andrew.cheng@jhuapl.edu), 2SwRI, Boulder, Colorado   Introduction:  The first ever images of comets from a stratospheric balloon observatory have been obtained by the Balloon Observation Platform for Planetary Science (BOPPS) mission, which observed the Oort Cloud comets C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring) and C/2014 E2 (Jacques) on September 26, 2014. Previous work on the potential of stratospheric balloon platforms to obtain new and high value planetary science [1] has shown that a one meter aperture telescope, with a pointing system that achieves one arcsecond or better pointing stability, and an imaging instrument suite covering the near ultraviolet to mid infra-red spectrum from 300 to 5000 nm wavelengths, can make significant contributions towards addressing important questions in the Planetary Science Decadal Survey [2]. BOPPS flew such an instrument suite and pointing system, with a telescope of 0.8-m aperture. Stratospheric balloon-borne telescopes have the advantages that observations are obtained from above 99.5% of the atmosphere at 30-35 km float altitudes, with rapid program response to targets of opportunity and at low cost compared to space and airborne missions, with additionally the ability to retrieve the balloon payloads and refly them. Background:  BOPPS was developed in 8 months by a team from NASA Glenn Research Center, Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and the Southwest Research Institute. The main objective of BOPPS was to observe an Oort Cloud Comet, C/2013 Siding Spring, shortly before its extraordinary close encounter with Mars which was observed by a fleet of spacecraft at Mars and at Earth. Comet Siding Spring passed within 100,000 km of Mars on Oct 19, 2014; BOPPS observed the comet on Sept. 26, 2014, when the comet was 114 million km from Mars. The Oort Cloud is a distant repository of material little changed since the formation of the solar system. Oort Cloud comets are pristine, icy bodies that have never been heated by passing close to the Sun. Instrumentation:  The BOPPS instrument suite consisted of two instruments, the BIRC near-infrared, multispectral imager [3] and the UVVis nearultraviolet and visible imager system which had two cameras and a fine guiding system with a fast steering mirror. The BIRC primary objective was to measure the H2O and CO2 emissions from the comet coma to help understand the comet’s origins and its activity. BIRC used a commercial camera with an HgCdTe array detector operating at about 62K with an integrated cryostat and control electronics. The BIRC instrument included a nine-position filter wheel and relay optics, all cooled by liquid nitrogen. BIRC is mounted on a separate optical bench from UVVis. The UVVis instrument is mounted on its own optical bench with a two-position mirror that directs light either to UVVis or to BIRC. The primary UVVis objectives were to demonstrate the ability of the fine guiding system to stabilize pointing to the sub-arcsec level and specifically to demonstrate 10 milliarcsecond error signal generation at 20 Hz and fast steering mirror corrections at 5 Hz.  BOPPS was launched from Fort Sumner, NM on September 25th, 2014 with primary objectives to observe Comet Siding Spring just before its Mars encounter and to demonstrate sub arcsec pointing capability (Fig. 1). The launch time was delayed to 0830 by ground-level wind conditions which shortened the time for commissioning and left insufficient time to acquire morning targets (Vesta and comet C/2012 K1 PanSTARRS). The Siding Spring observations were obtained at altitudes above 120,000 ft prior to sunset in twilight conditions, with the comet at low elevation, only approximately 10 degrees elevation angle. BOPPS also obtained observations of a second bright Oort Cloud Comet, C/2014 E2 Jacques, the dwarf planet Ceres which is by far the largest member of the asteroid main belt, and several bright stars including Polaris. Observations.  A summary of targets successfully observed by BOPPS in the near infrared and visible is given in Table 1.  Table 1. BOPPS targets detected by BIRC  BOPPS detected Comet Siding Spring in R-band near 640 nm wavelength and in near infrared filters at wavelengths of 2.47 µm, 2.7 µm and 4.0 µm for measuring water vapor emissions. The comet brightness in R-band was at magnitude R=10.6 in a photometric aperture of 14 arc sec. The inferred H2O production rate from Comet Siding Spring was 4 x 1027 /sec. Results of BOPPS near infrared observations of Jacques and Ceres will be presented and discussed. 1409.pdf

The UVVis instrument on BOPPS successfully demonstrated the capability of the fine pointing system while imaging Polaris in daytime. UVVis achieved 33 and 58 milli-arcsecond stabilization on Polaris in the instrument azimuth and elevation directions, respectively. During this observation the rms spread in centroid positions was 2-3 arcseconds, which is a measure of the BOPPS gondola pointing stability. The gondola pointing stability of the telescope improved at night, with pointing errors < 1 arcsecond over 15 minutes while guiding on a sidereal target (Figure 2).
