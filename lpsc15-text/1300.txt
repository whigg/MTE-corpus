Carbonaceous chondrites are known to contain a diverse suite of organic compounds including those are essential in biology [2]. Those molecular complexities have also leaded to the suggestion that complex organic synthesis likely occurred within meteorite parent bodies (asteroids) during aqueous alteration [2]. Aqueous environments on the asteroids likely provide favorable conditions for the prebiotic molecule syntheses due to (1) expected higher concentrations of reactive molecules including formaldehyde and ammonia compared with conventional hydrospheres such as Earth's ocean, (2) coexistence of various mineral species including phyllosilicates and sulfide which would provide reaction surfaces and/or catalytic activities, and (3) warm (~0-150°C) and weak basic condition (pH712) [3] that are favorable for organic syntheses. Formaldehyde condenses to produce a variety of sugars and sugar alcohols, in neutral to slightly basic aqueous solution, which is known as formose reaction (e.g., [4]). Heating of formaldehyde with the presence of ammonia, also yields amino acids [5,6]. Further condensation of formaldehyde and sugars yields black organic solids similar to the insoluble organic matter (IOM) in the carbonaceous chondrites [7], and with the presence of ammonia, IOM-like complex macromolecular organic matter containing pyrrole- and pyridinelike moieties is produced [8]. Here we focus in particular on the formation of prebiotic organic molecules possibly synthesized on the asteroids starting with formaldehyde and ammonia.  Fig.1: ESI-TOF/MS spectra in (a) ESI+ and (b) ESI- mode of the reaction products at 90°C for 3 hours.  Experiments:  We conducted hydrothermal experiments starting with formaldehyde and ammonia with the presence of glycolaldehyde and calcium hydroxide as catalysts at 90 and 150°C for 72 hours, following the organic solids synthesis in [8]. The reaction products in the liquid fractions were analyzed using an electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI-TOFMS), and ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (IE-HPLC) specific for amino acid analysis with and without acid hydrolysis.

Results and Discussion:  Negative- and positivemode ESI mass spectra of the liquid fraction of the reaction products at 90°C are shown in Fig. 1. Kendrick mass defect (KMD) analysis (Fig. 2) is very useful in revealing its compositional diversity [9]; Kendrick mass (KM) = (m/z) × (nominal mass of [CH2 etc.])/(exact mass of [CH2 etc.]) KMD = nominal KM - KM The horizontal lines in the plot (where each dot corresponds to a peak in a mass spectrum) indicate common repeat units, e.g., CH2, NH, and H2CO.  The KMD diagrams of liquid fraction of the reaction products at 90°C implies that the methylene (CH2), amine (NH) and aldehyde (H2CO) groups are dominant in their structures. The mass spectra indicate the presences of sugars (CnH2nOn), sugar acids (CnH2nOn+1), dehydrated sugars (CnH2n-2On-1) (Fig. 1b), and C5H6N2+nCH2 series that are likely aliphatic- and/or amino-substituted benzenes/pyridines/pyrimidines (Fig. 1a).  Fig.3: Amino acid analysis of the reaction products at 150°C for 3 hours. Glu: glutamic acid, Gly: glycine, Ala: alanine, βAla: β-alanine, β-AIB: β-aminoisobutyric acid, γ-ABA: γaminobutyric acid.  Fig. 3 shows the chromatograms of amino acid analysis from the liquid fraction of the reaction products at 150°C with and without acid hydrolysis (6M HCl at 110°C for 24 hours). Each peak in the chromatograms was identified by comparison with amino acid reference standards (type AN-II and type B, Wako). Glutamic acid, glycine, alanine and β-alanine were detected before acid hydrolysis (as 'free' amino acid). β-aminoisobutyric acid and γ-aminobutyric acid were detected in addition to them after acid hydrolysis. Total amino acid abundance were also higher after acid hydrolysis compared to without acid hydrolysis, suggesting that amino acids in the reaction products were largely in the forms of amino acid precursor molecules. We compered the relative amino acid abundances in the products with those reported in Murchison meteorites [10], and found that both had somewhat similar trend, although relative abundances of alanine and βalanine in the products were higher than those in Murchison (Fig. 4). These plots compare only the trend of amino acid abundance, but if an attempt is made to compare the quantitative abundance of glycine; 1 g of Murchison contains ~7 μg of glycine and ~20 mg of IOM [10], whereas one can calculate that the reaction products contain ~20 μg glycine in the same aliquot containing 20 mg of solid fraction.

Conclusions: We have been exploring the possible pathway to the formation of prebiotic organic molecules starting with formaldehyde and ammonia during aqueous alteration. We have so far found amino acids, sugars and sugar related compounds, and possibly nitrogen bearing heterocyclic compounds and/or anilines. These molecules might have produced by melting of ice grains containing simple organic molecules.
