THEMIS-DERIVED THERMAL INERTIA: IMPROVEMENTS TO A FUNDAMENTAL DATASET. R.L. Fergason1, J.R. Laura1, T.M. Hare1, 12255 N. Gemini Dr., Flagstaff, Arizona 86001, rfergason@usgs.gov       Introduction: The integration of accurate, quantitative information from thermal inertia datasets with high resolution visible images is a powerful analysis technique to understand the surface and shallow subsurface of Mars. The derivation of accurate surface temperature and thermophysical properties, with well quantified uncertainties, has proven essential for selecting scientifically interesting and safe landing site locations [e.g., 1-4] and to understand past and present martian geologic processes such as the definitive identification of bedrock, the recognition of indurated surfaces, unconsolidated fines, and dust [e.g., 1; 5-22]. The Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS [23]) provides the highest spatial resolution for a globally available thermophysical dataset. The integration of the THEMIS infrared dataset with higher resolution topographic and atmospheric information used in the derivation of thermal inertia, directly results in a more accurate and scientifically useful composite product.      This work builds upon the recently-released THEMIS-derived global thermal inertia mosaic, which resulted in both an 8-bit qualitative and 32-bit quantitative THEMIS-derived thermal inertia global product [24]. Through these mosaics, THEMISderived thermal inertia data was made available to the public at a 100 m/pixel scale, and these products are excellent for facilitating the mapping of surface physical properties, obtaining first-order thermal inertia values of a surface, and ingesting thermal inertia information into models and searching algorithms [24]. This current work is the next step in bringing THEMIS-derived thermal inertia data to the science community, and addresses many of the limitations inherent in the mosaics (such as the assumption of flat topography and input datasets having a courser spatial resolution than the THEMIS infrared data). This abstract reports our current progress in the development and implementation of these improvements, including: 1) deriving local slope and slope azimuth information at 100-200 meter spatial scales and implementing these new datasets as input parameters, and 2) developing improvements to the interpolation software for mapping thermal inertia, to allow additional input parameters to be incorporated in an automated manner. These improvements will result in the cutting-edge ability to derive thermal inertia from THEMIS data, provide a more accurate thermophysical dataset to the planetary science community, enable fundamental science questions to be more fully addressed, and support increased accuracy in landing site characterization.      Improved local slope and slope azimuth information: The addition of higher resolution local slope and slope azimuth data as input datasets allows more accurate thermal inertia values to be derived along sloping features, such as crater walls, enabling important science questions to be more fully addressed.  We have generated global slope (0° to 90°) and slope azimuth (0°to 360°) maps by integrating existing High-Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC [25]) Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) into Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA [26-27] DEMs. The merging of these datasets allows for simplicity in automating the generation of thermal inertia values, and the usefulness of this product can be realized by the science community. HRSC DEMs are generated with a typical spatial resolution of ~50 m/pixel or less depending on the resolution of input images [28], whereas MOLA is released at 463 m/pixel spatial resolution globally. When HRSC DEM coverage is available (50 m/pixel) it is far superior to the MOLA DEM, which can contain kilometer-wide interpolated gaps from the original MOLA shot data.       We have mosaicked available HRSC DEMs (~40% of the planet; Figure 1) into the global 128 pixel/degree MOLA DEM. HRSC DEMs are very well registered to the MOLA DEM, yet along the HRSC/MOLA seams there are differences in the elevation values. Thus, several pixels along the edges are blended, using bilinear resampling to either upsample the MOLA DEMs or down-sample the HRSC DEMs, to maintain a smooth transition between the two datasets while preserving data integrity and accuracy. When the borders still contain vertical jumps between the two datasets, we also buffer the border around the HRSC edge and run an iterative low-pass filter only within a defined distance to/from the edge. Slope and aspect are then calculated in ISIS3 using a 3x3 Horne method with the addition of correcting for  Figure 1.

scale as the latitude moves away from the equator [29]. The final resolution of the merged DEM is 100-200 m/pixel, which is a significant improvement over MOLA and at a spatial resolution comparable to THEMIS IR data.      Advanced interpolation algorithm: The standard technique used to derive thermal inertia from THEMIS data converts THEMIS band 9 temperatures to thermal inertia by successive interpolation using a 7dimensional look-up table [11]. To incorporate additional input parameter values and improve the accuracy of the THEMIS-derived thermal inertia dataset, the KRC thermal model [30] has been utilized to generate a 10-dimensional look-up table (Table 1). In contrast to previous work, prior to generation a parameter space search was performed to find a best fit distribution of node spacing in an effort to both reduce interpolation error and improve computational performance. Once generated, the lookup table is loaded into a Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) data cube, which is optimized for high performance, scalable storage of numerical data. Interpolation methods (Table 1) have been selected to balance computational cost with accuracy. All interpolations are forced through the known data nodes. The most expensive, monotonic cubic interpolation is used only in instances where quadratic or cubic interpolations caused significant deviations from known constraints (e.g. significant 'overshoot' to minimum model temperature). Initial testing shows the maximum off node interpolation error to be between 0.02º K and 0.48º K. The maximum interpolation error, 0.48º K, is observed in the time dimension and intentionally forced to the evening twilight. That is, error is minimized in the predawn and dawn hours at the cost of increased twilight error.  Parameter Nodes Interp.

While optimized for THEMIS, this pipeline is extensible such that modification for the inclusion of future datasets is relatively minor.  Performance testing for full image processing is underway with the goal of leveraging on disk caching, in-memory memoization, and parallel processing techniques to provide a robust processing pipeline for the planetary science community. Additionally, the quantification of error propagation through ten sequential interpolations remains to be completed.      References: [1] Fergason R. L. et al.
