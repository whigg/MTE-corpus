CONFIRMATION OF AN ISOTOPICALLY LIGHT CHLORINE SOLAR NEBULA AND USE OF CHLORINE ISOTOPES AS A SENSITIVE RECORDER OF MARTIAN CRUSTAL CONTAMINATION  J. T. Williams1, Z. D. Sharp1, C.K. Shearer 1,2 and C. B. Agee1,2. 1Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87131 (jtw14@unm.edu). 2Institute of Meteoritics, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87131.   Introduction:  Previous measurements of Cl isotopes in primitive meteorites, Earth, and Moon have been interpreted as indicating that the chlorine isotopic composition (δ37Cl) of the Solar Nebula is approximately 0‰ and is a uniform reservoir [1,2]. Recent data of Martian meteorites have suggested that the Mars has a Cl isotopic composition lighter than any previously measured body [3,4]. This suggests that the material accreted to form Mars is different than that of Earth [3], the Moon [2,3], and Carbonaceous Chondrites [15] and is further suggestive of Cl isotope heterogeneities in the Solar Nebula. Supporting this idea is an anomalously low LL Chondrite Parnallee (-4.09 ‰) and CAI sodalite inclusions from Allende (-2 to -.4 ‰)[2].  Previous δ37Cl data of Martian meteorites have been interpreted as indicating that Mars contains at least two chlorine reservoirs; a light Cl isotope mantle (≈-4 to -2 ‰) and a heavy crust (>0 ‰) [3,4]. At odds with this interpretation is that the bulk Tissint, a mantle derived depleted olivine-phyric shergottite, has a δ37Cl of -0.6 ‰ and apatite in the matrix of Chassigny has a δ37Cl of +0.35 ‰. Tissint contains two components, which may record the Cl isotopic composition of two distinct reservoirs: an impact glass representing the crust and a magmatic assemblage representing the Martian mantle. Rare gas signatures of Chassigny have been interpreted as representing the Martian mantle [5] and therefore appears to be decoupled from the crustal signature implied from the δ37Cl of the apatite.    In the study we present new data for Martian meteorites NWA 817 (Nahklite), NWA 2737 (Chassignite), Tissint (Olivine-phyric Shergottite), and two unaltered, lowest metamorphic grade [6], 3.00 L Chondrites NWA 8276 and NWA 7731. The intent of this study is to better define the Cl isotope reservoirs in both Mars and the Solar Nebula. Methods: All isotope measurements are reported in standard delta notation relative to Standard Mean Ocean Chloride (SMOC). Data reported here are bulk structural Cl and water-soluble Cl analyses. Methods for Cl extraction and analysis are the same as described by [1,2,3]. Errors are based on daily standard reproducibility (1σ); ± .35‰.  Results:  Previous measurements of bulk Tissint of -0.6 ‰ were reexamined in detail by analyzing δ37Cl of the different components in the meteorite. The structurally bound δ37Cl in Tissint separates were much lighter than the bulk Tissint we previous reported [3,4] (igneous component -2.96‰ and impact glass component -2.17‰) (Figure 1). Analysis of the water-soluble fractions of the glass and igneous components were both heavier than the previously reported bulk Tissint [3,4] (igneous +0.04‰ and glass -0.43‰). The majority of the Cl from Tissint was water soluble (about 75%). A mass balance calculation of all Cl fractions analyzed produced the same bulk measurement as previously reported within error.  Figure 1: δ37Cl of Tissint separates and bulk rock   Analysis of NWA817 and NWA2737 yielded results of .38‰ and -3.85‰ respectively, placing them both into the appropriate previously discussed Cl reservoirs, see Figure 2. Analyses of 3.00 L Chondrites NWA7731 and NWA8276 yielded results of -.75‰ and -4.52‰ respectively. NWA8276 is now the lightest δ37Cl measured in a planetary body, see Figure 2.   Figure 2: δ37Cl of all measured bodies discussed here Discussion:  The additional data presented here provide further insights into the distinct Cl isotope reservoirs on Mars and the potential for multiple Cl isotope reservoirs in the Solar Nebula.  2641.pdf

The heavy Cl in the water-soluble component in Tissint is interpreted as a Martian soil-like component that was incorporated into the Tissint lithology during impact. We interpret the heavy Cl isotope composition of Nahklite NWA 817 as also representing a crustal component and is consistent with other Nahklites previously analyzed by [3,4].  The light Cl signature of the bulk impact glass and olivine-phyric basalt lithology represents the igneous component in Tissint. NWA 2737, a Chassignite, has a light Cl signature. This is consistent with the Martian mantle noble gas ratios identified in Chassigny [5], but appears to be inconsistent with Cl isotope measurements made in matrix apatite in Chassigny [3,4]. Shearer et al. [4] postulated that this discrepancy is the result of the Chassigny matrix containing a crustal component, whereas the melt inclusions hosted in olivine contain the mantle noble gas component and presumably the mantle Cl component. This light Cl component in Tissint and NWA 2737 is consistent with a light Cl isotope mantle.   All of these new data confirm the existence of two distinct Martian Cl reservoirs, and that Cl isotopes are a recorder of crustal contamination for mantle derived Martian basalts.  The Olivine-phyric Shergottites, and Chassignite represent the light Cl mantle component, while the Nahklites and   NWA7034 represent the heavy Cl crustal component. The basaltic shergottites represent mantle-derived magmas with varying degrees of assimilation or mixing of the crustal component. The mechanism for the creation of the heavy crustal component is likely due to atmospheric loss through time, as with other isotope systems. Another possibility is anhydrous degassing, similar to what has been proposed for the Moon. A fundamental observation for Mars is that the light Cl isotope mantle is distinctly different than the Earth, Moon, and chondritic meteorites. Sharp et al. [3] interpreted these differences to indicate that Mars accreted from different material from an isotopically light Cl reservoir in the Solar Nebula. In addition to the light Cl isotopic composition of Mars, the δ37Cl of NWA 8276 supports the existence of an isotopically light Cl reservoir in the Solar Nebula. Because this chondrite is relatively unaltered by fluids, the δ37Cl of NWA 8276 may record a more primitive solar δ37Cl. This implies that all other bodies with a δ37Cl heavier than ≈-4‰ had been altered by an incorporation of a heavy Cl material, or had been processed in another manner. The δ37Cl of NWA 8276 is similar to values measured from LL 3.6 Chondrite Parnallee and the Sodalite inclusions from Allende. The Sodalite inclusions represent secondary mineral assemblages in CAI's but probably formed early on (<1.5My) as shown by [7].  These inclusions have an excess of 36S, corresponding to the decay of the shortlived isotope 36Cl [7]. In addition, the maximum theoretical δ37Cl fractionation calculated by [8] for Sodalite formation in the Nebula was 0.7‰, which cannot account for the range seen in δ37Cl in these inclusions.  The heavy reservoir in the solar nebula may be produced through the process proposed by [9]. They proposed that chondrites have incorporated HCl ice, evidenced by acidic reactions. HCl hydrate is stable in a cool Solar nebula at 140 to 160°K as HCl 3H2O. At this temperature, the theoretical fractionation calculated by [8] is on the order of 3-6‰ by interaction with surrounding HCl gas. If the temperature of the Nebula rose after this fractionation, or the body moved to warmer region, then the resulting heavy acidic fluid would be incorporated. These observations also suggests that ordinary chondrite volatile element ratios may better represent a proxy for Solar compositions.  This light Cl isotope component may have resided in Mars as a result of variations in early accretion. Mars has been described as a planetary embryo [10] and it has been suggested that it may have been cut off from accretion during the "Grand Tack" event [11]. The Earth may have originally sourced the same light δ37Cl  reservoir as Mars, but heavy δ37Cl Chondritic material accreted later to Earth had been aqueously altered by incorporation of HCl hydrate and therefore raised the  δ37Cl and Cl budget. Or later processing associated with accretion raised the δ37Cl on Earth by preferential loss of 35Cl. References: [1] Sharp, Z.D. and Draper, D.S. (2013) EPSL 369-370, 71-77. [2] Sharp, Z.D. et al.
