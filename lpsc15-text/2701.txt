SPECTRAL ANALYSIS OF CARBONATE DEPOSITS AT NILI FOSSAE, MARS  A. J. Brown1, J.L. Bishop1and C. Viviano-Beck2, 1SETI Institute, 189 N. Bernardo Ave, Mountain View, CA 94043 abrown@seti.org, 2AppliedPhysics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University, Laurel, MD 20723.Introduction:  Given the unique role of carbonatein preservation of biogenic signatures on Earth,  understanding the nature and disposition of carbonate deposits on Mars is key to unlocking the astrobiologicalhistory and the nature of past aqueous environments onthe Red planet [1].CRISM has detected Mg-carbonate at Nili Fossae[2] and small amounts of carbonate have also been discovered by Spirit and CRISM at Gusev Crater [3,4].The carbonates have been found in combination withtalc and saponite [5, 6]. Here we begin a program ofnumerical discovery to learn more about the signaturesof carbonate spectra located in Nili Fossae in the hopeof better characterizing their formation processes.Methods: Brown et al. [6] carried out an analysisof the 2.3 and 2.5 micron bands of carbonate for oneCRISM image (FRT40FF). Here we extend that analysis by applying a similar technique to other carbonatebearing images. We report the findings for CRISMFRT image 9D44 (Figure 1) here.For each pixel in the image, the steps of the analy sis are as follows:1.) We first use DISORT to carry out an inversionprocedure and create a model surface albedo [7].2.) Second, using the spectrum from the DISORTbased inversion, we determine the asymmetry of the2.3 and 2.5 bands using the formula suggested in [6]:Results: Figure 2 shows an example of the resultswe have obtained so far. The test image is FRT 9D44,which is taken from the southern reaches of Nili Fossae, near 20°N, 73°E.      Figure 1 – CRISM FRT 9D44 showing the edge of an escarpment of Nili Fossae to the right and Syrtis Major plainsto the west. Image is approximately 10km across.Figure 2 – (top) BDCARB index for CRISM FRT 9D44(bottom) 2.3 micron centroid image.Figure 2 (top) shows the BDCARB index, whichshows the strength of the 2.3 micron band, which hereis most likely due to carbonate. Figure 2 (bottom)shows the centroid of the asymmetric 2.3 micron band,showing some variation, possibly due to Fe-Mg-OHsubstitution. The regions in white show a large 2.3 micron band. Note the sharp contact on the west is due tohe edge of the escarpment and the strongest carbonatefeatures occur at the top level exposure of the Fossae.Figure 3 shows a DISORT corrected surface albedoof one of the hotspot locations of the BDCARB index,at x=296,y=170. Some residual atmospheric signaturesare still visible at 2 microns, and the spectral rangefrom 2.65-2.8 microns has been omitted due to CRISMirregularities in that region. Relatively strong 2.3 and2.5 bands are readily visible. A secondary 2.4 micronband is present, likely due to the presence of talc [5].

Location of 9D44 in Figures 1 and 2 isshown by red triangle.Association of Talc and carbonate: Two recentstudies have uncovered corroborating spectral evidencefor talc in Nili Fossae on Mars using the CRISM spectrometer on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Inspired byfieldwork in the Pilbara region of Western Australia,Brown et al. [4] suggested talc was present in some locations where saponite had been identified in the earlier study by Ehlmann et al. [8]. Viviano et al. [6] thenfound an identifying marker for talc vs. saponite whichconfirmed the presence of talc and mapped the loca tions of the mineral signature using this spectral feature. The results of her mapping are shown in Figure 4.Talc, Mg3Si2O5(OH)4 is an important mineralfor identifying processes of hydrothermal alteration inultramafic sequences in the Archean greenstone beltson Earth [9], and has been suggested to be evidence forhigh ocean temperatures in the past [10]. As an alter ation mineral of Mg-olivine it is likely to play the samerole on Mars [11]. Potential Terrestrial analogs: Serpentine andmagnetite are by-products of the reaction from Mgolivine to talc. Talc has also been found in associationwith actinolite in hydrothermal vent systems such asthat at the Lost City hydrothermal field [12]. In the Pilbara craton in Western Australia, talc has been foundreplacing Mg-olivine in komatiite cumulate zones inultramafic sections of the Dresser Formation [9].    New Martian alteration class. McSween et al.[13] followed up the talc discovery recognizing talccarbonate as forming one of six alteration classes inevidence at Nili Fossae.Figure 5 shows a geological timeline for the NiliFossae region based on recent global scale maps ofMars [14]. It is the aim of this study to examine formation hypotheses associated with the Syrtis Major lavaflows to the potential primordial Martian crust thatmight be accessible at Nili Fossae.Figure 5. Geological framework at Nili FossaeAstrobiological Implications: Early Mars andEarth had hotter mantles in their early stages of formation [15], following overturn of their respective magmaoceans, when life began on Earth and may have startedon Mars [16]. The presence of talc (particularly incombination with carbonate) is consistent with hydrothermal alteration of ultramafic rocks in an ocean-floorsetting [10], and may lead the way to astrobiologicallyrich regions on Mars.As discussed by Mustard et al. [17], Nili Fossaecontains ancient crust on Mars that includes pre-Isidisbasement rocks and post-Isidis brecciated materials.This complex history will be challenging to interpret,but interpret it we must, because it may constitute a geological time capsule within which we can examineour own origins.Acknowledgements: This work is partly funded bythe NASA Astrobiology Institute, through the SETI Institute team led by PI Nathalie Cabrol.References: [1] Niles, P.B. et al.
