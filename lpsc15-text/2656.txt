Introduction:  Gale crater, the landing site for the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover, was selected primarily due to its large interior mountain (informally known as Mt. Sharp) which contains roughly flat lying sediments as seen from orbit [1]. Many studies have sought to explain the formation of Mt. Sharp. Formation hypotheses proposed include deposition of lacustrine sediments, aeolian deposition or  ash fall [210]. Some of these hypotheses therefore require significant transport of material from the Gale rim and beyond. Interestingly, en route to Mt. Sharp, MSL observed feldspar rich lithologies in several float rocks presumed to have come from the Gale rim [11, 12].  Previously, Peace Vallis and its associated alluvial fan have been characterized for their contributions to the material observed near the MSL landing site [13].  Peace Vallis is not unique, as other regions along the Gale rim also have morphologies indicating downhill, potentially fluvial, sedimentary transport. Impact cratering has also excavated bedrock and sediment associated with the Gale rim. The goal of our study is to identify the composition and stratigraphy of bedrock and sedimentary materials in the immediate vicinity of Gale crater, which likely contributed to materials explored by Curiosity. Methods: All of our geologic mapping is done on a Context Camera (CTX) base layer and where possible High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) images have been incorporated. We used CTX and HiRISE (both color and grayscale) to trace out morphological boundaries. Spectroscopic data from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) instrument were examined to identify and map distinct compositional units. We have processed all available CRISM images along the Gale rim. We are currently in the process of incorporating data from the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) through the use of thermal emissivity profiles, decorrelation stretches, and thermal inertia derivations. We have replicated the methods of [14] and [15] in an attempt to identify any felsic materials in the Gale rim.   Results: We have distinguished several unique units on the basis of geomorphology and composition as well as determined some of the stratigraphic relationships between them (Fig. 1, preliminary map). A significant amount of material on the Gale floor has been transported either from the wall, rim, or beyond, as is evidenced by multiple large areas of material with morphologies indicating downhill transport (lilac in Fig. 1) as well as inverted channels (light blue in Fig. 1) and filled depressions (blue-green in Fig. 1) emanat ing from multiple locations on the rim. Some of these flows onlap older, heavily cratered capping units and each other.   A large crater (Fig. 1, ejecta blanket in orange; Fig. 2) provides a view into the Gale crater rim units.  This crater impacts the wall and floor of Gale.  The upslope side of the crater wall is significantly more competent and intact than that on the opposite wall, perhaps implicating impact-excavation of debris covering the wall or Gale floor units (Fig. 2). CRISM data of the ejecta and wallrock show hydrated minerals and olivine. Additional detections in Fig. 1 are olivine within a small outcrop of the Gale rim in CRISM image C95A [16] and hydrated materials on the Gale floor in CRISM scene 28B4.  We have conducted a similar exercise on a small crater on the southern wall of Gale, imaged by CRISM scene B5A3. Similar to the northern Gale rim, the southern Gale rim has many valleys and fans emanating from it. The amount of material sourced from outside of the crater appears to be significantly greater than on the northern wall, as the wall appears terraced by sediments of different ages. There are also well defined channels cutting through the southern Gale rim. The entire B5A3 CRISM scene has relatively strong mafic signatures with especially distinct olivine signatures in the ejecta from this small crater [17].  We have also found hydrated materials associated with small areas in the crater ejecta as well as associated with a peculiar blocky landslide to the west.  We do not find this hydrated mineral signature within the small crater itself (although the rim is well preserved) nor within the channels dissecting the region.  Our search specifically for the felsic materials presumed to have been sourced from the northern Gale rim did not return any positive results.  We replicated the CRISM band combinations of [15] as well as the decorrelation stretches of [14] for the Gale rim and did not observe any silica rich areas.  These methods did however lead us to the identification of additional regions along the Gale rim with potential mafic signatures.       Discussion: We have identified mafic and hydrated mineral signatures in multiple units on the Gale rim. Mapping is ongoing to determine how these units relate to the rim rock and the floor units being explored by MSL. However, the abundance of mafic material in B5A3 as well as the presence of it in the rim bedrock in C95A is indicative of Gale being emplaced in mafic bedrock, consistent with findings regionally [16].  The stratigraphy observed in our two map areas indicates that material has been coming into Gale crater from the surrounding region in multiple episodes of transport.
