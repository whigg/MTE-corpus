The FGRs in ordinary chondrites are finer-grained and more compact than the chondrite matrix [4] and may contain precursor solids from which chondrules formed [5]. The rims may either represent records of chondrite accretion postdating chondrule formation and predating the accretion of chondrite parent bodies [2], or be a result of asteroidal compaction processes [6]. The FGRs and matrix are thought to represent complimentary fractions of a single reservoir from which most chondritic components formed [7,8].  Microchondrules (defined as ≤40µm in diameter by [9,10] are common, yet poorly understood components of  type I FGRs in unequilibrated ordinary chondrites [1-3,10-12]. The lack of microchondrules in the rims of type II chondrules from UOCs suggests different liquidus temperatures, dynamic conditions and/or gasto-dust dust ratios compared to type I chondrules from UOCs. Hypotheses for microchondrule formation, include splattering or spallation of material from larger chondrules, separated protuberances from partially molten parent chondrules or melting of FeO-rich dust in a process similar to that experienced by larger chondrules [2, 12]. Whether microchondrules formed during the same chondrule-forming event as their larger host chondrules or in entirely different events and from different precursor materials is poorly constrained. To better understand the the origin and formation of microchondrules and FGRs and how they relate to their host chondrules we analyzed the oxygen isotope composition of microchondrules and rim material from UOCs NWA 5717. Similar work on Bishunpur, MET 00526 and Semarkona is proceeding.  Sample: Northwest Africa 5717 (NWA 5717) is an ungrouped UOC (type 3.05) [13], with ~60% of all chondrules in NWA 5717 having well-defined FGRs, and of these, ~ 20% contain microchondrules [2,3]. Microchondrules surrounding two ~500 µm size chondrules were analyzed together with sulfide-poor FGR material (Fig. 1 and 2).  Figure 1. Backscatter electron (BSE) image of radial pyroxene chondrule C3, in UOC NWA 5717, enclosed by sulfide-rich FGR.   Figure 2. BSE image of porphyritic enstatite chondrule C47 enclosed by FG-sulfide-'poor' rim. The chondrule is surrounded by an abundance of microchoondrules.   Analytical Methods: The oxygen isotope composition of microchondrules in UOC NWA5717 was measured using a Cameca NanoSIMS 50 at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. A ~11 pA Cs+ primary beam with a diameter of 200-300 nm was rastered over 2×2 µm2 areas (Fig. 3). Charge compensation was achieved using a ~200 nA electron beam. We simultaneously measured 16O− on a Faraday cup and 17O−, 18O−, and 28Si− on electron multipliers. A mass resolving power of ~7000 was used to minimize the contribution from 16O1H− to 17O−. Instrumental mass fractionation was determined by measuring matrix matched terrestrial standards. The propagated uncertainties of our measurements on Δ17O were ~4‰ (2σ).   Figure 3. BSE image showing examples of NanoSIMS analysis locations (squares) in the microchondrules. The image corresponds to the inset on the right-hand side in Fig. 2.  Results: Two small chondrules in the rim of chondrule C3 (Fig.1) and eight micro-chondrules in the rim of chondrule C47 (Fig.2), have within uncertainty the same Δ17O composition as the larger host chondrule (Fig 4 and 5). Two analyses of the FGR material adjacent to chondrule C47 also have within uncertainty the same Δ17O composition as the surrounding microchondrules and host chondrule.   Figure 4. NanoSIMS oxygen isotope data for C3 host chondrule and two smaller chondrules in NWA 5717. Data for NWA 5717 lithologies A and B are from [14].  Discussion: Our oxygen isotope data suggest chondrules, microchondrules, and associated FGR in NWA 5717 formed from the same local nebular precursor material. Micochrondrules and fine-grained rims appear to have formed shortly after, or contemporaneously, with larger chondrules and prior to accretion on a parent body, consistent with the suggestion FGRs are representative of the dusty material that melted to form chondrules.    Figure 5. Showing oxygen isotope data for microchondrules associated with chondrule C47. Data for NWA 5717 lithologies A and B are from [14].  The O-isotope data are also consistent with all three of the hypotheses for microchondrule formation discussed above. We are exploring the application of short-lived radionuclides, 26Al-26Mg and 53Mn-53Cr, as well as variations in 18O/16O to provide additional  constraints on models of microchondrules formation.
