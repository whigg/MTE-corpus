Introduction: The Moon's surface is a key proxy for the early Earth. Since the lunar surface lacks geological activity, it preserves a static record of samples dating to the early Solar System [e.g., 1]. Brecciated lunar meteorites offer rare glimpses of a wide sampling of lunar material that is not restricted to a small sample area like the Apollo material [2- 4]. Lunar meteorites are therefore vital to our understanding of unsampled areas of the Moon and thus are crucial for understanding the development of the whole Moon and its early history [2, 5]. We have started the investigation of lunar meteorite Shisr 162, in order to improve and enlarge our knowledge of lunar highland rock types. Here we report petrography and mineral chemistry of the different lithologies present in this meteorite. Sample and Methods: Lunar meteorite Shisr 162 was found in Zufar, Oman on February 2006. This meteorite is classified as a lunar feldspathic impact-melt breccia [6]. For this project we analyzed a thin section of Shisr 162 with dimensions of approximately 13 x 6 mm (Fig. 1).

Clasts in Shisr 162 were analyzed using the electron microprobe (CAMECA SX100) housed in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH). Beam conditions were 15 kV accelerating voltage and a 1 μm beam diameter. Beam current and peak time varied for volatile and non-volatile elements: 10 nA with a peak time of 10 sec. and 20nA with peak times of 30-50 sec. respectively. Standards included well characterized natural and synthetic materials.  In addition, elemental x-ray maps for Na, Fe, K, Mg, Ca, Al, Si, S, Cr, and Ni were obtained using the SX100 at AMNH. Beam conditions were: 15kV accelerating voltage, 40 nA beam current, 1 μm beam diameter, and a step size of 5 μm. The maps were later converted into RGB maps to visualize the composition of the minerals in the thin section and to detect any changes in composition between similar clast types. Lithic and Mineral Lithologies: Shisr 162 is composed of a variety of clasts and mineral fragments. These include (in order of abundance) monomineralic clasts with a reaction rim, impact-melt breccias, granulites, monomineralic fragments, Ca-S rich amygdules, anorthosites, and Fe-Ni metal (Fig.2).   Figure 2: BSE images of various clasts found in Shisr 162. a.)Monomineralic pyroxene (Pyx) with a reaction rim of a terrestrial alteration product (Ta); b.) Monomineralic fragment; c.) Impact-melt breccia; d.) Granulite clast.  Clasts with reaction rims: Monomineralic clasts (Fig. 2a.) that exhibit a reaction rim range from 50-500 μm in diameter. Most are pyroxenes with a reaction rim of a possible terrestrial alteration product.  Impact-melt breccias: These clasts range from (1-2.3 mm in diameter) and consist of ~200 μm sized anorthite fragments and a few olivine fragments (50-100 μm in diameter) set in an anorthositic matrix that contains abundant fine grained olivine (Fig. 2c.). Granulites: Clasts with granulitic texture range in size from 300-400 μm in diameter and consist of a poikilitic-granoblastic texture of anorthitic matrix with rounded, granular olivine, some terrestrial alteration product, and a few pyroxene grains (Fig. 2d.).  40m b  Monomineralic fragments: Monomineralic fragments are abundant throughout the matrix. Olivine fragments are the most abundant while pyroxene fragments are present but sparse. Spinel and Fe-Ni metal are also present but very rare. These fragments range from < 25 to 300 μm in diameter (Fig. 2b). Ca-S rich amygdules: Amygdules containing high amounts of Ca and S were found throughout the thin section. These contain some mafic components of olivine and pyroxene but are mainly rich in Ca-S rich mineral, most likely gypsum or anhydrate. These amygdules range in size from 200-400 μm in diameter and are not very abundant. These clasts may represent a terrestrial weathering product, typical for hot desert meteorite [7,8]. Anorthositic clasts: Anorthositic clasts in the thin section of Shisr 162 are small (200-500 μm) except for one clast which is ~2.9 mm in diameter. The mafic component of these anorthosites is olivine and little to no pyroxene. Mineral chemistry: Olivine: Olivine composition within Shisr 162 varies from Fo64-Fo84 (Fo = molar Mg/(Mg+Fe)*100) and does not vary greatly within individual clasts. Impact-melt breccias and granulites have a smaller range in Fo# while anorthosites, monomineralic clasts, and clasts with reaction rims show a greater range. Pyroxene: Pyroxene is less abundant in the thin section compared to olivine. The majority of clasts containing pyroxene plot in the low Ca-pyroxene region (Fig. 3) with the exception of two monomineralic clasts with reaction rims that plot from the high Ca- (pigonite) to low Ca-pyroxene region (Fig. 3a.).   Figure 3: Quadrilateral plots showing pyroxene present in clasts within Shisr 162 (plots a & b). Most clast plot in the low Ca-pyroxene region with the exception of two clasts with reaction rims which plot in the pigonite region.  Feldspar: Plagioclase feldspar is the most abundant mineral in Shisr 162. It makes up the matrix and is found in breccias, anorthosites and granulites. All plagioclase in the clasts analyzed are anorthitic with an An# (An# = molar Ca/(Ca+Na+K)*100) ranging between An93-An97. Discussion and Conclusions: The Fe/Mn ratio in olivine within clasts in the thin section of Shisr 162 follows the trend line for lunar rocks (Fig. 4) [9], thus, confirming Shisr 162 to be of lunar origin.   Figure 4: Fe/ Mn ratio in olivine for clasts in Shisr 162. Trend-lines from [9].  The lithic clasts in Shisr 162 have a narrow range in Mg# and fall in the gap between the Mg-suite rocks and Ferroan Anorthosites similar to other lunar feldspathic meteorites [5]. Thus, Shisr 162 probably comes from an area different than the Apollo sample collection sites. In addition, no basaltic clasts were found in this thin section. The KREEP component in Shisr 162 is low [10], further supporting the evidence that this meteorite originated far away from the Procellarum KREEP Terrane.
