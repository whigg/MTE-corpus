PRECISION AND ACCURACY OF SIMULTANEOUSLY COLLECTED HIRISE DIGITAL TERRAINMODELS Sarah S. Sutton1, M. Chojnacki1, A. Kilgallon1, and the HiRISE Team. 1Lunar and Planetary Laboratory,University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona 85721 USA; smattson@pirl.lpl.arizona.eduIntroduction: High precision Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) made from High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) [1] stereo pairs are beingproduced for geomorphic and geologic analyses (e.g.[2, 3, 4]) as well as landing site assessment [5, 6, 7].In many cases, they are being used to orthorectify sequences of images, making change detection of the martian surface possible at unprecedented detail. Stereopairs separated by one or more Mars years are acquiredover selected active sites in order to attempt to quantifyvolumetric changes in topography such as dune migration [8] and gully activity [9].Here we present some examples where two HiRISEstereo pairs are controlled simultaneously in order tomeasure such changes. These special cases providean opportunity to investigate the internal precision andaccuracy of HiRISE DTMs. Quality can be affectedby spacecraft jitter, observation angles, image quality,albedo differences and illumination angles. Althoughthe dynamic range and signal-to-noise ratio of HiRISEimages are very good, the changes we wish to measureare not large and may be smaller than the differences between the DTMs. This work presents a review of vertical precision, horizontal accuracy and internal precisionin HiRISE DTMs, and what effect these values mighthave on studies of topographic change.Precision and Accuracy in Individual DTMs:Within a single HiRISE DTM, precision and accuracycan be estimated or measured by several methods.Expected vertical precision: This value can be estimated based on the observation geometry and the pixelscale, as well as the quality of the triangulation. Theformula used to derive EP is based on [10]:EP = �p ⇤ IFOV/(parallax/height)where �p is the quality of pixel matching given by theRMS error in SOCET SET (usually < 0.6 px), IFOVis the pixel scale of the stereo images in meters, and(parallax/height) can be estimated by taking the tangentof the convergence angle between the stereo images. Formost HiRISE DTMs, the EP is < 0.5 m.Horizontal precision: HiRISE DTMs are typicallygenerated at ⇠4 times the source image pixel scale (i.e.1 m/post for 30 cm/px stereo images and 2 m/post for50 cm/px images).Horizontal accuracy: HiRISE stereo pairs are controlled to laser altimetry from the Mars Orbiter LaserAltimeter (MOLA) [11], which has much lower spatialresolution (⇠150 m footprint per laser shot). In an absolute sense, the horizontal accuracy of a HiRISE DTMcannot be better than the spatial resolution of theMOLAdata set.Vertical accuracy: When controlling HiRISE stereoto MOLA, the goal is to get within ±5 m difference,with a mean difference close to 0 m. This goal is often acheived through a combination of manual and automated triangulation methods [7, 12].Error Between DTMs: In order to minimize anysubjective differences made by the operator, the mostaccurate way to create two DTMs is to control bothstereo pairs simultaneously. This ensures that static surface features are used to tie all four images together, andthat the control to the laser altimetry is identical. Theremaining differences, that are not actual topographicchange, are due to intrinsic issues as discussed beFigure 1: Difference map of two DTMs made fromthe image pairs PSP 008823 2310, PSP 009245 2310 andESP 027297 2310, ESP 027376 2310 draped over orthoimage. Color ramp indicates difference between the two DTMsin meters, red is negative, blue is positive. The main effectsare due to jitter, not topography. Note the horizontal banding, which is due to cross-track jitter. Vertical striping is dueto misalignment along CCD seams due to along-track jitter.Overall differences range between ±3 m.3010.pdf

low. Difference maps are made by subtracting the DTMmade from the more recent stereo pair from that madefrom the earlier pair. Error magnitude can be quantifiedfrom analysis of the difference map.Jitter: Spacecraft jitter (oscillations or vibrations frommoving parts on the spacecraft) causes subtle geometricdistortions in pushbroom cameras with high spatial resolution (such as HiRISE), because the images are builtline by line along the orbit track. Cross-track jitter, iflarge enough, can cause shifts in the x-direction, whichcauses mis-estimation of heights by the stereo matcher.Along-track jitter causes distortions in the y-direction,making it difficult for the stereo matcher and introducing noise into the DTM. The HiRISE camera has theadditional complicating factor of being comprised of 10Charge Coupled Devices (CCDs) in a staggered arrayacross the full swath width [1]. Despite careful opticalcalibration and jitter correction algorithms [5, 13], theeffects of spacecraft jitter are the largest source of systematic error in HiRISE DTMs. In most cases, the jitteris minimal within a single image; jitter error has beencorrected to be less than 1 µrad, or 1 pixel. However,the combined effects of even low amounts of jitter canstill have a significant effect on stereoanalysis.Image noise: Noise in HiRISE images can come fromseveral sources including: electronic noise, calibration,saturation, haze or dust in the atmosphere. Image noisehas a negative effect on the stereo matching algorithm,which introduces a noisy surface texture into the DTM,and in the worst case causes the stereo matcher to failaltogether.Case Studies:Lyot Crater gullies: These two DTMs were collectedby controlling two stereo pairs together, along with afifth image (non-stereo), with the goal of detecting anychanges in the gullies visible on the central peak of LyotCrater (Fig. 1). The two stereo pairs were collected 3Mars years apart. Jitter is the dominant source of differences between the two, as can be seen by the lowfrequency horizontal banding, with an amplitude of ±3m. The topography of the scene is not apparent in thedifference map, vaidating that the two stereo pairs arewell-controlled together.Ganges Chasma dunes: In this case, the goal is toquantify the volumetric changes in the active dunes [14]present in the scene (Fig. 2). Stereo pairs were acquired3 Mars years apart, but at similar solar longitude, in order to minimize seasonal illumination differences. Errors here are mostly due to along-track jitter, which affected mostly the non-dune areas to the left of the peaknear the center of the scene. CCD seams are visible asvertical banding, also due to along-track jitter. Other errors present in this scene are due to shadows (e.g. next tothe peak) where terrain could only be estimated in onepair. Measurable topographic change is visible alongthe leading edges of some of the dune forms. An additional consideration in HiRISE DTMs over relativelydark dunes is that they often require manual editing toresolve the dunes well, as the stereo matcher often failsover dark, featureless surfaces [8, 15].Discussion and Conclusion: The timing of stereopair acquisition should take into consideration the typesand magnitudes of potential error discussed here, aswell as the intrinsic accuracy and precision of HiRISEDTMs, as they relate to the magnitude of surfacechanges. There has been a considerable amount of datacollected documenting changes occurring on Mars today [16]. These data give us information about the ratesof changes that are happening at various landforms. Theamount and rate of these changes should determine theoptimal time separation for stereo pair acquisition in order to unambiguously quantify topographic change.References: [1] A. S. McEwen, et al.

Color ramp indicates the difference between the twoDTMs. Noise due to along-track jitter is evident as "boxes" indicated by black arrows. The large error near the peak (whitecircle) is due to a large shadow and unresolvable topographywithin it. The actual changes along dune slip faces are evident by the negative/positive changes in the direction of dunemotion (black oval).3010.pdf
