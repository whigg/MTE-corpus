Introduction: The sulfur (S) cycle is important in many geological processes on Mars [1]. Volcanic degassing, hydrothermal circulation, groundwater recharge, ephemeral surface flows, evaporation and polar weathering are all believed to play significant and unique roles in depositing the sulfate-rich minerals present on the surface of Mars [2,3,4,5]. Despite the fact that the sulfate-rich minerals on Mars provide key evidence of past fluid movement, chemistry, and potential habitability, many of the key processes controlling the hydrological S cycle on Mars remain unclear. For example, we are uncertain about the relative influence of volcanic S emissions, aqueous chemical weathering, and climate conditions on the S cycle, and we poorly understand the hydrological environment that transported S on or to the Martian surface. To address the research problems discussed above, we have been studying the modern hydrological S cycle related to volcanic S emission and aqueous chemical weathering of the large terrestrial volcanic system of Valles Caldera, New Mexico.  Analogue Setting: The 22 km-wide Valles Caldera of northern New Mexico (USA) has hosted volcanic and geothermal activity since the last calderaforming eruption at 1.25 Ma (Fig. 1). The presence of active H2S-rich fumaroles [6], volcanic sulfide-rich mineralization up to 3.4% in some locations [7], the high elevation (2,600 to 3,400 m asl), snow cover during the winter, low annual temperatures (average ~8oC), and numerous streams and ancient intracaldera lakes, make the Valles Caldera an excellent geochemical analogue for Mars. Furthermore, the availability of well-preserved and age-constrained core sediments of a mid-Pleistocene intracaldera caldera lake [8] make this site ideal for quantifying the relative contributions of S/SO42- from volcanogenic and bedrock sources and for evaluation of S preservation in the sedimentary record.  Field/Lab Methods: The amount of SO4 transported in the surface hydrological system can be determined by calculating the SO4 flux. The stream SO4 flux is determined by multiplying the streamwater SO4 concentrations by the volumetric flow rates. This flux corresponds to the mass of dissolved SO4 ions that flow out of the caldera per unit time (e.g., kg SO4 per day). The S isotope composition (δ34S) of SO4 can be used to distinguish S sources in aqueous environments. Additionally, the O isotope composition (δ18O) of SO4 can be used to understand oxidation pathways of volcanic H2S to SO4 and contributions of atmospheric O2.   Aqueous Sulfur Budget in Valles Caldera: According to the measured SO4 fluxes, our initial results imply three major SO4 sources in the studied aqueous volcanic system of Valles Caldera: 1) chemical weathering (e.g. oxidation/dissolution of hydrothermal S-rich minerals) contributing 71-86 % of SO4; 2) snowmelt contributing 9-16 % of SO4; 3) hydrothermal gas emission (oxidation of fumarolic H2S in surface environments) contributing 5-13 % of SO4.  Accumulation of Hydrothermal S-rich Gases in Snow: In order to understand the role of atmospheric SO4 deposition from hydrothermal S-rich emissions, we collected several snow samples from fumaroleactive and non-active sites in Valles Caldera. Generally, the concentrations of SO4 in snow samples collected in close proximity (a few meters) to the active fumaroles with H2S emission appeared to be slightly lower (~0.66 mg/L) when compared to other locations showing no surface evidence of fumarole exhalation (~0.94 mg/L). Considerably higher δ34S of SO4 were observed in the snow samples (+5.6 to +7.8‰) when compared to the hydrothermal H2S emission of Valles Caldera (+0.8 to +3.4‰). This suggests that most of the SO4 in the snow was sourced by non-hydrothermal sources such as dissolution of dust particles and anthropogenic pollution (+6 to +7‰). This lack of significant deposition of hydrothermal S in snow most likely resulted from quick dispersion of S-rich gases in the atmosphere.  Oxidation of hydrothermal H2S to SO4: The δ34S and δ18O of stream SO4 showed greater variation in the Sulphur Creek catchment, which has active fumaroles and elevated emission of hydrothermal H2S into stream 1303.pdf

water (-8 to +3 ‰ and -5 to +5 ‰, respectively). Other catchments with no H2S emission had less variation in δ34S and δ18O (+4 to +6 ‰ and +3 to +5 ‰, respectively) (Fig. 1). The low δ18O of SO4 at Sulphur Springs (-5 to -3 ‰) is indicative of prevailing oxidation of H2S to SO4 with water oxygen (-9 ‰) rather than atmospheric O2 (+23 ‰). In terrestrial systems, this type of oxidation is usually microbially mediated.   Implications for Mars: Our initial results imply that chemical weathering (oxidation of pre-existing hydrothermal sulfide minerals, and dissolution of sulfate minerals in various rock formations) is a much greater contributor to the sulfur flux (71-86%) than the smaller and localized oxidation of H2S from fumarolic emissions (5-13%). Additionally, atmospheric deposition of SO4 from fumarolic emissions in the snow cover appears to be negligible compared to the SO4 dissolved in the stream network draining Valles Caldera. This contrasts with the suggestion of S-rich volcanic emissions as a major source explaining sulfate enrichment of the Martian surface [5, 10]. Conversely, our results are more in accord with studies suggesting subsequent aqueous processes and a significant role of chemical weathering of bedrock minerals in the S cycle on Mars [4, 9, 11]. In hydrothermal sites of Valles Caldera (e.g., Sulphur Springs catchment), the oxygen in SO4 originating from oxidation of hydrothermal H2S gas appears to be sourced by water oxygen. Although atmospheric O2 is present, it does not appear to significantly contribute to H2S oxidation. Given that Mars probably never had an O2-rich atmosphere, this finding may provide important insight regarding plausible oxidation pathways of S gases in Martian surface environments.
