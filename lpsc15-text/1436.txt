DETRITAL SHOCKED ZIRCONS DETECTED 2,000 KM DOWNRIVER FROM THE VREDEFORT DOME, SOUTH AFRICA.  S. Montalvo1 (stephanie.montalvo1@upr.edu) and A. Cavosie1,2,3 (aaron.cavosie@upr.edu), 1Univ. Puerto Rico-Mayagüez, 2Univ. Wisconsin-Madison, 3Curtin Univ.   Introduction: The impact record on Earth’s surface has been partially removed through erosion, burial and tectonic activity. Presently there are only 185 confirmed impact structures [1]. Geologic processes erode target rocks, producing sediments with unique microstructural impact deformation signatures. In zircon, these features include planar deformation features (PDFs), planar fractures (PFs), granular texture, microtwins, and curviplanar fractures [2-6]. Documenting shock microstructures in detrital sand grains can identify impact structures that have been eroded or are otherwise unknown [4]. This research documents detrital shocked zircons found in the Orange River at the Atlantic coast, ~2,000 km downriver from the Vredefort Dome impact structure in South Africa. Orange River.  The Orange River is the largest river in South Africa, discharching since the Early Cretaceous [7-8]. Its basin partially overlaps the Kaapvaal Craton and a tributary stream (Vaal River) cuts through the Vredefort Dome in an overall southwestern direction. The combined Vaal-Orange fluvial system flows ~2,000 km downstream from the Vredefort Dome and deposits sediment on the Atlantic coast.  The Vredefort impact structure.  The Vredefort Dome, or the Vredefort impact structure, is currently the largest (~90 km wide) and oldest (2.02 Ga) wellpreserved precisely dated impact structure on Earth [911]. It is located southwest of Johannesburg, South Africa. Previous studies have identified detrital shocked minerals in the Vaal River at the Vredefort Dome [4], and as far as ~750 km downriver [12]. Methods:  Five alluvium samples (14VD69, 72, 76, 77, 80) from the Orange River and three beach sand samples (14VD79, 86, 89) from the Atlantic coast were collected. The samples were washed and sieved to <0.5 mm. To concentrate the zircons, the samples went through heavy liquid (acetylene tetrabromide) and a Frantz magnetic separator.  A total of 9,136 zircons were handpicked and placed on stubs using a binocular microscope. The documentation of microstructures on the exterior of the grains was done using backscattered electron (BSE) of a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.   Results:  From the five alluvium samples, a total of 7,634 zircon were surveyed for external microstructures. Three grains presented evidence of microstructures indicative of shock metamorphism cause by a meteorite impact. One detrital shocked zircon was found in a sandbar 15 km upriver from the Atlantic coast (sample 14VD77, 1/3174, 0.03%), and two were found at the mouth of the Orange River (sample 14VD80, 2/2745, 0.07%). Zircon 1224 from sample 14VD77 preserves three orientations of PFs (Figure 1A). The grains from sample 14VD80 showed up to four orientations of PFs (Figure 1B,C) A total of 1,502 detrital zircon were surveyed from the three samples from the Atlantic coast south of the Orange River mouth; no shocked grains were found in these samples.   Discussion and conclusions:  Five alluvium samples from the Orange River and three beach sand samples from the Atlantic coast of South Africa were surveyed to search for Vredefort-derived shocked zircons.  A total of 9,136 zircons were surveyed, from which two shocked zircons were found in beach sand at the Orange River mouth, and one in a sandbar in the Orange River, 15 km upriver from the mouth. The presence of a shocked zircon in the sandbar sample confirms their transport to the coast in the Orange River.   No shocked grains were found in 1,502 zircons from three beach sand samples collected south of the Orange River mouth; thus no evidence was found to support a longshore drift origin for the shocked grains found at the mouth.  A previous study demonstrated the presence of a detrital shocked zircon at the mouth of the Orange River [13], a finding confirmed by our results. Upcoming U-Pb geochronology studies will seek to further correlate the detrital shocked zircons found in the Orange River to the Vredefort impact structure, to add further support to the conclusion that shocked zircons can survive extreme distal transport (up to 2,000 km) from their source.  However, the important conclusion from this study is that shock microstructures are preserved and detectable using simple SEM methods.  Hence, the study of detrital shocked minerals in siliciclastic sediments can be used to document eroded impact structures of any age on Earth.
