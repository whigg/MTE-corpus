However, some patchy positive anomalies are also presented close to crater, which is often attributed to magnetic substance deposit [1]. Analysis of air blast events showed that transient geomagnetic disturbances could occur while a wellconductive gas cloud moves across the geomagnetic field [3], so could influence on magnetization of impact debris.  Peculiarities of transient magnetic field. Application for magnetic crust anomalies:  As shown in [3] a size of the disturbed area may be of order of thousand km, maximal values of disturbances are of hundreds of nT, and there are both negative and positive anomalies over the area. It is important that the induced field is not similar to the field of a magnetic dipole. Hereafter we discuss a possible influence of these transient magnetic fields on magnetization of impact debris. In Table 1 radiative cooling times for solid debris samples of different sizes are presented. The initial temperature was 1300 C, the final temperature was below of the Curie point.

In Table 2 ballistic times for ejecta samples with different start velocities at an angle of 45 degrees are written.  Velocity, km/s 1 2 3.14 Time, s 140 280 440 Table 2. Ballistic times.  Vertical distribution of relative pressure at the time moment 128 s after oblique impact of 1 km asteroid is shown in Fig.1. Radial velocities at altitudes 110-170 km are of order 2-3 km/s, so the geomagnetic field is not expelled by the shock wave. We anticipate strong anomalies of the geomagnetic field at distances 400500 km from the crater.   Fig.1. Vertical relative pressure distribution in a plane of trajectory (An early stage was simulated by Shuvalov V.V.). At time moment 128 s ballistic ejecta are pretty close to the crater and to the center of the cloud, where disturbancies due to the transient magnetic field appear minimal. As it was shown in [4], for Ries-size craters ejecta particles with velocities above 1 km/s precipitate after deceleration in the atmosphere. They can move at a height of 100 km for a long time. In this heated layer particles stay hot, but cool swiftly, leaving it. Their natural remnant magnetization must demonstrate strong positive or negative anomalies. Origin of 'curved' positive magnetic field anomalies, responsible for bright-colored swirls on the Moon's surface [5] could be related with transient magnetic fields generated by crater-forming events in the ancient lunar magnetic field. Antipodal to basins positive anomalies were previously explained by expulsion of solar wind magnetic field by plasma of colliding impact ejecta [6]. Summary:  Elaborate study of the impact-induced transient magnetic fields and impact ejecta behavior could reveal some crater magnetic anomalies.  References:   [1] Hawke P.
