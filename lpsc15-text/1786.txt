Neutron spectroscopy has been central tothis endeavor and allows one to probe the top fewdecimeters [1].Here, we present an updated study of thedaily variations of the Lunar Prospector epithermal neutron spectrometer count rates to inquireif such potential variations are sensitive to dailyvariations in H concentrations. This study isprompted, in part, by a report of time variableconcentrations of (top tens of microns) H2O/OHthat have been observed with spectral reflectancedata [2]. If such time variable H concentrationsextend to macroscopic depths of multiple mm tocm then such variations could in principle be observed with orbital neutron data. Preliminaryanalysis of data from the Lunar Exploration Neutron Detector has shown a diurnal count rate variation, which has been interpreted as daily variations in H concentrations [3]. Such extraordinary findings, if confirmed, could lead to deepconsequences on our understanding of the hydrogen distribution at the lunar surface. Here, weshow that the Lunar Prospector Neutron Spectrometer (LP-NS) epithermal neutron count ratesalso exhibit diurnal variations, but these variations are correlated with variations in instrumental and sub-surface lunar temperatures.In this work we use the epithermal neutrondataset gathered by the LP-NS, which is inthe public domain at the Planetary Data System(PDS).1 We also use temperature measurementsof the lunar surface collected by the DivinerLunar Radiometer on Lunar ReconnaissanceOrbiter. These measurements are also availableat PDS.2 We will also use thermal models thathave been constrained by the above thermalmeasurements [4].1http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/lunarp/2http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/lro/diviner.htmFigure 1: Count rate versus LPNS sensor temperature scatter diagram. Red line shows the linearfit to the data.To quantify the variability of the epithermalcount rate, cr(x, t), we introduce the random overcount rate variable, δcr(x, t)/cr:δcr(x, t)/cr = cr(x, t)/crf (x, t)− 1 (1)where crf (x, t) is the fiducial count rate maps at6pm (local time), x is the location on the lunarsurface and t denotes local time. To quantifycr(x, t) we use the time-series defined as follows:all the instants of the overall LP-NS time-serieswithin the latitude range latitude < 55◦ and lowaltitude (average∼ 30 km) portion of the mission.In Figure 1 we show the LP-NS count rate versus sensor temperature. The top panel of Figure 2shows the count rate averaged over the latitudedomain for uncorrected (green) and sensor temperature corrected (violet) data. The sensor temperature corrections alone reduce the over countvariations from ∼ 2.73% down to ∼ 1.60%.Little et al (2003) [5] and Lawrence et al (2006)[6] used a Monte Carlo approach to study neutrontransport in typical lunar soils and showed thatboth thermal and epithermal neutron count ratesare dependent on temperature.In this work we consider a variety of subsurface temperatures as a function of both lati1786.pdf

tude and local time, as constrained by the Divinermeasurements.To take into account the effects of the lunar subsurface temperature we consider an "averagesoil" made up of equal fractions of Luna 16, 20,24, Apollo 11 and FAN (see [6] for further detailsregarding the lunar soils). In the upper panel ofFigure 2 we show the averaged over count rate corrected for sensor temperature and surface temperature effects (black). In the lower panel of thesame figure we present the over count rate as corrected for sub-surface temperatures at differentdepths. In Table 1 we present the peak-to-peakvariation of the over count rate for different subsurface temperature corrections. The minimumvariation occurs for a sub-surface depth of 20 cm.Conclusions: LP-NS epithermal neutroncount rates also show diurnal variations,however, these variations are correlated withvariations in instrumental temperature and withthe sub-surface temperatures as constrained bythe Diviner measurements. These findings suggest that rather than reflecting diurnal changes inhydrogen, the temporal fluctuations in the countrates are due to residual systematic effects in thedata reduction which have not been taken intoaccount in previous studies [7].After corrections for instrumental and subsurface temperature, the remaining diurnal countrate variations are ∼ 0.5%.An additional result is that we have made thefirst measurement of the effective leakage depthfor epithermal neutrons of 10 - 20 cm. When thesedepths are used for sub-surface temperature correction, they lead to the lowest diurnal variationsin the epithermal neutron data.References: [1] W. C. Feldman, et al.
