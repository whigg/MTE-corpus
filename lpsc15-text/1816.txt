AN OPEN SOURCE ALTERNATIVE FOR CRATER COUNTING USING QGIS AND THE CIRCLECRATERS PLUGIN.  S. E. Braden1, 1HireIQ Solutions, Inc., 1101 Cambridge Square, Alpharetta, GA 30009, sarah.braden@hireiqinc.com.Introduction:  Statistical analysis of crater sizefrequency distributions (CSFDs) from impact craterson planetary surfaces is a method to derive ages on thebasis of remotely-sensed image data [1-5]. Data required for the statistical analysis are area size andmapped geologic units, as well as measurements of primary impact crater diameters within the study area.Data collection techniques have changed over time.Initially, photogrammetric instruments were used tomeasure image coordinates on film transparencies, andthen the coordinates were translated into crater diameters. More recently, measurements of impact crater diameters were made from projected raster imagesthrough measurements of pixels. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) providedan environment for both the projected image data(raster data) and the measurements of digitized craters(vector data), however, a challenge remained for accu rate crater diameter measurements. Distortions of distances and areas due to different map projections wasstill a significant source of error when making measurements from projected raster data [6]. In general,distortions produced by different map projections increase with distance from the projection center. TheCraterTools extension for Environmental Systems Research Institute's (ESRI's) ArcGIS addressed this issueby preforming undistorted re-projection of each digitized impact crater and using the undistorted crater diameter as the true measurement output [6].     At present, the only crater counting tool utilizing aGeographic Information System (GIS) is CraterTools[6]. There is not an open source alternative to the combination of ArcGIS and CraterTools.    This abstract presents a new open source tool, CircleCraters, for crater counting built as a QGIS plugin.QGIS is an Open Source Geographic Information System (GIS) licensed under the GNU General Public License [7]. QGIS is an official project of the OpenSource Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo). It runs onLinux, Unix, Mac OSX, Windows and Android. Incontrast, ArcGIS limits the user by requiring a Windows operating system.The advantages to using a combination of QGISand a community developed open source plugin forcrater counting are not only lower cost compared to using ArcGIS, but also the ability of independent individuals to make improvements to the code and long-termmaintainability with transparent version control. Opensource code is essential to the scientific process, notonly to support the reproducibility of results, but tocontribute to the scientific community and developmethodologies over time [8].Measurement Tool:  CircleCraters uses the samethree point crater digitizing method as ArcGIS CraterTools. The method assumes that impact craters have anear circular shape, which excludes oblique impactcraters. Errors in diameter measurements due to projection related distortions are avoided by using spherical coordinates to create a circle through the threepoints defining the crater rim, and then using thehaversine formula (Fig. 1) to calculate the diameter ofthe circle. When solved for distance, the haversine formula finds the shortest distance between two pointsgiven in latitude and longitude [9]. The haversine formula is accurate even for craters that cover a large portion of the planetary surface. The final undistorted diameter is saved as a property of the group of threeFigure 1. The haversine formula solved for distancewhere d is the distance in meters, r is the radius of theplanetary body in meters, phi is latitude and lambda islongitude for two points. points selected by the user, along with the latitude andlongitude of the center of the circle. On the screen acircle is drawn in the same projection as the raster data(Fig. 2).When all study areas are mapped and the cratercounting process is complete, data can be exported as acomma delimited file (.csv), shapefile (.shp), or as acrater-diameter list with a defined surface area (a .diamfile) designed to be imported by Craterstats2, a tool forplotting crater counts and determining surface ages using the techniques described in [2-5, 10]. Craterstats2requires the area containing the impact craters, whichis calculated automatically by CircleCraters as long asthe user has defined the area in a vector layer. The areais computed with an equal-area sinusoidal projection.In a sinusoidal projection, scales are true along paral lels and along the central meridian, while being distorted in directors not along the parallels.Source Code:   The code and documentation forCricleCraters is on the GitHub website atgithub.com/sbraden/circle-craters.

collaboration using the version control system Git.Contributions to the code base of CircleCraters, or anycomments, suggests, or other input are welcome fromthe planetary science community. Github provides aneasy-to-use platform for documentation and feedback.CircleCraters will be included in the QGIS pluginrepository (plugins.qgis.org), which allows the pluginto be installed with one click from within the QGISdesktop application. The plugin is written in Python, arelatively easily-adopted programming language. CircleCraters is made available under the BSD (BerkeleySoftware Distribution) 3-Clause (“BSD Simplified”) license [11].Conclusion and Future Work:   This open sourcetool provides planetary scientists with an alternative tothe ArcGIS platform. The hosting of the code in aGitHub repository will promote long-term maintainability and transparency. Other scientists requiringcrater counting software tools may use the source codefrom this repository. CircleCraters will evolve togetherwith new QGIS releases and improvements.  Figure 2. An example of impact crater definition as acircle automatically generated after the user definesthree points along the crater rim. The image data is araster layer while the group of three points and circleare vector layers. The crater center latitude, longitudeand diameter are stored as feature properties for laterexport and use in Craterstats2.Immediate development priorities include:• A crater size frequency distribution previewplot with isochrons, similar to what is available in CraterTools.• Exporting crater counting data as a binned.stats file readable by Craterstats2 [10].• An option to use more than three points to define the crater rim.• Option for users to label craters within thecrater counting vector layer as uncertain whenconsidering possible secondary craters.• A measurement scale/guide that includes a default minimum crater diameter spatial resolution limitation based on number of pixels.
