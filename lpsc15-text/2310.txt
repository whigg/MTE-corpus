E-mail: mark.nottingham@manchester.ac.uk  RIMSKI: The Resonance Ionization Mass Spectrometer for Krypton Isotopes (RIMSKI), based at The University of Manchester, is an ultrasensitive mass spectrometer, designed to analyze isotopic ratios of krypton trapped within milligram sized extraterrestrial samples. The mass spectrometer utilizes design aspects of previous generation instrumentation in order to achieve a detection limit of ~700 atoms of 84 Kr [1]. These features include a small internal volume, a resonant ionization scheme and a cryogenic sample concentrator, and were based on designs by Thonnard et al. [2]. The krypton system is most notably used to date cosmic ray exposure (CRE) duration in extraterrestrial material, where cosmic rays produce isotopes of krypton from target elements (Sr, Rb, Y, Zn). A limiting factor of this system is the low abundance of Kr within material (true of both trapped krypton and cosmogenic relative to trapped krypton). This is compounded by the even lower abundance of radioactive 81 Kr, which forms an integral part in the calculation of CRE ages. The krypton system may be considered largely independent of material chemistry because the relative errors introduced by a large variation in target element abundances (1-3%, from a 2-3 times increase in abundance) [3] are less significant than the inherent ~10% error of a standard CRE age calculation (from the 81 Kr abundance).  Krypton is ionized selectively by a resonant excitation scheme. There are three transitions utilized within the scheme (Figure 1). A 116.48 nm photon (generated by four-wave mixing of two 252.5 nm photons and one 1507.3 nm photon, in a precisely controlled Xe-Ar gas cell) raises the electron from the ground state (4p 6) to the first utilized level (4p 55s[1/2]1). A second excitation step is achieved using a tuned 558.03 nm photon, to excite the atoms up to the 4p 56p[1/2]0 level. A final photon of 1064 nm is used to achieve the ionization step. This scheme ensures that only the target gases are efficiently ionized.  Laser Systems:  The incident laser light is generated by a seeded pulsed (10 Hz pulse rate) Continuum Powerlite 9010 Nd:YAG with doubling and tripling harmonics, before being tuned to the required wavelengths for vuv generation via a Sirah Cobra Stretch (Coumarin 503 dye, with an FCU doubling unit) to laser light of 252.5 nm, as well as a Sirah Cobra Stretch (DCM dye, with a DFMIIR mixing unit) to generate 1507.3 nm laser light. The instrument also tunes a beam to 558 nm via a Sirah Cobra dye laser (Pyrromethene 580 dye) for the second transition of the excitation scheme employed. Collectively, the beams entering the spectrometer consist of a 1507.3 nm beam (~4.5mJ per pulse), a 1064 nm beam (attenuated Nd:YAG fundamental, ~10 mJ per pulse), a 558 nm beam (~10 mJ per pulse) and a 252.5 nm beam (~4.5mJ per pulse).    Recent Modifications: Modifications have been made to the instrument to enhance the ionization efficiency and signal detection limits and to make operation of the instrument more routine. The instrument is now always operated with collinear laser beams, and we have developed more precise control over the Xe/Ar ratio of the mixing cell to maximize ionization efficiency in this configuration.  Beam alignment. The beams are aligned in both space and time, collinearly, to be parallel with the spectrometer back plate to ensure maximum overlap of the beams.  Xe-Ar four-wave mixing cell. The lack of commercially available laser systems that produced a tunable 116.48 nm wavelength laser light resulted in the implementation of a four-wave mixing scheme to generate the required photons. This system has been previously characterized [4], but has now been modified by the addition of mass flow controllers (MKS Instruments) to allow precise control of the gas mix within the cell.  Figure 1- The krypton ionization scheme employed on the RIMSKI instrument, and associated scheme used to generate the 116.48 nm vuv photon required for the first transition. The generation of the vuv photon exploits a virtual energy state to bridge the 5p 6 - 5p 56p[3/2]2 transition.  The aim of the modification was to enhance the reproducibility of the ratio between the gases. Figure 2 shows the enhanced reproducibility of the gas mixture via the produced vuv wavelength (a function of the 1507 nm wavelength the system is tuned to in order to generate a vuv signal).    Figure 2- Illustration of the reproducibility of the gas cell. The cell was filled six times to the same nominal pressure (600 Torr), and Xe/Ar ratio (1:9.2) and vuv generation was measured in the NOx detector cell. The peak (point) and range (error bar) of vuv generation for each filling are displayed.   The newly adopted modifications have enhanced ionization efficiency considerably, with a doubling of the relative signal strength, as is shown in Figure 3.  0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000 10000 Re la ti ve I on C ou nt Figure 3- A comparison between typical air calibration spectra from the current system and from the previous setup for the system (previous system data originally from Strashnov et al. [5]) A standard air aliquot contains ~2.5x10 5 atoms of Kr, of atmospheric isotopic composition.  Mixing Cell Re-characterization: Following the development of the new gas ratio control system, we have been able to investigate the relationship between Xe/Ar mixing ratio and the wavelength of vuv generation. The partial pressures of xenon and argon were varied, keeping a constant total pressure of 600 Torr. The 252 nm wavelength was set as to maximize a xenon ionization signal within a detection cell (the same construction as is detailed in Strashnov et al. [4]). For each given Xe/Ar ratio, the wavelength of the 1507 nm beam was then tuned until the signal observed in a second detection cell (filled with 1.6x10 -1 mbar NOx) was maximized, indicating the peak of vuv generation. All dye laser tuning systems were calibrated using a wave meter to ensure accurate wavelengths were reported in this work. The resulting tuning curve is shown in Figure 4 where it is contrasted with that previously reported.  The offset between the two datasets can be attributed to systematic errors arising from pressure measurement in the previous configuration and the relationship between relative nominal flow rates and ultimate cell gas ratio in the new configuration.  However, the data serve to illustrate the improvement in our ability to control the mixing ration with the new configuration.  Optimum krypton excitation is achieved with a nominal Xe/Ar ratio of 1:5.2 at 600 mbar total pressure.  Figure 4- The calculated vuv wavelength generated at a given Ar/Xe ratio, based on the 1507 nm wavelength when a vuv signal was detected in the NOx detector cell. Note that the ratio values stated for this work relate to the ratio between the settings for the mass flow controller components where as those of Strashnov et al. [4] were deduced from measured pressure changes on a baratron pressure gauge, following the individual inlet of each gas from a gas bottle.    Once vuv generation has been optimized at the wavelength required for krypton excitation, the ionization process itself is optimized using a detection cell containing 7.0x10 -2 mbar Kr allowing the instrument to be tuned ready for analysis.
