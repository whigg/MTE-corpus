Summary: Combined analyses of gravity and topography can yield useful information about the interior structures of planetary bodies [1–4]. Based on radio tracking of the Cassini spacecraft, we present an estimate of the gravity field of Saturn's large moon Rhea. Combining this with a shape model based on limb profile analyses, we attempt to constrain Rhea's internal structure, concluding that the core likely exhibits some excess flattening. Gravity: During its time in the Saturn system, Cassini has performed two close fly-bys of Rhea devoted to gravity investigations: one in November 2005, and another in March 2013. As in previous work [2,4,5], the gravity field of Rhea was estimated by reconstructing the spacecraft trajectory during these encounters, making use of precise measurements of the Doppler shift of a highly stable microwave radio link between Cassini and the ground station antennas of NASA's Deep Space Network.  The available data were analyzed in a multi-arc fit estimating a fully unconstrained quadrupole gravity field for Rhea, the Rhea state vector at a reference epoch, and the spacecraft initial state vector for each fly-by. The stability of the solutions was tested by perturbing the dynamical model in various ways, including estimating a full 4x4 gravity field and changing the a priori uncertainties. The resulting estimate of Rhea's gravity field exhibits a statistically significant departure from the hydrostatic expectation (Figure 1), with a J2/C22 ratio of 3.9±0.1 (the hydrostatic ratio is ~3.33). As a result, the moment of inertia cannot be inferred directly from the Radau-Darwin approximation. Estimating the moment of inertia directly from the J2 or C22 coefficients yields incompatible and unrealistic estimates of ~0.41 and ~0.37, respectively.  Shape: Rhea's shape has been determined previously via analyses of limb profiles [6,7]. After incorporating the latest available data, we repeat this analysis, obtaining a best-fitting tri-axial ellipsoid with semiaxes:  a = 765.7 ± 0.3 km, b = 763.6 ± 0.3 km, c = 762.9 ± 0.2 km, from which we obtain the unnormalized degree-2 coefficients: J2 = 1190 ± 260 m, C22 = 350 ± 120 m (uncertainties are all one-sigma). Figure 2 illustrates how the shape compares with the hydrostatic expectation for various assumed moments of inertia. The central value is close to the expectation for a nearly homogeneous, hydrostatic body, however the uncertainties are large.  Internal Structure: There are a number of ways to explain the excess oblateness (higher than expected J2/C22 ratio) in Rhea's gravity field that are consistent with the observed shape. Homogeneous Model: If Rhea is of uniform density, it can be shown [8,3,4] that the shape required to explain the observed gravity is given by   𝐻!" = !!!! !! 𝐺!" (1) where R is Rhea's mean radius, and 𝐺!" and 𝐻!" are spherical harmonic coefficients of degree l and order m, representing the dimensionless gravitational potential and topography, respectively. In addition to the J2 and C22 values estimated from limb profile observations, Figure 2 shows the values obtained from equation (1) based on the gravity coefficients illustrated in Figure 1. The gravity field is thus consistent with a homogeneous Rhea of the observed shape, to within the shape model's uncertainties.

Expected hydrostatic values of J2 and C22 are indicated for various normalized moments of inertia along the theoretical hydrostatic line (dashed line). 1069.pdf

Two-Layer Model: Considering that the surface is most likely water ice [9,10], it may be more realistic to assume some internal layering. Here, we consider a simple two-layer model: silicate core and H2O mantle. We assume the density of the mantle is 920 kg/m3 and we examine a series of different core densities. For each assumed core density, we compute the core radius required to satisfy the observed bulk density constraint (𝜌 = 1236 kg/m3). If the surface conforms closely to the central values of our shape model, then the excess oblateness of the gravity field requires an irregular core shape (i.e., oblateness at the core-mantle-boundary that is beyond the hydrostatic expectation)—similar concepts have been considered previously for Enceladus [6,11] and Mimas [12]. With this two-layer model, we can solve for the core-mantle-boundary topography required to give rise to the observed gravity field (e.g., [11,13]). Given a known gravity field and surface topography, expressed in spherical harmonics, it can be shown that the required topography at the core-mantle-boundary is given by 𝐻!"!"# = !∆! !!!! !!! !!!! !!! 𝐺!" − 𝜌!𝐻!"!       (2) where 𝐻!"!"# is the core-mantle-boundary topography at degree l and order m, ∆𝜌 is the density contrast at the core-mantle-boundary, d is the depth of the coremantle-boundary (𝑑 = 𝑅 − 𝑅!"#$), 𝜌 is Rhea's bulk density, R is Rhea's full radius, 𝜌! is the density of the mantle, 𝐺!" is the dimensionless gravitational potential resolved at radius R, and 𝐻!"!  is the surface topography.   As illustrated in Figure 3, if the surface conforms to our shape model (Figure 2), and assuming we have not significantly overestimated the C22 topography, then some excess core oblateness (roughly 1 km) is required to account for the observed gravity field. This excess core topography implies stresses of ~0.3 MPa, which are readily supported by cold silicate materials. With larger mantle thicknesses, the core-mantleboundary is deeper and so larger amplitudes are required to overcome the resulting attenuation of the gravity signal. Conclusions: The observed shape is consistent with the shape required for an undifferentiated (uniform density) Rhea to account for the observed gravity. However, because the surface is more likely to be water ice, a two-layer model may be a better approximation (cf. [5]). In this case, and assuming a mantle density of 920 kg/m3, some ~1 km of excess core oblateness may be necessary to account for the observed gravity (Figure 3). A wide range of moments of inertia is allowed, but models with low moments of inertia (i.e., more differentiation) require greater magnitudes of excess core topography to satisfy the observations.
