Introduction:  Gale is a ~155 km diameter crater located on the martian dichotomy boundary (5°S 138°E). Gale is estimated to have formed 3.8 - 3.5 Gya, in the late Noachian or early Hesperian [1,2,3]. Mt. Sharp, at the center of Gale Crater, is a crescent shaped sedimentary mound that rises 5.2 km above the crater floor (Fig. 1). Gale is one of the few craters that has a peak reaching higher than the rim of the crater wall [1,2,4]. The Curiosity rover is currently fighting its way across the ripples and sharp rocks of the Pahrump hills at the northwest base of Mt. Sharp searching for evidence of habitability.      This study will use orbital images and topographic data to refine models for the geologic history of Mt. Sharp by analyzing its morphological features. In addition, the study will assess the possibility of a peak ring in Gale. The presence of a peak ring can offer important information to how Mt. Sharp was formed and eroded early in Gale's history. Methodology: Craters with sedimentary mounds. Craters located between 60°N - 60°S   and 100-200 km in diameter with interior deposits were identified using the Mars Crater Database (http://crater.sjrdesign.net/) [5]. The latitude limits were chosen to avoid recent ice processes that may have affected mound formation, erosion and exposure. This search yielded 255 craters, of which 6 were selected (Fig 2, Table 1) to study closely using image datasets from the orbital Context Camera (CTX), High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE), and Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS). The six craters were chosen based on their unique mound morphologies as well as their similarity to Mt. Sharp. Topographic profiles for each crater were constructed using ArcMap10.1 software and Mars Orbital Laser Altimeter (MOLA) derived digital elevation models.        Craters with peak rings. Craters between 60°N - 60°S and 100 km-230 km in diameter with peak rings were cataloged using the same Mars Crater Database [9] as well as MOLA data and GoogleMars. Four craters were selected for close analyses of morphologic features and textural characteristics (Table 2).  Results and Discussion: Craters with mounds. Craters with strong evidence of fluvial processes, for example Firsoff (Fig 2d), have river channels and layered sediment along the walls. These features suggest that the crater was once partially or completely filled  and subsequently eroded to form a circular mound in the center of the crater. Prominent yardangs show recent prevailing winds in multiple directions. Cerulli (Fig 2a) and Becquerel (Fig 2c) have isolated mounds showing evidence for erosion - possible due to  glaciation - and periodic deposition[6]. Nicholson & Gale Comparison. Out of the six craters analyzed, Nicholson (Fig 2f) is the closest analog to Gale in terms of mound morphology. Nicholson has a large central peak and a surrounding sedimentary mound similar to Gale.  The cross section (Fig 3) of the Nicholson mound shows the rim and crater floor slope down towards the north-northwest [4], in addition to having a peak that rises higher than its surrounding rim. These features are similar to what is observed in the cross sections of Gale. Both Gale and Nicholson essentially lie on the dichotomy boundary and both impacted into Hesperian Noachian transition unit [3]. They may have been exposed to similar climatic evolution when Mars transitioned to an arid climate [3]. Both craters show evidence of deposition of windtransported sediments on the mound and central peak. On Gale, there is a thin young layer of wind transported possibly from the Medusae Fossae formation (MFF) [4, 7]. On the east and west lobes of the Nicholson mound the surfaces exhibit crescentic scour features, Fig 1.

similar to features found in the MFF, indicating that a young layer of MFF may also present on the Nicholson mound [8]. Another distinguishing feature on Nicholson's mound is the large deep channel, ~18 km long, running from the center to the near southeast base of the mound. Several large canyons incise the western lobe of Mt. Sharp. Such canyons suggest large quantities of water were once present.  The major morphological feature that makes Gale unique is the crescent shape of Mt. Sharp. The comparison mounds are relatively concentric with their crater rims, but Gale is a semi-circle mound with the central peak exposed along the southern face. This unique erosion of Mt. Sharp may suggest the presence of a partial peak ring that protected the sediment from erosion[9]. Peak ring morphology. A peak ring typically has a diameter that is half of its craters diameter. Peak rings are composed of deep-seated material that look fundamentally different from layered sedimentary mounds. The maximum depth of excavation for the peak ring in Gale is ~17 km [10].  After analyzing the four peak rings (Fig 4) it became apparent that not all peak rings have the same rock texture. This variation could be dependent on the underlying substrate rock. The commonality among these peak rings is their style of erosion into massive unlayered conical hills, in some cases littered in boulders. Lowell (Fig 4d/Fig 5b) contains a well formed peak ring. A thin mass of sediment is corralled inside the northeast quadrant of the peak ring. This may be analogous to the much thicker mass of sediments that forms the lower mound of Mt. Sharp.  An arc of low hills southeast of Mt. Sharp may be the eroded remains of a peak ring in Gale crater (Fig 5c). Holden Crater has conical hills (Fig 5d) analogous to Gale's peak ring hills.  Conclusions: The present findings support the conclusions of previous studies that fluvial deposition and aeolian erosion of the lower mound, followed by aeolian deposition and erosion of the upper mound,  characterize the history of Mt. Sharp [1,2,4].  Nicholson is morphologically the closest analog to Gale. Studies focusing on Nicholson's morphologic features along the crater floor and wall as well as its mound should be done to further compare the history Nicholson with Gale. The presence of a peak ring within Gale is plausible based on the analyses of peak rings in other craters. Peak rings erode to very distinct, unlayered conical hills, especially in craters smaller than 200 km in diameter. Peak rings allow for protection of sediments within the ring, resulting in the formation of mounds high in topography in relation to the eroded crater floor [4].  References: [1] Thomson et al.
