Introduction: Although visible and near infrared reflectance spectroscopic  data unambiguously identify phyllosilicates on the Martian surface [1-5], confirmation of the type and abundance of those phases by other remote and surface sensing techniques has been difficult. For nontronites, this may be due to shock metamorphism changing the structure [6]. Because different spectroscopic instruments probe different parts of a sample structure, structural changes would affect the signal obtained by each instrument differently [6,7]. Therefore, identification may be hampered by failure to consider shock altered phases in spectral libraries, particularly in areas with craters >5.75 km diameter [8].  This problem is exacerbated when considering Mössbauer spectra of the Martian surface because peak parameters of many phases overlap in a narrow range. Results from the Mössbauer spectrometers aboard the Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) [9,10] did not identify any specific doublets representing phyllosilicates. However, one Fe 3+ doublet (Fe3D3) in rocks from the   Figure 1. Shocked and unshocked 295K Mössbauer spectra of chlorite, serpentine, and kaolinite. Spectra are offset and scaled for clarity. Burns Formation was unassigned, with an isomer shift () of 0.37±0.02 mm/s and quadrupole splitting () of 0.62±0.03 mm/s. Rocks at both landing sites contain a doublet assigned [9,10] to nanophase Fe 3+ oxide with  = 0.38 and  = 0.89. These features closely overlap values reported for various clay minerals [11] and are nearly identical to those of shocked nontronites [6]. Further comparisons of MER results with clay mineral spectra are needed; data on shocked samples are presented here to illuminate Mössbauer interpretations.  Figure 2. 295K Mössbauer spectra of saponite SapCa-2. Spectra are offset and scaled for clarity. Note that shock oxidizes nearly all the Fe2+ and causes the Fe3+ doublets to be become broader, indicating increased quadrupole splitting resulting from site distortion. Methods: Impact experiments were performed at the Flat Plate Accelerator at NASA's Johnson Space Center. Peak pressure was achieved through shockreverberation, thus achieving lower peak temperatures than would be expected for comparable natural impacts [12].  Mössbauer spectra were acquired using a ~60 mCi 57 Co in Rh on a WEB Research Co. model WT302 spectrometer at 295K. Spectra were fit with Lorentzian doublets using the MEX_FielDD program [11]. Errors for  and  are ±0.02 mm/s for well-resolved doublets and ±1-5% for peak area, depending on peak overlap.  Results: This current study considers shocked chlorite, saponite, kaolinite, and serpentine, complementing previously-reported results on nontronite [6].  Each mineral behaves slightly differently with shock and each site in each mineral shows a different trend.  Nontronite samples were fit by two [6] Fe 3+ doublets with parameters of  = 0.37 mm/s and  = 0.34 and 0.69 mm/s (88 and 12% area, respectively). As shock increases to 19.7 GPa, Fe 3+ partitions away from the low- doublet and into the higher- doublet. At >25.2 GPa, there is no occupancy of the undistorted, low site; instead, there is a distribution with = 0.350.36 mm/s and  = 1.14-1.19 mm/s, indicating occupancy in highly-distorted coordination polyhedra [6]. Unaltered chlorite (Figure 1) can be fit with two [6] Fe 2+ (=1.14. =2.34, 2.65 mm/s) and two  [6] Fe 3+ doublets (=0.39, 0.36, =0.99, 0.78 mm/s). In shocked samples, parameters ( and ) for Fe 2+ doublets remain fairly constant but the  increases from 0.99 to 1.26-1.33 for the higher- Fe 3+ doublet. The %Fe 3+ for chlorite initially nearly doubles from shock but then remains constant within error for all pressures studied. The increase in Fe 3+ area is exclusively in the sites represented by the low  Fe 3+ doublet.  Figure 3. Mössbauer parameters for all clays studied here. Bottom plot shows typical ranges for Fe in varying valence and coordination polyhedra for all silicates. Top shows a close-up of the Fe3+ region of this plot. Saponite (Figure 2) and kaolinite behave similarly. Both oxidize completely (from 66 and 74% Fe 3+ , respectively, to 100%) at shock pressures (<10 GPa) but where saponite shows some Fe 2+ at higher shock pressures, kaolinite does not. There is no distinct trend for , , or % area for either mineral. However, parameters for the low- Fe 3+ doublet in saponite change from =0.33 mm/s, =0.39 mm/s to =0.15 mm/s, =0.54 mm/s. Those for the high- Fe 3+ doublet in kaolinite change from =0.37 mm/s, =0.77 mm/s to = 0.280.33 mm/s, =0.95-1.00 mm/s with increasing shock pressure favoring higher  Figure 4. Effects of shock on  in clays. In nearly all cases,  for Fe3+ increases with shock pressure, indicative of increasing site distortion. Errors are ±0.03 mm/s on  Unshocked serpentine spectra (Figure 1) are fit with one [6] Fe 2+ doublet and three highly overlapped [6] Fe 3+ doublets, so trends are not evident with shock due to the high degree of overlap. Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ does not change with shock for this sample.  Implications: Our results show a predictable outcome; namely that shock would cause site distortion. However, the extent of that distortion is quite significant (Figure 3). For example, shock causes the  value of nontronite to increase so much that it spans nearly the entire range of  known to occur in silicates. This increase in occurs to varying extents in all the clays studied here (Figure 4). This result shows that there are no "diagnostic" Mössbauer parameters for clays in situations where the extent of shock is unconstrained. If other silicates behave similarly with shock, then the reference values for silicates that currently exist in Mössbauer databases may not be suitable for interpreting results from planetary surfaces where shock has occurred. Broader ranges of Mössbauer parameters as a result of shock in commonly-occurring minerals may create new possibilities for interpreting results from extraterrestrial instruments such as those on the MERs.
