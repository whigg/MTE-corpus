Introduction:  The MAVEN spacecraft successfully executed orbit insertion at Mars on September 22, 2014, after a 10 month cruise en route to the red planet. The magnetic field instruments [1], along with other sensors in the Particles and Fields Package, operated flawlessly throughout cruise to Mars, instrument commissioning, and transition orbit phase, and began routine science operations in November, 2014. MAVEN was initially placed into a high-inclination (75ยบ) elliptical orbit with a period of 35 hours. After a series of maneuvers, the orbit period was reduced to 4.5 hours and periapsis lowered to approximately 150 km altitude. The serendipitous arrival of comet Siding Spring provided a unique opportunity to augment MAVEN's science objectives with in-situ observations of the comet and its effects on the Mars atmosphere. In this paper we present observations of the comet encounter and the first results of observations acquired during the first few months in orbit about Mars. References: [1] Connerney, J. E. P., J.

The encounter was characterized by a weak magnetic field and large amplitude fluctuations with a period of a few minutes.    1080.pdf
