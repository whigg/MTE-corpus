Gibbon3 1Univ.Puerto Rico-Mayagüez, 2Curtin Univ, 3Univ. New Brunswick.  Introduction:  While it has long been known thatshocked minerals are preserved in target rocks [eg. 1],recent investigations have demonstrated that shock microstructures in minerals such as zircon, monazite, andquartz also survive erosion of the impact structure andtransportation by fluvial and glacio-fluvial processes[2-4]. Shocked minerals have been found in modernsands and sedimentary rocks eroded from four impactstructures: the Vredefort Dome, South Africa [2,3,5];Sudbury, Ontario, Canada [4]; Rock Elm, Wisconsin,USA [6,7]; and Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA [8-11].These detrital shocked minerals have been found locally, near and within their source impact structures[2,4,6-11], as well as hundreds of kilometers downriver [3,5]. Here we report detrital shocked minerals inthe lithified 300 Ma Dwyka Group tillite, eroded fromthe Vredefort Dome impact structure. These results notonly contribute to Vredefort's detrital shocked mineralstory, but also add to Earth's impact record by demonstrating that shocked minerals can endure lithificationand preservation through deep time.Detrital shocked minerals in Dwyka tillite:  A total of ten poorly-indurated tillite samples were collected from the core and collar of the Vredefort Dome impact structure (Fig. 1). Grain exteriors of 100 zirconsfrom nine of these samples were analyzed using backscattered electron (BSE) imaging. All samples contained impact-shocked zircons (Fig. 2), ranging from27% in a sand-poor tillite from the collar of the impactstructure, to 63% in a sand-rich tillite from the core(average = 41%). Twenty-one monazite grains fromthe core tillite sample were also analyzed by BSEimaging. 100% of these grains show evidence ofshock, with up to three orientations of planar microstructures preserved (Fig. 3). Thin sections of eachof the ten samples were surveyed for shocked quartzusing petrographical methods. All samples containshocked quartz, exhibited by grains with up to two orientations of decorated planar deformation features(PDFs) (Fig. 4a). Less frequently, quartz grains contained feather features (Fig. 4b,c), another shock microstructure found in quartz, associated with planarfractures.One well-lithified diamictite sample was collected~40km from the center of the Vredefort Dome, outsidethe modern exposure of the impact structure (Fig. 1).One hundred zircons separated from the diamictitewere surveyed for surface expressions of shock microstructures using BSE imaging, yielding nineshocked zircons. Thin sections made from this sampleyielded two quartzite clasts that contained shockedquartz. These samples were collected from outside theknown limit of PDFs in quartz [12].Figure 1.

Both grains exhibit three orientations of planar microstructures.Discussion: Detrital shocked minerals have beendocumented in lithified glacial tillites from the 300 MaDwyka Group in South Africa. These zircon, monazite,and quartz grains were eroded from the VredefortDome impact structure and transported by Permo-Carboniferous glaciers, where they were deposited, lithified, and preserved until present day. These findingsdemonstrate two new scenarios for preservation ofshocked minerals: (1) that shock microstructures canwithstand glacial transit, and (2) that shocked mineralscan survive lithification and deep time in the rockrecord. These ancient preserved grains can be an important tool for a better understanding of Earth's earlyimpact history. Though very few impact structures survive alteration, erosion, and burial from Earth's surfaceand tectonic processes, shocked minerals eroded fromthese impact structures can endure in the rock record.Sediments and sedimentary rocks containing shockedminerals can be the key to discovering the existence ofancient impacts that have long since been erased.References:  [1] French B.
