ISOTOPIC ANOMALIES IN Cr, Fe AND Ni FROM “s” PROCESSING IN AGB STARS. G. J.Wasserburg, LunaticAsylum, Geological & Planetary Sciences, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA (gjw@gps.caltech.edu),O. Trippella, M. Busso, Dep. of Physics, University of Perugia, and INFN, Section of Perugia, Italy.We report on the effects of slow neutron captures inAGB stars on isotopes of the “Fe group” elements. Inparticular Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni and Zn are considered to be members of the “iron group”. These nuclei are predominantlythe product of supernovae (SNe), both core collapse andSNeIa. It has been known for over three decades thatsmall (<1%) variations are found in the isotopic compositions of Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni and Zn in macroscopic samplesof meteorites (see review by [1]). In particular, see [2] forFe and [3] for Ni. Their results stimulated this study. Inparticular, these isotopic effects are common in calciumaluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) in meteorites, but arealso wide spread at lower levels in “bulk” samples ofmany different groups of meteorites. The observed effects in Cr, Fe and Ni often show enrichments in theheaviest isotopes 54Cr, 58Fe and 64Ni, which are lowfractions of their respective element (∼2.3% for 54Cr,∼0.28% for 58Fe and ∼0.9% for 64Ni). The isotopicpatterns observed in Ti and Si are distinct and complex.As the “Fe group” elements are associated with Supernovae (SNe), it has been natural that interpretations ofthese effects in CaIs and “bulk” meteorites have focusedon nucleosynthetic processes in SNe. This has not led toany firm explanation of the observed isotopic anomaliesor to clear predictions. The first study that considered thepossibility of s-process effects on Fe-group nuclei was by[4], who explored the occurrence of s-processing in massive stars. The s-processed material is, in the interstellarmedium (hereafter ISM), predominantly from low massAGB stars. We expect that the effect of s-processingon Cr, Fe, and Ni (originally synthesized in SNe) is toproduce the heavier isotopes of these elements, 54Cr,58Fe and 64Ni, in over-abundance; this can be seen byconsidering that the pure s-process abundance pattern is,in general, smoothly correlated with the neutron-capturecross sections, yielding processed material enriched innuclides heavier than the seed. As only a very small fraction of matter in an AGB star is subjected to s-processing,it is not obvious how large the effects will be in the envelope of an AGB star, or will be provided to the ISM.There are thus three distinct issues: i) What are the sprocess effects on isotopic abundance patterns in Cr, Fe,and Ni in an AGB envelope? ii) How significant arethese effects? iii) What are the effects to be expected onthe nuclei of lower atomic number than iron (e.g. Si, Tiand Ca)? We show that there are substantial effects onthe abundances of 54Cr, 58Fe and 64Ni produced in AGBstars and that these may provide an explanation of theeffects observed in many meteorite samples. Shifts onother isotopes of Cr, Fe and Ni aremuch smaller. Our calculations assumed that the initial inventory of all heavyelements was solar, with isotopic ratios taken from [5],but with the abundances of “heavy elements” relative toH and He variable as an estimate of the net “metallicity”of the system. The net number of isotopes (Ni) in theenvelope for all species was calculated at the end of eachpulse-interpulse episode and carried out through the fullevolution of model AGB stars up to the end of the AGBphase. The enrichment factorsE⊙i,kof isotope “i” relativeto an index isotope “k” for an initial solar isotopic pattern (E⊙i,k ≡ (Ni/Nk)/(Ni/Nk)⊙− 1) were calculatedfollowing [6], with some modifications to include all pertinent nuclei in the region of interest, for stars ranging inmass from 1.5 to 3M⊙ for solar and 1/3 solar metallicities. For 64Ni, attentionmust be paid to the e and positronemission branches of 64Cu. The results for Cr, Fe and Niare shown in Figure 1. It is evident that 54Cr, 58Fe and64Ni are produced in large enrichments as compared to allother isotopes of those elements. This relative abundancepattern result is independent of the stellarmass andmetallicity. Themagnitude of the enrichment is sensitive to thenumber of pulses and metallicity. All previous yield calculations in the literature are not applicable for Cr, Fe andNi except for the results available at the FRANEC database (Repository of Updated Isotopic Tables & Yields).The report by [7] that provides this data base is focusedon light s and heavy s parameters ([ls/Fe] and [hs/Fe],respectively). The results obtained here and the FRUITYdata base are in essential agreement for Cr, Fe and Ni.Weconclude that some of the observed effects in Cr, Fe andNi are due to processing in AGB stars and not related toSNe. The attribution of these effects to SNe is sometimebased on the existence of large isotopic shifts and thelure of SNe. These effects can be obtained in standardAGB processing in most cases. For Fe and Ni there aresome data on circumstellar condensates associated withAGB stars. The first reports by [8] using an IMS3F. Theirfocus was on X grains that are associated with SNe. [8]only measured 54Fe/56Fe and did not detect any effects.A report by [9] presented extensive data on Fe and Ni1204.pdf

These measurements are very difficult because of interferences at54Cr, 58Ni and 64Zn. The work of [9] was again on Xgrains associated with SNe. Large excesses were foundfor 57Fe and 61Ni and 62Ni for some X grains. Extensivemeasurements were also made on Mainstream grains associated with AGB stars. These showed no large shifts(see their Figs 4 and 5). The major emphasis of [9] wasto identify the effects they measured with selected zonesin a reference SNeII model assuming that different zonesare sampled to produce the isotopic patterns a SiC grain.These workers present the effects of s-processing in theenvelopes of AGB stars. However, they present no calculations for 52Cr, 58Fe or 64Ni which are the isotopeswith major s-process effects. We presume these were ignored because they could not be measured. The results onmain stream grains in that report do not either support ornegate the results presented in this work. The connectionof s-processing to Si, Ca and Ti is more complex as hasbeen widely noted in the literature, particularly considering data on those circumstellar condensates (CIRCONS)which are associated with AGB stars [10]. Cogent arguments have been presented by [11, 12] and [13] thatinitial variability in the Ti isotopic composition of starsis responsible for the wide scatter of isotopic abundancepatterns found for Ti. We are in accord with this view butconsider this to be the result of a typical granularity in theISM and not directly connected to the “Galactic Chemical Evolution”. While we consider long time galacticscale effects to be very important, these should only beassociated with low metallicity stars. We consider thatthe Ti data can be explained by ∼10% variability in theabundances of the isotopes coupled by the fact that onlyadvanced stages of dredge-up dominate the isotopic patterns. Efforts to correlate Si and Ti patterns with GCE iscomplicated by the fact that the Si is only weakly affectedby s-processing and the wide variability of SNe sourcesfor Si will dominate the patterns as pointed out by [14].The problem of Ca remains difficult. The Ca shifts ins-processing are relatively weak as compared to Ti, Cr,Fe and Ni. Even a very small granularity in the ISM willmake unraveling of components difficult. The effects wecalculate for 46Ca are very large and no observations support this. Provisionally, we attribute this to a short livedstate of 45Ca. The standard assumption that 42Ca/44Cais Solar is certainly not justified and small shifts in thatratio would give even larger shifts in 48Ca/40Ca. AGBprocessing will shift 42Ca/44Ca and give a spurious effect in 48Ca, An increase of ε(42, 44) = 2 would give aε(46, 48) = 4 . AGB processing would also give a significant shift in 43Ca/44Ca which has not been observedas pointed out by D.A. Papanastassiou (private communication). It is hoped that the above simple considerationson AGB processing may aid in clarifying some of theisotopic shifts found in some Fe group nuclei.Acknowledgements.
