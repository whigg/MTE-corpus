 ISOTOPIC ANOMALIES IN Cr, Fe AND Ni FROM "s" PROCESSING IN AGB STARS. G. J. Wasserburg, Lunatic Asylum, Geological & Planetary Sciences, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA (gjw@gps.caltech.edu), O. Trippella, M. Busso, Dep. of Physics, University of Perugia, and INFN, Section of Perugia, Italy. We report on the effects of slow neutron captures in AGB stars on isotopes of the "Fe group" elements. In particular Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni and Zn are considered to be members of the "iron group". These nuclei are predominantly the product of supernovae (SNe), both core collapse and SNeIa. It has been known for over three decades that small (<1%) variations are found in the isotopic compositions of Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni and Zn in macroscopic samples of meteorites (see review by [1]). In particular, see [2] for Fe and [3] for Ni. Their results stimulated this study. In particular, these isotopic effects are common in calciumaluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) in meteorites, but are also wide spread at lower levels in "bulk" samples of many different groups of meteorites. The observed effects in Cr, Fe and Ni often show enrichments in the heaviest isotopes 54Cr, 58Fe and 64Ni, which are low fractions of their respective element (∼2.3% for 54Cr, ∼0.28% for 58Fe and ∼0.9% for 64Ni). The isotopic patterns observed in Ti and Si are distinct and complex. As the "Fe group" elements are associated with Supernovae (SNe), it has been natural that interpretations of these effects in CaIs and "bulk" meteorites have focused on nucleosynthetic processes in SNe. This has not led to any firm explanation of the observed isotopic anomalies or to clear predictions. The first study that considered the possibility of s-process effects on Fe-group nuclei was by [4], who explored the occurrence of s-processing in massive stars. The s-processed material is, in the interstellar medium (hereafter ISM), predominantly from low mass AGB stars. We expect that the effect of s-processing on Cr, Fe, and Ni (originally synthesized in SNe) is to produce the heavier isotopes of these elements, 54Cr, 58Fe and 64Ni, in over-abundance; this can be seen by considering that the pure s-process abundance pattern is, in general, smoothly correlated with the neutron-capture cross sections, yielding processed material enriched in nuclides heavier than the seed. As only a very small fraction of matter in an AGB star is subjected to s-processing, it is not obvious how large the effects will be in the envelope of an AGB star, or will be provided to the ISM. There are thus three distinct issues: i) What are the sprocess effects on isotopic abundance patterns in Cr, Fe, and Ni in an AGB envelope? ii) How significant are these effects? iii) What are the effects to be expected on the nuclei of lower atomic number than iron (e.g. Si, Ti and Ca)? We show that there are substantial effects on the abundances of 54Cr, 58Fe and 64Ni produced in AGB stars and that these may provide an explanation of the effects observed in many meteorite samples. Shifts on other isotopes of Cr, Fe and Ni are much smaller. Our calculations assumed that the initial inventory of all heavy elements was solar, with isotopic ratios taken from [5], but with the abundances of "heavy elements" relative to H and He variable as an estimate of the net "metallicity" of the system. The net number of isotopes (Ni) in the envelope for all species was calculated at the end of each pulse-interpulse episode and carried out through the full evolution of model AGB stars up to the end of the AGB phase. The enrichment factorsE⊙ i,k of isotope "i" relative to an index isotope "k" for an initial solar isotopic pattern (E⊙i,k ≡ (Ni/Nk)/(Ni/Nk) ⊙− 1) were calculated following [6], with some modifications to include all pertinent nuclei in the region of interest, for stars ranging in mass from 1.5 to 3 M⊙ for solar and 1/3 solar metallicities. For 64Ni, attention must be paid to the e and positron emission branches of 64Cu. The results for Cr, Fe and Ni are shown in Figure 1. It is evident that 54Cr, 58Fe and 64Ni are produced in large enrichments as compared to all other isotopes of those elements. This relative abundance pattern result is independent of the stellar mass and metallicity. The magnitude of the enrichment is sensitive to the number of pulses and metallicity. All previous yield calculations in the literature are not applicable for Cr, Fe and Ni except for the results available at the FRANEC data base (Repository of Updated Isotopic Tables & Yields). The report by [7] that provides this data base is focused on light s and heavy s parameters ([ls/Fe] and [hs/Fe], respectively). The results obtained here and the FRUITY data base are in essential agreement for Cr, Fe and Ni.We conclude that some of the observed effects in Cr, Fe and Ni are due to processing in AGB stars and not related to SNe. The attribution of these effects to SNe is sometime based on the existence of large isotopic shifts and the lure of SNe. These effects can be obtained in standard AGB processing in most cases. For Fe and Ni there are some data on circumstellar condensates associated with AGB stars. The first reports by [8] using an IMS3F. Their focus was on X grains that are associated with SNe. [8] only measured 54Fe/56Fe and did not detect any effects. A report by [9] presented extensive data on Fe and Ni  Atomic Mass 50 52 54 (i, 52 )E 00.2 0.4 0.6 Cr isotopes 1/3Z1.5M TPth0.1055 - 12 TPth0.0399 - 6 1/3Z3M TPth0.5672 - 13 TPth0.1162 - 7 FRUITY models 1/3Z1.5M 1/3Z3M Atomic Mass 54 56 58 (i, 56 )E 01 23 45 Fe isotopes 1/3Z3M TPth3.9383 - 13 TPth0.8320 - 7 1/3Z1.5M TPth0.6803 - 12 TPth0.2272 - 6 FRUITY models 1/3Z1.5M 1/3Z3M Atomic Mass 58 60 62 64 (i, 58 )E 02 46 Ni isotopes 1/3Z1.5M TPth1.4717 - 12 TPth0.6509 - 6 1/3Z3M TPth6.4774 - 13 TPth1.2387 - 7 FRUITY models 1/3Z1.5M 1/3Z3M isotopes in SiC grains using a NanoSims. These measurements are very difficult because of interferences at 54Cr, 58Ni and 64Zn. The work of [9] was again on X grains associated with SNe. Large excesses were found for 57Fe and 61Ni and 62Ni for some X grains. Extensive measurements were also made on Mainstream grains associated with AGB stars. These showed no large shifts (see their Figs 4 and 5). The major emphasis of [9] was to identify the effects they measured with selected zones in a reference SNeII model assuming that different zones are sampled to produce the isotopic patterns a SiC grain. These workers present the effects of s-processing in the envelopes of AGB stars. However, they present no calculations for 52Cr, 58Fe or 64Ni which are the isotopes with major s-process effects. We presume these were ignored because they could not be measured. The results on main stream grains in that report do not either support or negate the results presented in this work. The connection of s-processing to Si, Ca and Ti is more complex as has been widely noted in the literature, particularly considering data on those circumstellar condensates (CIRCONS) which are associated with AGB stars [10]. Cogent arguments have been presented by [11, 12] and [13] that initial variability in the Ti isotopic composition of stars is responsible for the wide scatter of isotopic abundance patterns found for Ti. We are in accord with this view but consider this to be the result of a typical granularity in the ISM and not directly connected to the "Galactic Chemical Evolution". While we consider long time galactic scale effects to be very important, these should only be associated with low metallicity stars. We consider that the Ti data can be explained by ∼10% variability in the abundances of the isotopes coupled by the fact that only advanced stages of dredge-up dominate the isotopic patterns. Efforts to correlate Si and Ti patterns with GCE is complicated by the fact that the Si is only weakly affected by s-processing and the wide variability of SNe sources for Si will dominate the patterns as pointed out by [14]. The problem of Ca remains difficult. The Ca shifts in s-processing are relatively weak as compared to Ti, Cr, Fe and Ni. Even a very small granularity in the ISM will make unraveling of components difficult. The effects we calculate for 46Ca are very large and no observations support this. Provisionally, we attribute this to a short lived state of 45Ca. The standard assumption that 42Ca/44Ca is Solar is certainly not justified and small shifts in that ratio would give even larger shifts in 48Ca/40Ca. AGB processing will shift 42Ca/44Ca and give a spurious effect in 48Ca, An increase of ε(42, 44) = 2 would give a ε(46, 48) = 4 . AGB processing would also give a significant shift in 43Ca/44Ca which has not been observed as pointed out by D.A. Papanastassiou (private communication). It is hoped that the above simple considerations on AGB processing may aid in clarifying some of the isotopic shifts found in some Fe group nuclei. Acknowledgements.
