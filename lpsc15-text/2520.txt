ENDOFLIFESCENARIOSFORSMALLRUBBLEPILEASTEROIDS. D.J. Scheeres,U.Colorado, Boulder (scheeres@colorado.edu).Recent theory and observations have shown that rubblepile asteroids may have a small but significant level of cohesion holding their components together, on the order of 100Pa. One significant implication of this, among others, is thatrubble pile bodies less than a certain size subject to the YORPeffect will have finite lifetimes in the solar system before theybecome disaggregated into their individual components due torepeated fission. This occurs for bodies small enough suchthat their fission spin rate exceeds the escape spin rate, meaning that they undergo abrupt escape after fission. We provideexplicit predictions of the possible lifetime of small rubblepile asteroids as a function of their cohesive strength and willdiscuss the possible implications of this at the conference.Introduction The physical lifetime of asteroids pose a complex, difficult and diverse set of questions that vary as a function of the size of these bodies. Classical theory has identifiedcollisions and gravitational interactions with planets as themain driver of asteroids, and this remains true for larger bodies. However, as the size of the asteroids considered becomessmaller, non-gravitational effects come into play. In addition toeffects that change orbits, it is also now realized that there areeffects that control and shape the physical evolution of asteroids. Most significant among these is the Yarkovsky-O'KeefeRadzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect that causes smaller asteroid to spin-up over time, potentially bringing their spin ratesto extremes that can cause a rubble pile asteroid to fission andenter a multiple-component stage of its evolution. It has beenshown that YORP spin-up and fission can directly competewith and dominate over collisions as a transformative physicalevolution in the main belt at sizes of a few kilometers [1]. Thisleads to a markedly different type of physical transformationas compared with collisional impacts.For larger asteroids subject to YORP, rotational fissionleads to the creation of unstable multiple-component asteroidsystems which undergo a chaotic dynamical evolution. Thereare a number of different outcomes that can emerge from suchinteractions, some of which are summarized in Jacobson andScheeres [2]. The lifetimes of objects that emerge from rotational fission are complex, and can go through a number ofiterations before landing into a stable state such as the BYORPTide equilibria for binary objects [3,4]. Over time, howeverthe size of a rubble pile may decrease through repetition ofevolutionary cycles, collisions, or planetary flybys. As thisoccurs, the recent theory and observations that have shownthat rubble pile bodies can have a weak level of cohesion begins to become important [5,6,7,8]. As the size of a weaklycohesive rubble pile decreases, the spin rate at which this bodywill fission increases. At some point the spin rate can becomeso great that the components of the fissioned body may immediately escape, without undergoing further interactions. Oncethis size limit is reached, the physical evolution of a rubblepile can enter a new phase where it undergoes such fissionswith abrupt escapes at increasing rates, rendering a rubble pilebody into its component pieces in a finite time. This abstractpresents the physics of this final phase of a rubble pile's lifeand provides a range of estimates for its duration.An overview of the effect follows. For a rubble pile bodywith a given level of cohesion, its maximum spin rate is inversely proportional to the body diameter. Thus, every time arubble pile body is split into smaller components, the resulting bodies can spin proportionally faster before it can shed orfission again. In contrast, the YORP effect's spin accelerationis inversely proportional to the body diameter squared. Thus,the time it takes for the components of a fissioned body to spinup to its new fission limit is proportional to the body diameter squared and takes proportionally less time to achieve theirnext fission. If a body fissions into N components, the neweffective diameters of the components will equalN−1/3 timestheir initial diameter. Thus, if we assume that a fissioned component is immediately accelerated to its next fission rate, thetotal time for a rubble pile to completely fission is a convergentpower series, and can be shown to be equal to the initial YORPtime scale of the starting, initial rubble pile. This total timecan be extended by an order of magnitude if a fissioned bodyis initially rotationally decelerated. It may also be extendedif its post-fission tumbling state slows its YORP rotationalacceleration.This abstract outlines recent research and predictions forthe likely lifetimes of small rubble pile asteroids. Direct comparisons are made between the competing effects of YORPacceleration, dissipation of a complex rotation state back touniform rotation, and the number of components that a bodymay split into. We find that, based on recent constraints placedon theµQ values of rubble pile bodies, the relaxation time backto uniform rotation should be short compared to the time tobe accelerated to its next fission spin rate. Ultimately, we findthat the lifetime of a rubble pile once less than∼500 meters indiameter at 1AU can be as low as 0.4 MY, but not faster thanthis in general. At the extreme other end of the spectrum, if arubble pile is always subject to a deceleration its lifetime canbe extended by an order of magnitude.Spin Limits for Abrupt Escape For a rubble pile with agiven level of cohesion, σ, the nominal failure rate of the bodyis a combination of overcoming gravitational attraction andcohesion. The general expression for the spin rate at whichfission will occur is of the form ω2F ∼ ω2ρ + σρR2 , where ωρis the spin rate at which a cohesionless rubble pile will beginto deform and potentially fission, ρ is the density of the bodyand R is its radius [5]. Note that ω2ρ ∼ 4piGρ/3, where Gis the gravitational constant and is nominally independent ofsize (although it does have a shape dependence). Thus, for asmall enough rubble pile the spin rate for fission is dominatedby the cohesion term and is ωF ∼√σρ1R, where we note thatrecent theory and observational constraints indicate that thelevel of cohesive strength is of the order σ ∼ 100 Pa [A,B,C].Given this dependence, at a small enough body size the failure2520.pdf

spin rate will be great enough such that when the componentsseparate they will immediately escape and not undergo thecomplex dynamical evolution that occurs at lower spin rates.Figure 1 shows the size at which such an abrupt escape occursfor different strength levels.Assuming mass conservations across such a fission event,we can develop a rule for relating the size of the new asteroidswith the prior asteroid. If the body breaks into N distinct androughly equal components then on average NR3i+1 = R3i .This leads to the size of a body at the (i + 1)th fission asa function of the initial body size when such abrupt fissionstarted: Ri+1 =(1N1/3)i+1R0. Then the change in angularvelocity from one fission event to the next can be characterizedas: ∆ωi+1,i =√σρ[1Ri+1∓ 1Ri]. The − sign occurs if thebody undergoes rotational acceleration in the same direction,and the + if it first decelerates and goes through zero.Figure 1: Rubble pile escape spin limit as a function ofcohesive strength (from [5]).YORP Timescales The YORP effect has been extensivelystudied, especially for uniform rotators. Thus we simply statethe general form of the spin rateω˙ ∼ 3Φ4piA2√1− E2CρR2where C ∼ 0.001→ 0.01 is a non-dimensional constant that isa function of the shape of an asteroidal body [9]. The parameterΦ is the radiation constant and A is the orbit semi-major axisand E the eccentricity. The timescale of significance here isthe the time it takes a body to fission into components of sizeRi+1 at an initial spin rate ofωF,i. This is computed as ∆ω/ω˙,and isTi+1,i ∼ 4piA2√1− E23Φ√σρC[1∓ 1N1/3]Ri+1Relaxation Timescales One prediction of an abrupt escapeis that the component bodies will immediately start to tumble,due to the conservation of the body spin vector across a breakupand the immediate mis-alignment of this spin vector from theprinciple moments of inertia of the body. While extensivestudy of the YORP effect on a tumbling body has not beenmade, it is believed that the YORP spin-up effect will be lesssignificant for a tumbling body. Thus, the relaxation time ofa body is important to consider. Taking the classical analysisfound in Harris [10] and comparing the relaxation timescale tothe YORP timescale at 1 AU for the range of possible valuesoutlined above we find that their ratio goes from τR/τY ∼1 × 10−5 → 0.3. The lower limit is computed using thenewly estimated µQ values for a small, rubble pile binaryasteroid made by Scheirich et al. [4], while the upper bounduses the conservative upper constraint found in Margot et al.[11]. Thus we note that the relaxation time appears to be shortwith respect to the YORP time, meaning that this phase can beignored in our subsequent computations.Putting it together: Rubble Pile Lifetimes Given the abovemodel and results we can compute a bound on the total lifetimeof a rubble pile body by summing all the times Ti+1,i, as thesewill be a convergent power series.∞∑i=0Ti,i+1 ∼ 4piA23Φ√σρC[1∓ 1N1/3][1− 1N1/3]R0We add to this the initial YORP timescale of a body of sizeR0to be accelerated from rest to its failure spin rate, calculated tobe 4piA23Φ√σρC R0 which is remarkably equal to the summationchosen with the "-" sign.Note that if YORP directly accelerates the body to thenext fission event, the sum is independent of the parameterN and equals twice the YORP timescale of a body of radiusR0 to achieve its cohesive fission spin rate. If the body isdecelerated each time and must pass through a "0" spin ratethe total lifetime is lengthened and becomes a function of N .Taking some nominal / conservative values of A = 1.5×1011 m (1 AU), Φ = 1 × 1017 kg-m/s2, ρ = 3000 kg/m3,R0 ∼ 250 m, N = 4, we find the following results. If thebody starts at a size of R0 with no spin and is consistentlyspun-up to the next fission event without passing through zero,the ultimate time scale ranges from 0.8 → 8 MY for therange of YORP strengths used here. Instead, if the bodyundergoes a reversal in its spin acceleration the time scale isprolonged, almost by a factor of 5 for N = 4, but decreasingas N increases, yielding 3.5 → 35 My. Of ultimate interestis to compare these estimated lifetimes with the measuredcosmic-ray exposure ages of meteorites, to better understandthe timescale of physical evolution of the parent bodies ofmeteorites [12].References: [1]: Marzari et al., Icarus 214: 622-631 (2011).[2]: Jacobson & Scheeres, Icarus 214: 161-178 (2011).
