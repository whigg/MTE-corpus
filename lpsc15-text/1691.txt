TURBULENT CONCENTRATION OF MM-SIZE PARTICLES IN THE PROTOPLANETARY NEBULA:SCALE-DEPENDENT CASCADES. J. N. Cuzzi1, and T. Hartlep2, Jeffrey.Cuzzi@NASA.gov; 1Ames Research Center, NASA,MS 245-3, Moffett Field, CA, USA; 2BAERI inc.; Petaluma, CA..Introduction: The initial accretion of primitive bodies(here, asteroids in particular) from freely-floating nebula particles remains problematic. Traditional growth-by-stickingmodels encounter a formidable “meter-size barrier" [1] (oreven amm-to-cm-size barrier [2]) in turbulent nebulae, makingthe preconditions for so-called “streaming instabilities" difficult to achieve even for so-called “lucky" particles [3]. Evenif growth by sticking could somehow breach the meter sizebarrier, turbulent nebulae present further obstacles through the1-10km size range [4]. On the other hand, nonturbulent nebulae form large asteroids too quickly to explain long spreads information times, or the dearth of melted asteroids [5]. Theoretical understanding of nebula turbulence is itself in flux; recentmodels of MRI (magnetically-driven) turbulence favor lowor-no-turbulence environments [6], but purely hydrodynamicturbulence is making a comeback, with two recently discovered mechanisms generating robust turbulence which do notrely on magnetic fields at all [7,8].An important clue regarding planetesimal formation isan apparent 100km diameter peak in the pre-depletion, preerosion mass distribution of asteroids [9]; scenarios leadingdirectly from independent nebula particulates to large objectsof this size, which avoid the problematic m-km size range,could be called “leapfrog" scenarios [10-12]. The leapfrogscenario we have studied in detail involves formation of denseclumps of aerodynamically selected, typically mm-size particles in turbulence, which can under certain conditions shrinkinexorably on 100-1000 orbit timescales and form 10-100kmdiameter sandpile planetesimals. There is evidence that at leastthe ordinary chondrite parent bodies were initially composedentirely of a homogeneous mix of such particles [4]. Thus,while they are arcane, turbulent concentration models actingdirectly on chondrule size particles are worthy of deeper study.The typical sizes of planetesimals and the rate of their formation [11,12] can be estimated using a statistical model withproperties inferred from large numerical simulations of turbulence [13]. Nebula turbulence is described by its Reynoldsnumber Re = (L/η)4/3, where L = Hα1/2 is the largesteddy scale, H is the nebula gas vertical scale height, α theturbulent viscosity parameter, and η is the Kolmogorov orsmallest scale in turbulence (typically about 1km), with eddyturnover time tη . In the nebula, Re is far larger than anynumerical simulation can handle, so some physical argumentsare needed to extend the results of numerical simulations tonebula conditions. In this paper, we report new physics to beincorporated into our statistical models.Cascade model and multiplier distributions: The spatial distribution of particle concentration can be captured statistically by a cascade model [11,13] which predicts the probability distribution functions (PDFs) for dense particle clumps;these PDFs are essentially the volume fractions of the nebulawhich have the necessary properties (solids mass and localvorticity) for planetesimal formation. A cascade model presumes that, as energy flows from large eddies to smaller ones,particles and fluid properties are partitioned unequally at each“level" of the cascade from “parent" into “daughter" eddies.Figure 1: The symbols indicate the multiplier pdfsfor turbulent dissipation in high-Re atmospheric turbulence [10], showing scale invariance over 300-3000η. Thered β-functions (β=3, 6, and 48) provide context for βvalues in figure 2. In [11] we adopted level-independentmultiplier pdfs with β ∼ 3 based on our own simulations.The probability distribution functions (pdfs) of the so-calledmultipliers by which particle and fluid properties are partitioned have widths that are parameterized by the parameterβ; smaller β means larger width ([13]; see figure 1 above),or a higher probability of strongly asymmetrical partitioningwhich, repeated over a number of levels, leads to clumpier ormore intermittent local values of particle and fluid properties.The wide range of scales between L and η is looselycalled the inertial range; in this range the equations of motionare scale-free, and the multiplier pdfs for dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy (which, like the chondrule-size particlesmodeled by [11-13], is characterized by Kolmogorov eddytimescales) are known to be scale-independent in atmosphericflows from hundreds to thousands of Kolmogorov lengthscales[14; figure 1]. This fact motivated [11,13] to develop a cascademodel in which the multiplier pdfs for particle concentrationΦwere also independent of turbulent eddy lengthscale. Subsequent disagreement with results of others [15] led us to a morein-depth study using highly resolved fluid simulations [16,17]that revealed a scale dependence of multiplier pdfs, which willaffect the formation rate and masses of primary planetesimalsin the scenario of [11,12]. The approach is described in [18].Here we present further analysis along these lines.Results: Figure 2 shows our results for the widths of themultiplier pdfs [18], binned on a wide range of lengthscales rgiven in units of η. In this figure, the particle stopping timets has been normalized to a scale-dependent value Str usingthe inertial range timescale ratio (r/η)−2/3, and the constantparameter St ≡ ts/tη where tη is the Kolmogorov eddy time.In this plot, a value of Str = 1 represents a particle havingstopping time equal to the eddy time for the spatial scale r.Except at the largest binning scales (r ≥ 128η), this scaling1691.pdf

Figure 2: β (like inverse width) of multiplier pdfs forparticle concentration, plotted as a function of Str(stopping time ts normalized by the turnover time ofan eddy with scale r), for a variety of binning scales rranging from 12η to 512η ∼ L/2. With this scaling,the multiplier pdf β values collapse to a universal curveexcept at the largest scales r > L/10. The scale-freeβ ∼ 3 for dissipation (figure 1) is shown. A universalcurve allows our cascade models to be extended to scalessmaller than resolvable by current numerical models.collapses our previous results [18] into an invariant family ofcurves, allowing us to predict the value of β for any combination of lengthscale and particle stopping time. The minimumnear Str = 0.2 suggests that particles with stopping timesomewhat shorter than the eddy time on lengthscale r are moststrongly concentrated within spatial averages over lengthscaler. This scaling collapses the multipliers much better than analternate scaling found by [19] which collapses the normalized concentration pdfs themselves; the concentration pdfscan be thought of as the cumulative result of multipliers actingsequentially over all larger scales. After a number of eddybifurcations to smaller scale, particles of a small but finiterange of sizes might thus end up concentrated within a single clump, which may be consistent with new determinationsof chondrule size distributions which find them to be broaderthan previously believed [20]. Our model will ultimately maketestable predictions along these lines.However, the curves for the largest lengthscales (r >L/10 where L ∼ 1000η) diverge from this scale-invariantcurve, probably because, in the top decade of lengthscales,turbulent stretching and vortex tube formation have not yetreached their fully developed state (see [8] and referencestherein). For these largest scales, multiplier statistics are bettercharacterized by their scale as a fraction of L rather than as amultiple of η. Moreover, at the largest scales, where nominalmultiplier β values are large, the β-function itself does not provide a complete description of the cascade properties (figure3). The scale at which the β-function becomes an adequate fitto the actual multiplier pdf is close to the scale at which theβ(Str) curves of figure 2 become universal.The cascade model for planetesimal formation by turbulent concentration [11] can now be modified to allow for theobserved level-dependence in the particle concentration multiplier pdfs (figures 2 and 3), as well as in the multiplier pdfs forgas enstrophy (vorticity squared) which also determine the cascade results and, we have found, also differ from values usedFigure 3: Multiplier pdfs for nominally St = 1 particles, at four diﬀerent scales. The red curves are thebest-fitting overall β-functions, which get narrower fora given particle size to large scales (in figure 2, pointsmove up and to the left on the universal collapse curve).At smaller scales, lying within the universal collapse domain, the β-function itself provides a good (and scaleinvariant) fit to the actual multiplier pdf. However theactual pdfs (black curves) have broader exponential tailsat large spatial scales.in [11,12]. However, the asymptotic β value we determinefor dissipation does not quite match the scale-free value determined by [14] in atmospheric flows. Thus, some effort mustbe dedicated to understanding how the results presented heremay change with Re itself, and we are pursuing this. Becausenebula properties such as turbulent intensity and gas densityare unknown to an order of magnitude [11,12], these findingsdo not, on the face of it, qualitatively change the outlook for thescenario, but will lead to quantitative changes in predictions ofplanetesimal IMF and chondrule size distributions.References: [1] Brauer, F. et al 2008 A&A 480, 859;[2] Zsom A. et al 2010, A&A 513, id.A57; [3] GaraudP., Meru F., Galvagni M. et al.
