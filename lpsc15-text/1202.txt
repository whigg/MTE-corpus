It has been found that ion loss rates slowly vary with the subsolar longitude, anticorrelating with the intensity of the dayside crustal field source, with some time delay, using a time-dependent multispecies MHD model (Ma et al., 2014). In this study, we investigate in detail how plasma properties are influenced locally by the crustal field and its rotation. Model results will be compared in detail with plasma observations from MAVEN.    Approach: The time-dependent multi-species single-fluid MHD model [Ma et al., 2014] includes four continuity equations to track the mass densities of the proton and three major ions in Martian ionosphere: O2+, O+ and CO2+. All the ion species share the same velocity and temperature. The Mars-solar wind interaction is self-consistently calculated in the model by including the effects of the crustal magnetic field, ion-neutral collisions, and major chemical reactions.   We simulate a few days of plasma interaction using solar wind condition based on averaged SWIA (Solar Wind Ion Analyzer) observations in the solar wind during relative quite time. The rotation of the crustal field is included in the time-dependent simulation, and Mars rotation axis is set to match the real condition.   Model Results and Comparsion: We present model results along MAVEN orbit and compare them with observations from MAVEN plasma instruments such as magnetometer (MAG) as shown in Figure 1, SWIA, and Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS). The MHD model results are used to provide a global context of the observations in terms to understand the observed magnetic field (see Figure 2) and other plasma properties as well as the effect of the local crustal field and its rotation.
