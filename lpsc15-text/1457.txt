ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF THE VASTITAS BOREALIS FORMATION IN THE VICINITY OF CHRYSE AND ACIDALIA PLANITIAE, MARS. M. R. Salvatore1 and P. R. Christensen1, 1School of Earth and Space Exploration, Arizona State University, 201 E. Orange Mall, Tempe, AZ 85287-6305, msalvatore@asu.edu.  Introduction: The martian surface is characterized by an ancient topographic dichotomy, with heavily cratered highlands to the south and the less cratered lowlands to the north [1]. The Vastitas Borealis Formation (VBF) is the uppermost geologic unit over much of the northern lowlands, is separated into an interior and annular marginal unit [2], and is thought to represent the final stages of water-related sedimentary activity in the northern plains of Mars [1-5]. Many studies have identified unique morphological features within the VBF [2, 5, and references therein], including subdued topography [e.g., 3], mud volcanism [e.g., 6], graben networks [e.g., 7], thin and lobate flow features [e.g., 8], and sedimentary layering in the shallow subsurface [9]. However, only recently has a single hypothesis been proposed to explain all of the newly available datasets [5, 10].  In this study, we evaluate the hypothesis that the VBF was derived from the burial, compaction, and expulsion of water-laden sediments (“mud”) following the discharge of the circumChryse outflow channels. This mud expulsion hypothesis helps to unite the range of morphological, thermophysical, and spectral properties of the VBF and the plains of Chryse and Acidalia Planitiae under a single mechanism. Hypothesis and Predictions: Based on the previous work and recent analyses throughout this region, we propose the following timeline of geologic events (Fig. 1) [5]: (a) the pre-outflow channel landscape of the northern plains; (b) deposition and burial of fine-grained, waterladen sediments derived from the circum-Chryse outflow channels; (c) compaction of these sedimentary materials by subsequent coarser outflow channel sediments; (d) expulsion of the fine-grained, water-laden sediments onto the surface due to overpressurization, resulting in depositional constructs, fracture formation, and diagnostic flow morphologies; and (e) deflation of the surface in response to the removal of these sedimentary materials. Predictions. Using this hypothesis as a geologic framework, we can make several predictions that can be tested using the available orbital datasets [5]. If the VBF formed as a result of the burial, compaction, and expulsion of water-laden sediments, then there should be evidence of (1) a thickening sedimentary layer in the subsurface with distance from the outflow channels; (2) similar subsurface properties in the VBF marginal unit and the surrounding plains of Chryse Planitia; (3) surface deflation as a result of the expulsion of water-laden sediments; (4) similar thermophysical properties associated with materials of the same predicted origin; and (5) regional spectral signatures that are consistent with the proposed formation mechanism. Methods: Morphological and stratigraphic properties were investigated using the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE [11]), Context Camera (CTX [12]), and Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS [13]) visible camera. Visible/near-infrared (VNIR) spectral data were derived from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM [14]) instrument, while thermal infrared (TIR) spectral data were acquired using the THEMIS infrared camera and the Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES [15]) instrument. THEMIS nighttime infrared data were used to derive the thermal inertia of different surfaces [16], which is indicative of the grain size and/or induration of the surface materials. Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA [17]) data were used for topographic analyses. Results and Discussion: We assess the five predictions listed earlier as a means of testing the hypothesis that the VBF formed through the burial, compaction, and expulsion of mud from the shallow subsurface [5]:  (1) Thickening sedimentary layer. The properties of  Figure 1. Hypothesized evolution of the VBF in Chryse and Acidalia Planitiae. (a) pre-outflow channel terrain, followed by the deposition of fine (b) to progressively coarser (c) outflow channel sediments. (d) Compaction and expulsion of finegrained, water-laden sediments onto the surface. The formation of mud volcanoes and lobate flow features (1), as well as polygonal fractures (2) are a result of this (e) Surface deflation in response to subsurface sediment removal.

crater ejecta deposits can be used as a proxy to characterize the properties of the subsurface. Within the VBF marginal unit and much of the surrounding plains of Chryse Planitia, craters of comparable size exhibit widely different ejecta properties, indicative of a highly variable subsurface. This observation suggests that the subsurface properties in this region are heterogeneous over short spatial scales and at shallow depths. Further north into the VBF interior unit, crater ejecta are largely homogeneous regardless of crater diameter. These similar properties indicate that the subsurface becomes more homogeneous to a greater depth with increasing latitude. (2) Similarity between Chryse plains and VBF marginal unit. Sedimentary layers associated with outflow channel deposits have been observed outside of the VBF in the plains of Chryse Planitia [9]. Similarly, crater ejecta morphologies and thermophysical properties that are common in the VBF marginal and interior unit are also observed in the surrounding plains outside of the VBF. These observations suggest that the previously mapped extent of the VBF may simply be a surficial expression of a more widespread subsurface sedimentary unit. The more diagnostic surface properties associated with the VBF may only have formed where the subsurface sedimentary accumulations are thickest and where subsequent surface deformation could occur. (3) Surface deflation. Evidence for surface deflation is observed throughout the VBF [5]. High-standing buttes and mesas have been identified with perched collar-like morphologies and no observed contact between their bases and the surrounding plains. On average, these collars are 123 ± 36 m above the surrounding plains. These collars are thought to indicate the original height of the surrounding terrain that has since deflated due to the expulsion of material from the subsurface. Applied evenly over the observed extent of these buttes, a deflation of 123 m represents approximately 3 x 105 km3 of expelled material from the subsurface. Assuming fluid-laden sediments with a porosity of 35%, consistent with inferences from [18] based on the modeled dielectric constant of the subsurface, the estimated volume of water expelled from the subsurface would be 1.05 x 105 km3, which is slightly less than the volume of Lake Superior. (4) Similar thermophysical properties. Several different units throughout Chryse and Acidalia Planitiae exhibit comparable surface properties and thermal inertias. For example, the marginal unit of the VBF and the previously identified mud volcanoes exhibit comparable thermal inertias (140 J m-2 K-1 s-0.5 and 135 J m-2 K-1 s-0.5, respectively). Similarly, the plains of Chryse Planitia outside of the VBF and the VBF interior unit exhibit identical thermal inertias (165 J m-2 K-1 s-0.5). These properties suggest that the VBF marginal unit and the observed mud volcanoes are composed of the same materials, while the VBF interior unit and the surrounding plains of Chryse Planitia also share a similar origin that is unique from the VBF marginal unit and mud volcanoes. (5) Regional spectral signatures. The composition of the VBF interior unit in Acidalia Planitia was previously derived using both VNIR [19] and TIR [20] orbital data [21]. Both datasets suggest an overall basaltic composition for this material, and both agree that the identified pyroxene compositions are dominated by low-calcium pyroxenes. Such compositions are more indicative of Noachian-aged basalts than Hesperian-aged basalts [22], which is consistent with the plains of Chryse Planitia and the VBF interior unit being derived from materials sourced from the late-stage outflow channel activity. These late-stage outflow channel sediments are derived from the deepest (oldest) areas within the channels, relative to the younger materials derived from higher in the stratigraphic column. Conclusions: The mud expulsion hypothesis for the origin and evolution of the VBF satisfies all previous and currently observed morphological, thermophysical, and spectral properties of Chryse and Acidalia Planitiae [5, 10], and was recently proposed for Utopia Planitia [23]. This formation mechanism indicates that the northern plains underwent immense and rapid sedimentary modification both during and after outflow channel activity. While the presence of a northern ocean on Mars remains uncertain, it is clear that oceanic amounts of liquid water were likely required to produce the observed properties associated with the VBF.
