Introduction: Bulk chemical compositions of Ca,Al-rich inclusions (CAIs) record the cumulative effects of multiple high-temperature and largely volatility-controlled processes (condensation and evaporation) during the first 12 million years of solar system history [1,2]. Yet precise CAI bulk composition data remain sparse. We contunue correlated mineralogical, chemical, and isotopic studies of large CAIs (~0.5 to 2 cm) from CV chondrites Efremovka and NWA 3118. The most common inclusions in CV chondrites are Type A and B  [3]. Type As are divided into two types: coarse-grained igneous Compact Type As (CTA) and apparently unmelted irregularly-shaped Fluffy Type As (FTA) [4]. Limited data of bulk chemical compositions of Type As (mostly CTAs) show a narrow range in the spinel-projected gehlenite–anorthite–forsterite ternary plane [5]. These bulk compositions plot at the beginning of the condensation trajectory from a gas of solar composition [6]. Type Bs are igneous CAIs that are more silica-rich than Type As and contain abundant primary (igneous) anorthite. Some Type Bs show evidence for multiple heating events [7]. Several CV CAIs have bulk chemical compositions transitional between Type As and Bs [7-9]. To understand evolution of CAI precursors and genetic relationship between FTA, CTA, and Type B CAIs we studied mineralogy and bulk chemical compositions of these CAI types in NWA 3118 and Efremovka. Results: FTA CAIs (39E, 41E, 44E) have irregular shape, consist of melilite nodules with enclosed spinel and rare perovskite grains, and are surrounded by Wark-Lovering (WL) rim layers of spinel and pyroxene. CAI 44E is a compound inclusion containing abundant spinel- and pyroxene-rich melilite nodules. Melilite is highly gehlenitic (Åk0.3–22), pyroxene in the rim and inside nodules is Al2O3- and TiO2-poor.  Bulk compositions of 39E and 41E projected from spinel on Ca2SiO4-Al2O3-Mg2SiO4 plane are in the field of Type A CAIs; bulk composition of 44E plots between the fields of Type As and Bs (Fig. 1).  CTA CAIs (6aN, 7N, 9bN, 21bE) have round or oval shape, consist of melilite of variable composition (Åk3–56), Al-Ti-pyroxene (up to 19 wt% Al2O3, 13 wt% TiO2), spinel, rare perovskite, and, occasionally, hibonite (titanium content in pyroxene is reported as TiO2 for simplification). They are surrounded by WLrim layers of melilite, spinel (±hibonite) and Aldiopside. Bulk compositions plot in the filed of Type A CAIs (Fig. 2).  Type B CAIs (10Na, 10Nb, 36E, 38E, 42E, 47E, 49E) are coarse-grained igneous inclusions composed of åkermanite-rich melilite (Åk26–72), zoned Al,Tipyroxene, spinel, and igneous anorthite. They are surrounded by WL-rim composed of melilite, spinel, and Al,Ti-pyroxene. Bulk compositions of these CAIs are in the field of typical Type B inclusions (Fig. 3).  Bulk compositions of several CAIs studied (1N, 13N, 16N, 27cE, 50E, 53E) are transitional between Type As and Bs (Fig. 4). These CAIs are texturally and mineralogically diverse CAIs: 1N and 16N are typical CTAs; 13N and 27cE are similar to Type Bs; 50E is intermediate between CTA and FTA; and 53E is a CTA CAI containing spinel-melilite-anorthite-hibonite inclusions. All these CAIs have WL-rim layers of melilite, spinel and pyroxene. CAI 1N consists mostly of gehlenitic melilite, with subordinate spinel, euhedral Al,Ti-pyroxene, and scattered perovskite grains enclosed in pyroxene, spinel, and melilite. The pyroxene is strongly zoned, with Al,Ti-rich interiors and Al,Ti-poor rims.  CAI 16N consists predominantly of melilite; pyroxene and spinel are relatively abundant compared to other CTAs studied. It also contains interstitial anorthite in the core, and numerous small perovskites generally enclosed  within pyroxene.  In CAIs 13N and 27cE, melilite varies from Åk14 to Åk33 in the rim, and from Åk31 to Åk70 in the core and the mantle zone. Pyroxene crystals in the core and the rim display different chemical compositions (Fig. 3) ‒ the core pyroxenes are enriched in TiOtot (TiO2+Ti2O3) and Al2O3 and depleted in MgO and SiO2 compared to the rim pyroxenes.  CAIs 50E and 53E consist mostly of highly gehlenitic melilite (Åk1–15) and pyroxene. In 50E, Tipoor Al- diopside forms individual concentric objects in the core. In 53E, pyroxene is Al,Ti-rich (up to 27 wt% Al2O3; 20 wt% TiO2) that occurs largely  in the core. The CAI contains also secondary anorthite. Discussion. The bulk chemical compositions of Type As appear to overlap with those of Type Bs suggesting a continuum between these CAI types. These observations may indicate either a continuum in bulk chemical compositions of CAI precursors or reflect various degrees of evaporation or re-condensation during their melting [9,10].

free Type A CAIs to anorthite-rich Type Bs requires the addition of a silica-rich component, possibly during alteration of melilite to secondary anorthite prior to melting [11].
