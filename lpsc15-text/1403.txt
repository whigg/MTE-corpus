(a) UNDERSTANDING THE NATURE OF POSSIBLE OLIVINE-CHROMITE EXPOSURES AT CRATER ARISTOTELES USING HIGH-RESOLUTION REMOTE SENSING DATA. Mamta Chauhan, Satadru Bhattacharya and Prakash Chauhan, Space Applications Centre, Indian Space Research Organisation, Ahmedabad - 380 015, India (satadru@sac.isro.gov.in).    Introduction: Crater Aristoteles (51oN 17o E), is a complex crater on the nearside of the Moon, lying in the North and displaying heterogeneous lithology [1, 2]. Mineral analysis of this highland crater detected the presence of mafic exposures of gabbro, norite and olivine-spinel from its margin and central peak. Here we report for the first time, the occurrences of olivine-chromite-bearing troctolites in the form of mafic ejecta clasts from the rim and terraces of crater Aristoteles based on the high spectral and spatial resolution data from recent lunar missions. To better understand the nature of occurrence and geological setting of these olivine-chromite exposures, a detailed mineralogical and morphological analysis have been carried out.  Methodology:  For mineralogical analysis of the study area, Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) data from Chandrayaan-1 have been used. Considering the widely separated absorption band of olivine and spinel in VNIR region, their modal composition derived from spectral analysis have been utilized for petrological studies as suggested by [3]. [3] has also mentioned the possibility and explained that most of the relevant compositional parameters required for determination of petrological factors such as modal percentage, geothermometric parameters like partition coefficient could be derived potentially from the analysis of reflectance spectra of the coexisting mineral phases. Considering this as the foundation, a detailed spectral analysis of olivine-chromite-bearing exposures has been carried out. An attempt has been made to derive the forsterite (Fo) and fayalite (Fa) content (wt%) in olivine based on variations in the band center of 1000-nm composite olivine feature following the techniques given by [4, 5]. To calculate the modal-composition of chromite and olivine their unique spectral properties and spectralcompositional relationship obtained from laboratory based reflectance measurement of the spectra have been used. The calculated parameters from spectral analysis are analysed by plotting them on various compositional plots and variation diagrams for understanding their geochemistry and deducing the relationship between the coexisting cations in minerals. Based on the systematic variation relationship of Fe2+ absorption band wavelength positions with Mg/(Mg + Fe2+) content, the partition coefficient (KD) is calculated for the coexisting olivine and chromite. The derived LnKD and Cr-content of chromite are used to estimate formation temperature of these exposures. For detailed assessment of morphological characteristics of    Figure 1.

 crater Aristoteles, high-resolution images (~0.5-2.0 m/pixel) from LROC Narrow angle camera (NAC) [6] have been used. Results and discussions: The results obtained from spectral-compositional-analysis are plotted in Figures 3-5.   Figure 3.

In LROC-NAC observations the associated mafic exposures occurs in the form of boulders and clusters of clasts present along the margin of the crater rim and fault scarps. Their geological setting over the raised crater rim and along the edges of fault scarps suggest their nature consistent with that of primary ejecta excavated during the initial less-shocked stage during cratering. The unique tectonic setting of the crater, associated lower crustal thickness, and the distribution pattern of mafic exposures further supports that they are deep crustal derivatives exposed by the high-velocity impact forming the crater Aristoteles.

(b) Plot of data for Fe-Mg exchange equilibrium between olivine-chromite assemblages of the crater Aristoteles over the isotherms [11] of lnKD KD=(XOlMg*XCrFe)/(XOlFe*XCrMg) against Cr # derived from spectral analysis [3].  Detailed spectral-compositional analysis of olivinechromites suggests them to be troctolitic in nature with high chromium content with Chromium Number (Cr# ) ~ 0.75 and Magnesium Number (Mg#) ~0.65. The calculated modal composition utilized for estimating the temperature based on derived LnKD (average value 1.43) indicates high formation temperature (1200-1000oC) suggestive of plutonic condition. The plots of the results obtained from spectral-compositional analysis falls within the field of stratified complexes that indicates a similarity in manner of formation analogous to chromites in terrestrial layered complexes.
