Introduction: Meteor emission spectra provide an insight into the chemical nature of meteoroids ablating in the atmosphere, but also useful information about the mechanisms that control this ablation process [1, 2, 3, 4]. For this reason, an array of spectrographs has been deployed at several meteor observing stations operated by the University of Huelva, in Spain. These stations work in the framework of the SPanish Meteor Network (SPMN). The first of these devices, which were based on low-lux CCD video cameras endowed with holographic diffraction gratings, started operation in 2006 at the station in Sevilla and also at the Cerro Negro mobile station [5]. Later on, slow-scan CCD spectrographs were also employed at both locations. Nowadays, these spectral cameras operate in a fully autonomous way at 8 meteor stations in the framework of the SMART project, which is the acronym for Spectroscopy of Meteoroids in the Atmosphere by means of Robotic Technologies. Favorable weather conditions in Spain play a key role in the successful development of this systematic spectroscopic campaign. The spectra of meteor events associated to poorly-known and recently discovered meteoroid streams are of special interest, since these can provide new clues to improve our knowledge about these swarms. In this context, we present here the first emission spectrum ever recorded for a 78 Ursae Majorid fireball. Instrumentation: The spectrographs work in a fully autonomous way thanks to the MetControl software, which was developed by the second author in the framework of the SMART project [6]. Some or these systems are based on low-lux monochrome CCD video cameras (models Watec 902H and 902H Ultimate). These employ aspherical fast lenses (f1.0) covering fixed fields of view ranging from 90 to 8º. To disperse light emitted by bright meteors, a holographic transmission diffraction grating is attached to the objective lens. Emission spectra produced by events brighter than mag. -4/-5 can be obtained by these video spectrographs. On the other hand, five slow-scan CCD cameras manufactured by ATIK and SBIG are also employed as imaging devices. These cover a field of view of ~50º and are placed on automated alt-az mounts. In this way, they can be pointed to an arbitrary region of the sky. They can image emission spectra for fireballs brighter than mag. -6/-7. Spectrum of a 78 Ursae Majorid fireball: On Jan. 5, 2015, at 6h19m27.2s UTC, a mag. -5±1 fireball was simultaneously imaged from two meteor observing stations located in Andalusia (Sevilla and Huelva). The triangulation of its atmospheric path revealed that the fireball started at a height of 107.1 km above the sea level, with the terminal point located at 78.5 km. The inclination of this trajectory with respect to the zenith was of around 19º. According to the calculated radiant and orbital data, this event belongs to the recently discovered 78 Ursae Majorid meteoroid stream (IAU code #596 MUS), which according to the information provided by the IAU Meteor Data Center produces a meteor display peaking on Jan. 6. The emission spectrum produced by this event was obtained by two videospectrographs operating at the abovementioned locations. This is, to our knowledge, the first emission spectrum recorded for a member of this stream. The calibrated spectrum (once corrected for the instrumental efficiency) is shown in Figure 1, where the main lines have been highlighted.  0 50 100 150 200 250 300 400 500 600 700 800 Wavelength (nm) Rel at iv e In te ns ity () .

As usual in meteor spectra, most lines identified in this signal correspond to neutral Fe. Thus, as Figure 1 shows, several multiplets of this element have been identified. The emission from calcium is also observed, although the H and K lines of Ca II are blended with the contribution of Fe I-4. The line from multiplet Ca I-2 (422.7 nm) can be also seen. The emission lines of the Na I-1 doublet (588.9 nm) and the Mg I-2 triplet (516.7 nm) are not so prominent in this case, but the O I triplet at 777.4 nm is very relevant in this spectrum. The detailed conditions in the meteor plasma are currently under analysis. This will  provide an insight into the chemical nature of MUS meteoroids.  Conclusions: The SMART project is providing emission spectra of meteors brighter than mag -3/-4 by means of automated video and slow-scan CCD spectrographs deployed in 8 meteor stations along Spain. The first of these systems started operation in 2006, and the main effort focuses on the analysis of spectra of meteor events associated with poorly-known or even recently discovered meteoroid streams. In this context, we have presented here the first emission spectrum produced by a meteor belonging to the MUS meteor shower. The analysis of this signal will provide valuable information about the chemical nature of meteoroids belonging to this stream. Acknowledgements: The SMART project was funded by J.M. Madiedo.
