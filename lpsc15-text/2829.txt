More precisely, Schrödinger is nestled betweenthe outer edge of SPA's transient crater and the finalbasin rim [1, 2]. Schrödinger is one of the youngest lunar basins, only marginally older than Orientale [3, 4].It has been targeted as an ideal location for a futurelanding site [5] since it is thought to have tapped deepcrustal lithologies associated with the SPA basin-forming event [6], contain ejected lithologies from the Orientale basin-forming event, and has later mare and pyroclastic eruptions on its floor.    Basin-related pyroclastic volcanism may representthe last phase of volcanic activity in some regions onthe Moon. Remote sensing studies have shown that volcanic glasses are fairly common and often found alongthe perimeter of mare-filled basins [7]. Modeling of thestresses related to the basin-forming process [8,9] showthat basin margins provide the ideal conduit for lowvolume lunar pyroclastic volcanism (as compared to thehigh output of mare volcanism).    Schrödinger Basin provides an interesting location tostudy the phenomenon. 1) Its proximity to SPA mayhave encouraged late-stage volcanism by providingcloser access to the deep crust and/or mantle. 2) Thebasin is not filled with mare basalt; instead the floor islargely composed of a compositionally uniform impactbreccia [6]. The exceptions are two distinct and spatially isolated volcanic units, both confined within thecentral peak ring (Fig. 1a). One is a thin mare deposit tothe north, and to the south is an 8.6 km-long pyroclasticvent. 3) The basin floor has a complex set of fracturesthat postdate formation of the basin; some of which areassociated with the later onset of volcanism[6,10,11,12,13,14].    We have been studying Schrödinger through a coordinated effort utilizing our different expertise in spectroscopy, petrology, photogeology, geophysics, structural geology, and impact cratering mechanics usingdata sets including Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter's(LRO) Wide Angle Camera (WAC) and Narrow AngleCamera (NAC) images, topography from LRO's Orbiting Laser Altimeter (LOLA), and spectral data from theChandrayaan-1's Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) tofully characterize the geology and history ofSchrödinger Basin [6,10,11].Schrödinger's Fractures    Most of Schrödinger's fractures are associated withthe formation of the basin [6,11]. The exception is asystem of fractures on the basin floor inside the peakring that suggests a relationship to Schrödinger's latervolcanic activity [10,11,13]. We are working to understand whether this system of fractures is associated withthe formation of the basin, if the volcanic event simplyutilized an already existing conduit, or whether an expanding magma chamber once resided in this location,uplifted the basin floor, and formed these inter-peakring fractures [14]. Whether or not the fractures existedthere prior to volcanic activity, it is apparent that themagma reservoir emptied via a propagating dike andsill complex, and eventually surfaced at the location ofthe pyroclastic vent. Did the dramatically altered stressstates that resulted from the formation of the basin provide pathways ideally suited for magma ascent?Schrödinger's Volcanic Units    Schrödinger has two volcanic units, both of whichoccur inside of its peak ring [6,15] (Fig. 2). The marebasalt unit is located interior to the NNE portion of theinner peak ring. It is identified morphologically by itssmooth, dark surface, and distinct flow morphology. Itis also distinguished from the surrounding impact breccia floor material by its lower crater population densityand characteristic mare basalt spectrum. The unit cannotbe thicker than 50 m because craters as small as 450 mdiameter have spectra that resemble the adjacent impactFFig. 1: (a) M3 750 nm albedo image of Schrödinger's peakring and interior.

breccia floor material, indicating they have penetratedthe mare. The source vent is the eastern end of a grabenlocated in the northern portion of the inner peak ringfloor material (Fig. 2).    Schrödinger’s pyroclastic volcanism occurred to theSSE inside the peak ring. An apron of volcanic glasscovers an area of ~1150 km2 around the vent (Fig. 1a).The pyroclastic material exhibits a characteristicallyglassy spectrum - low albedo, broad and weak maficabsorption features, and a steep, linear continuum slope(Fig. 2b). The structure extending NE from the vent isthe only linear depression that has spectral evidence ofthe volcanic material. Whether this structure is an exposed dike, a fracture later filled with volcanic material,or carved by flowing volcanic material is still under investigation. Like the mare unit, the pyroclastic unit hasa lowest crater density than the impact breccia on thebasin floor, indicating a significant period of time before the onset of volcanic activity in Schrödinger. Thesequence of volcanic events with respect to each otherhas not yet been quantitatively determined.Where's the Water?The chemistry of sampled lunar volcanic glasses indicates that they experienced very little fractional crystallization during their ascent to the surface - they havepristine melt compositions [e.g., 16]. Volatile abundances, including OH, measured in some lunar volcanicglasses [17,18] has been the basis for modeling a waterabundance of ~700 ppm in mantle, or at least the mantlesource of the analyzed glasses. Incompatible trace elements abundances measured in the same glassesshowed a positive correlation with OH and othervolatiles [19], which is expected since water is also incompatible in a magma. Volatile enrichment wouldlower the melting temperature in the deep mantlesource, and volatile exsolution in the lithosphere couldprovide a driving force for ascent of dense basalticmagmas through less dense anorthositic crust in dikes[8].    We used M3 spectral data to create a map of the depthof the absorption at 2820 nm (Fig. 1b), which is attributed to the presence of OH within the top μm of the surface. Virtually all of Schrödinger’s materials exhibit unambiguous spectral absorption features due to the presence of OH, testifying to the prevalence of volatiles inthis polar region. The mare and pyroclastic units standout as dark in Figure 2c, compared to the rest of thebasin, because they have a much weaker OH absorption. Moreover, the crater and ejecta of a fresh impactinto the pyroclastic deposit are even darker in the 2820nm band depth image (Fig. 1d), indicating that the freshpyroclastic material has an even lower OH abundance.Although we did not expect to observe the enrichmentin OH from orbital data, such as measured in the lunarglasses by [17] and [18], the observation of a relativedepletion in freshly exposed volcanic glass was unexpected, and is difficult to reconcile with the laboratorymeasurements. In the very least raises questions aboutthe rate and efficiency of volatile loss and retention indifferent materials on the lunar surface.References[1] Garrick-Bethell & Zuber (2009) Science, 323; [2] Uemotoet al.
