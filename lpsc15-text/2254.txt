Introduction:  The near isotopic identity between the Earth and Moon accompanied by some chemical differences, especially in volatile elements, implies high-temperature, near-equilibrium processing in a common reservoir which is thought to be a vapor-melt proto-lunar disk formed by the Moon-forming Giant Impact.  Recently we reported [1] results of physicochemical modeling of evaporation/condensation processes in a proto-lunar disk of different compositions, including the bulk silicate Earth (BSE), for the 0.01 - 1 bar pressure range. Here we extend our modeling to a wider pressure range (10-6 - 200 bar) and discuss implications of our results for the models of lunar origin.  Model: We assume that a vapor cloud of BSE composition [2] formed after a giant impact experiences equilibrium condensation upon slow cooling. In addition to the full equilibrium we explicitly model effects of partial condensate isolation in a manner described in [3]. The model also tracks isotopic compositions of O, Mg, Si, K, Ca, and Fe in the condensed and gaseous phases. The results are compared with two different estimates of the bulk Moon composition - Fe-rich and Fe-poor - derived based on [4-7] and [3,8,9], respectively. Computational technique: Like [1], we used  the 20 element (H, He, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) version of the GRAINS code [10] with the thermodynamic database expanded to 5000 K. Compared to [1], a non-ideal model of the Fe-Ni-Co-Cr-P-Si metal liquid has been added and the Na2O and K2O end-members of the silicate melt were replaced with Na2SiO3 and K2SiO3, respectively, as the high-temperature thermodynamic data for latter are more reliable than for the oxides. Also added were several subroutines for calculating condensation along different prescribed P-T profiles (isobaric, adiabatic, isochoric, or an ad hoc polynomial). The results reported here were calculated using the ideal silicate melt model.  Results: The calculated equilibrium phase diagram of the proto-lunar disk of BSE composition is shown in Fig. 1 along with the 50% condensation temperatures of K and Na, isopleths of vapor content, and the saturated gas pressure equilibrated with the BSE melt [11]. Given the lack of highly volatile elements in [11] and the assumption of BSE composition of the melt (as opposed to the BSE composition of the bulk system), there is a good agreement between our results and [11]. One important exception is the higher amounts of the H2, H2O, CO dominated gaseous phase (> 0.1 wt %) at lower pressures in our calculations resulting from the presence of H, C, N, P and S in our system. Because the H, C, S, and a large portion of P remain in the gaseous phase down to fairly low temperatures, after the condensation of most oxygen into silicate melt the residual gas becomes reducing enough to precipitate small amounts (~1-2 wt% of condensate) of liquid Fe,Ni metal (from the silicate melt). There are three different isobaric condensation (and reevaporation) sequences.  1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 5000 Temperature, K 10-6 10-5 10-4 10-3 10-2 10-1 100 101 102 Pre ss ur e, b ar sBSE Vapor Melt + VaporMelt+Vapor +Crystals Cry st al s+ Vap or s 10 %s3 0% s7 5% Fig. 1. Phase diagram of the proto-lunar disk of BSE composition with superimposed 50% condensation temperatures of Na (blue) and K (red). The kinks in the Na and K condensation curves at the solidus temperature are due to the internal inconsistencies between the ideal melt and non-ideal plagioclase solution models.  Heavy dotted lines (labeled v#%) show vapor contents in wt%. Thin lines (labeled s#%) are isopleths of crystal contents in wt%. The solid purple line shows the total pressure of gaseous species equilibrated with the BSE melt composition [11]. At pressures higher than ~2Ã—10-3 bar, cooling vapor of BSE composition would condense as a silicate melt of nearly BSE composition (except for the volatiles), with the condensation rate slowing down with falling pressure as indicated by the 10 wt% and 1wt% vapor isopleths. Cooling below ~2540 K results in the crystallization of periclase followed by Ca-olivine (s10% isopleth) with the combined crystal content rising to ~ 30 wt%; both phases react with the melt at ~2100 K to form forsterite (s75% isopleth). Finally, the melt solidifies at 1850 K as a mixture of olivine,  plagioclase, ortho- and clinopyroxene containing ~1 wt% of partially molten Fe,Ni metal.  At pressures below ~10-5 bar, the BSE vapor initially condenses as a mixture of Al,Ca-rich minerals that reacts with the residual vapor to be converted first to an olivine-spinel assemblage and subsequently to an olivine-melt mixture that solidifies again as a mixture of olivine, plagioclase, ortho- and clinopyroxene, and partially molten Fe,Ni metal.   In the intermediate pressure range, the initially condensed Ca,Al,Ti-rich and SiO2-poor melt rapidly solidifies into a mixture of corundum, Ca-olivine and spinel that upon further reaction with the ambient vapor transforms into an olivine-melt mixture that solidifies at 1850 K as described above. The pressure also affects the condensation sequence of Na and K, making the latter less volatile than Na at pressures higher than ~10 bar. Implications for the Moon's origin:  With the condensation tracks being pressure-dependent, the modeling at higher pressures predicted by the hydrodynamic models of the proto-lunar disk [e.g., 12] not only changes the relative depletions of Na and K, but also requires different modes of the Moon's origin (Fig. 2).    Fig. 2. BSE- and Si-normalized model compositions of the Moon calculated at different P-T conditions (see legend). Compositions labeled as 'Bulk' are condensates equilibrated with the vapor at given T and P. The label 'Inert' refers to the cumulate amount of condensate that has become progressively isolated as a system cooled down to the specified temperature. The W12 profile describes the P-T cooling path adopted from [12]; the reported composition of condensate (blue line) is in equilibrium with the residual vapor at T=3500 K and P=7.5 bar.  At low pressures the Moon has to progressively accrete inert condensate that is only partially equilibrated with the ambient gas upon its condensation [1], while at high pressures the Moon could form either as an evaporation residue of the BSE melt or as equilibrium condensate of the BSE vapor.  These scenarios do not take into account a specific effect associated with condensation of gaseous phase consisting mainly of the silicate vapor - a drastic decrease in the amount of gas phase (by >90 %) and associated pressure drop after condensation of silicate melt. So far, no physical model of the proto-lunar disk takes this effect into account. Our crude modeling of this effect assuming isochoric conditions shows shallower slopes of condensation curves and a wider temperature gap (several hundred degrees) between condensation of major and volatile elements; i.e. fractionation of volatiles would take place at lower temperature when the silicate melt is almost completely condensed.
