Introduction: Since impact melt clasts have not previously been reported in carbonaceous chondrites [1], the effects of impacts on CV and CM chondrites have not been studied. CV and CM chondrites do not have mineral assemblages that are in magmatic equilibrium [e.g., 2], and thus carbonaceous chondrite impact melts should have a distinct mineral assemblage compared to their parent material. Understanding how impact melting of carbonaceous chondrites changes mineral assemblages and mineral chemistries may be useful for recognizing impacts on carbonaceous chondrite-like asteroids. Carbonaceous chondrites are generally expected to respond to impact shocks similarly to ordinary chondrites (OCs) [1]. However, CV and CM chondrites have higher intrinsic oxygen fugacities compared to OCs [3,4], and can contain mineralogically bound water and carbon species, whereas most ordinary chondrites do not [5,6]. Volatilization of hydrogen and carbon (as H2O or CO-CO2) following impact melting has the potential to reduce the melt products relative to their precursor. Elements commonly present in both ordinary and carbonaceous chondrites such as sulfur volatilize during impact melting [7]. Keeping their differences in mind, numerous OC impact melt clasts/rocks have been identified [e.g., 8] and thus provide a reference for impact melting of chondrites. Ordinary chondrite impact melt clasts typically have bulk compositions close to the meteorite/material from which they melted [9,10]. Processes that occurred after bulk melting can usually explain deviations in precursor bulk composition from impact melt composition. For example, loss of volatiles or separation of immiscible Fe-Ni-S liquids from silicate liquid will change the bulk composition in ways that can be anticipated [8,11]. The composition of immiscible Fe-Ni-S liquids may differ between carbonaceous chondrite and OC impact melts because of the higher intrinsic oxygen fugacity of carbonaceous chondrites.  Materials and Methods: We examined thin sections with transmitted and reflected light using a petrographic microscope. In the Allende-type oxidized CV3 chondrite LAR 06317, we identified five impact melt clasts in two thin sections: ,2 and ,11. We will discuss three impact melt clasts from LAR 06317 in this study: Clast A, Clast B, and Clast C [12]. In the reduced CV3 chondrite RBT 04143, we identified one impact melt clast: Clast Z in section RBT 04143,2 [oral presentation of 12]. We also identified an impact melt clast with CM chondrite-affinity in the howardite thin section GRO 95574,17 which we refer to as Clast mIM [oral presentation of 13]. Electron microprobe (EMP) analyses were performed with a Cameca SX-100 EMP at the Univ. of Tennessee. Mineral analyses were conducted at 15 kV, 30 nA with a 1 micron diameter beam. Glass analyses were conducted at 15 kV 10 nA with a 10 micron diameter beam. We used the glass set-up to collect point analyses (120-215 per clast) in grids to estimate bulk composition.  High-resolution energy dispersive x-ray (EDS) elemental maps and bulk compositional data were obtained using the FEI Nova NanoSEM 600 at the Smithsonian Institution. We collected EDS maps using a beam current of 15 kV and 2-3 nA. We used Noran System Six (NSS) software to extract bulk compositional data from select subareas of our EDS maps. Results and Discussion: In this study, we constrain the bulk chemistry to further investigate the provenance of these carbonaceous chondrite impact melt clasts. We also examine redox implications of the impact melt clasts’ respective Fe-Ni-S globules. Petrographic description: All of the carbonaceous chondrite impact melt clasts investigated are translucent in plane polarized light. These impact melt clasts all contain microphenocrysts of Mg-Fe zoned equant olivine (Fo44-95), which occasionally have very Mg-rich (>Fo90) optically discontinuous relict cores. Olivine microphenocrysts are in groundmasses composed primarily of undevitrified glass in clasts A, C, Z, and mIM. The groundmass of Clast B is composed primarily of plagioclase and high-Ca pyroxene. Impact melt clasts found within the CV chondrites contain vesicles (Clasts B, C, and Z). These vesicles are characterized by rounded edges lined with glass, and in some instances the meniscus of a vesicle can be observed. Clast mIM does not contain vesicles. Provenance and bulk composition of impact melt clasts: CV and CM chondrites bulk compositions have the highest Al/Si and Ca/Si ratios among the major chondrite groups, and the lowest Na/Ca ratios. [5,6]. The impact melt clasts in this study have Al/Si and Ca/Si ratios consistent with or higher than the ranges for CV and CM chondrites. These impact melt clasts have Na/Ca ratios consistent with or lower than the ranges for  CV and CM chondrites (Tables 1 and 2). 2076.pdf

Clasts A, B, and C  have fragmental textures and did not melt in situ but their bulk composition corresponds to their host meteorite; thus their precursors are most likely an oxidized CV chondrite. Clast Z’s bulk composition, along with textural evidence that it melted in situ, is consistent with it forming from its host meteorite, a reduced CV chondrite. Clast mIM’s bulk composition has Al/Si and Na/Ca ratios consistent with CV or CM chondrites, and its Ca/Si ratio exceeds the range of both. SIMS oxygen three-isotope analyses of olivine grains (not relict) that grew out of this impact melt (e.g., δ18O=6.29±0.49 ‰, δ17O=0.20±0.41 ‰, Δ17O=-3.07±0.41 ‰) have values consistent with bulk CM chondrites . Clast mIM is located in a howardite: CM chondrites are a common exogenic component in howardites [14]. Redox chemistry and Fe-Ni-S globules: All of the clasts with a glassy groundmass have Fe-Ni-S globules (Clasts A, C, Z, and mIM). Fe-Ni-S globules composed of troilite and Fe,Ni metal are common in OC impact melts [e.g., 15]. OCs have lower intrinsic oxygen fugacity than the likely precursors for the carbonaceous chondrite impact melts in this study. Of the impact melt clasts in this study, Clast Z formed from the most reduced precursor, and its FeNi-S globules are most similar to those of OCs. Clast Z contains 100s of µm-scale Fe-Ni-S globules. The FeNi-S globules are composed of troilite, Fe,Ni metal, and Fe-oxides (likely terrestrial weathering products).  The rest of the clasts melted from more oxidized precursors (oxidized CV and CM chondrites). Some of the Fe-Ni-S globules in these clasts (A, C, and mIM) contain a Ni-bearing sulfide in addition to troilite and Fe,Ni metal. This additional sulfide phase is discernable in reflected light microscopy. The Fe-Ni-S globules in these clasts (A, C, and mIM) are µm-scale to 10s of µm-scale in size. High resolution EDS mapping confirms that the additional sulfide is Ni-bearing. In the Fe-Ni-S globule in Clast mIM (Figure 1), this additional sulfide has chemistry stoichiometrically consistent with pentlandite: 34.7 wt. % S, 39.6 wt. % Fe, 25.7 wt. % Ni. More Ni-rich sulfides are generally indicative of higher redox chemistry [e.g., 16]. Thus, these impact melts at least partially retain their precursors’ intrinsic oxygen fugacities, and did not suffer extensive impact-related reduction. Conclusion: The bulk compositions of impact melt clasts in this study are generally consistent with CV and CM chondrite precursors. The mineralogy within Fe-Ni-S globules in these carbonaceous chondrite impact melts appears to be influenced by the intrinsic oxygen fugacity of their parental material, although vesicles in clasts B, C, and Z indicate they have experienced some degassing. The impact melt clast from the most reduced precursor has Fe-Ni-S globule mineralogy similar to that of the even more reduced ordinary chondrites, while the Fe-Ni-S globules that formed from more oxidized precursors have different mineral assemblages, which include Ni-bearing sulfides.
