HOW WELL DOES THE BUS-DEMEO TAXONOMY CLASSIFY METEORITE SPECTRA?  T. H. Burbine1, 1Department of Astronomy, Mount Holyoke College, South Hadley, MA 01075, USA (tburbine@mtholyoke.edu).   Introduction:  The Bus-DeMeo asteroid taxonomy [1] currently classes asteroid reflectance spectra in the visible and near-infrared wavelength regions into 25 taxonomic classes.  The ultimate goal of any taxonomy is to group asteroids with similar mineralogies into the same taxonomic class.  This study tests how well the Bus-DeMeo taxonomy classifies meteorite spectra into different asteroid taxonomic classes. Data:  Keck/NASA Reflectance Experiment Laboratory (RELAB) meteorite spectra were classified (Table 1) using the Bus-DeMeo Taxonomy Classification Web tool on the Small Main-Belt Asteroid Spectroscopic Survey (SMASS) website.  Visual inspections were used to classify spectra that could not be unambiguously classified using the Web tool.   Expected Results:  The ~50 inputted ordinary chondrite spectra tend to be classified either as Scomplex bodies or as Q-types.  The ordinary chondrite spectra are from Dunn et al. [2] and have had their metallic iron separated out.  The spectra of the L chondrites are matched by Sr-, Q-, Sq-, and S-types and LL chondrites are matched by Q- or Sq-types The spectrum of ungrouped C2 chondrite Tagish Lake is classified as a D-type.  The spectrum of CO3 chondrite ALHA77307 is best classified as an Xk-type.  The spectrum of CV3 chondrite Allende is classified as a K-type. The spectra of aubrites are best classified as Xctypes.  HED spectra are classified as V-types.  The spectra of angrites are classified as A-types due to their strong 1 µm bands and weak to absent 2  µm bands.  Ureilite Almahata Sitta is best classified as a C-type while ureilite Y-74659 is best classified as a K-type.   Unexpected Results:  A wide range of taxonomic classes (Sq, S, Q, Sr, O, Sv) is found among the H chondrites.  Spectra of one H5 and two H6 chondrites fall intermediate between the Q- and O-types.  Visually, the H5 spectrum best matches a Q-type while the H6 chondrite spectra best match O-types.   The spectrum of R chondrite Rumuruti had an indeterminate classification.  The spectrum of CK6 chondrite LEW 87009 also had an indeterminate classification while the spectrum of CK4 chondrite ALH 85002 is best classified as a K-type.  The spectrum of CR2 chondrite Renazzo is best classified as an Xktype.  The spectra of CM2 chondrites are best classified as K- or X-types even though they have absorption bands at 0.7 µm and would be expected to be classified as Ch- or Cgh-types. The spectra of CI1 chondrites Ivuna and Orgueil are best classified as L-types. The spectrum of brachinite EET 99402 does not fit well into any of the Bus-DeMeo taxonomic classes.  Even though the brachinite spectrum is olivinedominated (like A- and Sa-type spectra), its spectrum is not as red as A- or Sa-types.   Conclusions:  Many of the taxonomic classifications of the meteorite spectra are as expected (e.g., L, LL, HEDs).  However, a number of the meteorites have classifications that are not expected or cannot be classified.  Care must be used when assuming that a taxonomic class implies a specific meteoritic mineralogy for an asteroid. References: [1] DeMeo F. E. et al. (2009) Icarus, 202, 160-180. [2] Dunn T. L. et al.
