Introduction:  TIR is an infrared thermal imager onboard the Hayabusa2 spacecraft, which will perform thermal imaging of C-class asteroid 162173 Ryugu (1999 JU3) through in situ observations during the rendezvous phase from 2018 to 2019. Hayabusa2 carried out an Earth swing-by on December 3, 2015, and TIR observed the Earth and the Moon for calibration and performance tests.      The detector of TIR is an uncooled microbolometer array (320A, NEC Inc.), and the optical system has a germanium triplet lens. TIR is the same design as a long wave infrared camera, LIR, onboard the Akatsuki Venus climate orbiter [1]. The observation wavelength is an integrated wavelength range of 8 to 12 micrometers. The field of view is 16 x 12 degrees, and the number of effective pixels is 328 x 248. The spatial resolution is 0.05 degree/pixel [2]. Performances of the TIR were evaluated in the pre-launch test, and then, the temperature conversion table from the observation integrated energy to a brightness temperature was constructed for every pixel. Also, the focal length, the distortion of the observed image, and the ratio of pixel aperture were calibrated.      The performance check in the earth swing-by observation was performed to compare with the prelaunch test results, such as the historical changes (using the temperature conversion table), the observed image distortion, the aperture ratio, and the detector alignment. In this study, results of in-flight calibration for the current performance are introduced by Earth and Moon observations before and after the Earth swing-by.      Pre-launch Geometrical Tests:  During the prelaunch tests, a collimator, METS-VS-8-2.9, was used for checking the image distortion and the aperture ratio of a pixel. A 15 mm side square and a 100 micrometers diameter pinhole were used as a collimator mask. A blackbody source was behind the masks and heated up to the temperature of 125 degrees Celsius.       An observed image of the square mask was 19 pixels with TIR. Thus, the collimated image was equivalent to 0.79 mm/pixel in this collimator system. TIR measured the square mask at the FOV corners, and that data was used for the checking of the image distortion (Figure 1). The result of the distortion was within 1 pixel from the image's center to every corner.      Pinhole images with TIR was apparently the size of 1/8 pixel in this collimator system, but an actual bolometer pixel size was 37 micrometers. TIR was moved to the radial direction in the step of 0.01 degrees by using a micro-rotary stage and measured the aperture ratio. Insensible areas were found in the corners of pixels.    Figure 1:  A collimator square masked image (25 points positioned composite gray image) taken with TIR in the pre-launch test. This image was used for a distortion check of the observed image. As a result of distortion, it was within 1 pixel from the image center to every corner.        Earth and Moon Observations:  Before and after the Earth swing-by of the Hayabusa2 spacecraft, TIR observed the Earth and the Moon on October 14 and October 16, November 10 to 14, November 26, and December 4 to 21, 2015. Figure 2 shows examples of the observed images with TIR. The brightness temperatures of the Earth and the Moon taken with TIR were nearly equal to the brightness temperatures from an observed result by Himawari, the Japanese Geostationary Meteorological Satellite. Figure 3 shows the Earth and Moon composite image in the J2000 inertial coordinate system calculated by the SPICE kernel. The data was used for alignment and image distortion corrections, such as rotations forward and an inclination of the bore sight forward. It is critical for adjusting for the Hayabusa2 and the TIR coordinate systems. 1801.pdf

   Figure 2:  Images of the Earth (top, UTC 2015-1204T04:06) and the Moon (bottom, 2015-12-05T11:46) taken with TIR. The color bars indicate the values after analog-to-digital conversion of observed radiant energy. The lower radiation area in the middle of Earth is Antarctica and clouds, and the left limb bright area is Australia. The Moon was seen as an ecliptic area on the South Pole and Mare Orientale. The Sun is illuminated from the left-hand side in this figure.  Figure 3: Composite image of the Earth and Moon taken with TIR after the Earth swing-by in the J2000 system (from Dec. 7, 2015 to Dec. 21, 2015). This image is a gray image with reduced background (out of TIR FOV on Earth).      Results and Discussions:  Australia was shown at the limb of the Earth in the TIR image (Figure 2 top), but Himawari data were observed to the sub-satellite point at the same time. These difference of observer points caused the slight difference of the both brightness temperatures. Atmosphere and cloud decrease the brightness temperature depending on a phase angle of the observer and the sun.       The alignment confirmed that there are three pixels, and two pixels differences in X and Y coordinates, respectively, in the TIR image compared with the Hayabusa2 coordinate system (Figure 4). More detailed alignment correction is required because the aperture ratio of pixels decreases the observed brightness temperature, and it causes a difference of observed center of the Earth. Thus, alignment and aperture ratio correction is necessary to correct within subpixels. The Akatsuki cameras have estimated the aperture ratio to consider the limb darkening of Venus [3] and, thus, TIR is also required to estimate the limb darkening of the Earth image and calibrate detail alignment and image distortion for sub-pixels.      A detailed shape model of the asteroid is necessary for the asteroid observation because the aperture ratio of pixels decreases apparent brightness temperatures of a minute target on the surface such as boulders. Repetition of observations will also improve the quality of data. Figure 4:  The observed coordinates of the Earth in J2000 inertial system before the swing-by observation of TIR. TIR pointed to the Earth from approximately 0.2 degrees and 0.1 degrees with a difference in X and Y coordinates of the Hayabusa2 coordinate system. This data was used for the correction of TIR detector alignment.       References:  [1] Fukuhara T. et al., (2011), EPS, 63,   1009–1018. [2] Okada T. et al. (2015), 46th LPSC, No. 1832, p.1331.
