 CAREER AND WORKFORCE IMPACTS OF THE NASA PLANETARY SCIENCE SUMMER SCHOOL: TEAM X MODEL 1999-2015.  C. J. Budney1, L. L. Lowes1, K. L. Mitchell1, A. M. Sohus1, and A. S. Wessen1, 1NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena, California 91109).  Introduction:	   	   Sponsored by NASA's Planetary Science Division, and managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the Planetary Science Summer School prepares the next generation of engineers and scientists to participate in future solar system exploration missions.  	  Project Evolution:  This program was first organized by JPL in 1989 as a week-long series of lectures at the California Institute of Technology with a oneday tour of JPL.  This experience was conducted for 10 years, annually attended by 60-80 Post-Docs and PhDcandidates in planetary science who heard from cutting-edge researchers and networked with peers.  In 1999, JPL evolved the experience to utilize JPL's emerging concurrent mission design "Team X" as mentors. With this model, participants learn the mission life cycle, roles of scientists and engineers in a mission environment, mission design interconnectedness and trade-offs, and the importance of teamwork.  Participants: Applicants are sought who have a strong interest and experience in careers in planetary exploration, and who are science and engineering postdocs, recent PhDs, doctoral or graduate students, and faculty teaching such students.  Disciplines include planetary science, geoscience, geophysics, environmental science, aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, and materials science. Participants are selected through a competitive review process, with selections based on the strength of the application and advisor's recommendation letter.  The majority of students come from top US universities with planetary science or aerospace-related engineering programs, over 50 different universities total. Diversity. We conducted a diversity study in fall 2015 to assess the gender and ethnic diversity of participants since 1999.  On average, 40% of participants are women, which tracks with the findings from the the Planetary Science Workforce Survey of departments offering degrees related to planetary science [1].  There has been an approximate 5% uptick in women participants in PSSS in recent years.  The percentages of ethnic minorities participating 1999-2015 tracks with the population of science PhDs earned for astronomy, chemistry, earth science, physics in 2002-2012 (the closest fields and time period available) [2].  Authentic and Participatory Learning Experience:  PSSS is designed to provide an authentic learning experience in order to provide a connection between personal aptitude and professional practice of participants.  An authentic learning experience has real-word relevance, a sustained investigation, multiple sources and perspectives, collaborative work, integrated assessment, polished products, and multiple interpretations and outcomes [3].  Within the context of a real-world challenge - in this case, practical, current multidisciplinary issues involved with planetary exploration mission design -- our effective authentic learning provides participants with the benefit of direct experience with a variety of science and engineering fields, and a chance to "try on" roles.  They also gain or enhance their valuable "portable" career skills of research, practice, and negotiation [4]. The Planetary Science Summer School Experience: Under the mentorship of a lead engineer and a lead scientist (most recently, Dr. Charles Budney and Dr. Karl Mitchell), students select, design, and develop a mission concept from the Planetary Science Decadal Survey, following the guidelines of the NASA New Frontiers Announcement of Opportunity.  Students develop their mission in the JPL Advanced Projects Design Team (Team X) environment, which is a crossfunctional multidisciplinary team of professional engineers and scientists that utilizes concurrent engineering methodologies to complete rapid design, analysis and evaluation of mission concept designs. In advance of an intensive week-long session in the Project Design Center at JPL, students select the mission and science goals during a series of eight weekly WebEx/telecons, and develop a preliminary suite of instrumentation and a science traceability matrix.  Students assume both a science team and a mission development role with JPL Team X mentors.  Once at JPL, students participate in a series of Team X project design sessions, during which their mentors aid them in finalizing their mission design and instrument suite, and in making the necessary trade-offs to stay within the cost cap.  Tours of JPL facilities illustrate the endto-end life cycle of a mission.  At week's end, students present their Concept Study to a "proposal review board" of JPL scientists and engineers and NASA Headquarters executives, who feed back the strengths and weaknesses of their proposal and mission design. Project Impact: PSSS seeks to have a positive influence on participants' career choice and career progress, and to help feed the employment pipeline for NASA, aerospace, and related academia.  Current Employment.  581 individuals have participated in the Team X-based PSSS sessions since 1999.  In fall 2015, we conducted an online search that located 516 of them and their current occupations (primari ly through LinkedIn and university and corporate websites).  Results by industry sector (Figure 1) show the majority (total of 59%) are employed or conducting postdoctoral research at NASA Centers (8 including JPL, plus NASA Headquarters); are employed at Federally-Funded Research and Development Centers, science research organizations and aerospace companies; or they are university faculty or staff.  A number of alumni, most from cohorts from the most recent years, are students or postdocs at universities.  The majority of the remaining alumni are employed in other technical fields.  Figure 1: NASA PSSS Alumni Industry Employment Status, 1999-2015 Cohorts (516 alumni found)              Data show that alumni are conducting NASA work not only at the Centers, but at universities, occupying roles that include space and planetary science mission and instrument Principal Investigators and Co-PIs, mission participating scientists, Astrobiology Institute and Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute team members, and NASA Research Grant PIs.  Clearly, PSSS provides the benefit of feeding the employment pipeline for NASA, aerospace, and related academia.  Other supporting or related sectors benefit as well. Survey to Measure Long-Term Success.  In a 2013 survey, 395 active emails of alumni from 1999-2012 were located, and 212 of those contacted (54%) responded.  Evidence was sought to support indicators of long-term success: .PSSS experience has a positive influence on career choice and on career progress .PSSS feeds the employment pipeline for NASA, aerospace, and related academia .PSSS alumni demonstrate leadership potential, ability, and/or experience in fields related to planetary science exploration Respondents indicated that PSSS directly affected their career choice, highlighted career options available in planetary science exploration field, and/or added breadth and perspective to their current work.  They indicated PSSS gave them knowledge and skills that are still useful in their careers, with about half having roles in one or more spaceflight missions and proposals, including 84 leadership positions.  Alumni have earned several awards including the Urey Prize from DPS, Macelwane Medal from AGU, Napolitano Award from AIF, and the Biggs Award from GSA. Looking back on the PSSS experiences, the skills and knowledge intended to be imparted were, in order of usefulness: . Importance of teamwork in designing spacecraft missions . End-to-end mission process AND Interconnectedness of systems and subsystems, and of science and engineering  . Networking with peers . Concurrent engineering design Technical Contributions to the Field. Results from PSSS mission concepts, including such destinations as Venus, Mars, Ganymede, Trojan Centaurs, Uranus, and Nepture have been presented as papers at major conferences in recent years, including AGU, DPS, LPSC, IEEE Aerospace Conference, and the International Planetary Probe Workshop.  Additionally, PSSS students who developed a Neptune mission concept were later invited to give an invited presentation at the 2014 Outer Planets Assessment Group meeting. Some alumni have developed education experienes using elements of the PSSS experience, for example, the graduate level course at Purdue "Spacecraft Engineering and Conceptual Mission Design I", and undergraduate and high school engineering design projects  though the University of Alabama in Huntsville. Implementation: The Planetary Science Summer School is implemented by the JPL Education Office in partnership with JPL's Team X Project Design Center.
