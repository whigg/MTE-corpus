Over the first 1200 sols at Gale Crater the MSL APXS has measured ~275 spots on 240 distinct  samples along the traverse.  After detailed investigations of the foothills of Mount Sharp at Pahrump, on its way uphill Curiosity encountered a geologic contact with heterogeneous composition that suggests acidic alteration with elevated Si, S and Ti, evidence for higher Fe3+/Fetotal and a significant loss of the soluble elements Ni and Zn. Murray-Stimson Contact: At Marias Pass a contact identified from orbit was investigated and yielded a sharp compositional transition from upper-Pahrump- like to an average-Mars-like composition.  The samples Ronan (Stimson) and Wallace (Murray), both brushed with the DRT, differ significantly in composition albeit just some 10 cm apart on each side of the visible contact. Fig 1. shows the logarithmic  ratio of the standard 16 elements the APXS quantifies to the soil Portage. Ronan deviates much less than 10% from the typical soil or average Mars crustal composition, while Wallace shares a lot of characteristics with SantaAna, one of the targets in the upper Pahrump section.               Figure 1 Chemistry at the contact Wallace shares several of the distinct elemental patterns with Pahrump - elevated Si, lower Mg and Ca. Most prominent is the similarity in elevated P, up to 2.5% P2O5 and a consistently high Fe/Mn ratio, which is known from MER to follow the Fe3+ content. However, Wallace is distinct from Pahrump with lower Mn, Fe, Ni and Zn, possibly continuing an uphill trend that was already observed in the 10 m section at Pahrump.   Traverse beyond Pahrump: The APXS measured about 40 samples since leaving GardenCity, a complex vein system on top of Pahrump [2]. The ~2 cm FOV is uniquely suited to determine an average composition for drill samples analyzed by SAM and CheMin, to follow broader elemental trends along the traverse and to provide ground truth for orbiters. In Fig. 2, the trends of SiO2 content with other elements are shown.                                                  Figure 2 Compensated ratios for the non-SiO2 content. A simple addition of pure SiO2 would give flat trends.

The trace elements Ni and Zn, highly enriched at lower Pahrump with values of more than 1000 ppm, drop sharply with increasing SiO2. Ge is uniformly enriched, like in most bedrocks in Gale. Of the minor elements, K, Ti and especially P exhibit a clear positive trend with SiO2. The highest P2O5 of 2-3% belongs to a group of samples with ~60% SiO2. These samples are similar in most elements (Fig. 3) and have been encountered over kilometers in Hidden Valley, upper Pahrump, Marias Pass and beyond [3], possibly indicating a common, large scale origin.                     Figure 3  Si and P rich samples along the traverse So far, possibly the cleanest endmember of the overall trends can be seen in the Mini-drill at Pilgrim, nearby the full drill at Greenhorn. This area was found to be very heterogeneous, lateral and in depth, even on a sub centimeter scale. The ~10 mm deep Mini-drill represents the best bulk chemistry available for this material. 95% of Pilgrim is made up of SiO2, SO3, CaO, FeO, P2O5, TiO2 and Cl. On the other hand, Na2O, MgO and Al2O3 are very low, all together less than 4%. The quite high 13.5% SO3 can be only balanced by nearly all of the Ca and Fe. So, there is little chemical evidence for significant amounts of igneous minerals in this sample.                 Fig. 4 shows the similarity of Pilgrim and Greenhorn. Both samples belong to the group of medium SiO2 compositions of ~60% with elevated P and show the highest Fe/Mn ratio, i.e. Fe alteration index. Mn is nearly absent in these samples, indicating a complete alteration and removal of original Fe bearing igneous minerals. The dissolved Mn might have been deposited downhill, possibly in vein systems similar to GardenCity, where elevated Ca, Mn and Ge was found [2].                   Summary: Elevated SiO2 and S, indications for altered Fe3+ minerals, significantly changed bulk chemistry, mobilized Ni and Zn as well as elevated TiO2 point towards an episode of large scale acidic leaching. This bulk chemistry interpretation is consistent with the mineralogy findings by CheMin [4,5,6], although also other interpretations of APXS data are discussed, e.g SiO2 precipitation [7]. In all cases, this episode of aqueous alteration is very different geochemically than the environment in Yellowknife Bay that formed Fe/Mg-smectite, where S is low and the chemistry is similar to average Mars crustal compositions [8]. Further insights into the changing environmental conditions on early Mars are expected when Curiosity will continue to ascent Mount Sharp.
