For a  differentiated  planet  like  theEarth,  whose bulk composition cannot be determineddirectly,  these  values  are  approximated  using  chondrites – undifferentiated primitive meteorites that  arethought to represent the building blocks of the terrestrial planets.However,  the  discovery  of  excess  142Nd  in  theEarth's  mantle  relative  to  primitive  meteorites  [1]challenged this “chondritic Earth” paradigm, because,if interpreted as a result of 146Sm decay (146Sm →142Nd;t1/2 = 103 Ma), this offset seems to require evolution ofthe  accessible  Earth  with  a  super-chondritic  Sm/Ndsince at least 4.53 Ga. Mass balance then requires theexistence  of  a  reservoir  with  sub-chondritc  Sm/Nd;this reservoir has never been sampled and either  hasbeen lost to space by impact erosion of early-formedcrust [2] or was sequestered to the deep Earth [1].Both of these scenarios have far-reaching implications for our understanding of the Earth and initiated acomplete  re-assessment  of  how we think  the  Earthevolved through geologic time (e.g., [2, 3]). However,all these prior studies relied on the assumption that the142Nd offset between Earth and chondrites is of chronological  significance,  i.e.,  caused by an  early Sm/Ndfractionation, followed by decay of 146Sm to 142Nd.Here we investigate an alternative explanation forthe  142Nd excess in  the  Earth  relative to chondrites,namely nucleosynthetic isotope heterogeneity betweenchondrites and the Earth. Using high precision Nd andSm isotope measurements of planetary materials,  wewill quantify nucleosynthetic Nd isotope variations between chondrites and the Earth, with the ultimate goalto determine whether any of the difference in 142Nd between the accessible Earth  and chondrites is attributable to radiogenic ingrowth.Materials and Methods:  We analyzed a variety ofordinary  and  enstatite  chondrites,  the  carbonaceouschondrite Allende, the ungrouped primitive achondriteNWA 5363,  as  well  as  a Ca,Al-rich  inclusion  (CAI)from the Allende meteorite. In order to avoid potentialartifacts associated with the incomplete dissolution ofrefractory presolar  components and  to minimize disturbances  through  terrestrial  alteration,  only  equilibrated  chondrites  (petrologic classes  4-6,  except  Allende CV3) from observed falls were selected for thisstudy.  Compared  to  previous  studies,  we  digestedlarger sample sizes (~2 g), which allowed us to obtainhigher precision isotope data, particularly for the nonradiogenic Nd isotopes. All  measurements  were  performed  by  TIMS  atLLNL. Neodymium isotope ratios were measured using  a two mass-step procedure  that  calculates  142Nd/144Nd  and  148Nd/144Nd  dynamically,  while  measuringthe other Nd isotopes statically. Fractionation was corrected relative to 146Nd/144Nd = 0.7219 using the exponential law. The absence of analytical artifacts in ourprocedures is demonstrated by the analyses of terrestrial standards (BHVO-2, BIR-1, JNdi-1), which wereprocessed along with the samples and whose measuredisotope  compositions  are  indistinguishable  from  theunprocessed JNdi-1 Nd and AMES Sm standards.Results:  Most samples show well-behaved 147Sm143Nd systematics and fall on a 4.568 Ga isochron. Themean  147Sm/144Nd and  143Nd/144Nd values  defined  bythe chondrites are in good agreement with the currentbest estimate of the average chondritic values [4]. The142Nd/144Nd data of the meteorites fall mostly below a4.568 Ga isochron constructed through the accessibleEarth and a chondritic 147Sm/144Nd = 0.1960, and onlypoorly  correlate  with  Sm/Nd.  After  correction  to  acommon 147Sm/144Nd = 0.1960, the µ142Nd (ppm deviation relative to the JNdi-1 standard) values range from-9±5 (95% c.i.)  for enstatite  chondrites to -31±1 forthe Allende carbonaceous chondrite. This is consistentwith  prior  observations  [5-7]  and  indicates  that  the142Nd/144Nd of chondrites does not only reflect Sm/Ndfractionation  and  146Sm  decay.  Evidence  for  theprocess responsible for the  142Nd variations  in  chondrites comes from the non-radiogenic Nd isotopes, forwhich our new data show resolved systematic and positively correlated anomalies (Fig. 1). These anomalieswere not resolved in previous studies because the measurements  were of insufficient  precision.  The  anomalies increase in  the  order:  enstatite  chondrites,  carbonaceous  chondrites,  ordinary  chondrites,  NWA5363.Discussion:  The anomalies in non-radiogenic Ndisotopes plot along mixing lines between terrestrial Ndand  s-process  Nd as  obtained  from  s-process  model1908.pdf

calculations,  data from presolar  SiC grains,  or chondrite  leachates.  This  implies  that  the  meteorites  arecharacterized  by variable depletions  in  s-process Ndrelative to the Earth,  an observation that is consistentwith inferences from other isotope systems,  e.g., Mo,Ru and Zr [8-10]. However, while for these other systems  the  nucleosynthetic  anomalies  are  typicallylargest in carbonaceous chondrites, the µ145Nd, µ148Ndand  µ150Nd values of Allende are  similar  to those ofenstatite  and  ordinary chondrites.  These subdued Ndanomalies in Allende can be explained by the presenceof CAIs, which host about half of all the Nd (and Sm)in Allende and are characterized by an s-excess in thenon-radiogenic Nd isotopes [11]. A CAI-free carbonaceous  chondrite  composition  obtained  by mass  balance,  therefore,  exhibit  significantly  larger  µ145Nd,µ148Nd and µ150Nd anomalies.The information obtained from the non-radiogenicNd isotopes allows quantification  of nucleosyntheticcontributions  to  measured  µ142Nd  anomalies  in  thechondrites. The µ142Nd values of the meteorites are inversely correlated with µ145Nd, µ148Nd and µ150Nd. Enstatite and ordinary chondrites, as well as NWA5363,plot on mixing lines between the terrestrial  composition and s-process Nd. Allende deviates from this linesdue to admixture of CAIs. Mass balance indicates thata CAI-free carbonaceous chondrite source compositionalso plots well on the s-process correlation line definedby the other chondrites. Regressions of the bulk meteorite data yield slopes that are indistinguishable fromthose obtained  for  s-process mixing  lines,  and  theirµ142Nd intercept values are indistinguishable from theterrestrial value at the current level of precision.Conclusion:  Our data indicates that compared tochondrites, the Earth accreted from material enrichedin Nd isotopes produced by the s-process of nucleosynthesis.  Once this  nucleosynthetic  effect is  taken  intoaccount, the Earth and chondrites seem to have indistinguishable 142Nd compositions. This suggests that theEarth  has a chondritic Sm/Nd ratio and as such supports the long-standing paradigm of a chondritic composition  of the  Earth.  Thus,  our  results  obviate  theneed  for  collisional  erosion  of early-formed crust  orthe  presence  of  a  hidden  reservoir  within  the  deepEarth.References:  [1] Boyet  M.  and  Carlson  R.W.(2005)  Science 309,  576-581.
