Introduction:  Precise and accurate knowledge of a planet's  bulk chemical  and  isotopic composition is essential  for  unraveling  its  geologic history by geochemical  means.  For a  differentiated  planet  like  the Earth,  whose bulk composition cannot be determined directly,  these  values  are  approximated  using  chondrites - undifferentiated primitive meteorites that  are thought to represent the building blocks of the terrestrial planets. However,  the  discovery  of  excess  142Nd  in  the Earth's  mantle  relative  to  primitive  meteorites  [1] challenged this "chondritic Earth" paradigm, because, if interpreted as a result of 146Sm decay (146Sm →142Nd; t1/2 = 103 Ma), this offset seems to require evolution of the  accessible  Earth  with  a  super-chondritic  Sm/Nd since at least 4.53 Ga. Mass balance then requires the existence  of  a  reservoir  with  sub-chondritc  Sm/Nd; this reservoir has never been sampled and either  has been lost to space by impact erosion of early-formed crust [2] or was sequestered to the deep Earth [1]. Both of these scenarios have far-reaching implications for our understanding of the Earth and initiated a complete  re-assessment  of  how we think  the  Earth evolved through geologic time (e.g., [2, 3]). However, all these prior studies relied on the assumption that the 142Nd offset between Earth and chondrites is of chronological  significance,  i.e.,  caused by an  early Sm/Nd fractionation, followed by decay of 146Sm to 142Nd. Here we investigate an alternative explanation for the  142Nd excess in  the  Earth  relative to chondrites, namely nucleosynthetic isotope heterogeneity between chondrites and the Earth. Using high precision Nd and Sm isotope measurements of planetary materials,  we will quantify nucleosynthetic Nd isotope variations between chondrites and the Earth, with the ultimate goal to determine whether any of the difference in 142Nd between the accessible Earth  and chondrites is attributable to radiogenic ingrowth. Materials and Methods:  We analyzed a variety of ordinary  and  enstatite  chondrites,  the  carbonaceous chondrite Allende, the ungrouped primitive achondrite NWA 5363,  as  well  as  a Ca,Al-rich  inclusion  (CAI) from the Allende meteorite. In order to avoid potential artifacts associated with the incomplete dissolution of refractory presolar  components and  to minimize disturbances  through  terrestrial  alteration,  only  equilibrated  chondrites  (petrologic classes  4-6,  except  Allende CV3) from observed falls were selected for this study.  Compared  to  previous  studies,  we  digested larger sample sizes (~2 g), which allowed us to obtain higher precision isotope data, particularly for the nonradiogenic Nd isotopes. All  measurements  were  performed  by  TIMS  at LLNL. Neodymium isotope ratios were measured using  a two mass-step procedure  that  calculates  142Nd/ 144Nd  and  148Nd/144Nd  dynamically,  while  measuring the other Nd isotopes statically. Fractionation was corrected relative to 146Nd/144Nd = 0.7219 using the exponential law. The absence of analytical artifacts in our procedures is demonstrated by the analyses of terrestrial standards (BHVO-2, BIR-1, JNdi-1), which were processed along with the samples and whose measured isotope  compositions  are  indistinguishable  from  the unprocessed JNdi-1 Nd and AMES Sm standards. Results:  Most samples show well-behaved 147Sm143Nd systematics and fall on a 4.568 Ga isochron. The mean  147Sm/144Nd and  143Nd/144Nd values  defined  by the chondrites are in good agreement with the current best estimate of the average chondritic values [4]. The 142Nd/144Nd data of the meteorites fall mostly below a 4.568 Ga isochron constructed through the accessible Earth and a chondritic 147Sm/144Nd = 0.1960, and only poorly  correlate  with  Sm/Nd.  After  correction  to  a common 147Sm/144Nd = 0.1960, the µ142Nd (ppm deviation relative to the JNdi-1 standard) values range from -9±5 (95% c.i.)  for enstatite  chondrites to -31±1 for the Allende carbonaceous chondrite. This is consistent with  prior  observations  [5-7]  and  indicates  that  the 142Nd/144Nd of chondrites does not only reflect Sm/Nd fractionation  and  146Sm  decay.  Evidence  for  the process responsible for the  142Nd variations  in  chondrites comes from the non-radiogenic Nd isotopes, for which our new data show resolved systematic and positively correlated anomalies (Fig. 1). These anomalies were not resolved in previous studies because the measurements  were of insufficient  precision.  The  anomalies increase in  the  order:  enstatite  chondrites,  carbonaceous  chondrites,  ordinary  chondrites,  NWA 5363. Discussion:  The anomalies in non-radiogenic Nd isotopes plot along mixing lines between terrestrial Nd and  s-process  Nd as  obtained  from  s-process  model  calculations,  data from presolar  SiC grains,  or chondrite  leachates.  This  implies  that  the  meteorites  are characterized  by variable depletions  in  s-process Nd relative to the Earth,  an observation that is consistent with inferences from other isotope systems,  e.g., Mo, Ru and Zr [8-10]. However, while for these other systems  the  nucleosynthetic  anomalies  are  typically largest in carbonaceous chondrites, the µ145Nd, µ148Nd and  µ150Nd values of Allende are  similar  to those of enstatite  and  ordinary chondrites.  These subdued Nd anomalies in Allende can be explained by the presence of CAIs, which host about half of all the Nd (and Sm) in Allende and are characterized by an s-excess in the non-radiogenic Nd isotopes [11]. A CAI-free carbonaceous  chondrite  composition  obtained  by mass  balance,  therefore,  exhibit  significantly  larger  µ145Nd, µ148Nd and µ150Nd anomalies. The information obtained from the non-radiogenic Nd isotopes allows quantification  of nucleosynthetic contributions  to  measured  µ142Nd  anomalies  in  the chondrites. The µ142Nd values of the meteorites are inversely correlated with µ145Nd, µ148Nd and µ150Nd. Enstatite and ordinary chondrites, as well as NWA5363, plot on mixing lines between the terrestrial  composition and s-process Nd. Allende deviates from this lines due to admixture of CAIs. Mass balance indicates that a CAI-free carbonaceous chondrite source composition also plots well on the s-process correlation line defined by the other chondrites. Regressions of the bulk meteorite data yield slopes that are indistinguishable from those obtained  for  s-process mixing  lines,  and  their µ142Nd intercept values are indistinguishable from the terrestrial value at the current level of precision. Conclusion:  Our data indicates that compared to chondrites, the Earth accreted from material enriched in Nd isotopes produced by the s-process of nucleosynthesis.  Once this  nucleosynthetic  effect is  taken  into account, the Earth and chondrites seem to have indistinguishable 142Nd compositions. This suggests that the Earth  has a chondritic Sm/Nd ratio and as such supports the long-standing paradigm of a chondritic composition  of the  Earth.  Thus,  our  results  obviate  the need  for  collisional  erosion  of early-formed crust  or the  presence  of  a  hidden  reservoir  within  the  deep Earth.
