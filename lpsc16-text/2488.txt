H2 can be considered as a"smoking gun" for the suspected hydrothermal activityin Enceladus' ocean ([1][2]) as it is ultravolatile andwould need to be the result of an ongoing production.However, while results for low velocity (7.5 km/s) areconsistent with regard to the abundance of H2, highvelocity flyby show a higher quantity. This is attributedto the presence of ice grains in the plumes [3]: theirimpacts on the walls of the titanium antechamber ofINMS expose/project fresh titanium that will react withwater to form hydrogen. The large number of small icegrains arriving during a single integration period ofINMS creates a continuous signal in addition of largegrains causing punctual spikes, visible only in oneintegration period. This process poses the question ofhow much of the detected hydrogen is native and howmuch is an artifact. A surface chemistry model of the INMS has beendeveloped in order to determine how much H2 isproduced from the expected ice grains distribution foreach flyby (given by Cassini CAPS data [4]). Thismodel considers adsorption and chemisorption effectsto follow the evolution of surface and gas phasespecies in the antechamber. [5] Simulations of impacts on an titanium surface [6]have shown that above 16 km/s (as is the case for flybyE5) the impact produces titanium vapor, while at thevelocities of the slow flybys, the titanium stays in theform of solid fragments.The surface chemistry model has shown that an icegrain impact releasing titanium vapor [5] produces apeak with a duration well under the integration periodof 31 ms. Longer simulations show that the yetunreacted titanium vapor deposited onto the walls ofthe antechamber creates a residual signal; however, aslong as high velocity impact occur, they are the mostimportant source of the H2 signal.New simulations, taking into account the exposedsurface and fragments of titanium in order to replicatethe conditions of slow flybys, show a different effecton the antechamber population and therefore on thesignal (Figure 1). A low velocity impact will notproduce the peak seen at high velocity.  Here we present the preliminary results of thesimulation of a low-speed flyby using the ice grainsdistribution determined from CAPS data [4] and usethe new INMS sensitivity model [7] to translate thoseresults into an expected number of counts at mass 2.We discuss how those results compare to the slowflybys E14, E17 and E18 and to the recent E21 flyby(using the open source to exclude H2 produced by icegrains).References: [1] Hsu et al., 2015, Nature, 519(7542), 207-210.

The residual signal is correlated to the quantity ofsolid titanium exposed, while the titanium vapor (high-velocity impact only) creates an intense and short-lived peak.2488.pdf
