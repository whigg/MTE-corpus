H2 can be considered as a "smoking gun" for the suspected hydrothermal activity in Enceladus' ocean ([1][2]) as it is ultravolatile and would need to be the result of an ongoing production. However, while results for low velocity (7.5 km/s) are consistent with regard to the abundance of H2, high velocity flyby show a higher quantity. This is attributed to the presence of ice grains in the plumes [3]: their impacts on the walls of the titanium antechamber of INMS expose/project fresh titanium that will react with water to form hydrogen. The large number of small ice grains arriving during a single integration period of INMS creates a continuous signal in addition of large grains causing punctual spikes, visible only in one integration period. This process poses the question of how much of the detected hydrogen is native and how much is an artifact. A surface chemistry model of the INMS has been developed in order to determine how much H2 is produced from the expected ice grains distribution for each flyby (given by Cassini CAPS data [4]). This model considers adsorption and chemisorption effects to follow the evolution of surface and gas phase species in the antechamber. [5] Simulations of impacts on an titanium surface [6] have shown that above 16 km/s (as is the case for flyby E5) the impact produces titanium vapor, while at the velocities of the slow flybys, the titanium stays in the form of solid fragments. The surface chemistry model has shown that an ice grain impact releasing titanium vapor [5] produces a peak with a duration well under the integration period of 31 ms. Longer simulations show that the yet unreacted titanium vapor deposited onto the walls of the antechamber creates a residual signal; however, as long as high velocity impact occur, they are the most important source of the H2 signal. New simulations, taking into account the exposed surface and fragments of titanium in order to replicate the conditions of slow flybys, show a different effect on the antechamber population and therefore on the signal (Figure 1). A low velocity impact will not produce the peak seen at high velocity.  Here we present the preliminary results of the simulation of a low-speed flyby using the ice grains distribution determined from CAPS data [4] and use the new INMS sensitivity model [7] to translate those results into an expected number of counts at mass 2. We discuss how those results compare to the slow flybys E14, E17 and E18 and to the recent E21 flyby (using the open source to exclude H2 produced by ice grains).
