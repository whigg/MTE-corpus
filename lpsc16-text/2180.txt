Politechniki 11, 90 924 Lodz, Poland,  (mszurgot@p.lodz.pl).    Introduction:  Knowledge of  mean atomic weight is important to characterize minerals and rocks, planets, moons, and asteroids [1-9]. Certain ordinary chondrites are classified as intermediate H/L, and L/LL meteorites. The aim of the paper was to determine and analyze mean atomic weight of selected H/L and L/LL chondrites. All the selected meteorites represent falls. For comparison with intermediate groups average values of mean atomic weight of LL, L, and H groups of chondrites have been also analysed. Literature data on mean bulk elemental and oxide composition of the meteorites [10-16], and grain density of meteorites [17, 18] have been used to calculate mean atomic weight.  Results and discussion:  Recent results by Szurgot [5-9] show that mean atomic weight Amean of planets, protoplanet Vesta, moon and meteorites can be determined using chemical composition, atomic Fe/Si ratio, and density d (g/cm3): Amean = ∑wi/ ∑(wi/Ai),                                         (1)                            Amean= 5.72.Fe/Si + 20.25,                                  (2)  Amean= 7.51.d - 2.74,                                            (3) where wi(wt%) is the mass fraction of ith element, and/or ith oxide, Ai is atomic weight of ith element, and/or mean atomic weight of ith oxide,  and d (g/cm3) is planetary uncompressed density of planets, moons and asteroids, and grain density of meteorites.        Tables 1 and 2 collect values of Amean, calculated by eqs. (1-3) employing chemical composition established by various researchers [10-16].

For calculation of average values of dgrain and logχ of L/LL and H/L chondrites, dgrain and logχ of individual meteorites were used [19].   Tables 1-3 reveal that using Fe/Si and eq.(2) leads to the good prediction of Amean, and using dgrain and eq.(3) leads to the satisfactory prediction. Tables 1 and 2 show that, in general, Amean data confirm the petrological classification of intermediate chondrites. As concerns Nyirábrany it was first classified as LL5 chondrite [16], and recently as L/LL4-5 chondrite [21]. Amean data support this new intermediate class for Nyirábrany.  Table 4 present data on average values of Fe/Si atomic ratio, dgrain, and logχ of meteorite groups represented falls. Tables 3 and 4 show that Amean, Fe/Si ratio, dgrain, and logχ follow the inequalities: AmeanLL<AmeanL/LL<AmeanL<AmeanH/L<Amean H,                                                                           (4) (Fe/Si)LL<(Fe/Si)L/LL<(Fe/Si)L<(Fe/Si)H/L<(Fe/Si) H,                                                           (5)   dgrainLL≈dgrainL/LL<dgrainL<dgrainH/L<dgrainH,                                                                                  (6)                                                                                                                                          logχLL<logχL/LL<logχL<logχH/L<logχH.             (7)                                                                                                                                                                                   Tables 1-4 and inequalities (4)-(7) show that average values of Amean, Fe/Si, dgrain, and logχ for intermediate L/LL chondrites are between L and LL chondrites, and those for intermediate H/L are between H and L chondrites. This means that Amean and Fe/Si are useful for classification of ordinary chondrites. Grain densities of LL and L/LL are comparable, but H/L chondrites are distinguishable from L and H chondrites.     Magnetic suscebility is now well verified property to classify meteorites [19,20], and present data (Table 4) confirm that intermediate meteorites exhibit transitional magnetic properties. Relationship between Amean and logχ can be expressed by the equation  Amean = 1.49. logχ + 16.6,                                   (8) for which R2 = 0.95, and RMSE = 0.24. This relationship is presented in Fig. 1.   Fig. 1 Relationship between mean atomic weight and logχ for ordinary chondrites.     Eq. (8) predicts Amean = 24.08 for Bremervorde (logχ =5.02 [17]), for Cali Amean = 24.21 (logχ =5.11 [14]), Amean = 23.92 for Tieschitz (logχ =4.91 [17]), and Amean = 23.99 for Sultanpur (logχ =4.96 [17]).    The comparison of Amean values determined in this paper for OC's (Tables 1-4) with  Amean value established recently for Chelyabinsk (Amean = 23.47 for dominant light lithology, and 23.52  for light and dark lithologies [8]), indicates intermediate L/LL5 class of this meteorite rather than LL5. Magnetic susceptibility of Chelyabinsk is also intermediate between LL and L group [22].       Conclusions: Mean atomic weight, Fe/Si ratio, grain density, and magnetic susceptibility of intermediate L/LL and H/L chondrites confirms their transitional nature. Relationships between Amean and Fe/Si ratio, Amean and dgrain, and Amean and logχ have been successfully verified for OC's chondrites. This means that Amean values predicted by Fe/Si ratio, grain density and magnetic susceptibility are in good agreement with Amean values determined by bulk chemical composition of meteorites and can be used for classification of ordinary chondrites. Certain physical properties of parent body of H/L meteorites can be predicted: Amean = 24.3 ± 0.1, Fe/Si = 0.73 ± 0.04, dgrain = 3.64 ± 0.09, and  logχ = 5.0 ± 0.1.  References: [1] Anderson, D.
