The LCROSS mission confirmed that as much as 5%wt of water is found in part of the floor of Cabeus crater [Colaprete et al., 2010]. LRO's  far UV sensing systems has also detected a surface water veneer at  < 2% mix into the regolith material in the coldest cratered regions [Gladstone et al., 2012; Hayne et al., 2015].  There are currently two different models presented in the literature to describe the trapping process of water in cold permanently shadowed craters. We will compare and contrast these models herein.  The Watson Model. The first theory is a sublimation/evaporation model originally presented in Watson et al. [1961] and which is now applied to understand the trapping of water as detected by LRO's remote sensing systems. Specifically, the evaporation rate from a surface is found to be directly proportional to the vapor pressure of the overlying gas, dE/dt ~ p, with this pressure varying as p=  B exp(-A/T) where T is the equilibrium temperature of the gas and surface, and B and A are constants of the specific gas in question. In Watson et al., the gas constants are extrapolated to levels expected in polar craters, with T at or below 100K and pressures below 10-15 Bar (<10-10 Pa). Zhang et al. [2009] has since derived a volatility temperature, Tv, defined as that temperature where the evaporation rate corresponds to a surface loss of 1 mm of surface volatile material per billion years for a density of 1 g/cm3. For example, Tv for a water ice surface is near 105K, for sulpher between 200-205K, etc. The sublimation rate goes approximately as dE/dt ~ 2.8 x 109 (0.01/T)1/2 exp(-0.55/T) kg/m2-s where T is in units of eV (and 1 eV =11000K). At 110K, the water outflux is 1011 waters/m2-s and at 100K the outflux drops to 5 x 108 waters/m2-s from the icy surface.  For a sublimation process, we interpret the exponential relationship as being representative of the probability of the overlying water vapor at temperature T releasing a surface-bound water molecule (bound at a value near 0.5 eV).  The Barrie Model. The second model has been applied recently to programmed temperature desorption studies like those performed by Hibbitts et al [2011], Poston et al [2013; 2015] and is best described by Barrie [2008]. Specifically, they do not consider sublimation, assuming the overlying gas has no effect on surface water release. Instead, they consider thermal desorption from the surface associated with the quantum mechanical probability of the surface releasing a bound volatile trapped in an atom-atom potential well at a given temperature. Due to increased phonon activity, the lattice will become more vibrationally-active with increasing T, thereby increasing the likelihood of volatile release from a trapped atomic potential. The rate of release via thermal desorption is defined by the first-order Polanyi-Wigner equation [Poston et al., 2013] as r =- dN/dt = kN, where k is the Arrhenius equation k = C exp(-U/T) and C is a pre-exponential factor defined by the quantum mechanical frequency of the trapping potential well (typically ~ 1013/s), and U is the surface activation energy (in eV).  There is no single activation energy applicable to a surface, since U will have a range of values depending on the defect structure of the surface crystal. Barrie considered the distribution of activation energy states, F(U,T), that described the adsorption states of the surface. In this case the integrated desorption rate, r = - dN/dt = integral of [C exp(-U/T) F(U,T) dU] from 0 to infinity. Using the inversion techniques from Barrie, Poston et al. [2015] found that desorption rate from lunar sample 72501 could be described by a distribution of chemisorbed activation energy states having a peak near 0.7 eV and a distribution half-width of 0.15 eV covering nearly 10% of the surface. The importance of the width of the distribution: Those sites with large activation energies (> 1.0 eV) will trap water even at relatively high temperatures. Hence, water sticking to surfaces as described by Barrie is considered a statistical mechanics problem involving the varied states of the surface atomic potential.  Near 100K, the desorption rate from these chemisorbed sites is r ~ 10-3 waters/m2-s with the water at these high potential sites well bonded to the surface atoms. This surface also has a large concentration (~90%) of non-chemisorbed sites with U < 0.5 eV, and the desorption rate from the remaining surface is then r > 4 x 107 waters/m2-s.  Comparing and Contrasting. We note that both of these approaches are currently presented in the literature but differ substantially in philosophy and result. The first relies exclusively on release by an overlying gas while the latter relies exclusively on the detailed atomic potential properties of the surface itself, defined by F(U,T).  We will compare and contrast the Watson vs Barrie approach and demonstrate that in high water  concentrations, the two approaches can yield similar results - especially when adsorption sites become occupied by water. However, for low water concentrations, the properties of the regolith surface (defined by F(U,T)) rather than the overlying low pressure gas, should be used to define water release. Schorghofer  [2014] imposes a conversion factor of 400 to approximate the effects of low water concentration on exposed regolith implementing the ice sublimation approach. However, the Barrie approach yields a substantial compositional dependence and predicts correlation between surface water concentrations and surface exposure history. We will also attempt to examine recent LRO observations of water frost, but now in the Barrie framework.  References: [1] Colaprete, A. et al., Science, 330, 463, 2010. [2] Gladstone, G.
