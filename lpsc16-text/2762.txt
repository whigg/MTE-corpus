CERES MODEL SUGGESTS LARGE SCALE TOPOGRAPHY MAY REFLECT EARLY TIME INTERNAL CONVECTION.   B. J. Travis1, W. C. Feldman1, 1Planetary Science Institute, 1700 E. Ft. Lowell, Suite 106, Tucson, AZ 85719 (btravis@psi.edu).       Background: Relating internal dynamics to planetary surface features can be challenging. Here, we present numerical simulations of large-scale internal convection on Ceres that suggest a correlation of the results of these simulations with topographic features observed by Dawn.     Ceres’ low density (2077 kg/m3) implies it may contain large amounts of H2O. A recent analysis [1] concludes that Ceres must in fact contain a large free water fraction. Thermal evolution models e.g., [2], confirm that radiogenic heating could have melted any water ice present earlier in its history, leading to complete differentiation of Ceres. Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and near-IR data confirm that the shape of Ceres is consistent with a differentiated body [3]. Earth-based spectroscopy has suggested hydrated minerals on Ceres’ surface, including carbonates such as dolomite, iron-rich clays and even magnetite [4, 5]. Numerical modeling of dynamics in Ceres can provide constraints on its past and present internal states. For Ceres, estimates of the Rayleigh number indicate strong fluid flow could occur, at least in its early history.       Our simulations indicate that multiple scales of convective plumes develop early in Ceres’ history, and diminish under a thickening ice shell. Global surveys of topographic relief on Ceres indicate three types of structures that may have relevance to these internal dynamics: (1) long wavelength topography (high- and low-land regions at several 100-km length scales (see Figure 1 [6]), (2) numerous large domes (10s of km in diameter) [7,8], and (3) an isolated mountain, Ahuna Mons [9].   Ceres Model: A two-dimensional model simulation of Ceres covering most of its history was performed previously [10] to discover the kind of internal dynamics that is possible, under the constraints of conservation laws and thermodynamics. Hydrothermal activity in the rocky permeable core is coupled to flow in an ocean layer and to heat transfer in an ice shell. The MAGHNUM simulator [11] is used.         Applied surface temperature varies from 150 K at the poles to 170 K at the equator. Model geometry is spherical (radius, latitude). Our simulation covers evolution of the interior from its early history to nearpresent. Gravity is a function of depth; surface gravity is 0.278 m/s2.  The ice shell evolves over time and location in response to local dynamics. Sub-grid-scale flow dynamics in the ocean layer and the ice shell are parameterized through effective thermal conductivity as function of a local Rayleigh number-Nusselt number relation. The rocky core is roughly 300 km in radius with a density of about 2520 kg/m3. Ocean mud density is about 1870 kg/m3. These densities and the core radius will depend somewhat on the amount of compaction that occurs in the core; 30% residual core porosity is assumed here.         Results: In our model simulation, the internal temperature peaks very early at about 200 oC, from decay of 26Al and 60Fe, then drops off by about 150 Myr into the simulation to about 35 oC. At this point, long-term radiogenic heating almost balances heat loss through the surface, and the internal peak temperature drops slowly, only a few oC/Gyr. Internal heating in the rocky core plus cold, sinking plumes from the surface drive the convective circulation. Initially, the flow pattern is dipolar, but transitions to a quadrupole pattern between 200 and 500 Myr. Figures 2 and 3 display the temperature distribution at 0.5 Gyr and 1.5 Gyr. The large warm upwellings in the rocky permeable core feed smaller scale convection in the ocean layer.       Convective cells in our Ceres model early on are ~ 300 km in height and on the order of 500+ km wide. Downwellings (outside the core) freeze over time, potentially generating ~150 km height x 0.09 (Δvolume - water to ice) x ~ 0.5 (fraction of water in mud) ~ 7 km change, comparable to surface relief.  Even late in our Ceres model evolution (Figure 4) there is still considerable vertical height contrast between upwelling and neighboring frozen regions; that could sustain kms of surface relief.       Large domes are ~ 1-5 km high, and 50-100 km diameter. The scale of small-scale, late time convection is about 50-100 km in diameter, from a 3-D simulation (Figure 5). Freezing of downwellings would generate ~ 75 km height x 0.09 Δ (volume) x 0.5 (fraction of water in mud) ~ 3-4 km relief, comparable to the large domes. Freezing between upwellings produces lateral stress, that, based on compressibility of water and rock, could rise as high as 2 kbars, likely sufficient to fracture ice and drive out flow to the surface, until excess volume is expelled. Further study of these possibilities is needed and is in progress.      Summary:  We propose that long wavelength Cerean topography is consistent with large upwelling plumes early in the dwarf planet’s history. Large domes (typically exhibiting 1 - 5 km of relief) may be consistent with extrusion of mud through fractures in the icy crust later in Ceres’ evolution. Over-pressuring of upwelling plumes at the base of the icy crust from freezing of neighboring downwellings could generate surface uplift of a few kms as well as fractures in a frozen mud crust. 2762.pdf
