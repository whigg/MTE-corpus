In the canonicalscenario [3],  which is constrained by the present daysystem angular  momentum (LEM),  a  ~0.1  Earth-massbody obliquely impacts the proto-Earth near the escapevelocity to generate a disk predominantly composed ofprojectile  material  from  which  the  moon  accretes.However,  since the original  formulation of the GiantImpact  hypothesis,  improved  analytical  techniqueshave  revealed  that  the  Moon  and  Earth  have  nearlyidentical isotopes [4], with the simplest explanation forthe isotopic similarity being that the Moon was formedfrom Earth's mantle [5]. As the impactor is expected tohave a different isotopic signature than Earth, the giantimpact hypothesis has had an "isotopic crisis" [6, 4].Ćuk and Stewart [7] presented a new model for theorigin of the Earth-Moon system. A late erosive impactonto a fast-spinning proto-Earth produced a disk thatwas massive enough to form the Moon and was composed primarily of material from Earth, but the systemhad more angular momentum (AM) than at present day.Subsequently, the excess AM was lost during tidal evolution of the Moon via a resonance between Earth's orbital  period  and  precession  of  the  Moon's  perigee.Canup [8] presented a different impact scenario, a slowcollision between two similar mass bodies, that leads toEarth's mantle and disk having similar source materials.  This  scenario,  which  produces  a  fast-spinningEarth, invoked the angular momentum loss mechanismin [7]. Wisdom and Tian [9] showed that the evectionnear-resonance can despin the Earth for a wider rangeof tidal parameters than explored by Ćuk and Stewart[7] and reproduce the current AM of the system.Furthermore, Lock et al. [10,11,12] show that aftera  high-energy,  high-angular  momentum giant  impact,the  Earth's  mantle,  atmosphere  and  circumplanetarydisk would not be isolated from each other, enablingrapid mixing that would lead to a lunar isotopic composition resembling that of Earth's mantle. Robust postimpact mixing also alleviates the need for special impact conditions, and a wider range of impacts than theso-called successful cases in [7,8] can generate an isotopically similar Moon. Lunar accretion from a highenergy, high-angular momentum post-impact state alsopredicts a pattern of volatile element depletion of theMoon relative to Earth that matches the observations[12]. However, the AM loss through the evection resonance is confined to a subset of possible tidal parameters of Earth and the Moon, and its robustness is stillunder question.Lunar Inclination:  A major issue left unresolvedby existing theories is the origin of lunar orbital inclination. It is currently about 5 deg and studies of theMoon's tidal evolution [13, 14] found that the inclination would have been at least 12 deg at lunar formation, assuming it was primordial; this is at odds with lunar formation from a flat disk in the equatorial plane ofEarth, which should result in the Moon with no inclination.  Hypotheses  that  have been proposed  to  explainthe  lunar  inclination  include  a  complex  sequence  ofluni-solar resonances [15] and the Moon's resonant interaction  with the  protolunar  disk  [16];  both  requirespecial  conditions  and  unlikely tidal  evolution  histories.  More  recently,  Pahlevan  and  Morbidelli  [17]found that encounters between large planetesimals andthe Earth-Moon system following lunar formation cangenerate  substantial  lunar  inclination.  However,  thismechanism [17] requires implausible tidal properties ofEarth and neglects lunar inclination damping by lunarobliquity tides, as well as lunar eccentricity excitationby Earth tides. We find it unlikely that such encountersexplain the present lunar inclination.Chen and Nimmo [18]  found that  lunar  obliquitytides affected lunar inclination more strongly than previously realized. Past studies of lunar tidal history [11,12, 7] ignored lunar obliquity tides, despite the fact thatthe Moon had large obliquity when it was between 30and 40 Earth radii (RE) due to the lunar spin axis undergoing the Cassini state transition [19, 20]. While Chenand Nimmo [16] considered tides within lunar magmaocean  that  rely on  excitation  of  Rossby waves [21],here we will be more conservative in our approach andonly  consider  tidal  response  of  the  current,  "cold"Moon. If we assume long-term average tidal dissipationwithin Earth and current lunar tidal properties, we findthat the orbital inclination of the Moon must have beensubstantially higher before the Cassini state transition,possibly as high as 30 deg. We now describe a new scenario that can explain this high early inclination.Tidal  Evolution  with  a  High-Obliquity  EarlyEarth: Very large lunar inclinations are reminiscent ofstudies by Atobe and Ida [22] who explored dynamicsof  high-obliquity  Earth-like  planets  with  large  satellites.  They found complex dynamics,  which includedlarge-scale  angular  momentum loss  from the  system.2489.pdf

Dynamics  of  satellites  around  high-obliquity  planetswas later studied by Tremaine et al. [23] and Tamayo etal. [24], who found that the satellite orbits are excitedby solar  perturbations at  the so-called Laplace planetransition if the planetary obliquity exceeds 69 deg.In order to study tidal evolution of the Moon from ahigh-obliquity Earth followed by inclination dampingat Cassini state transition, we wrote a specialized numerical integrator R-SISTEM that resolves lunar rotation and, therefore, fully models lunar obliquity tides.We  will  present  results  for  simulations  that  assumeEarth's initial obliquity of 70 deg with a 1.8 LEM postimpact angular momentum, after Ćuk and Stewart [7]. We find that solar perturbations induce significantlunar eccentricity when the Moon reaches the Laplaceplane transition at about 17 RE, triggering strong satellite tides that arrest further tidal evolution. As these solar perturbations are secular in nature [24], they do notaffect the lunar semimajor axis but lower the Moon'seccentricity. As a result, AM is removed from the lunarorbit and transferred to Earth's heliocentric orbit; Earthtides in turn transfer AM from Earth's spin to lunar orbit, while satellite tides do not change Earth-Moon system AM. During this prolonged stalling of lunar tidalevolution, the Moon acquires large inclination (over 30deg), while the obliquity of Earth decreases. In the laterpart of the Laplace plane transition lunar eccentricity isexcited by a complex near-resonance between lunar orbital precession and the precession of Earth's spin axis.Depending on the exact tidal parameters used for Earthand the Moon, Earth's obliquity can reach <20 deg required to match the present value [25], while the AM ofthe system also matches the present value. Cassini State Transition:  The rotational dynamicsof  the  Moon  is  strongly  dependent  on  the  Moon'sglobal shape. It is widely expected that the early Moonhad little strength and its shape was in equilibrium withtidal  forces  [26].  While  our  integrator  considers  theMoon to be a rigid body, in simulations of the Moon'searliest history, we periodically reset its figure to matchan equilibrium shape at  that  distance from Earth,  assuming synchronous rotation [25]. This assumption ofhydrostatic-like shape results in low obliquities in theCassini state 1 when the Moon is close to Earth [17].Since the current shape of the Moon matches the orderof magnitude of tidal deformation expected at 23-26 RE[26],  we assumed that the Moon is rigid and has thepresent-day  principal  moments  when modeling  lunartidal evolution beyond 25 RE. Our results are roughlyconsistent with the idea that the lunar shape formed atdistance 15-17 RE on an orbit with e~0.2 [27].We find that the Moon likely spent some time in anon-synchronous  rotation  state  when  close  to  theCassini state transition, and we find that transition between rotation states can be triggered by various resonances or impacts. Regardless of the Moon's rotationstate, lunar obliquity is certain to have been very highduring the Cassini state transition and immediately following it, leading to damping of lunar inclination. Using our numerical integrator, we find that the lunar inclination damps roughly to its present value if we assume long-term average tidal properties for Earth and arelatively non-dissipative, solid Moon. Conclusions:   We have discovered a new solutionto the lunar inclination problem. Starting with a postimpact high-obliquity, high-angular momentum EarthMoon  system,  tidal  evolution  through  the  Laplaceplane transition leads to reduction in the system angular momentum while generating high inclination. Subsequently,  lunar  inclination is lowered to  the presentday value in the Cassini state transition. A single giantimpact that generates a high-energy, high-angular momentum,  high-obliquity  post-impact  state  initiates  anatural sequence of events that imparts the elementaland isotopic composition of the Moon and the presentday dynamical state of the Earth-Moon system.Acknowledgements: M.Ć.  is supported by NASAEmerging Worlds program, award NNX15AH65G.References: [1] Hartmann, W.
