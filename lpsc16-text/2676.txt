USA.Introduction:  Surrounding Jupiter there are multiple satellites, 67 known to-date. The most recent classification system [1,2], based on orbital characteristics,uses the largest member of the group as the name andexample.  The closest group to Jupiter is the progradeAmalthea group, 4 small satellites embedded in a ringsystem.  Moving  outwards  there  are  the  famousGalilean moons, Io,  Europa,  Ganymede and Callisto,whose mass is similar to terrestrial  planets. The finaland largest group, is that of the outer Irregular satellites. Those irregulars that show a prograde orbit areclosest to Jupiter and have previously been classifiedinto three families  [2],  the Themisto,  Carpo  and Himalia groups.  The remainder of the irregular satellitesshow a retrograde orbit,  counter  to Jupiter's  rotation.Based on similarities in semi-major axis (a), inclination(i)  and  eccentricity  (e)  these  satellites  have  beengrouped  into  families  [1,2].  In  order  outward  fromJupiter  they are:  Ananke  family (a 2.13x107 km ;  i148.9o;  e 0.24);  Carme  family  (a 2.34x107 km  ;  i164.9o; e 0.25) and the Pasiphae family (a 2:36x107 km;  i 151.4o;  e 0.41). There are some irregular satellites,recently discovered in 2003 [3], 2010 [4] and 2011[5],that have yet to be named or officially classified.The aim of this project is to investigate the validityof the groupings and taxonomic relationships amongstthese satellites, using a technique called cladistics.  Cladistics:  This technique is traditionally used toexamine the relationships  between biological  groups,though it has been used to classify Galaxies [6]. Thiswork is the first usage of cladistics in a planetary science context.  Cladistics uses a multivariate analysis toexamine the relationships between groups, in this casethe Jovian satellites. The advantage of this method overother,  bivariate  analysis  systems  is  the  inclusion  ofmultiple orbital and physical characteristics, thus moredetailed  relationships  can  be  inferred.  The  resultingbranching taxonomic tree is then a hypothesis for therelational groups. Methods: To construct a taxonomic tree, a taxoncharacter matrix is required.  A taxon-character matrixis a table consisting of the individual satellites (taxa) inthe rows, and the orbital (5), physical (2) and compositional  (29)  characteristics  in  each  column.  The  datawas gathered from [2,7-14]. The resulting matrix is analyzed  using the Mesquite  software  package  [15].  Astrict consensus of the 100 most parsimonious trees ispresented in figure 1.Results:  Figure 1: A strict consensus taxonomic tree of theJovian  satellites.  Colors  indicate  families  [1,2]:Amalthea family;  Galileans; Themisto group;  Himaliafamily;  Carpo  group;  Anake  family;  Carme  family;Pasiphae group;  Sun outgroup; Uncatagorised and yetto be named2676.pdf

Satellite groups:The taxonomic tree confirms earlier  classificationsystems [1,2] with each of these groups exemplified bya large type satellite. Some of the newer, unnamed irregular  satellites  can also  be  confidently assigned  tothese groups. Amalthea  Inner  Regular  family: These  satellitesform a sister group to the irregular satellites, suggestinga  common origin.  The  icy composition  of  Amalthea[15] supports this hypothesis. The association with theHimalia family also indicates a similar mechanism ofcapture.Galilean:  The  Galilean  satellites  form  a  sistergroup to all other satellites. This agrees with the theorythat  they formed  locally through  disk  accretion  [17]and  survived  planetary  encounters  of  the  jumpingJupiter model [18]. Himalia Prograde Irregular family:  This is a wellsupported group. Themisto and Carpo were proposedas their  own groups [1],  but  this analysis  supports  alarger family with the type satellite being Himalia. TheHimalia family forms a distinct group to the other irregular  satellite  groups (Anake family,  Carme familyand Pasiphae  group).  This  would suggest  a  commonorigin, but perhaps not a common mechanism of capture. Anake Irregular family:  The Anake family is  upheld and expanded to include new members. Heike ismoved from the Pasiphae group. Some of the unclassified  members  can  also  be  assigned  to  this  family;S2003J3/12/15/18,  S2010J2  & S2011J1.  The  Anakefamily  form  a  super-family  with  the  other  irregularsatellites.Carme Irregular family: This family is also upheldand expanded.  It  is  expanded  to  confidently includeS2003J5/9/10/19.  Possible  other  members  includeSinope, Callirrhoe and S2003J4/16.Pasiphae Irregular group:  This group is problematic. Pasiphae itself forms a small group with Megacliteand Aoede, but is separate from the others. There is another  group with Sponde,  Hegemone,  Cyllene,  Kore,Autone,  S2003J2/23,  S2010J1  and  S2011J2.  Thisgroups is well supported, but does not contain a largetype  member.  The other  large  member of  the group,Sinope,  could  possibly belong to  the  Carme family.This suggests that the Pasiphae group is the result ofmultiple interactions, with multiple originator objects.Origins: With the groups outlined, the multiple origins of the Jovian satellites can begin to be determined.Each family, except the Galileans,  is composed of alarge,  type satellite. With the prograde Amalthea andHimalia families forming a sister group to the other irregular families, this would support  a different originmechanism. Nebular drag theory has been proposed asthis mechanism for the Himalia Family [19] and couldexplain the orbital mechanics of the Amalthea as well. It  has  been  theorized  that  the  irregular  satelliteswere captured  during planetary interactions,  involvedwith the jumping-Jupiter  model [20].  The progenerators of the families proposed would be consistent withthis model. Further work: The composition of the small satellites is still theoretical. This leads to a bias towards orbital characteristics in analysis. This study and others[1,2] link them to larger type satellites that have knowncompositions. As technology improves, spectral imaging, using a large infra-red space telescope, such as theJames Webb Space Telescope, may be undertaken onthese smaller bodies. This would provide the missingcompositional information and could help resolve several families.Using a similar cladistical technique, the type satellites of the families can be compared with other solarsystem bodies.  This would help resolve the origin ofthe  Jovian  satellites  and  relationships  between  solarsystem bodies.References: [1]Nesvorny,  D.  et  al.  (2003)  AJ,  126,  398-429.[2] Sheppard, S.
