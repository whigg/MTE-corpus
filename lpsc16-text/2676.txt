USA. Introduction:  Surrounding Jupiter there are multiple satellites, 67 known to-date. The most recent classification system [1,2], based on orbital characteristics, uses the largest member of the group as the name and example.  The closest group to Jupiter is the prograde Amalthea group, 4 small satellites embedded in a ring system.  Moving  outwards  there  are  the  famous Galilean moons, Io,  Europa,  Ganymede and Callisto, whose mass is similar to terrestrial  planets. The final and largest group, is that of the outer Irregular satellites. Those irregulars that show a prograde orbit are closest to Jupiter and have previously been classified into three families  [2],  the Themisto,  Carpo  and Himalia groups.  The remainder of the irregular satellites show a retrograde orbit,  counter  to Jupiter's  rotation. Based on similarities in semi-major axis (a), inclination (i)  and  eccentricity  (e)  these  satellites  have  been grouped  into  families  [1,2].  In  order  outward  from Jupiter  they are:  Ananke  family (a 2.13x107 km ;  i 148.9o;  e 0.24);  Carme  family  (a 2.34x107 km  ;  i 164.9o; e 0.25) and the Pasiphae family (a 2:36x107 km ;  i 151.4o;  e 0.41). There are some irregular satellites, recently discovered in 2003 [3], 2010 [4] and 2011[5], that have yet to be named or officially classified. The aim of this project is to investigate the validity of the groupings and taxonomic relationships amongst these satellites, using a technique called cladistics.  Cladistics:  This technique is traditionally used to examine the relationships  between biological  groups, though it has been used to classify Galaxies [6]. This work is the first usage of cladistics in a planetary science context.  Cladistics uses a multivariate analysis to examine the relationships between groups, in this case the Jovian satellites. The advantage of this method over other,  bivariate  analysis  systems  is  the  inclusion  of multiple orbital and physical characteristics, thus more detailed  relationships  can  be  inferred.  The  resulting branching taxonomic tree is then a hypothesis for the relational groups. Methods: To construct a taxonomic tree, a taxoncharacter matrix is required.  A taxon-character matrix is a table consisting of the individual satellites (taxa) in the rows, and the orbital (5), physical (2) and compositional  (29)  characteristics  in  each  column.  The  data was gathered from [2,7-14]. The resulting matrix is analyzed  using the Mesquite  software  package  [15].  A strict consensus of the 100 most parsimonious trees is presented in figure 1. Results:  Figure 1: A strict consensus taxonomic tree of the Jovian  satellites.  Colors  indicate  families  [1,2]: Amalthea family;  Galileans; Themisto group;  Himalia family;  Carpo  group;  Anake  family;  Carme  family; Pasiphae group;  Sun outgroup; Uncatagorised and yet to be named   Satellite groups: The taxonomic tree confirms earlier  classification systems [1,2] with each of these groups exemplified by a large type satellite. Some of the newer, unnamed irregular  satellites  can also  be  confidently assigned  to these groups. Amalthea  Inner  Regular  family: These  satellites form a sister group to the irregular satellites, suggesting a  common origin.  The  icy composition  of  Amalthea [15] supports this hypothesis. The association with the Himalia family also indicates a similar mechanism of capture. Galilean:  The  Galilean  satellites  form  a  sister group to all other satellites. This agrees with the theory that  they formed  locally through  disk  accretion  [17] and  survived  planetary  encounters  of  the  jumpingJupiter model [18]. Himalia Prograde Irregular family:  This is a well supported group. Themisto and Carpo were proposed as their  own groups [1],  but  this analysis  supports  a larger family with the type satellite being Himalia. The Himalia family forms a distinct group to the other irregular  satellite  groups (Anake family,  Carme family and Pasiphae  group).  This  would suggest  a  common origin, but perhaps not a common mechanism of capture. Anake Irregular family:  The Anake family is  upheld and expanded to include new members. Heike is moved from the Pasiphae group. Some of the unclassified  members  can  also  be  assigned  to  this  family; S2003J3/12/15/18,  S2010J2  & S2011J1.  The  Anake family  form  a  super-family  with  the  other  irregular satellites. Carme Irregular family: This family is also upheld and expanded.  It  is  expanded  to  confidently include S2003J5/9/10/19.  Possible  other  members  include Sinope, Callirrhoe and S2003J4/16. Pasiphae Irregular group:  This group is problematic. Pasiphae itself forms a small group with Megaclite and Aoede, but is separate from the others. There is another  group with Sponde,  Hegemone,  Cyllene,  Kore, Autone,  S2003J2/23,  S2010J1  and  S2011J2.  This groups is well supported, but does not contain a large type  member.  The other  large  member of  the group, Sinope,  could  possibly belong to  the  Carme family. This suggests that the Pasiphae group is the result of multiple interactions, with multiple originator objects. Origins: With the groups outlined, the multiple origins of the Jovian satellites can begin to be determined. Each family, except the Galileans,  is composed of a large,  type satellite. With the prograde Amalthea and Himalia families forming a sister group to the other irregular families, this would support  a different origin mechanism. Nebular drag theory has been proposed as this mechanism for the Himalia Family [19] and could explain the orbital mechanics of the Amalthea as well. It  has  been  theorized  that  the  irregular  satellites were captured  during planetary interactions,  involved with the jumping-Jupiter  model [20].  The progenerators of the families proposed would be consistent with this model. Further work: The composition of the small satellites is still theoretical. This leads to a bias towards orbital characteristics in analysis. This study and others [1,2] link them to larger type satellites that have known compositions. As technology improves, spectral imaging, using a large infra-red space telescope, such as the James Webb Space Telescope, may be undertaken on these smaller bodies. This would provide the missing compositional information and could help resolve several families. Using a similar cladistical technique, the type satellites of the families can be compared with other solar system bodies.  This would help resolve the origin of the  Jovian  satellites  and  relationships  between  solar system bodies. References: [1]Nesvorny,  D.  et  al.  (2003)  AJ,  126,  398-429. [2] Sheppard, S.
