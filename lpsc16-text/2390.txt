All four of these satellites are on near-circular orbits with low inclinations to the orbital plane of the inner binary [2]. Discovery and Exploration:  The brighter two of Pluto's small satellites, Nix and Hydra, were discovered in 2005 [3]. Subsequent observations discovered Kerberos in 2011 [4] and Styx in 2012 [5]. NASA's New Horizons spacecraft was launched to the Pluto system in January 2006 and arrived in July 2015 [1]. Nix and Hydra were included in the science targeting schedule uploaded to the spacecraft shortly after launch, but the late discovery of Styx and Kerberos only allowed limited imaging of those satellites. New Horizons flew closest to Nix, and on Nix's day side, allowing high quality imaging. The other three small satellites were on the far side of the system (see Figure 1), and were imaged at lower resolution. Extensive searches for additional satellites by New Horizons on approach to Pluto did not detect any new satellites [1]. Orbits and Stability:  The Pluto system is a uniquely complex dynamical hierarchy in the solar system. The small satellites orbit around the barycenter of the central Pluto-Charon binary and are strongly perturbed by Charon [2]. Orbits interior to the 2:1 Charon Mean Motion Resonance (MMR) are generally unstable [6], except for highly inclined orbits between Pluto and Charon [8]. The satellites orbit close to (but not perfectly at) the 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, and 6:1 Charon MMRs [2]. This very close packing and the strong perturbation by Charon severely limits where stable orbits lie between Styx and Hydra [7]. New Horizons performed a deep search for new satellites in the Pluto system, but none were detected [1]. Rotational Rates and Poles:  All four small satellites exhibited brightness variations in pre-flyby observations by the Hubble Space Telescope. This was interpreted by [9] to mean that they were rotating chaotically at a rate close to their orbital period. However, photometry taken by New Horizons on approach to Pluto showed that all four small satellites were rotating much faster than their orbital periods. In addition, all four rotational poles are significantly inclined to their respective orbital poles [10]. The poles of Styx and Kerberos are inclined 80-90° to their orbits. The pole of Nix is inclined 120-130° to its orbit. At this high inclination, Nix's rotation should be more perturbed by Charon than Styx or Kerberos, and this may be expressed in the variations seen in Nix's rotation period [11]. The pole of Hydra is harder to determine, as it was pointing towards the spacecraft at the time the highest resolution images were taken, however it can be constrained to within 90-120° of its orbital pole. Surfaces and Composition: The encounter face of Nix appears to show a cratered surface of mostly uniform composition. There is a large crater on the encounter face, ~15 km diameter [12]. Around this crater is a region that is "redder" (larger Blue/NIR ratio) than the surrounding terrain. This may be evidence of the crater excavating darker material from below, or of two compositionally distinct regions. A lowerresolution color image of Hydra showed it to be a uniform color similar to the light terrain on Nix. Numerous craters at the 1-2 km scale are apparent on both Nix and Hydra [12]. Crater retention ages > 4 Gyr are found for both Nix and Hydra. Relevance to the Proposed New Horizons Extended Mission:  In October and November 2015, New Horizons performed maneuvers to enable a proposed flyby of 2014 MU69 (formerly known as PT1). If NASA approves a New Horizons Extended Mission, this flyby would occur on January 1, 2019 [13]. 2014 MU69 is a cold classical Kuiper Belt object similar in size to the small satellites of Pluto (30-50 km across). If approved, New Horizons will perform a day-side flyby that will permit spatial resolutions similar to those achieved on Pluto. References: [1] Stern S.A. et al. (2015) Science, 350, 292-300.

The spacecraft trajectory crosses the Pluto-Charon plane from above the page and right to below the page and left and inclined at 43° to the plane. The flyby geometry favored observations of Nix and Styx, but Styx was discovered so late (2012) that only a single resolved observation could be scheduled.
