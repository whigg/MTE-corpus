PHOSPHATE RELEASE: THE EFFECT OF PREBIOTIC ORGANIC COMPOUNDS ON DISSOLUTION OF MARS-RELEVANT MINERALS  C. L. Bartlett1, E. M. Hausrath1, and C. T. Adcock1, 1Department of Geoscience, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, NV 89154, bartlc1@unlv.nevada.edu  Introduction:  Phosphate is essential for life: it is required to stabilize RNA, DNA as well as phospholipid membranes [1]. Phosphorus, either as phosphate or a more reduced form such as phosphite, may also have played an important role in prebiotic reactions [2,3]. Merrillite, Ca9NaMg(PO4)7, and chlorapatite, Ca5(PO4)3(Cl, F), are the dominant phosphate-bearing minerals found in martian meteorites. Whitlockite, Ca9.1Mg0.9(P1O3OH)(P1O4)6, is the terrestrial, hydrated version of merrillite and is potentially important on early Mars as well [4]. Phosphate availability for prebiotic reactions, or for use by organisms, largely results from mineral dissolution. Therefore, the study of how phosphate is released and what influences release rates is essential for interpreting potentially habitable martian environments.   Previous work has indicated that the availability of phosphate may have been greater on early Mars than early Earth [5]. However, that study examined dissolution of merrillite and chlorapatite in inorganic solutions and the environments relevant to potential early martian life likely contained abundant prebiotic organic compounds delivered to Mars by carbonaceous chondrites and interplanetary dust particles [6, 7].  These organic compounds may have aided the release, and therefore availability, of phosphate in early martian environments. Studies have shown that the presence of organic compounds can enhance phosphate release from fluorapatite and hydroxyapatite [8-10]. To the best of our knowledge, however, no previous studies have examined the effect of organic compounds on whitlockite, merrillite, or chlorapatite dissolution.   This study, therefore, aims to further knowledge of phosphate availability from mineral dissolution in the presence of prebiotic organic compounds, with implications for possible habitability of Mars.  Methods: Whitlockite was synthesized following [11] which modifies the method of [12], using  0.300 g of magnesium nitrate to 1.000 g of calcium hydroxyapatite in 90ml of deionized water. Through the addition of phosphoric acid the solution was acidified to a pH less than 2.8. The solution was then heated for 7 days at 240 °C. Merrillite was also synthesized following [12] by heating whitlockite for 24-48 hours at 1095 ºC. Chlorapatite was synthesized using a weight ratio of 6:7.5 hydroxyapatite to calcium chloride and heating to 1100 ºC for 24 hours [13-16]. Before use in dissolution experiments, merrillite, chlorapatite, and whitlockite were powdered using an agate mortar and pestle, sieved to the 38-75 µm size fraction, washed by sonicating in spectroscopic grade ethanol until the solution was clear, and dried for 24 hours.  The organic compounds used in this study were chosen based on the compounds documented in carbonaceous chondrites, as well as proposed degradation products in martian soils [17-19].  Five potential prebiotic organic compounds were chosen: acetic acid, succinic acid, methylsulfonic acid, oxalic acid, and benzenehexacarboxylic (mellitic) acid [1719, 20-21].  The sodium salt of each organic compound chosen was used for dissolution experiments. Each experiment consisted of dissolution of one mineral in the presence of one organic acid.  Each experiment was performed in duplicate, with an organic compound-containing blank, as well as a blank with no organic compound in solution.  Organic-containing dissolution experiments were compared to dissolution of the same mineral in organic-free solutions adjusted to the same starting pH.   Each dissolution experiment contained 0.150 g of merrillite, chlorapatite, or whitlockite placed in 180 mL of solution in 250 mL polypropylene bottles. Solutions consisted of a 0.01M solution of KNO3, with or without the organic compound of interest, adjusted to a pH of 5.5 and filter-sterilized. Batches were agitated at 100 rpm in a temperaturecontrolled shaking water bath at 25 ºC  Ten mL of solution was removed every hour for six hours the first day, and then  once per day for the following two days. Every sample removed was tested for pH as well as calcium and phosphate concentration. Calcium in solution was measured using atomic absorption (AA) spectrometry on a Thermo Scientific iCE 3000 Series AA after the addition of 0.36 M lanthanum chloride solution to 10% v/v to mitigate interference by phosphorus. Phosphorus was measured by the methyl blue/acetic acid method [22] using a Thermo Scientific Genesys 10S UV-Vis.   2754.pdf

Results and Discussion: Results of this study thus far indicate the enhanced release of phosphate from mineral surfaces in the presence of some prebiotic organic compounds (Figure 1). Three organic compounds (acetic acid, succinic acid, and methylsulfonic acid) have been run with whitlockite, merrillite, and chlorapatite. The presence of succinic acid and acetic acid enhanced the release of both calcium and phosphate from the surfaces of all three minerals. The presence of methylsulfonic acid, in contrast, has decreased calcium and phosphate release relative to release in organic-free solutions adjusted to the same starting pH.   Work to interpret these results, as well as finish the dissolution experiments of the remaining conditions, is ongoing.  Figure 1. Moles released calcium versus time from the calcium phosphate mineral whitlockite show enhanced release in the presence of solutions containing acetic acid and succinic acid relative to organic-free solutions at the same pH, and decreased release from solutions containing methylsulfonic acid. Error bars represent analytical uncertainty estimated at ten percent.   Conclusions: The results of this study will provide further understanding of phosphate availability from the dissolution of Mars-relevant minerals in the presence of prebiotic organic compounds.   A greater understanding of phosphate availability and mobility in the presence of organic compounds will help better  interpret the potential habitability of early martian environments.
