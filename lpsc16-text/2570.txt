Great number of sensors (camera, bio detector and magnetometer), an emitter-receiver unit and a power supply can be built into the small sized lander units. The essentially new aspect of this strategy is scattering a great number of these small sized lander units in different fields of targets. [1] MSSM & NPSDR: New devices in wide scale of shapes and sizes applicable to use for space missions, e.g.  reduced  MSSMs  (jet-carrier  analogue)  nearly cube decimetres, are to carry and distribute fleet of nano probes of NPSDRs as sensor ships. NPSDRs are different  shaped  according to  target  and  with wide spectrum of possible independent or more multiplied sensors - fleet of analytical sensor ships - and with reduced  smart  telecommunication systems. In  case  of MSSMs for  NPSDR sensor probes,  it  is  enough to communicate  with motherships,  which  gather,  pack and transmit the collected data towards to Earth. Figure  1 A  possible  realization  or  model  of  a nano-, or pico-lander. The sensors can be found in the prickle-like  cylinders  protruding  from  the  central sphere which have the support leg function also [2]., Figure 2  Mars Global Digital Dune (red) Database: MC-30. We propose the first use and landing these nano-pico units in the Southern Pole of Mars where dark dune fields, and seasonally can be found. [3]  It  comes  from the  small  size  that  great  number (some dozen) can be scattered from such a small mass measuring  units  from  the  space  probe  which  approaches the planetary surface  in a  10-50 kilometers heights. They can be dropped out in a package, which is  decelerated  by  a  parachute  braking  if  necessary. They can be packed and landed in a balloon, too. The collected data are emitted to the orbiting unit and transmit them to the Earth. We propose the first use and landing these nanopico units in the Southern Pole of Mars. Between the 60-90  degrees  latitude  there  are  a  great  number  of craters in which dark dune fields and seasonally DDSs occur. The dune fields included in this global database were  initially  located  using  Mars  Odyssey  Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) Infrared (IR) images [3]. We suggested about DDS that probably primitive surface bio forms exist in these spots. [4, 5, 6], that is why are they the primary objects to reveal by the nano-pico lander units. [1]. Meteorite like landing: The strength of meteorites is similar to that of artificially constructed nano-pico space probes. (That is the case  with  artillery  projectiles.)  Therefore  scattering these  small  nano-pico  instruments  do  not  need  extra strength of materials. Heat shielding is important, however, because the surface of the arriving meteorites frequently melts. The molten material forms a layer which is shaking, but - at the same time - droplets from this molten layer  split  off  and  carry the  heat  with itself. That is why the majority of falling meteorites do not heat up totally, in its cross section. The  technology  of  such  robots  is  the  following. During planning a package is constructed which will be thrown out at  a height of some kilometers above the surface. Majority of the falling nano-pico robots - after a heating up period - fall down on the surface and begins to work. Insulator layer is planned on the surface to have been come away during the heated period. During aero brake the lagging behind fragmentation catches the heat  and the remaining inner part  can be kept  in  cooler  temperature.  Additional  possibility comes from nanotechnology at bit of drills. Nano layer coatings at top of the bits are elongating their life eight times, and can insulate the inner important body from the high temperature. [7] NPSDRs  can  be  environmentally  friendly because of their  structure.  It  can contain only environmentally friendly resources as far as structure and content are concerned. Further  plans:  If  the  first  mission  is  successful then the Mars  Northern Polar  Regions should be  investigated during the space mission in the next launching window. Fig.3.
