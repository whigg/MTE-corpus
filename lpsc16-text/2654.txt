Introduction1:  The Lunar Polar Hydrogen Mapper (LunaH-Map) is a 6U CubeSat mission recently selected by NASA's Science Mission Directorate to fly as a secondary payload on the first launch of the Space Launch System (SLS). LunaH-Map will be led by Arizona State University, in collaboration with NASA centers, JPL, universities, and commercial space businesses. Data from LunaH-Map will reveal hydrogen (H) abundances at <10km spatial scales, by utilizing a pair of neutron spectrometers and by successfully maneuvering into lunar orbit to achieve over 140 lowaltitude South Pole fly-bys during its two month science phase. The two neutron spectrometers will be designed using a new scintillator material Cs2YLiCl6:Ce, or 'CLYC'. The detector system and electronics will be designed for LunaH-Map, but can be accommodated or modified to fit on any 6U (or greater) CubeSat platform. LunaH-Map will carry a propulsion system capable of low-thrust maneuvers that will achieve science orbit insertion within ~12 months of SLS separation. After cruise, the spacecraft will enter a highly elliptical orbit with low-altitude (510km) perilune centered on the lunar South Pole. Interplanetary CubeSats: The design of CubeSatsized spacecraft for acquiring scientific measurements is evolving quickly, but remains relatively new [1-3]. LunaH-Map will be one of the first interplanetary CubeSats to demonstrate the use of onboard propulsion for achieving orbit around another planetary body. Other engineering subsystems that are typical of larger spacecraft have been in development for some time and have already been tested or are now ready for use on small spacecraft [1-3].  Although resources (volume, power, mass, data) on CubeSat-sized spacecraft remain limited, neutron spectroscopy is one of the traditional planetary science instrument payloads ideally suited for a resourceconstrained mission [4]. CLYC can be fabricated into arrays to maximize surface area (200 cm2 total) and achieve statistically significant neutron count rates similar to previous missions [5]. Neutron spectrome                                                                    1 Part of this work was performed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. ters are also typically low power, and reasonably low mass with less restrictive pointing requirements than optical sensors. With on-board data processing, neutron count rates themselves can be stored and returned to Earth at low data volume.

Value to Planetary Science: Neutron data from LunaH-Map will be used to improve our understanding of the Moon's geologic history and constrain abundances of resources at the lunar South Pole for future missions. LunaH-Map responds to the 2014 NASA Science Plan, the Lunar Exploration Analysis Group's Strategic Knowledge Gaps, and the Planetary Decadal Survey goals [6-8]. LunaH-Map data may help place constraints on the contributions of H to the signal derived in the LPNS 45km and LEND 10km pixels. LunaH-Map will demonstrate that a significant scientific measurement can be achieved by a CubeSatsized spacecraft. While the mission focuses on longstanding lunar science questions, the Moon remains a reasonably well-studied planetary body when compared to many other objects in our solar system. Future CubeSat-sized missions could be included on larger missions to more distant planetary bodies where small, high-risk, high reward spacecraft could be utilized to enhance the primary mission's science goals. LunaHMap will scientifically demonstrate, through neutron spectroscopy and the determination of H abundance, one way in which these types of small spacecraft can be designed to obtain important planetary science data.  Mission Overview: Although design of the spacecraft is critical, here we focus on the instrument and mission/trajectory design as these elements combine to determine our sensitivities to lunar H abundances. Instrument. LunaH-Map (Fig. 1A) will use two uncollimated neutron spectrometers, a standard in planetary science, to map the distribution of H at a spatial scale equal to approximately 1 ½ times the orbital altitude [9]. The CLYC detector arrays will be ~2cm thick and 100cm2 each. A preliminary design of the neutron spectrometer is shown in Fig. 1B. For thermal and epithermal neutrons, CLYC has efficiencies similar to the LPNS 3He detector tubes. The instrument will discriminate between thermal and epithermal neutrons using a Cadmium (Cd) shield on one detector be sensitive to both H abundance and the depth distribution of H. Data can be acquired continuously or on an operational cadence, at both high and low altitudes with neutron counts saved every 3 ½ seconds (time to pass over a 7.5km pixel at perilune). Data will be acquired in cruise for background measurements and calibration, while higher altitude equatorial data will be used to characterize instrument response to "dry" lunar regolith (C0) [10-11]. Trajectory. The preliminary design of the LunaHMap science phase is shown in Fig. 3. The high spatial resolution of LunaH-Map is achieved by a unique orbital navigation solution that places the spacecraft into a stable, highly elliptical orbit with perilune directly over the South Pole (-89.9°S). The mission architecture, designed by KinetX and NASA Ames, allows for a 60-day science mission with perilune centered on Shackleton Crater at 5km altitude. There is sufficient fuel for 141 science orbits, covering many portions of many permanently shadowed craters (PSRs) and craters identified as high priority science targets [12]. At the end of the science phase, after the critical science data have been transmitted back to Earth and fuel reserves have been spent, LunaH-Map will deorbit and crash into a permanently shadowed crater at the lunar South Pole.  Sensitivities. For typical lunar South Pole H abundances of ~100 ppm, LunaH-Map's CLYC detectors will measure H with a maximum precision of ~20 ppm within PSRs, and will be able to resolve elevated H abundances within portions of crater floors (~7.5 km/pixel). H sensitivities near perlune will be greatest, and are shown in Fig. 2 for a spatial scale of 7.5 km/pixel. Over the course of the mission, LunaH-Map will make several flyovers of South Pole craters including Cabeus, Haworth, Shoemaker, Faustini, Shackleton, de Gerlache, Amundsen, and Sverdrup. Measurement precision will vary by crater and coverage, but just one pass will be sufficient to map any significant increases in H abundance (>0.2 wt.%) within these, and other PSRs at spatial scales of <10 km.
