RIPPLE ORIENTATIONS AS INDICATORS OF RECENT SURFACE WINDS ON MARTIAN SAND DUNES.  J. R. Zimbelman1 and M. B.

Introduction:  Sand dunes on both Earth and Mars have been shown to preserve the most recent wind patterns in their ripple formations [1-3]. This investigation, supported by NASA MDAP grant NN12AJ38G [4], summarizes documentation of wind ripples on Martian dunes from across Mars in order to assess recent surface wind flows. This information will provide insight into the modes of dune formation and ripple morphology at the study sites, and offer new constraints for global or regional circulation models. Background:  Movement of Martian sand ripples was first observed by the Spirit rover [5] but ripples now can be studied using images from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera [6, 7]. This instrument provides unprecedented views of Mars, including sand dunes in diverse areas, with resolution as high as 25 cm/pixel [6]. This includes dunes with complex structures and crest positions which may have been created by multiple wind directions or seasonal wind variations. Being unable to choose between multiple possible regimes leaves some dune morphologies open to interpretation. However, dune crests and ripples mapped by Neilson and Kocurek [1] show that the ripple patterns are a good indicator of recent surface wind flow which modifies the principle crests. This same ripple mapping technique now can be used to document recent wind flow patterns on Mars. Because wind speeds have yet to be measured directly in most areas, we must rely on high resolution images and ripple-scale patterns for recent wind information. Methodology:  The Martian study sites used in this investigation were selected to have clear HiRISE images of ripples on sand dunes, and be able to represent diverse locations across the surface as determined primarily by their latitude and longitude. Frames with stereo pairs were preferred when available because of the ability to create digital terrain models (DTMs) of the sites using photogrammetry software such as SOCET SET. The resulting 40 study sites and their corresponding HiRISE images are listed in Table 1, and their global distribution illustrated in Figure 1. The ripple documentation method at the first 7 sites used the Java Mission-planning and Analysis for Remote Sensing (JMARS) geospatial information system (GIS) while the remaining images were studied using ESRI’s Arc GIS. In both systems, lines were drawn perpendicular to ripple crests across three adjacent ripples in order to document ripple wavelength from line length   Table 1.

It is not possible to infer a unique wind direction from ripple orientation alone and therefore the inferred directions have a 180 degree ambiguity [8]. For example, a crest with North-South alignment may have been constructed by an Easterly, Westerly, or bi-directional wind. Due to this ambiguity, results obtained during this study will assume azimuths to be between 0 and 180 degrees. Actual orientations may be defined after further study by using additional information about dune morphology [3], such as well-known dune types and the rule of maximum gross bedform-normal transport [9]. Ripples in each study site are then categorized by the cardinal wind direction they suggest and percentages of each inferred direction are calculated. Percentages of wavelength values are also displayed in order to look for possible regional or global patterns. At sites with existing DTMs, inferred wind direction can be compared to the slope magnitude on which the ripple formed [10]. The slope information allowed us to evaluate how great the effect of slope may be on deflecting ripple orientation on Martian dunes [10], using the results first described for sand dunes on Earth by Howard [11].  Terra Sirenum Example:  One site explored during this study is in Terra Sirenum (HiRISE frame ESP_023928_1205, site 12 in Table 1), where 333 ripples were recorded using lines perpendicular to the ripple crests. In this area, about 1% of measurements suggest an ESE-WNW wind, 36% suggest SE-NW, 38% suggest SSE-NNW, 24% suggest S-N, and the remaining 1% suggest SSW-NNE. This distribution shows that the wind was primarily in a SSE-NNW with additional ripple orientations distributed around this direction. Ripple wavelength ranged from 2 to 4 meters, where 3-4 m represents the majority of  measurements in the ESE and SE while 2-3 m comprise the majority of SSE, S, and SSW measurements. It is unclear if any strong relationship exists between ripple orientation and wavelength. The slope distribution on the dunes at this site indicates that very few (<5%) of the ripple measurements were obtained on slopes >15°. However, these few measurements fell into two of the larger orientation categories (SSE-NNW and S-N), so that any possible effect on the overall distribution should be minimized. One small dune at this site examined in detail shows that while the angle between the direction of inferred wind and direction of maximum slope ranges between 13 and 87 degrees, the ripples show a NW-SE wind over the majority of the dune, with only minimal variation at the base of the eastern side where form flow effects may have occurred [8]. These results confirm that slope does not seem to have a large affect on ripple orientation and deflection, as long as areas on or next to slip faces are avoided [10].  Results: The Martian surface displays an abundance of sand dunes in many different areas [e.g., 12], and the ripple patterns visible on some dunes provide a new tool for gaining insight into the most recent sandmoving winds [2, 3]. The complexity of documented ripple patterns varies from uniform directionality across hundreds of kilometers to areas with varying patterns on a single dune, plus overlapping ripple patterns at many locations (but such areas were not included in the present study). These patterns suggest the possiblity of regional variations between single and multiple dominant winds, perhaps including a diurnal or seasonal change in the wind direction. Individual study sites suggest that there may be a relationship between ripple wavelength and azimuth, although more study is needed to evaluate how rigorous any relationship may be. Finally, surface slope angle on the dunes does not have a significant effect on the deflection of ripple orientation with respect to the formational wind as long as areas adjacent to slip faces are avoided.
