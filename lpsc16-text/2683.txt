Burr3 1Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, JohnsHopkins University (xyu33@jhu.edu); 2Applied Physics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University; 3Department of Earthand Planetary Sciences, University of TennesseeIntroduction: Aeolian processes are found on manyplanetary bodies in the Solar System, including Earth,Venus, Mars, Saturn's moon Titan, Triton, Pluto andthe comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko [1]. Both Earthand planetary wind tunnels serve as an effective way tosimulate aeolian processes under different planetary parameters, with the robustness of results dependent uponthe degree of control of experimental conditions andunderstanding of the experimental materials [2]. Thethreshold wind speed needed to initiate saltation is one ofthese processes that may be investigated experimentally.For example, recent Titan Wind Tunnel (TWT) resultsshow a 50% higher than previously predicted thresholdwind speed that is likely caused by the high atmosphericdensity (5.1 kg/m3) over particle density (radar dark,organics, 400-1500 kg/m3) ratio on Titan compared toEarth (1.2 kg/m3 over 2650 kg/m3 of typical sand) [3].The threshold wind speed is determined by the balance of gravity, the aerodynamic force, the drag force,and interparticle forces. On Earth, water is relativelyabundant and interparticle forces are dominated by cohesion between adsorbed water molecules adsorbed on thesurfaces of particles [4]. In contrast, on planetary bodieslike Titan, Venus, Mars, and comet 67P, water is low inabundance such that interparticle forces are likely dominated by electrostatic forces (see discussion in [3]), orpotentially cohesion between other liquids such as C2H6on Titan [5]. Because wind tunnel materials are not commonly dessicated and generally conducted within an atmosphere with some amount of humidity, assessing thecontribution of adsorbed water to interparticle force provide a more precise translation of experimental threshold results to planetary environments in which water islargely absent. Toward that end, here we examine the water content and equilibration timescales of some common(and uncommon) wind tunnel materials. This examination is a necessary first step in understanding the effect ofwater adsorption on threshold wind speed. These materials have been used to simulate saltation on Earth,Titan,Mars and Venus [1, 2, 3] and our results are thereforebroadly applicable to a range of planetary conditions.Prior studies have investigated the effect of watercontent on threshold wind speed for sand. [6] showedthat water content from 0.1% to 0.2% results in a 10% increase in threshold for typical 400 µm sand particles, and[2] suggested that threshold doubled with 0.3%-0.6%moisture in typical quartz sand compared to dry sand.However, similar data are missing for low density materials, which are needed to simulate the weight of sandon Titan. Here, we extend that prior work to low densitymaterials. Based on this previous work, our hypothesisis that threshold increases by up to 100% under humidconditions. Low density materials are used in the TWTto simulate the lower gravity on Titan (9.8 m/s2 on earthversus 1.4 m/s2 on Titan) and the low density of the Titansand, inferred to be composed of organics [7]. These lowdensity materials include sieved walnut shells (density1100 kg/m2) and gas chromatography packing materials (GC). The water content and equilibration timescalesof these low density materials have not been previouslymeasured and are the focus of this study. We also measured basalt, quartz sand, and beach sand for comparison.Methods and Initial Results: Table 1 summarizesthe materials investigated in this work. With the exception of activated charcoal, iced tea, and instant coffee, thematerials used came from the batches in use at the TWT[1, 3]. Given the absence of water on Titan, activatedcharcoal was included as a non-polar weakly interactionmaterial. Iced tea and instant coffee were included asadditional low density materials.Material Density Size Range(kg/m3) (µm)Basalt 3000 150-1000 (3*)Quartz Sand 2650 106-250 (5)Beach Sand 2650 500-1000 (4)Walnut Shells 1100 125-1000 (6)Activated Charcoal 400 400-841 (1)GC 350 37-175Iced Tea 100-200 N/AInstant Coffee 100-200 N/ATable 1: Summary of material properties. * indicates thenumber of size bins.We determined the water content of the materialsthrough gravimetric measurement.

After drying, they were removed from the ovenand immediately weighed again (mdry). The water content is then given by:u(%) =mwet −mdrymdry× 100% (1)2683.pdf

Figure 1: Plot of water content as a function of time,beginning with dehydrated materials. Walnut shells takelonger to equilibrate with the atmosphere and achieve amuch higher water content.We also investigated the time required for the material toequilibrate with the ambient atmosphere by continuing tomeasure the weight (and relative humidity) as a functionof time. Figure 1 shows the typical increase in watercontent as a function of time for quartz sand and walnutshells due to water adsorption. The difference in wateradsorption between the two materials is dramatic, withwalnut shells taking more than 6 hours to equilibrate andacquire over 5% of water content (at only 20±3% RH),while quartz sand equilibrated in less than half an hourand acquired only 0.05-0.1% water.Figure 2 summarizes the equilibrium water contentfor all of the materials we investigated. The materials exhibit a range of water content from ∼0.05% to∼10.5%. The low equilibrium water content materials include quartz sand, beach sand, and basalt, whilehigh equilibrium water content materials include walnutshells, instant coffee, iced tea, GC and activated charcoal.The low equilibrium water content materials are generally both water insoluble and with low porosity. Materials with high equilibrium water content are either porous(walnut shells and activated charcoal), hydrophilic (walnut shells) or soluble (iced tea and instant coffee). Asshown in Figure 2, equilibrium water content does notshow any strong dependence on size.The equilibrium water content varies with relativehumidity. Equilibrium water content varies approximately linearly with relative humidity, with R2 valuesover 0.8, for RH range of 15% to 60%.Discussion and Future Work: The equilibrium water content of terrestrial soil under ambient conditions is0.2-0.6% and the equilibrium wetting time is 10-50 minFigure 2: Equilibrium water content of various materialsand sizes at RH=58.5±3%.utes [8]. However, for the wind tunnel materials usedhere, especially the low density walnut shells, the equilibrium water content is much higher (5% at RH=20%)and equilibrium timescales are much longer (over 6 hrs).Threshold wind speed is affected by the surface waterrather than the total water content of the materials. Thorough evaluation of the materials therefore requires separation of surface and internal water content to fully understand the effect on threshold velocity. Thermogravimetric analysis could be useful, since surface water released at a lower temperature than internal water. Thesemeasurements are currently in progress.The particularly long equilibration timescale of walnut shells could be used to estimate the effect of moisturecontent on threshold because it enables walnut shells tobe dried and used in a TWT run before they have hadtime fully equilibrate. Comparison of "wet" and "dry"wind tunnel runs would provide insight into the effect ofcohesion on threshold wind speeds. This will allow us tobetter assess the interparticle force from adsorbed waterand thereby better apply the results to future TWT experiments and other planetary conditions.References: [1] D.M.
