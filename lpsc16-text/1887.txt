The rock typesaround Mohar comprise Archean to Paleoproterozoicrocks dominated by Bundelkhand Granitoids with enclaves of older metasedimentary-metavolcanic supracrustals, unconformably overlain by the sediments ofMeso- to Neo-Proterozoic Vindhyan Supergroup. Themodel of meteoritic impact as a cause for the formationof this megastructure, was founded on the basis ofpresence of diagnostic shock metamorphic features inthe clasts of melt breccia that crops out sparsely in thenorth western part [1,2] and extensively in subsurface[3]. The present work reports,  petrological evidencesof rare carbonate-silicate melt immiscibility in a largelyfelsic melt breccia derived by the impact melting of thetarget granite. This feature is observed in subsurfacesamples from boreholes, located near the south easternflank of the structure.Methodology: The methodology involves detailedpetrological study of polished thin sections of surfaceand  subsurface samples drawn from 76 boreholes.This is followed by Micro-Raman Spectroscopy usingSTR-300 Micro-Raman spectrometer (SEKITechnotron, Japan at Wadia Institute of HimalayanGeology, Dehradun, India) and Horiba JY HR LabRam laser Micro Raman spectrometer (at BARC,Mumbai), on thin sections (without cover slip) andScanning Electron Microscopy (Zeiss Auriga FE SEM)and X-ray imaging (EDS-Oxford Instrument X-MaxN).Results: It has been petrologically observed that aminor phase of carbonate melt co-exists with the dominant felsic phase, in the melt breccia, that contains telltale signatures of shock metamorphism, viz., Ballenquartz, Planar Deformation Features (PDF) in quartz,toasted, diaplectic and ladder textured feldspar andkink-banded biotite/chlorite. The minor carbonate meltis in the form of  oval to ameboid, often bulbous to‘budding-out’ globules (which appear to float, squeezeand align along the flow of the glassy to microcrystalline felsic groundmass (Fig.1). They vary in size from<50 µm to approximately 500 µm across. The globulescontain crystalline/sparry grains of carbonate that under the microscope appear colorless, exhibit twinklingeffect and characteristic cleavage under one Nicol condition and high order interference color with faint traces of twin planes under crossed Nicol condition. Atplaces, the carbonate shows fluidal texture under highmagnification, entraining microvesicles within it. Themeniscus of the carbonate globules against the red felsic groundmass, is sharp, indicating contrast in composition and suggesting primary growth as droplets in amolten state.Fig.1.

Light, 1N, air,bar=200 µmThe carbonate globule and the red felsic groundmass have been subjected to Micro-Raman Spectroscopy. The obtained Raman spectra of the carbonateglobule matches with standard carbonate with peaks onthe lesser side of 300 cm-1, 1100 cm-1 and slightly >700cm-1. The spectra obtained for the felsic groundmass(Fig.2) shows distinct peaks at around 289cm-1,407cm-1 and 511cm-1, with additional peaks at around1319cm-1 and 1567 cm-1 and several minor peaks occurat around 223 cm-1, 243 cm-1, 480 cm-1, 540 cm-1 and605cm-1, implying aberration from the characteristicpeaks of standard K-feldspar in all the three Regionsdescribed by [4].0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 20001566.94605.06540.43510.88479.98152.71406.86242.71223.331319.38289..43Raman Shift (cm-1)Intensity (a.u.)Fig.2.

like once-dynamic melt droplets within a fine, felsicgroundmass (Fig.3). X-ray imaging was carried out forselected major (Si, Al, Mg, Fe, Ca, K) and trace elements (Rb, Ba, Sr), which established the compositionof majority of the carbonate  globules as  Ca-rich andMg- Fe- and Sr poor (calcitic), with a few globulesbeing rich in Mg, Fe and deficient in Ca, Sr (dolomitic). The composition of the felsic groundmass is K-,Si-, Al-, Rb-, Sr-rich and Ba-poor, which qualitativelyindicates co-presence of K-feldspathic composition.The carbonate-silicate contact is often marked by somechanges in oxygen content (Fig.4).Fig.3.

X-ray image showing oxygen (bright) distribution (O Kα1) around melt globules.Conclusion: Ca-rich carbonatitic melt is extremelyuncommon in near-surface condition and is generallyconsidered to be mantle derived. It is now recognizedto form in near-surface condition by impact melting at>40GPa where it occurs as immiscible phases intermingled with silicate melt in Ries crater, Germany,Chixulub crater, Mexico, Azuara impact structure,Spain, Martian meteorite ALH84001, Haughton structure, Canada [5,6,7,8]. In a target terrane dominated bygranite crystalline that contributed to a large amount ofgranite melt, the small portion of carbonate melt is possibly derived by the melting of precursor calcsilicatesupracrustals occurring as mappable enclaves and relicts within the granite in the western part of the structure. In perspective of this, and also the fact thatcaught-up fragments of carbonate are observed in subsurface melt rock samples from neighbouring boreholes, it appears that concomitant impact melting ofboth granite and minor calcsilicate supracrustal enclaves took place at Mohar, producing a minisculeamount of calcium-rich (with minor Mg-rich) insitucarbonate melt in near-surface condition, corroboratingthe processs of impact.Acknowledgement: The authors are grateful to theDirectors of AMD and BARC for according permission to publish this communication.References: [1] Pati, J.K. 2005, MAPS 40 A121.[2] Pati, J.K. et al.2008, MAPS 43, 1383-1398.
