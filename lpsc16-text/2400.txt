Introduction: Lunar basalts are eruption products  from the inner mantle region, thus its chemical compositions, volume, stratigraphy are key indicatores for our understanding of the mantle evolutions. Chang'e-3 (CE-3) lander and Yutu rover landed on the young Eratosthenian lava plain of north Imbrium (340.49°E, 44.12°N) in December, 2013 (Fig. 1). In situ measurements from APXS (Active Particle-induced X-ray Spectrometer) and VNIS (Visible and Near-infrared Imaging Spectrometer) on board Yutu rover both suggest a high level of Fe-rich olivine and clinopyroxene abundances of this region, provding first ground truth in some forty years after Apollo and Luna missions [1].    Fig. 1 The landing site of CE-3  With more accurate compositional and mineralogical information of this young basaltic unit (as shown in Fig. 1, I22, 2.96 Ga) at hand, unanswered questions still exists referring to the exact volume (or thickness) of this late-stage volcanic eruptions. Previous stduies of the thickness of lava flows are mainly based on optical images or orbital radar measurements [e.g. Hiesinger et al., 2003[2]].Here, we try to determine the thickness of the Eratosthenian layer around the Chang'e-3 landing site with mineral constratins. Using hyperspectral imaging data from Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) aided by the in-situ measurrments by Yutu rover, we aim to detect the variations of mineral abundances from different sized fresh craters. Radiative transfer modeling of the M3 spectral data employed in this study can yield mineral chemistries and proportions of the stdudied area, thus provide insights for the boundaries of basatic units. Data and Methods:  CE-3 landed on near the boundary of the high-Ti Eratosthenian basaltic unit (~2.96 Ga, [3]) and the northern low-Ti unit (~3.5 Ga, [3]). The younger unit is suggested to be enriched in olivine comparing to the older unit from remote sensing study [4]. Ten small fresh craters near the CE-3 landing site are selected from an M3 (Moon Mineralogy Mapper) image based on their brightness on the RGB false color map (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). The spectra of each crater is extracted by a 1x1 box. These spectra are then smoothed by Savitzky-Golay method. In order to derive the mineral abundances of these craters, we build a spectral library based on radiative transfer modeling [5-8]. Olivine, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, ilmenite and plagioclase are modeled from 0-100% at intervals of 5%. APXS and VNIS data proved the landing region of CE-3 is highly enriched in FeO and the olivine is tended to be ferroan, so the Mg' is set to vary from 30 to 60 at 10 intervals. In addition, nano-phase Fe0 is also included in this model to compensate for the space weathering effect. It is added from 0 to 0.5% at 0.05% intervals.

 Fig. 3 The M3 spectra of ten selected craters.  Results and Disscussions:  Ten spectra are matched with the spectral library by minimum RMS value. The diameter of the craters are measured from the narrow angle camera image (1.5 m/pixel) of LROC. The variation of olivine and ilmenite abundances with dimeters is plotted in Fig. 4. It can be detected that olivine only exists in craters with dimeter less than 600 m, which might suggest the upper limit of the Eratosthenian basalt layer thickness is ~ 50 m based on the crater dimeter-depth relation [9] . For craters with dimeter less than 400 m, olivine and ilmenite abundances decrease with crater dimeter, which might indicate the basalt in this unit may have undergone a differentiation process. As a result, the lower limit of the Eratosthenian basalt thickness is about 33.6 m.  The thickness of the Eratosthenian basalt near the landing region of CE-3 ranges from 33.6 m to 50 m, comparing to 35 m derived by Lunar Penetrating Radar (LPR) on board Yutu rover [10], 30-35 m from Schaber et al. [11] and 32-50 m from Hiesinger et al.[12].    Fig. 4 The variation of olivine and ilmenite abundances with crater dimenters.  Conclusions and Future Work:  We present spectral analysis of mineral varations among different sized fresh craters near Chang'E-3 landing site, with intent to constrain the thickness of this young lava flows. Our preminary results suggest the thickness varies between 33.6 and 50 m. Future work will extend the number of small craters for spectral analysis in order to draw the whole picture of young lava flows at Chang'E-3 landing site.
