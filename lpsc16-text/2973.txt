Introduction: The thermal history of the H chondrite body is still a matter of debate. Some prior studies have proposed an onion-shell model for the H chondrite parent body (e.g., [1]). In this model, the decay of short-lived radionuclides (e.g., 26Al), internally heated and metamorphosed the H chondrite parent body. The degree of thermal metamorphism increased from H3-6 due to increasing depth within the parent body. The 182Hf-182W isotopic system (t1⁄2 = 8.9 Ma) can be used to constrain the timing of early Solar System metal-silicate equilibration because Hf is strongly lithophile, whereas W is moderately siderophile.  This system has typically been used to constrain the timing of planetary accretion and core segregation [e.g., 2], but it can also be used as a thermochronometer to constrain the cooling of metal-silicate systems after metamorphic heating [3]. The H chondrites experienced a large range of thermal-metamorphic conditions [4]. Determining isotopic closure ages of H chondrites of different metamorphic grades, using different radiogenic isotope systems with a range of closure temperatures can, therefore, be used to constrain the thermal history of the parent body. Metal grains in H chondrites occur as irregular grains smaller than 0.1 mm2, large metal nodules [5], veins [6], and small metal grains within chondrules [7].  Prior studies have reported that large metal nodules of some H chondrites have different siderophile element abundances (HSE) than fine-grained metal grains [8,9], which suggests that fine- and coarse-grain metal may have formed by different processes. It was reported by [3] that 182W/184W may increase slightly with metamorphic grade, suggesting an inverse correlation between petrologic type and cooling rates, which is most consistent with an onion-shell model for the structure of the H chondrite parent body.  However, the reported 182W/184W of individual H chondrite metal fractions were generally indistinguishable within analytical uncertainties of typically greater than ±15 μ182W unit 2SD uncertainties reported for individual metal measurements (where μ182W is the isotopic deviation in parts per million of 182W/184W from a terrestrial standard).  The study, therefore, relied on linear regressions of data for metals and silicates to constrain initial 182W/184W for the bulk rock. This approach, however, did not resolve variations in 182W/184W among different sized metal fractions, which do not necessarily record the same thermal history. Here we present high-precision (±4.5 ppm 2SD external precision) 182W isotopic compositions and HSE abundances for metal fractions from H4, H5, and H6 chondrites. The primary goal of the study is to assess the thermal history of the H chondrite parent body. Further, we consider whether different metal size fractions record different closure ages in these rocks.  Finally, we explore evidence for nucleosynthetic variation with 183W in H chondrite metal grains. Methods: Chondrite metal was separated and refined in a procedure described by [12]. Tungsten was purified using cation and anion exchange chromatography [13]. Purified W was analyzed by negative thermal ionization on the the UMd Thermo-Fisher Triton using Faraday cup collectors, with the oxide correction method of [13] for Faucett and Richardton, and a recently developed method [14] for Avanhandava and Oakley (stone). The new oxide correction method allows measurement of 183W/184W to an external precision of ±4 ppm, however the  two samples analyzed here had internal 2SE of ~±8 ppm. The HSE abundances of separate aliquots of chondrite metal were determined by isotope dilution using procedures described by [15], and references therein. Results:  The 182W/184W isotopic compositions of the >150 μm metal separates from H4 (Avandhandava and Faucett) and H5 (Richardton) chondrites are indistinguishable within uncertainties (Fig. 1). The Faucett (H4) >150 μm metal separate has the lowest μ182W of  -313±5, which corresponds to a relative model age after CAI formation (ΔtCAI) of 3.29±0.47 Myr. By contrast, the <150 μm metal separate from Oakley (H6) has the highest μ182W of -284±7, corresponding to a ΔtCAI of 6.74±0.91 Myr. The 182W/184W isotopic compositions of two metal fractions from Faucett (H4) are resolved from one another, within uncertainties (Fig. 1).  The μ182W for the >150 μm metal fraction and <150 μm metal fraction of -313±5 and -299±5, respectively, correspond to ΔtCAI of 3.29±0.47 Myr and 4.86±0.53 Myr, respectively. The 183W/184W isotopic compositions of Avanhandava (H4; >150 μm) and Oakley (H6; <150 μm) metal fractions overlap, but are well resolved from the terrestrial standards (Fig. 2), with μ183W values of -12.5±8 and     -14.6±8, respectively. The HSE abundances of <150 μm metal are higher than those of  >150 μm metal (Fig. 3), but there is no correlation between metamorphic grade and HSE abundance.  2973.pdf

Discussion: The Hf-W closure ages of H chondrite metals inversely correlate with metamorphic grade, with the oldest ages for H4 and H5 chondrites (ΔtCAI =3.29±0.47), and the youngest age (ΔtCAI=6.74±0.91 Myr) for an H6 chondrite (Fig. 1).  This observation is generally consistent with an onion-shell model, with the most metamorphosed H6 chondrites cooling to HfW closure temperatures significantly later than the less metamorphosed H4 and H5 chondrites. The overlapping closure ages and uncertainties of the >150 μm metal fractions from H4 and H5 chondrites indicate that the maximum Δt for Hf-W closure between H4 and H5 >150 μm metal was 1.6 Myr. The <150 μm metal fraction of Faucett has a 182W/184W that is ~15 ppm higher than the >150 μm metal fraction. The higher 182W/184W of the finergrained <150 μm metal fraction is consistent with greater rates of diffusion of radiogenic W into the interior lattice of the finer-grained fraction during thermal metamorphism, because of the higher surface area/volume.  This model is consistent with the higher HSE abundances of fine-grained metal (Fig. 3). Thus, fine-grained metal may be a more sensitive thermochronometer, and date later metamorphism. Finally, it is possible that genetic differences in the fine- and coarse-grained metal can account for the difference in 182W/184W. A prior study [17] argued that large metal nodules in H chondrites formed by impact vaporization followed by fractional condensation.  In addition, the systematically different HSE abundances between >150 μm and <150 μm metal could potentially reflect genetic differences. Prior studies have reported nucleosynthetic W anomalies in early Solar System materials, including IVB iron meteorites [10] and calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions [11]. Nucleosynthetic anomalies are typically interpreted to result from the incorporation of diverse presolar materials that were inherited from multiple stellar sources and incompletely mixed in the early Solar System. Such anomalies can be used to establish genetic links among planetary materials. The 183W/184W isotopic anomalies of H chondrites Avanhandava (H4) and Oakley (H6) are most likely caused by nucleosynthetic effects, as cosmogenic and radiogenic effects can only substantially affect 182W.  The negative 183W/184W anomalies are consistent with either a nucleosynthetic s-process excess or an rprocess deficit. Figure 1. μ182W of H4-6 metal separates.
