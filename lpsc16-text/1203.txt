Introduction: The peripheral parts of Ca,Al-rich inclusions (CAIs) could have preserved the isotopic and chemical records of the latest heating event they experienced. Most CAIs are surrounded by single- or multilayered rims composed of spinel, hibonite, perovskite, melilite, anorthite, Al,Ti-diopside, and forsterite. These rims, described first by [1], are called Wark-Lovering (WL) rims. Based on the detailed mineralogical and isotopic studies of WL rims around CV CAIs, it is inferred that they formed by multistage evaporation, condensation, melting, and thermal annealing in the protoplanetary disk [2‒11]. Complex O-isotope heterogeneity of the CV CAIs and their WL rims, with melilite, perovskite, and anorthite often being 16O-depleted relative to spinel, hibonite, Al,Ti-diopside, and forsterite, has been interpreted as evidence for transport of CAIs between the solar-like (16O-rich) and planetary-like (16O-poor) nebular reservoirs multiple times [e.g., 5]. However, since all CVs experienced fluid-assisted thermal metamorphism on their parent asteroid [12], a postcrystallization O-isotope exchange in CV WL rims during fluidrock interaction cannot be excluded [2,4,8]. This is consistent with the observations that CAIs and their WL rims in CO3.0, CM2, and CR3.0 chondrites are uniformly 16O-rich [13,14]. Here we describe the mineralogy, petrology and O-isotope compositions of hightemperature rims (not all of them are WL rims) around CAIs from CR, CH, and CB chondrites.  Primordial Wark-Lovering rims: In CR chondrites, most CAIs are surrounded by high-temperature rims; the only exception are rim-free relict CAIs inside chondrules. A complete multi-layered rim sequence (spinel+hibonite+perovskite  melilite replaced to a various degree by anorthite  Al-diopside  forsterite) is rarely observed (Fig. 1a); Al-diopside±forsterite rims are more common. In CH chondrites, most CAIs are surrounded by high-temperature rims mineralogically similar to those in CR chondrites (Fig. 1b); however, rim anorthite is rare. The CR and CH CAIs and their rims are uniformly 16O-rich with a 17O value of ~ −24‰, with an exception of one CAI, MB4-1-5, having 17O of ~ −35‰ (Fig. 2), indicating formation in an 16O-rich gaseous reservoir with variable 16O-enrichment. Based on the mineralogy, petrology and uniform O-isotope compositions, we infer that these rims formed by evaporation, condensation, melting, and thermal annealing in the host CAIs-forming region. We define such rims as primordial WL rims. The CAIs surrounded by the primordial WL rims show large variations in the initial 26Al/27Al ratios (~510‒5 to <510‒6), suggesting that the 16O-rich gaseous reservoir in the CAI-forming region existed during addition and homogenization of 26Al in the disk [15].  WL rims melted during chondrule formation: Some uniformly 16O-rich CR and CH CAIs are surrounded by Al-diopside rims that are 16O-depleted to various degrees (17O ~ −10 to ~ +2‰). These rims are typically compact, often intergrown with m-sized ferromagnesian olivine and low-Ca pyroxene grains, and contain inclusions of Fe,Ni-metal nodules. We infer that these rims resulted from incomplete melting and Oisotope exchange of the primordial WL rims during brief heating events in an 16O-poor gaseous reservoir, most likely during formation of porphyritic chondrules.  Igneous rims formed in an impact-generated plume: All CB CAIs and about 10% of CH CAIs are surrounded by single- or double-layered igneous rims composed of ±melilite+Al,Ti-diopside+Ca-rich forsterite (Figs. 1c,d). Host CAIs have diverse mineralogies (grossite-rich, hibonite-rich, melilite-rich, spinel-rich, and Aldiopside-rich) and appear to be igneous. These CAIs and their rims are uniformly 16O-depleted (17O range from ‒10 to ‒5‰; Fig. 2b), indicating their formation in an isotopically distinct, 16O-poor gaseous reservoir. We suggest that (i) this reservoir is related to an impactgenerated plume of gas and melt invoked for the origin of magnesian non-porphyritic chondrules in CB and CH chondrites [16, 17], and (ii) the 16O-poor igneous CAIs and rims could have resulted from melting of the originally 16O-rich CAIs in the impact plume (17O ~ ‒2‰) followed by gas-melt O-isotope exchange, condensation of SiO and Mg into the CAI melts, and crystallization.  In conclusion, the CAI rims in CR, CH, and CB chondrites recorded high-temperature processing in gaseous reservoirs with different O-isotope compositions ‒ 16O-rich CAI-forming and 16O-poor chondrule-forming regions. In contrast to CAIs surrounded by isotopically heterogeneous WL rims around CV CAIs, our data provide no evidence that CAIs in CR, CH and CB chondrites were transported between the 16O-rich and 16Opoor gaseous reservoirs multiple times.

The uniformly 16O-rich CR and CH CAIs are surrounded by primordial Wark-Lovering rims originated in the CAI-forming regions. The only exception is CAI n3-3 surrounded by an isotopically heterogeneous WL rim that experienced incomplete melting and O-isotope exchange in an 16O-poor gaseous reservoir, probably during formation of porphyritic chondrules. Two igneous CH CAIs, UH1-1 and n113, are uniformly 16O-depleted and surrounded by 16O-depleted multilayered igneous rims. These CAIs and their rims formedas a result of melting and gas-melt interaction in an impact generated plume invoked for the origin of CB and CH magnesian non-porphyritic chondrules. c = core; r = rim. ^CAIs with (26Al/27Al)0 of ~510‒5; *CAIs lacking resolvable 26Mg* excess.
