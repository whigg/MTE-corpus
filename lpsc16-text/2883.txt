The Mapping X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometer ("Map-X") is intended to provide elemental  imaging  at  ≤100µm  spatial  resolution, yielding  elemental  chemistry  at  or  below the  scale length where many relict physical, chemical, and biological features can be imaged and interpreted in ancient rocks. Map-X:  Map-X  is  an  arm-based  instrument placed directly on the surface of an object to be analyzed and held in registry with it  through the use of touch sensors that physically contact the surface. During an analysis, either an x-ray tube or a radioisotope source bombards the sample surface with x-rays (tube source) or α-particles and γ-rays (radioisotope source), resulting in x-ray fluorescence from the sample. Fluoresced x-rays emitted in the direction of an x-ray sensitive CCD imager pass through an x-ray 1:1 focusing lens  that  projects  a  spatially  resolved  image  of the x-rays  generated  from  the  sample  surface  onto  the CCD. The CCD is read at several frames per second so that in the majority of cases, no more than one photon strikes an individual pixel between read cycles. In this  way,  the  energies  and  positions  of  individual X-ray photons are recorded. The images are stored in memory and  processed  using  algorithms  parameterized  from  the  ground.  In  a  single  analysis,  several thousand  frames  are  both  stored  and  processed  in real-time. The MapX concept is illustrated in fig. 1. Higher  level  data  products  that  can  be obtained from the raw images include single-element maps for elements of interest with a lateral spatial resolution of ≤ 100  µm and XRF spectra from selected Regions of Interest (ROIs). XRF spectra from ROIs are processed on  the  ground  to  determine  quantitative  elemental compositions.   Quantitative compositions  from ROIs are compared with known rock and mineral compositions to extrapolate the data to rock types and putative mineralogies. A single Map-X experiment provides elemental  and  compositional  maps  and  XRF  spectra having a spatial resolution of ≤  100 μm, commensurate with other imaging instruments. Proof of concept prototype:  An earlier prototype [1,2] was constructed to show the utility of the Map-X concept, but lacked some of the specific hardware and software necessary for proper testing and evaluation of the  concept.   A second  prototype  was  custom  built from  commercial  components  and  specialized  software (fig. 2).  A commercial camera with 1024x1024 back illuminated deep depletion CCD, under vacuum with a 200 µm Be window was used for the new prototype instrument (Andor iKon M).  Two 40kV-4W Au target transmission window x-ray tubes (Moxtek) illuminate the sample from opposite sides of the camera to limit topographic contrast.  An MPO x-ray focusing lens  (PHOTONIS) is  placed equidistant  between the sample location and the CCD.  This reflective lens derives from "lobster-eye" multichannel  optics used for X-ray astronomy [3].  It is implemented here in a flat geometry for 1:1 focusing.  This lens provides a much improved aperture when compared to pin-hole camera optics having  similar  spatial  resolution,  and  true focusing  when  compared  to  polycapillary  collimating optics also used for X-ray mapping.   The camera  is driven  at  up  to 3 frames  per  second,  and  the  x-ray sources are shuttered during read cycles. Fig. 1: Schematic drawing of the Map-X concept. Other work in progress:  Other  parts  of the instrument  development  are  being  pursued  in  parallel with the proof of concept evaluation. Development of  data processing software.  The instrument collects a large number of short acquisitions that  are combined into X-Y-time data cubes.  Python code was developed for processing raw CCD data of the prototypes.  This code includes background correction,  split  charge removal,  and optional  binning  features.  Resulting X-Y-energy data cubes are stored in HDF5 format and analyzed using PyMca [4] for quantitative analysis with fundamental parameter methods. Limited bandwidth of planetary missions will require additional on-board processing to further  reduce data into alternative products such as XRD spectra of spa tial  regions of interest,  or X, Y maps of spectral  regions of interest. Characterization and correction of the MPO point spread function (PSF).  The MPO lens causes a signal spread on the detector that must be corrected for optimum spatial  resolution.   The PSF varies with signal energy and  with  X-Y position  due morphological  or stacking  defects  of  the  micro-channels.   Dedicated equipment is being built to characterize the lens PSF and software is being developed to deconvolve the PSF from the data.   Ray-tracing models of the MPO have been developed in  parallel  to evaluate  the  effects of various types of defects on the PSF and to assist in the development of PSF deconvolution algorithms.

In parallel  with the method development and laboratory and field prototype refinement, engineering efforts are being pursued to increase the TRL of the instrument. The main effort is the development of a Peltier cooled CCD  X-ray  camera  using  the  E2V  frame  transfer CCD used in the MSL CheMin XRD/XRF instrument. Dedicated CCD electronics  using  flight  design  standards  are  being  developed and  a  breadboard  is  currently being  tested.   The new camera  prototype will demonstrate  the basic architecture of a flight  camera for an arm mounted instrument and will serve a base for an in-vacuum Map-X prototype to characterize the system capabilities at the low X-ray energies (e.g., Kα lines for Na-K) that are absorbed in the in-air current prototypes. Flow-down of  science  requirements.  Instrument models are being developed for the X-ray source emission, fluorescence response of the sample, MPO transmission and CCD signal collection to provide critical tools in the flow-down of system requirements.  Initial results of this effort are presented in [5]. Fig 3: Example of data output with the 2nd generation instrument.
