PLANETESIMAL INITIALMASS FUNCTIONS AND CREATION RATES UNDER TURBULENT CONCENTRATIONUSING SCALE-DEPENDENT CASCADES. J. N. Cuzzi1, T. Hartlep2, and P. Estrada3, Jeffrey.Cuzzi@NASA.gov; 1AmesResearch Center, NASA, MS 245-3, Moffett Field, CA, USA; 2BAERI inc.; Petaluma, CA.; 3SETI Inst.; Mt. View, CA..Introduction: The initial accretion of primitive bodiesfrom freely-floating nebula particles remains problematic. Traditional growth-by-sticking models in turbulent nebulae encounter a “meter-size barrier" due to both drift and destruction[1], or even a mm-to-cm-size “bouncing" barrier [2]. Recentsuggestions have been made that some “lucky" particles mightbe able to outgrow the collision and/or drift barriers, and leadto so-called “streaming instabilities" or SI [3]. However, newfull models of growth by sticking in the presence of radial drift[4] show that lucky particles (the largest particles, at the tail ofthe size distribution, that grow beyond the nominal fragmentation and drift barriers) are far too rare to lead to any collectiveeffects such as streaming or gravitational instabilities.Thus we need to focus on typical radii rM which containmost of the mass. Our models of disks with weak-to-moderateturbulence [4,5], which include all the most recent experimental constraints on collisional growth, erosion, bouncing,and fragmentation, as well as radial drift, find that growthstalls quite generally at sizes rM which are too small to settleinto layers which are dense enough for any collective effects(streaming or gravitational instabilities) to arise.Even if growth by sticking could somehow breach thenominal barriers (perhaps if the actual sticking or strengthis larger than current estimates for pure ice or pure silicate,with specific grain sizes), turbulent nebulae present subsequent formidable obstacles to incremental growth through the1-10km size range [6]. On the other hand, nonturbulent nebulae (↵⌧ 10�4) may form large asteroids too quickly to explain long spreads in formation times, or the dearth of meltedasteroids (see, however, [7]). Thus, the intensity of nebula turbulence is critical to the entire process from the earliest stagesof sticking, through the planetesimal formation stage.Theoretical understanding of nebula turbulence is itself (itseems, perennially) in flux; recentmodels ofMRI (magneticallydriven) turbulence favor low-or-no-turbulence environments[8], but purely hydrodynamic turbulence is making a comeback with two recently discovered mechanisms generating robust turbulence which do not rely on magnetic fields at all[9-11]. Nebula turbulence is described by its Reynolds number Re = (L/⌘)4/3, where L = H↵1/2 is the largest eddyscale, with eddy timescale tK ⇠ the orbit period, H is thenebula gas vertical scale height, ↵ the turbulent viscosity parameter, and ⌘ is the smallest scale in turbulence (typicallyabout 1km), with eddy turnover time t⌘ ⇠ an hour. The mechanisms of [9-11] lead to ↵ ⇠ a few times 10�4. In the actualnebula, for values of ↵ in this range, Re is far larger thanany fully resolved numerical simulation can currently handle,so some physical arguments and models are needed to extendthe results of numerical simulations to nebula conditions (see“Cascade models and thresholds.." below).Our models indicate that because of limits to particlegrowth by sticking, the midplane solids density falls short ofthe SI threshold by a factor of about 100, at least until 4⇥ 105years, a time when sizeable planetesimals are already knownto be forming in the terrestrial planet region [4 (figure 20), 5].If growth were possible, the midplane solids density wouldgrow asprM until the particle size is about a dm, and thenlinearly, so SI would require further particle growth by 3 orders of magnitude in the terrestrial planet region (to about 1mradius) for SI to occur for values of ↵ ⇠ 10�4 � 10�3. Thesituation is slightlymore favorable just outside the snowline at4-7AU in these models, where “stickier" ice particles can growto larger sizes. Work reported at this meeting [5] shows thatparticle porosity can vary these outcomes in significant ways.Important clues regarding planetesimal formation includean apparent 100km diameter peak in the pre-depletion, preerosion mass distribution of asteroids [12]. Scenarios leadingdirectly from independent nebula particulates to large objectsof this size, which avoid the problematic m-km size range,could be called “leapfrog" scenarios of which SI is one [for arecent review see 13]. There is also a range of evidence suggesting that the parent bodies of the primitive chondrites, evenat ⇠100km diameter, were originally homogeneous throughout in particle size and in chemical and isotopic properties[13]. Acceptable “leapfrog" models of planetesimal formationmust account for all of these observed properties.Cascade models and thresholds together determine theplanetesimal “IMF": The “leapfrog" approach we have pursued [14,13] envisions turbulent concentration (TC) of certainparticle sizes in moderate turbulence, into dense zones thatcan lead directly to planetesimal formation with the propertiesnoted above, given a range of initial parameters. The spatialdistribution of particle concentration can be captured statistically by a cascade model [14], based on full 3D numericalsimulations, which predicts the volume fractions of the nebulawith different combinations of local solids mass density andgas vorticity. The conditions that allow planetesimal formation are functions of spatial scale, and we modeled them usingestimates of “thresholds" which these local properties mustsatisfy. The combination of cascade-derived volume fractions,and crude-physics-based threshold estimates, leads to predictions of planetesimal Initial Mass Functions (IMFs) and formation rates [14]. Here we show how new understanding ofthe cascade affects planetesimal IMFs, and has implicationsabout the initial sticking process.Cascademodels and scale dependence: Cascademodelsare well known in turbulence physics [14], and are based onthe underlying cascade of energy from large scales to small.A cascade model calculates the fractional volume occupiedby some value of a property (like particle concentration) byrepetitive application of certain partition functions, envisionedas applying over a range of descending scales of the turbulence. Previously we assumed that these functions were scaleindependent, but disagreement with results of others at higherRe led us to an in-depth study using evenmore highly resolvedfluid simulations [15]. That work has been completed [16,17]and we find that the partition functions for particle concentration are scale dependent. Fortunately, the dependence itselfobeys a simple scaling involving lengthscale and stopping time[16,17]. We have now run new, level-dependent cascades andcombined them with our previous threshold estimates, to recalculate planetesimal IMFs. We find they differ significantly2661.pdf

The lighter colors along some part ofsome curves represent cases where the local solids massdensity exceeds values where turbulence damping mayoccur, which we regard as questionable. Modal valuesof planetesimal diameter are in the 10-60km range.from our previous results and have important implications.Results and speculations: After re-running the full cascademodels, using the new level-dependent partition functions(also called multipliers) of [16,17], while retaining the samethreshold physics as [14], we find that sizeable planetesimalswith a fairly well-defined size mode can still arise from turbulent concentration alone. Figure 1 shows the mass creationrate M˙ of planetesimals of a given diameter relative to the rateneeded to provide the primordial asteroid beltmass, prior to dynamical depletion (M˙goal). That is, a value of M˙/M˙goal = 1provides the needed amount of planetesimal mass in the asteroid belt over the several Myr it appears to take, based onage-dating evidence. The strength of the background “headwind" parameter � encountered by the clumps could be lowerin a solids-dominated midplane (bottom panel) than for an isolated particle (top panel)[14]. Several of the models providemore mass than needed, allowing for unmodeled inefficiencies. For instance, mass loading can damp turbulence [14],and this effect is not included in these cascades; lighter colors along some of the curves indicate where the underlyingparticle concentrations may be overestimates for this reason.However, the nebula particle sizes to which these resultsrefer are in the dm-radius range, and must reflect aggregates ofchondrule-size particles in the terrestrial planet region. Contrary to our prior results [14], no 10-100km diameter planetesimals are formed directly from turbulent concentration ofindividual, free-floating, chondrule-size particles under nebulaconditions close to nominal. This difference arises because ofthe previously unmodeled scale dependence of the multipliers,or partition functions. Rare objects of sub-km size may beformed, but these will be vulnerable to disruption by gravitational scattering [6].In the light of figure 20 of [4] and corresponding resultsof [5], we can see a disconnect at least in the terrestrial planetregion between the largest objects which the best current models can grow in weak to moderate turbulence by incrementalsticking (mm), and the sizes needed for planetesimal formationto begin (dm). Particles of dm radius, which figure 1 showscan lead to some planetesimal formation by TC, are still toosmall to permit planetesimal formation by SI alone at least inthe inner solar system [5, and above] unless ↵⌧ 10�4.However, the underlying conditions for planetesimal formation by SI and by TC seem to be converging, leaving openthe possibility that the two mechanisms might work synergistically. We might call this hypothetical regime “clusteringinstability" - a nonlinear instability triggered in SI stablemidplane layers of cm-dm size particles by the fluctuations causedby TC. Still, this scenario can only occur if sticking is slightlymore robust than currently believed [5]. It has been shown [18]that aggregates of dust-rimmed, chondrule-sized particles maygrow to perhaps mm-cm in radius, assuming pure silicates. Ifsome amount of “sticky" organics or frost were present on therims of silicate particles, or if grain size/shape effects playeda role, perhaps dm-size aggregates may not be unrealistic.Future work: damping of turbulence needs to be included,and the simple “thresholds" of [14] need to be replaced by actual simulations. Experimental work on sticking and strengthfor aggregates of mixed media, including refractory organicmaterials and ice rims, could be conducted. Evidence foraggregates could be sought in the most primitive chondrites.References: [1] Brauer, F. et al 2008 A&A 480, 859; [2]Zsom A. et al 2010, A&A 513, id.A57; [3] Johansen, A.;Blum, J.; Tanaka, H.; Ormel, C.; Bizzarro, M.; Rickman, H.2014, Protostars and Planets VI, Univ.
