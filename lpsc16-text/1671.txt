Introduction: Organic matter present in carbonaceous meteorites is most likely a mix of interstellar molecules, condensates that formed in the protosolar nebula, and those that transformed in the asteroid parent bodies. It has been established that both the soluble and insoluble organic matter (IOM) identified in meteorites and interplanetary dust particles contain material enriched in deuterium (D) and 15N. Bulk 15N enrichments in some carbonaceous meteorites [e.g., 1] are comparable to the values measured in comets and starforming regions [e.g., 2]. However, meteoritic 15N-rich 'hotspots' in the IOM [3−7] exhibit enrichments that varies dramatically over small spatial scales. Furthermore, meteorites belonging to the same class show enormous heterogeneity. Some of the 15N enriched hotspots are associated with nanoglobules [8, 9] and may not show D enrichments [9]. They exceed the most extreme values for prestellar cores [10] or protosolar systems [11]. The origin of these hotspots, although unknown, is most likely material preserved, after being produced by low temperature chemistry in the interstellar medium or early solar system, and are therefore relics from before the solar system collapsed. This study aims to characterize the isotopic, chemical and structural characteristics of the starting inventories of organics and volatiles in meteoritic materials. The diversity in the functional groups carrying the 15N-enrichments is unknown, although some of these materials and the surrounding matrix material have been characterized [12, 13]. Hotspots with 15N excess in Queen Alexandra Range 97416 and terrestrial C isotopic composition was found to contain nitrile functionality [6]. Another recent study [14] compared the average enrichments of the hotspots to the 15N isotopic enrichments measured in ammonia from a large suite of meteorites, and argued that a section of these hotspots could be amines, which may have formed in the protosolar nebula. In order to assess statistically the 15N enrichment routes for nitriles and amines, and identify additional N-bearing species, we collected C and N isotopic data of macromolecular material and presolar grains from Bells, Queen Alexandra Range 97990, Murray, Murchison, Cold Bokkeveld, and Allende. Additional chemical and structural data from these materials will be studied to learn more about what molecules that carry anomalous N and C isotopic compositions.  Samples and Methods:  The meteorites studied are C-ung Bells, CM2.6 QUE 97990, CM2 Murray, CM2 Murchison, CM2 Cold Bokkeveld, and CV3 Allende. All investigated samples were characterized, prior to SIMS, by back-scatter electron (BSE) imaging and X-ray elemental mapping with a Cameca SX-100 electron microprobe at the University of Arizona. Fine grained matrix areas around calcium aluminum inclusions and chondrules were searched for C and N isotopic anomalies with a 'chained analysis' setup, where the initial stage coordinates were predefined, and the stage moved in a predefined pattern. All of the isotopic analyses were performed on the Cameca Ametek NanoSIMS 50L at Arizona State University. The surfaces of the samples were Au-coated (20 nm thick) before analysis. Prior to each analysis, a 20-25 pA primary beam was rastered over a 20×20 μm2 surface area to remove the Au coating and surface contamination as well as to implant cesium. The sample surface was rastered with a primary Cs+ beam over areas of 15×15 μm2 divided into 256×256 pixels with a dwell time of 15 ms/pixel. The secondary isotopes of 12C-, 13C-, 12C14N-, 12C15N-, and 28Si- and secondary electrons were collected in multicollection mode with a beam current of 2 to 3 pA. Secondary ions of 16O-, 31P- and 32S- were also occasionally collected. Several planes (5 to 10) were acquired for each area. The mass spectrometer was set to >8000 mass resolving power (Cameca definition). The analytical protocol included measurements on cyanoacrylate standard, followed by a chained analysis, and another measurement on the cyanoacrylate standard. All obtained images were processed with WinImage. Carbon and N isotopic ratios were normalized to those measured on the standard. Only regions that showed the isotopic anomaly for at least three consecutive planes and with isotopic compositions more than 5σ away from the terrestrial ratios were considered anomalous. Error bars reported in this study are 1σ errors based on poisson statistics.  Results: CM2 Murray, CM2 Murchison, CM2 Cold Bokkeveld, C-ung Bells, CV3 Allende, and CM2 QUE 97990 were scanned over areas measuring 5775 μm2, 5400 μm2, 5400 μm2, 2300 μm2, 6750 μm2 and 4500 μm2, respectively. The range in C and N isotopic compositions of these hotspots is shown in Figure 1. A total of 27 N-anomalous domains were identified by raster ion imaging of the six meteorites. No isotopic  anomalies were found in Allende and two Nanomalous domains are most likely presolar grains.   Figure 1: Carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions of hotspots and coldspots in situ of five carbonaceous chondrites are shown in blue while the grey points are from published literature [6]. Errors are 1σ.  The remaining anomalous domains are carbonaceous grains with high C/Si ratios (C-/Si- ratios > 2). The δ15N values of the carbonaceous grains range from -746±61‰ to 2544±77‰ (Figure 1). The five grains with 15N depletions, which we refer to as 'coldspots', are from QUE 97990 and Cold Bokkeveld. The C isotopic composition of the carbonaceous grains range from -95±11‰ to 93±12‰ with seven of the grains showing a C anomaly. These seven Canomalous grains are from Murchison, QUE 97990 and Cold Bokkeveld. The CN-/C- ratios for all the Nanomalous carbonaceous grains vary from 0.2 to 1.5 corresponding to 0.27 to 2.03 wt.% N, when compared to the cyanoacrylate standard. The range in C and N isotopic compositions of the hotspots are similar to those observed previously [e.g., 3, 4, 6], although the coldspots are quite abundant. Cold Bokkeveld shows one coldspot (δ15N = 746±61‰), which is anomalous in carbon as well (δ13C = 37±5‰). Murray, in general shows the smallest range of anomalies, while Bells hotspots show the largest range in the 15N enrichments. Two of the hotspots in Murray contain small amounts of S.  Presolar grains. Two of the anomalous grains with very large 15N excesses (δ15N = 4505±35‰ and 15364±48‰) correlate with Si in the ion image, suggesting that they are SiC grains. Both the SiC grains are either mainstream SiC or X-grain. QUE 97990 was also searched for C- and O-anomalous presolar grains. None were identified in the 3350 μm2 area. Discussion and Conclusions: Very large 15Nenrichments were observed in five meteorites predominantly belonging to the CM-class of carbonaceous chondrites. Seven grains with C anomalies were also located in the same samples. It is not yet clear whether the absence of presolar grains in the relatively more pristine CM2.6 QUE 97990 compared to other CMs studied is due to aqueous alteration or that they are heterogeneously distributed and require measurement of additional areas. Oxidative metamorphism in Allende definitely  led to the destruction of the organic component of this meteorite. Our data suggest that the 15N enrichments are present in CM Type 2 chondrites, irrespective of the degree of parent-body aqueous alteration. Meteorites with high degree of brecciation, like Bells, have the largest 15N anomalies. 15N isotopic enhancements in primitive solar system material has been explained by either non-equilibrium ion-molecule chemistry in cold, dense molecular cloud material in the interstellar medium or via N2 self-shielding processes in the outer solar system [16, 17].  Based on the large range in N and C isotopic compositions, parent-body processing does not seem to have completely overprinted the original isotopic signatures indicative of cold chemistry. Additional measurements, including the determination of functional carriers, which are planned, are necessary in order to understand how these may have been formed and were delivered to the asteroid parent bodies.
