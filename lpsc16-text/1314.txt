Summary: Based on radio tracking of the Cassini spacecraft, we present a preliminary estimate of the gravity field of Saturn's mid-sized icy moon Dione. Combining this [1–5] with a shape model based on limb profile analyses [6,7], we conclude that Dione is differentiated, with a preferred moment of inertia of ~0.33MR2, and that its ~300 meters of non-hydrostatic degree-2 topography may be isostatically compensated, consistent with the presence of an internal ocean. Background: Dione has a mean radius of 561.4 km and its bulk density is 1478 kg/m3, making it one of the densest of Saturn's icy moons, with a rock/ice ratio >50% by mass. Dione's surface is marked by long troughs and ridges, suggesting an earlier epoch of greater geologic activity. Gravity: During its time in the Saturn system, Cassini has performed five close fly-bys of Dione, three of which included radio tracking during closest approach: one in December 2011, and two in summer of 2015. As in previous work [3,8–10], the gravity field of Dione was estimated by reconstructing the spacecraft trajectory during these encounters, making use of precise measurements of the Doppler shift of a highly stable microwave radio link between Cassini and the ground station antennas of NASA's Deep Space Network.  The available data were analyzed in a multi-arc fit estimating a fully unconstrained quadrupole gravity field for Dione, the Dione and the spacecraft initial state vectors for each fly-by, and modeling parameters for the non-gravitational accelerations. The stability of the solution was tested by perturbing the dynamical model in various ways, including estimating a full 3×3 gravity field and changing the a priori uncertainties. The Saturn system dynamics were modeled on the basis of the most recent satellite ephemerides. However, because these are updated frequently using the latest Cassini observations, our solution is still subject to minor refinements. The resulting preliminary estimate of Dione's quadrupole gravity field (J2 = 1454 ±16, C22 = 363 ±2, in units of dimensionless gravitational potential ×106; uncertainties are 1σ) exhibits a statistically significant departure from the hydrostatic expectation, with a J2/C22 ratio of 4.00 ±0.06 (the hydrostatic ratio for Dione is ~3.31 [5]; Fig. 1). As a result, the moment of inertia cannot be inferred directly from the RadauDarwin relation.  Shape: Dione's shape has been determined via analyses of limb profiles [6,7], with the unnormalized degree-2 coefficients being: J2 = 1920 ±160 m, C22 = 370 ±30 m (Fig. 2). The shape deviates from the hydrostatic expectation even more than the gravity—the topography's J2/C22 ratio is 5.2 ±0.6—perhaps suggesting some degree of compensation.  Internal Structure: In spite of its departure from hydrostatic equilibrium, it is possible to construct simple models of Dione's interior, some of which can be excluded based on the observed shape and gravity.  Figure 2 shows the observed J2 and C22 topography (blue crosshairs) as well as the shape required to give rise to the observed gravity [10] in the case of a homogeneous interior (green crosshairs), illustrating that an undifferentiated interior can be ruled out at the 3σ level. Figure 2 also shows, for two example moments of inertia (0.32 and 0.34; red and cyan crosshairs, respectively), the shape required to give rise to the observed gravity [4,5,10] given a two-layer model (silicate core and H2O mantle) assuming a hydrostatic core shape [5] and a mantle density of 930 kg/m3. Although these differentiated models are compatible with the observed   Figure 1: Dione's observed J2 and C22 dimensionless gravitational potential coefficients (blue crosshairs, illustrating 1σ uncertainty).

shape at the 2σ level, an improved match can be obtained if the non-hydrostatic topography is also compensated. In a separate attempt to constrain the internal structure, we follow an analysis that was originally carried out for Enceladus [3,11], which uses two independent measures of the degree-2 admittance to converge on a self-consistent interior model. Admittance quantifies the degree to which the topography is compensated and is given by: 𝑍!" = 𝐺!"!!𝐻!"!! where 𝐺!"!! and 𝐻!"!! are the degree l and order m unnormalized spherical harmonic coefficients for the non-hydrostatic ('nh') gravity and topography, respectively. To obtain the non-hydrostatic gravity and topography, we assume that the observed signals (𝐺!"!"#, 𝐻!!!"#) can be linearly separated into their hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic parts as follows: 𝐺!"!"# = 𝐺!"!!" + 𝐺!"!! 𝐻!"!"# = 𝐻!"!!" + 𝐻!"!! where 𝐺!"!!" and 𝐻!"!!" are the gravity and topography expected for a hydrostatic body given an assumed moment of inertia [5]. Carrying out this exercise for both the C20 (i.e., -J2) and the C22 terms, we obtain two independent estimates of the degree-2 admittance: Z20 and Z22, each of which varies with the assumed moment of inertia (Fig. 3). If the compensation mechanism (and therefore the admittance) is isotropic, then the results are self-consistent only for the moment of inertia that yields Z20 = Z22. Figure 3 illustrates that this occurs for a moment of inertia factor of ~0.33 and that the ±1σ admittance estimates overlap in the range 0.32–0.34. Assuming a mantle density of 930 kg/m3, this suggests a core mass fraction of 62 ±3%, a core radius of 410 ±15 km (mantle thickness 150 ±15 km), and a core density of 2350 ±150 kg/m3 [cf. 9,12]. Such a low core density could be an indication of hydrothermal alteration and/or substantial porosity. Figure 3 further shows that the degree-2 admittance is ~3.6×10-7 m-1, somewhat smaller than the value expected for uncompensated topography (~6.7×10-7 m-1). This lower admittance may be another indication that the topography is compensated, as if it were supported isostatically in a subsurface liquid layer. Uncertainties at the 2σ level, however, marginally allow for the possibility of uncompensated topography. Conclusions: In spite of the departure from hydrostatic equilibrium, a combined analysis of Dione's shape and gravity allows us to rule out the possibility of an undifferentiated interior. Although interior structure models are necessarily non-unique, we have shown, using two separate techniques, that the observed shape and gravity are most simply accommodated by models with moment of inertia factors in the range 0.32–0.34, and with some degree of compensation, consistent with the presence of an internal ocean.
