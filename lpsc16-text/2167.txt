FREEZING OF METHANOL-WATER MIXTURES AT HIGH PRESSURE WITH APPLICATIONS TOTITAN. Andrew Dougherty, Ross Chumsky, and Dustin Morris, Department of Physics, Lafayette College, Easton,PA 18042 USA. doughera@lafayette.eduIntroduction: We report measurements of the liquidus and eutectic points for a 30 wt.% methanol-watersolution at pressures ranging from 5 to 400 MPa, usingsimultaneous measurements of pressure, volume, andtemperature, coupled with optical images of the sample. The eutectic point for the methanol-water solutionappears to increase with pressure, similar to the behavior of the freezing point of pure methanol. Conversely,the liquidus point appears to decrease with pressure inthe Ice-Ih regime, similar to the behavior of pure water. We also observed Ice-Ih phases at somewhat higherpressures than one would expect based on the pure waterphase diagram.Background: The presence of a subsurface oceanon Titan has long been suspected[1], and is consistent with electric field measurements from the Huygensprobe[2], and with obliquity measurements[3]. Thethickness and rigidity of the outer ice shell would likelyhave significant influence on surface topography[4].Any subsurface ocean would likely contain impurities,such as ammonia and methanol, that act as powerful antifreeze compounds. Sandwiched between an outer IceIh shell and an inner high-pressure ice shell, these impurities could significantly affect both the thickness ofthe outer shell and the depth of the ocean[5].The phase diagram for methanol-water solutions at atmospheric pressure is shown in Fig. 1. As a methanolwater mixture is cooled, ice crystals precipitate out untilthe peritectic point is reached, at a temperature of approximately 171 K and a concentration of 69%, at whichpoint CH3OH ·H2O begins to form. Below the eutectictemperature of 150 K, the system solidifies completely.The eutectic concentration is approximately 88 wt%. Athigher pressures, the behaviors of the peritectic and eutectic temperatures are not known. 160 180 200 220 240 260 280 0  20  40  60  80  100T (K)Wt.% MethanolLiquidH2O + LiquidCH3OH .

Data are from Vuillard & Sanchez[7] and Miller & Carpenter[8].Experiment: Approximately 1 mL of sample wasloaded into a pressure cell. This cell is made from a316 stainless steel block with four ports.1 Two opposing ports contain plugs that have sapphire windows forthe imaging system, sealed with epoxy. The third portcontains a plug with a silicon diode thermometer, andthe fourth connects the cell to the pressure system. Afiber optic light is used to illuminate the sample, and aninverted periscope is used to obtain images. The pressure system includes a transducer that responds approximately linearly to changes in volume of the sample. Thepressure cell is insulated, and temperature can be controlled between 200 and 300 K. Cooling below 200 K isdone with liquid nitrogen.For these preliminary investigations, we choseto study an intermediate concentration of 30 wt.%methanol in water, somewhat similar to that used byZhong et al.[9] Although the eutectic concentrationis 88 wt.%, the relevant concentrations for planetaryapplications are likely much lower. Deschamps et al.estimate[5] that Titan's primordial ocean might havecontained ∼ 4wt.% of methanol relative to water.Sample Run at Low Pressure: A sample data runis shown in Fig. 2 for a nominal pressure of 10 MPa. 0.465 0.47 0.475 0.48 0.485 0.49 0.495 220  230  240  250  260  270  280Voltage (V)Temperature (K)(a)(b)(c)  (d)Figure 2: Transducer voltage (approximately linearly relatedto volume) vs. temperature for a run at a nominal pressure of10 MPa.The system started at point (a) as a homogeneous fluidat about 280 K, and was cooled steadily. As the systemcooled, the fluid contracted. After the system becamesupersaturated, dendritic ice crystals precipitated starting at point (b), around 235K. The volume increased,indicating that the ice crystals were less dense thanthe surrounding fluid, as would be expected for IceIh. Upon further cooling to point (c), more ice crystalsgrew, but some liquid remained as well. Under gradual1High Pressure Equipment Company, Erie, PA2167.pdf

warming, the ice crystals slowly melted and floated upward as pieces detached. The last crystals dissolved atthe liquidus point (d). In order to ensure thermodynamicequilibrium, the liquidus was approached very slowly,typically over several days at an average rate of less than0.25◦ C per hour.Sample Run at High Pressure: A sample data runis shown in Fig. 3 for a nominal pressure of 315 MPa. 0.2 0.21 0.22 0.23 0.24 0.25 0.26 190  200  210  220  230  240  250  260  270  280Voltage (V)Temperature (K)(a)(b)(c)  (d)  (e)  (f)Figure 3: Transducer voltage (approximately linearly relatedto volume) vs. temperature for a run at a nominal pressure of315 MPa.The system started at point (a) as a homogeneous fluidat about 270 K, and was cooled steadily. After thesystem became supersaturated, ice crystals precipitatedstarting at point (b). The volume decreased, indicatingthat the ice crystals were denser than the surroundingfluid. Comparison of the temperature to the pure icephase diagram suggests that the ice phase was Ice-II.Upon further cooling, the system froze and became anopaque solid.Under gradual warming, this solid phase underwenta repeatable melting transition as the system loopedthrough points (c), (d), and (e). The sample volumechanged rapidly, and the crystals could be seen growingor shrinking in the images. Further warming along thecurve from (e) to (f) gradually dissolved the remainingice crystals.At lower pressures, typically less than about 200 MPa,the volume increased upon the initial crystallization ofice crystals, consistent with the growth of Ice-Ih. Atthe 30 wt.% concentration used in these experiments, agood deal of ice has to freeze before the eutectic point isreached. In the Ice-Ih regime, that ice takes up a greatervolume and tends to both fill up the imaging windowand to lock up the volume transducer so that measurements are more difficult to interpret. Accordingly, weonly report eutectic temperatures in the Ice-II regime.Results: The resulting transition temperaturesare shown in Fig. 4. The phase boundaries for purewater[10] and methanol[11] are included for comparison. The Ice-Ih/Ice-II transition line is taken fromDunaeva et al.[12] Generally, the freezing behaviorfollows that of pure methanol, while the liquidustrend follows that of pure water. We also observe thatthe Ice-Ih/Ice-II transition appears to occur at higherpressures in this system than has been reported for purewater. 160 180 200 220 240 260 280 0  100  200  300  400  500Temperature (K)Pressure (MPa)Ice IhIce IIIce III Ice VLiquidMethanolMethanol-ice-IIliquidus-I 30%liquidus-II 30%Interpolated LiquidusFigure 4: Transition temperatures as a function of pressurefor a 30 wt.% methanol-water mixture. The freezing temperatures for pure methanol are shown as diamonds, while theeutectic temperatures are shown as boxes. The liquidus temperatures in the Ice-Ih and Ice-II regimes are shown as circlesand triangles respectively. The blue line shows the liquidus estimated by linear interpolation between the ice and methanolcurves.For modeling Titan's ocean, Deschamps et al. estimated the crystallization temperature as a function ofpressure by interpolating between the pure water andpure methanol values[5]. The results in Fig. 4 indicate that this is a reasonable approximation, but slightlyoverestimates the liquidus temperatures at higher pressures.Future experimental work will explore the eutectictemperature in the Ice-Ih regime by using much higherconcentrations of methanol. With higher concentrations, we will be able to avoid the complications causedby the large amounts of Ice-Ih in the present system, andanticipate being able to study the freezing transitions inmore detail.References: [1] J.
