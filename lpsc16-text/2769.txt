Introduction:  Sedimentary history and climate change are currently two major areas of interest in Mars science. The sediment found in dune fields originates from rock that has been eroded through a variety of physical and chemical processes. The sediment is transported, perhaps by fluvial, and then aeolian processes. Finally, the sediment accumulates to form dunes. If the dunes are active, the overall composition  of this accumulated sediment may be modified as the wind sorts grains of varying composition by their size, density and resistance to comminution. If the dunes are stabilized (e.g., by vegetation on Earth or induration on Mars), mechanical or chemical weathering may cause additional alteration. Each stage (erosion, transport, dune formation, mobility, and stabilization) can affect the final mineral composition of a dune field, which in turn, can provide clues about current and previous climate. Previous work: Previous studies have shown that Martian dune fields are primarily mafic in origin [1-4], composed mainly of olivine, pyroxene, and ironbearing glass. Other studies have shown that in some areas, gypsum, other hydrated sulfates, and phyllosilicates are present, indicating that water-related processes have played a role in the formation and/or evolution of aeolian sand [e.g. 5-8]. Global scale variations in mineral composition of eroded and transported material can help determine the extent and nature of waterrelated conditions that resulted in the formation of hydrated sulfates and phyllosilicates. The presence of these and other minerals and their variation in abundance across dune fields can reveal much about the environmental and climatic history of Mars. Previous results: This project is a follow-on to "Survey of Mars Dunes: A Global View of Climatic and Sedimentary Processes (08-PGG08-0019)." The primary intent of the precursor proposal was to create a database of all of the medium-to-large dark dune fields on Mars. Initially, THEMIS thermal infrared images were used to avoid selection effects, then highresolution visible images were used to classify morphology and wind directions. The result of this work included the GIS-based Mars Global Digital Dune Database (MGD 3). The database is available in three parts: (1) 65°N to 65°S [9, 10], (2) 65°N to 90°N [11] and (3) 65°S to 90°S [12]. The database provides necessary information to view dunes in a global context, comparing their geographic locations and attributes to other global datasets, such as the NASA-Ames General Circulation Model (GCM) [13]. This database has also provided the base tool for several research projects [e.g. 14-16] and provided 550 aeolian targets for the HiRISE team to image. Methodology:  Java Mission-planning and Analysis Remote Sensing (JMARS) software [17] was used to identify and download TES observations that occurred on the selected dune field sites. JMARS was also used to extract thermal inertia values for the dune field sites using nighttime observations to reduce errors caused by slope and albedo effects. Stabilization indices were determined from images using the criteria in [18]. TES spectra were ingested into the Davinci software package [19], where mineral abundances were calculated. The data were initially corrected for the atmosphere using linear deconvolution Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA) software with a surface and atmospheric library [20]. Then the mineral abundances were estimated from atmospherically-corrected emissivity spectra using the same SMA software. The spectral library used was created by Rogers and Fergason [21]. Database:  The improved database will include both mineral abundances for the primary mineral groups present and information on how those abundances were collected. Table 1 below is a partial example of the proposed product. Due to space considerations, columns for region (65°N to 90°N, 65°N to 65°S, or 65°S to 90°S), number of orbital tracks deconvolved, incremental counter keeper (ICK) range, temperature range, the number of spectra averaged, stability indices, and TES nighttime thermal inertia are not included in Table 1.  The orbital tracks are listed from west to east across the dune fields included. This allows any potential trends in mineral abundances to be examined as a function of longitude.  Figure 1 below shows the breakdown of dune fields by area in each region of the database. Four classes of dune fields by shape and area have been tentatively defined. The three dune fields included in Table 1 are in class I (dune fields in which distribution trends in mineral abundances can be examined). Class II dune fields can be reliably analyzed but are too small for trends to be recognized. Class III dune fields are so small that only three or fewer detectors per orbital track can be analyzed, making results unreliable. Class  IV dune fields are smaller in area than the detector footprint. As can be seen in Figure 1, there are a significant number of class IV dune fields; other methods will have to be derived to determine mineral composition in these dune fields.  Future Applications: This abstract provides a partial example of what the mineral composition portion of the MGD 3 will provide when published. Having a central repository with compositional and thermal inertia data for Mars dune fields will have multiple applications. Understanding composition and any trends in mineral abundances in the larger dune fields can be used to analyze how aeolian processes shape the surface of Mars.

Table 1: This table shows some of the information to be provided in the MGD3 when the composition portion is published. Abundances with error provided by DaVinci for each orbital track in the dune fields will be provided for the above mineral groups.   Figure 1: The charts above show the breakdown of the dune fields in each region by area in km2. Class I fields have the area and shape such that trends in abundances across the dune field may be examined. Class II fields can be analyzed thoroughly but are too small for trends to be examined. Class III fields are small enough such that compositional analyses may or may not be trustworthy. Class IV fields are smaller or narrower than a TES spectral footprint.
