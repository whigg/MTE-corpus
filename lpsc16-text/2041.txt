SURFACE ROUGHNESS MEASUREMENTS AND CRATER STATISTICS FOR ARISTILLUS IMPACT CRATER.  S. Dhingra1 and A. Bhattacharya1, 1Centre of Studies in Resources Engineering, IIT Bombay, Powai, Mumbai-400076, India (swinks@iitb.ac.in)     Introduction: Aristillus crater is a 55 km lunar impact crater that lies on the eastern side of Mare Imbrium, located at 33.90 N, 1.20 E. This rayed crater has a rough interior and an ejecta blanket easily distinguished from the surrounding mare region. Rays from Aristillus crater crossed and deposited some exotic ejecta material at the Apollo 15 landing site. The age of Aristillus was inferred to be 1.3 Gyr from the analysis of Apollo 15 samples and from the observation of optical maturity of Aristillus crater ejecta [1][2]. Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Narrow Angle Camera (LROC NAC) images allow the measurement of small crater sizes due to its high resolution. Crater counts using high resolution images can further ascertain the age of crater. Spatial density of craters contributes to the topographic roughness of the region depending upon the length scale of measurement. Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) data has been used to determine surface roughness characteristics of the Aristillus crater.    Data and methods:  For our study, we used a global mosaic of LRO wide-angle camera (WAC) images with a resolution of 100 m/pixel as a basemap. The high resolution map-projected LRO narrow angle camera (NAC) images were used to identify the study areas. We selected two geologically homogeneous units: one on the interior of aristillus crater (around 34.236○N, 0.959○E) and other in the proximal ejecta region outside the northern rim of the crater (around 35.043○N, 0.986○E). LROC NAC images with a resolution as high as 1m/pixel allow us to perform detailed crater counts and size measurements. Crater Size Frequency Distribution (CSFD) measurements can be used for deriving absolute model ages (AMAs) [3]. CraterTools [4] extension  was used in ArcGIS for crater counting and CraterStats [5] was used to plot CSFDs using the chronology function (CF) and production function (PF)  in [6], which is valid in the diameter interval of 10 m to 100 km. The regions of interest have suffered from secondary impacts and we tried to avoid nonhomogeneously distributed secondary craters.  For the same identified regions, we performed roughness calculations using Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) data. LOLA collects sequential elevation measurements for the lunar surface in a configuration consisiting of five spots. Each measurement is separated by ~56 m along the track and the minimum distance between two laser spots is ~25 m [7]. We used topographic root mean square (rms) planar offset and rms slope as an indicator of roughness. These parameters represent the roughness of lunar surface at the scale of  25-100 m. To estimate rms offset from the data, a least square plane was fit to a set of three successive spot patterns and the rms value of the residuals was used as an estimate of the surface roughness. The angle between the best-fit plane and the horizontal gives a measure of rms slope. These are the popular statistical measures used to characterize the roughness of terrain. The rms slope tends to emphasize on the prominent features of the terrain [8].  Results and Discussion:  As stated earlier, we dated the two regions of interest on the crater interior and the ejecta blanket by sampling crater populations. The LROC NAC image used for the purpose is M190595203R. The area of the region considered on the crater floor is 3.96 km2. On the basis of CSFD measurements (figure 1), we determined an absolute model age (AMA) for the aristillus floor region as ~ 1.1 Ga, which is close to the age as suggested for Aristillus crater in [1] and [2]. Spatial density of craters is higher on aristillus floor as compared to Copernicus floor as indicated by AMA  of ~478 Ma (for Copernicus) [9]. To study the roughness of the crater interior, LOLA data points were selected in the same region of crater floor. The histogram for the rms planar offset for this region is shown in figure 2. The median rms offset and the associated standard deviation value for this region is (0.96±0.57) m. The frequency distribution for rms slope (also for the same region) is shown in figure 3. The median rms slope is reported as (2.51±2.74)○. The area of the ejecta region considered above the northern rim of the crater is 1.01 km2 and the estimated AMA from the isochron fitting comes out to be ~ 600 (±200Ma). Secondary craters were carefully avoided during crater count. The estimated age is not a representative of the age of ejecta blanket. More regions on the ejecta need to be sampled to ascertain its age by crater density measurements. Earlier, the discrepancies have been reported in the age of floor and ejecta and various reasons have been attributed to it [9].  As for the crater floor,  rms offset was also calculated for the ejecta region for which the median rms offset value is reported as (0.72±0.31) m. The median rms slope for the same region is calculated as (5.96±2.42)○. The baseline for roughness measurements is 25-100 m. Higher value of rms offset is indicative of higher surface roughness. 2041.pdf

The frequency of primary impacts is a direct function of age. The older surface is ideally expected to be smooth. But the roughness is always specified with respect to a length scale. The scale of roughness measurements presented here is 25-100 m. Crater populations in this diameter range contribute the topographic roughness on this length scale. For these particular regions considered, floor region appears to be rougher as compared to the ejecta. Even for Copernicus and Tycho crater, similar trend has been observed [8]. But these craters are younger as compared to Aristillus crater, so here the topographic variations due to high crater density could explain the roughness observations at this scale. Roughness measures can be examined over other regions to see the trend. The median slope for the ejecta volume is more compared to the crater interior which is expected; but the floor region also has wide variation the local slope values. Ejecta regions typically have large local slopes.   Conclusions:  Frequencies of the crater sizes were measured on the floor and ejecta blanket of the Aristillus crater. Absolute model age derived from this data for the crater floor is consistent with inferred age in [1] and [2]. Aristillus crater  is radiometrically dated at 1.3 Ga. Crater counts reinforce this age. Roughness characteristics were measured for the same regions. Sampling crater populations from other regions might give more insight into age and roughness. We need to explore the relationship between spatial crater density and surface roughness characteristics at a scale of 25-100 m and how the roughness of craters has evolved with time. While counting craters, overestimation or underestimation of primary craters may lead to misleading absolute model ages. Randomness analysis needs to be performed to discriminate primary craters from secondary craters and to discern clustering effects, particularly in the case of an old crater.
