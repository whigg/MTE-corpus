As part of a coordinated world- and solar system-wide observing campaign, we report production rates for H2O and eight trace molecules (CO, C2H6, CH4, CH3OH, NH3, H2CO, HCN, C2H2) using the high-resolution spectrographs NIRSPEC [2] at Keck 2 and CSHELL [3] at the NASA-IRTF on ten pre-perihelion dates encompassing Rh = 1.213 - 0.344 AU.  Significant studies that emerged include spatially resolved measurements of H2O excitation in the coma [4, 5], a 3σ upper limit for HDO/H2O of 2.0 VSMOW [6], and serial measurements of H2O production and of molecular abundance ratios as functions of Rh [5, 7].  Spatially Resolved Excitation of H2O: The rotational temperature (Trot) of water was measured along the slit (Fig. 1).  This study revealed that elevated values of Trot persisted to beyond 1000 km from the nucleus, above those expected if adiabatic cooling dominated excitation conditions in the coma.  This work is driving physical coma models [8], which in turn provide synergy with observations.  Figure 1.  Spatially resolved measurements of dust continuum and gaseous H2O emission intensities, together with Trot of H2O along the CSHELL slit, which was oriented with respect to the projected sunward direction as shown in each panel, on (A) UT November 17.73 and (B) November 22.74.  Respective Rh-values are also indicated. Production Rates and Molecular Abundances: Water Production Rates. Thirty-two measurements spanned two orders of magnitude (Fig. 2).  We found a long-term heliocentric dependence consistent with Q(H2O) = (1.89 ± 0.11) x 1028 Rh(-3.10±0.09), based on 25 of these that we take to represent "baseline" measurements of water production in Comet ISON.  Figure 2. Evolution of water production in Comet ISON spanning 2013 October 22 through November 22.  The NIRSPEC results were obtained simultaneously on each date; the points on November 7 are separated horizontally only to visualize them more clearly.  Of the 32 measurements, seven (in dashed boxes) were associated with periods of enhanced water production (i.e., with "outbursts").  A heliocentric fit (dot-dashed line) excluding these seven points resulted in a power law steeper than the canonical insolation-limited Rh-2 slope.  Molecular Abundance Ratios. Abundances of CO, C2H6, and CH4 with respect to H2O were relatively constant with Rh, and were below their corresponding mean values measured among a dominant sample of Oort cloud comets.  CH3OH was also depleted for Rh > 0.5 AU, but was closer to its mean value for Rh ≤ 0.5 AU.  The remaining four molecules exhibited higher abundance ratios within 0.5 AU: for Rh > 0.8 AU, NH3 and C2H2 were consistent with their mean values while H2CO and HCN were depleted.  For Rh < 0.5 AU all four were enriched, with NH3, H2CO, and HCN increasing most (Fig. 3, Table 1). 2149.pdf

 Figure 3. Evolution of abundance ratios relative to H2O in Comet ISON, with molecules listed at right.  Points shown in red were measured during periods of enhanced gas production (i.e., during "outburst").  No discernable dependence of composition on "baseline" versus "outburst" activity was seen.
