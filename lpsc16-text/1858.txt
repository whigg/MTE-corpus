DIKE-RELATED FAULT MORPHOLOGY FROM STRUCTURAL MAPPING OF SIRENUM FOSSAE. Elizabeth A. Carey Boden (eboden@tulane.edu) and Nancye H. Dawers, Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA, 70118, USA.    Introduction: Tharsis is an extensional volcanic province and planetary analog to terrestrial magmatic rifts. An extensive system of narrow closely spaced graben, Sirenum Fossae, radiates southwestward from Arsia Mons through a complex and ancient terrain of the cratered uplands. Cross-sections of the graben reveal distinct geometric properties [1,2] that indicate dike-related graben formation [3,4]. On Earth magmatic and erosional processes remove evidence of dikerelated graben formation, which is an important component of rift initiation. Lower rates of erosion and a rigid Martian cryosphere provide a unique opportunity to examine similar features in a relatively pristine state. We examine the structural, geomorphic and magmatic features in an approximately 840,000 km2 area to characterize relationships between the graben and other surface features. Previous work [5] describes Sirenum Fossae extending to the 180 meridian and not to the end of the graben system; here we determine the total length of Sirenum Fossae. Our objective is to identify properties of the graben that are diagnostic of dikeinduced graben formation, and place them into a regional context. Data & Methods: Structural mapping was performed at 1:100,000 scale using over 320 images (~6 m/pixel) from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) Context Camera (CTX). CTX images were located using PILOT [6], then projected and downloaded using POW [7]. Digitization was carried out manually using ESRI's ArcGIS v.10.3. Observations: The Sirenum Fossae graben system extends about 3,360 km from [136.2 W, 22.3S] to [172.1 E,  39.4 S]. The majority of graben strike ~080 and based on cross-cutting relationships appear to postdate graben that strike ~065 (Fig. 1). Fissures are inferred where multiple channels originate from a linear source (Fig. 2). These linear fissures are of the same orientation as the strike of the older graben. Sinuous valleys, similar to terrestrial fluvial features, originate from these fissures and are interpreted as paleochannels. The fissures may therefore have formed during the earlier diking episodes, and served as sources for outflow channels and groundwater sapping.   Sirenum Fossae normal faults primarily occur as full-graben boundary faults, in contrast to normal faults in terrestrial rift zones that are typically halfgraben. Simple graben are less common than complex or compound graben, indicating that compound graben may have formed by fault-facilitated segment linkage due to repeated episodes of dike injection (Fig. 3). Abandoned splays within graben arrays and complex graben resemble those observed in terrestrial fault systems, which imply a long period of tectonic evolution.  Thrust-fault-related landforms (TFRLfs) are oriented roughly perpendicular to the normal faults that border the Sirenum graben. Mutual cross-cutting relationships between normal and thrust faults suggest coeval extensional and compressional tectonics. Elongate, asymmetrical and irregularly shaped depressions, interpreted to be collapse features, are frequently Figure 1: Rotated (342) CTX digital image mosaic showing the different strike directions (green ~065° and pink ~080° ) of normal faults in Sirenum Fossae.

oriented parallel to the graben or located on graben floors. Characterized by smooth or scalloped rims with convex inward-sloping walls, these negative topographic features lack a raised outer rim or displaced ejecta material characteristic of impact craters. Collapse features coinciding with dike-related graben likely formed by the collapse of shallow crustal rock, possibly due to magma evacuation (either with or without explosive volcanism due to volatile release) or due to outflow of ice melt-water. Summary and Conclusions: Sirenum Fossae extends from the base of Arsia Mons at [136.2 W, 22.3 S] to the the floor of an adjoining pair of impact craters at [172.1 E, 39.4 S]. The graben system extends over 3,360 km in length. Mapping deformational and geomorphic features reveals patterns and relationships that support the dike-related graben hypothesis. Repeated episodes of dike intrusion can explain the complex cross-cutting relationships exhibited by paleochannels and graben. There appears to be a relationship between the graben and source locations for paleochannels, suggesting melting of permafrost. Upwelling mantle plumes during the formation of Tharsis would have been accompanied by laterally propagating dikes [8,9]. Perpendicular and coeval TFRLFs and normal faults are consistent with expected stresses produced during the formation of the Tharsis Montes.  References: [1] Rubin, A.M. and Pollard, D.D.

Mapped faults in Sirenum Fossae are primarily complex graben and graben arrays. This indicates that the fault system evolved over a long period of time, rather than having formed during a single diking episode. 1858.pdf
