Introduction:  Cosmic dust, interplanetary, circumplanetary and interstellar, provides a wealth of information about its sources and the environments through which it has passed. Cosmic dust is primarily composed of minerals (e.g. silicates, carbides, sulfides, chlorides [1]), metals (e.g. Fe and Ni [2]) and organics (whether volatiles, such as water ice [3], or more stable, refractory organics, such as graphites, tholins or poly-aromatic hydrocarbons e.g. [4]). Interaction between cosmic dust and other objects in the solar system, whether they are man-made detectors or natural surfaces and atmospheres, tends to occur at high velocities - typically faster than the speed of sound in either the impacting dust or the target medium. These impacts are known as hypervelocity impacts and they produce a variety of phenomena including cratering [5], impact plasmas [6] and charge generation [7]. Analysis of crater residues [5], aerogel tracks [8], impact plasmas [6], impact charges [7] and/or crater morphologies [5] may reveal compositional, structural, morphological and dynamical information about the impinging dust grains, and hence their source bodies or regions. These analyses require laboratory calibration, which in turn means accelerating cosmic dust analogues to similar velocities as would be encountered in nature. Two primary methods exist to attain such high velocities (km s-1) on Earth: light gas guns and electrostatic (Van de Graaff) accelerators [9]. Light gas guns can accelerate projectiles up to velocities of approximately 7 km s-1. Single projectiles larger than ~300 µm, or multiple simultaneous smaller projectiles,  may be fired (a "buckshot" approach). Some facilities (e.g. that at the University of Kent) are capable of wholegun cooling, allowing frozen projectiles to be fired. Van de Graaff accelerators offer higher velocities (up to 100 km s-1) and single-particle control at the expense of reduced particle size and mass. Dust analogues for use in light gas guns are subject to less stringent physical criteria (essentially just needing to be well-characterised) than those intended for use in electrostatic accelerators, which (with the exception of those for use in novel accelerator sources [10]), require grains capable of charging in the accelerators' dust sources. In the case of non-conductive materials, such as the majority of minerals, this requires the application of a thin conductive coating to the surfaces of the grains. Typical coating materials are conductive polymers, such as polypyrrole [11] or metals, such as platinum [12].  Analogues accelerated in light gas guns have so far included metals, minerals (including sodium chloride, carbonates), ices and organics. Those accelerated in Van de Graaff accelerators include metals (Fe, Ni, Cu, Ag etc. [13]), graphite, Ag-coated glass, organics (primarily polypyrrole-coated latexes [14]) and minerals (polypyrrole or Pt coated, including olivine, orthopyroxene, anorthite, silica and pyrrhotite [14,15,16]).  Here we present our latest progress in creating cosmic dust analogues which simulate icy, volatile-rich grains or low-density silicate grains, together with advances in conductive coating using lower density metals. Method and Results:  Hollow silica particles (Fig. 1), designed to approximate low density "fluffy" silicate cosmic dust particles, have been produced, using a condensation method (Stöber synthesis), from hydrolysed phenyltrimethoxysilane (PTMS) [17].    Figure 1: ~200 nm hollow silica particles.  The particles have been coated with polypyrrole and successfully accelerated to hypervelocities in the Heidelberg Van de Graaff accelerator. TGA analysis after coating showed a secondary decomposition phase at approximately 500 ºC, possibly indicative of encapsulated, unreacted liquid PTMS within the  core of the 2243.pdf

synthesized grains. The grains were found, on average, to have a density of 1330 kg m-3, approximately 67% of that expected for solid particles produced by the Stöber method [18].  Further approaches to producing silica-shelled, liquid (water) filled particles have been undertaken. Typical methods include the formation of water-in-oil (W/O) emulsions, stabilized by surfactants [19] or hydrophilic nanoparticles [20], followed by deposition of silica from e.g. tetraethyl orthosilicate [18,21] (Fig. 2) and surface treatment with silanes such as mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane or similar [12]. Ethanol-filled, 200 nm polymer shells have also been coated with silica using a similar technique. The latest method tested so far is the production of waterfilled silica shells by the staggered melting of W/O surfactant-free emulsions flash-frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen.   Figure 2: SEM image of deflated silica shells formed around water droplets in a W/O emulsion.   To enable charging and acceleration in electrostatic accelerators, a facile, one-pot method for electroless plating Sn onto mineral grains has been developed and applied. Mineral surfaces are pre-treated with mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane (MPTMS) forming a functionalized surface layer [12]. Particles are suspended in a suitable solvent, in which SnCl2 is dissolved. Rapid reduction of the SnCl2 to Sn metal, which deposits on the functionalized surface (Fig. 3), is then induced by addition of a powerful reducing agent, NaBH4.The thin (nm) layer of Sn formed by this process is approximately a third of the mass of a similar Pt layer, whilst retaining excellent conductive properties.  Summary:   Progress in producing novel analogues for low density and/or volatile-rich cosmic dust has been presented, together with a new one-pot method for applying a light, low density, conductive metallic coating to cosmic dust analogue grains.
