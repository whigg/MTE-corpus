The GEKKO system stored all of the latest SP data products [3][4]. Figure 1 shows an image of GEKKO. One sample of theobserved SP spactrum is represented on the lunar basemap. GEKKO commenced service in August 2014:the system is operated by CAIST at the University ofAizu [5].This paper presents the technical details of the latestversion of the GEKKO system, which utilizes the greatadvantages of a Web Map Service (WMS).Data and previous work: JAXA provides allthe Kaguya data including SP data products in PDScompatible formats via the “SELENE (Kaguya) DataArchive” web site [6]. The SP product consists ofthree types of data: spectral data, ancillary data suchas its georeference data, and simultaneous observationimages. Due to the such irregular structure of the contents, the user cannot access the data simply using applications that accept the PDS format.Terazono et al. [7] developed a web application“WISE-CAPS” with which the user can view SP spectrafor a limited area, although the system focuses on supporting collaborative analysis by several researchers.They adopted aWeb Feature Service (WFS) as a methodfor distribution of SP data. We discuss the differencesbetween WFS and WMS latter of which we adopted forGEKKO.System requirements: To develop a hyperspectraldata viewer, the following two points should be considered. First, the observation spots are discontinuous, andit is therefore difficult to generate mosaic images for distribution, as there are intervals between the observationswaths located along every track. Second, the data arecontinuous spectra with high spectral resolution. For example, a single SP spectrum consists of 296 reflectanceFigure 1: Appearance of GEKKO application.data. Even if we were to obtain a mosaic image of SP,296 layers would be prepared in total which is not easyfor the user to view them. Thus, the distribution of SPdata requires novel technical frame.Distribution methods: Two methods are availablefor distribution of SP data, i.e., WFS and WMS, following the standards of the Open Geospatial Consortium[8].In provider side context, WFS is a protocol for distribution of feature data as vector format to a client overthe internet. If the SP data are treated as featureson WFS, a “GetFeature” request should be used to distribute the SP data. GetFeature is a command wherebythe user indicates the bounding box (i.e., a rectangulararea indicated by the locations of two points) and gets aresponse with the features within its area.On the other hand, WMS is a protocol for distributionof map data as an image format to a client over the internet. If the SP data are treated as features on WMS,a “GetFeatureInfo” request distributes the SP data. GetFeatureInfo is a command by which the user indicatesa location point on a map layer. The user gets the response from the server accompanied by some featuresthat are linked to the areas requested by the user.A WFS protocol has the ability to distribute a largeamount of data. So, the protocol might be a general method for distributing feature data. GetFeature inWFS publishes the data for a large area at a time. GetFeatureInfo in WMS publishes the minimum data at the1920.pdf

Therefore, we focused on the advantagesof WMS and adopted it to distribute data through theGEKKO system.Implementation: GEKKO distributes SP data using the GetFeatureInfo request on WMS. A systemoverview is shown in Figure 2. This web application integrates mainly OpenLayers on the client side,and MapServer on the server side.MapServer distributes three types of data: SP spectraldata, background image and SP observational footprint.The spectral data have a table structure consistingof the wavelengths of 296 bands and the observed reflectance of the same number of bands. There are twoways to distribute the SP spectral data to the user: (i)deliver the data themselves, or (ii) deliver a graph generated from the data. GEKKO adopts (i) with the following data flow steps, because the user can modify thegraph. First, SP data are distributed using GetFeatureInfo in WMS. The data format is JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), for convenience on the client side. Next,GEKKO Library accepts the JSON format data fromthe server and draws a spectrum graph in the browser(botom center of Figure 1) on the user side (Figure 2).SP data are not image data. So, background imagesare necessary to identify the observation spots. GEKKOprepares several images for the base map, such as themosaic images from theMulti-band Imager on board theKaguya, the Wide Angle Camera on board Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), and the topographic mapfrom the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter on board LRO.In addition, GEKKO is able to show simultaneous observation images from TC or MI at full resolution asbackground images. These background images are distributed using “GetMap” requests in WMS.The distribution of SP footprints is critically important, as the footprints on the background image (basemap) are the keys to link the features with locations.Upon receipt of a GetMap request in WMS, the footprints are distributed as an image layer from the serverafter rendering by MapServer.With regard to the GetFeatureInfo request in WMS,the response is limited to the area where the footprintsare displayed. The footprints can be categorized intoseveral groups according to various criteria and visualized accordingly. In Figure 1, the footprints arecolor-corded to indicate the Kaguya spacecraft altitude;the lower the altitude is, the better the data quality becomes (S/N ratio and spatial resolution). Thus the usercan easily check whether such data are available for theregion of interest. In addition, GEKKO offers a function wherein the user can choose to show or hide thegroups of footprints according to their preference.Conclusion: GEKKO is a unique system using a new method for distributing hyperspectral data.GEKKO focuses on the simplicity and convenience ofviewing the SP data on a web browser, rather than distributing massive data at a time. Taking advantageof WMS, the GEKKO system succeeds in displayingthe SP observation footprints categorized according customized criteria on the base map, which helps in visualization of the hyperspectral data. The differencebetween WFS and WMS for distribution of SP data isremarked as the difference of which side the data are visualized on: the user side in WFS or the server side inWMS. If a system does not require to distribute a largeamount of data at a time, and the data provider can prepare visualized data from hyperspectral data, the WMSmethod is recommended.References[1] JAXA.
