Introduction: The short-lived 107Pd-107Ag system	  is well suited to date iron meteorites, because the high Pd/Ag of metals combined with low Pd/Ag in troilites makes it possible to obtain precise Pd-Ag isochrons [e.g., 1, 2]. To utilize Pd-Ag chronometry meaningfully it is necessary to know the closure temperature (Tc) of diffusive exchange of Pd and Ag among the different minerals in iron meteorites. Knowledge of Tc is essential not only for using Pd-Ag ages to constrain cooling rates, but also for interpreting the Ag isotope systematics of individual iron meteorites correctly. For instance, in spite of their low Pd/Ag, troilites in magmatic iron meteorites often show elevated 107Ag/109Ag compared to the initial 107Ag/109Ag defined by regression of a metal isochron [e.g., 1, 2]. This unsupported radiogenic 107Ag in troilites may be the result of a disturbance of the Pd-Ag system some time after initial cooling, but it could also reflect a lower Pd-Ag closure temperature of metal near troilites compared to more distant metals.      To address these issues, we modeled the closure temperature of the Pd-Ag system in iron meteorites.  To compare the modeling results to actual Pd-Ag data, we also conducted a detailed Pd-Ag study of the IIIAB iron meteorite Cape York (Agpalilik) and analyzed a large troilite nodule, its surrounding metal and several metal pieces far away from any visible troilite.  Samples and analytical methods:  We investigated several metal pieces from a large slab of Cape York containing two large troilite inclusions (~1 cm and ~0.5 cm in size). Several metal pieces (~1-3 g) at least 3 cm away from the ~1 cm troilite inclusion were analyzed (hereafter referred to as 'normal' metal), as well as four metal pieces in direct contact with the large troilite. The large troilite inclusion was broken into several pieces that were analyzed separately. The Pd/Ag ratio and Ag isotopic composition of these samples were determined using our established procedures [3], and all isotope measurements were conducted on the Thermo Scientific® Neptune Plus MC-ICPMS at Münster. The Ag isotope data are reported in ε107Ag as the parts per 10,000 deviations from the mean 107Ag/109Ag obtained for measurements of bracketing runs of the NIST 978a Ag standard. Closure temperature of the Pd-Ag system:  Simultaneous production and diffusive exchange of radiogenic Ag between metal (kamacite + taenite) and troilite during cooling was simulated numerically. The diffusivity of Ag in kamacite is two orders of magnitude faster than in taenite. For simplicity, we considered Ag exchange to be controlled by bulk diffusion in the metal, neglecting grain boundary diffusion and assuming that the proportions of kamacite and taenite during cooling follow the equilibrium phase diagram. Equilibrium partitioning of Ag between metal and troilite is assumed at their interface.   Fig. 1: Metal-troilite closure temperature for the PdAg system as a function of cooling rate and Ni content. Our results show that in addition to cooling rate and grain size, the Pd-Ag closure temperature is sensitive to the bulk Ni content and troilite abundance. In general, metal-troilite closure temperatures for the PdAg system are in the range of 550-700 °C (Fig. 1). For Cape York with a Ni content of ~8 wt%, we obtained an average closure temperature of ~570°C (at cooling rate of 30 K/Myr). This estimate is lower than a closure temperature of ~800°C estimated in a previous study that used Ni diffusion as a proxy for the Ag diffusivity in the metal [4].  0 1 2 3 4 5 400 450 500 550 600 650 Distance from troilite (cm) Cl os ur e te mpe ra tu re (o C) Fig. 2: Dependence of closure temperature on the distance of metal from troilite. The dashed line shows the "bulk" closure temperature, which considers the average isotopic composition of the metal.   In detail, however, the closure temperature varies for different metal pieces, depending on how far away from troilite they are. For metal in immediate contact with  troilite, Tc can be as low as ~500 °C, while Tc for metals far away from troilite is ~600 °C (Fig. 2). As we will show below, this difference in closure temperatures as a function of distance from troilite can be used to estimate cooling rates from Pd-Ag data. Pd-Ag systematics of Cape York metal and troilite: The metal pieces sampled distant from the troilite nodule (i.e., the 'normal' metals) are characterized by quite uniform Pd and Ag concentrations resulting in similarly uniform 108Pd/109Ag of between ~340 and ~360. The Ag isotopic compositions of these normal metals are also similar with ε107Ag between ~66 and ~75. In contrast, metals sampled in direct contact to the troilite have lower Ag concentrations resulting in higher 108Pd/109Ag (up to ~810) and more radiogenic ε107Ag (between ~99 and ~128) compared to the normal metals. As expected, all troilites have very low 108Pd/109Ag and show the least radiogenic ε107Ag with values between ~10 and ~18.  0 200 400 600 800 050 100 150 108Pd/109Ag ε1 07 Ag Cape York (Agpalilik) Troilite 'Normal' metal Metal near troilite (107Pd/108Pd)i = (2.00±0.07) × 10-5 (107Pd/108Pd)i = (1.60±0.14) × 10-5 Fig. 3: Pd-Ag isochron for metal and troilite samples from Cape York. Regressions calculated using IsoPlot. The Pd-Ag data for the Cape York metal and troilite samples do not define a single isochron (Fig. 3), because the metals near troilite plot on a correlation line with shallower slope than the normal metals (Fig. 3). Regressing the two groups of metals separately, and using the lowest and highest ε107Ag for troilites in the regression of the normal metals and metals near troilite, respectively, results in two correlation lines with distinct slopes. If these correlation lines are interpreted as isochrons, then the difference in their slopes corresponds to a time difference of 2.1±0.9 Ma.  Cooling rate of Cape York:  The Pd-Ag data combined with the simulation of Tc can be used to evaluate the origin of the two distinct isochrons and to determine a cooling rate for Cape York. Fig. 2 above shows that the Pd-Ag closure temperature increases with increasing distance of the metal from troilite: the Pd-Ag system in metal near troilite closed at a lower temperature and, hence, later than in metals more distant from troilites. This difference in closure temperatures combined with the apparent age difference obtained from the two isochrons for normal metals and metals near troilite (Fig. 3) can then be used to estimate a cooling rate for Cape York. Fig. 4 shows the dependence of an apparent age difference between the two isochrons from the cooling rate obtained from our simulation of Ag diffusion between metal and troilite. Using this relation and the age difference of the two Cape York isochrons of 2.1±0.9 Myr results in a cooling rate of 25±15 K/Myr. This cooling rate is lower than typical metallographic cooling rates determined for other IIIAB iron meteorites [5], but is in good agreement with a cooling rate of 15 K/Myr determined for Cape York using the size of the cloudy zone [6]. 0 20 40 60 01 23 Cooling rate (K/Myr) Ap pa re nt ti me di ffe re nc e (M yr )Cooling rate 25±15 K/Myr Δt = 2 .1 ±0 .9 M yr Fig. 4: Difference in the time of Pd-Ag closure in metals distant and close to troilite as a function of the cooling rate at Tc. Conclusions:  The metal-troilite closure temperature of the Pd-Ag system in iron meteorites is in the range of 550 to 700 °C. Within a given iron meteorite, Tc varies depending on the metal-troilite distance and is lower close to the troilite. Thus, the unsupported radiogenic Ag observed for troilites in some iron meteorites may reflect slow cooling and later Pd-Ag closure rather than a late disturbance by a secondary event. The dependence of Tc from the metal-troilite distance can be used to determine cooling rates by analyzing metals close to and more distant to troilite. Using this approach, we show that at the time of Pd-Ag closure the IIIAB iron Cape York cooled at 25±15 K/Myr.  References: [1] Chen, J.H. and G.J. Wasserburg (1990) GCA, 54, 1729-1743.
