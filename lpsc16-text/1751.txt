Introduction:  Fine-grained clastic and chemical sedimentary rocks deposited in lakes and oceans provide a valuable proxy record of the secular dynamics of the Earth's surface environment. They have been used to deduce e.g., the nature and extent of variations in global climate [1], the evolution of the composition of the Earth's crust [2], and biologically-driven changes in the redox state of the Earth's atmosphere [3]. Such rocks have the important property of being relatively impermeable compared to their coarser-grained counterparts, enabling them to more effectively resist post-depositional alteration processes that might modify or destroy a primary proxy signal. Accordingly, those locales on Mars that contain layered sedimentary rocks linked to deposition in rivers, lakes, and seas garner widespread attention. Indeed, a primary motivation behind the selection of Gale Crater as the landing site for the Curiosity rover was the presence of a ~5km tall mountain of layered sedimentary rock that was hypothesized to contain a long temporal record of secular changes in Martian surface environments [4, 5]. Curiosity landed in Gale Crater in August 2012 and within ~1-year of landing (ca. sol 300 of the mission), had completed an extensive investigation of the stratigraphy, sedimentology, geochemistry, mineralogy, and geochronology of a sequence of clastic sedimentary rocks (sandstones and mudstones) located ~0.5 km east of her landing site. Informally named the Yellowknife Bay formation (YkB fm.), these rocks were deposited in an ancient (ca. 3.5 Ga) fluvio-lacustrine environment with the geochemical potential to support microbial metabolism [6-9]. The mudstones of the YkB fm. were analyzed by the full suite of instruments onboard Curiosity, and yielded evidence that the lake they were deposited in was characterized by anoxic, neutral to alkaline pH water conditions [9, 10]. More recently (between ca. sols 720 and 1000), Curiosity embarked on a similarly detailed investigation of a succesion of mudstones and interbedded sandstones that are topographically and stratigraphically higher than the YkB fm. Informally named the Murray fm., these rocks were deposited dominantly in a lacustrine setting [11], whose fluid chemistry will be explored in this contribution. Mudstones from the YkB and Murray fms., separated by ~70m of vertical stratigraphy and an unknown period of time, provide an opportunity to compare and contrast the properties of two sets of fine-grained clastic sedimentary rocks related by a common depositional setting on the surface of another planet. Data Sources: We use tabulated mineral abundances produced by the Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin) instrument team for the YkB fm. samples "John Klein" and "Cumberland", and Murray fm. samples "Confidence Hills", "Mojave", "Telegraph Peak", and "Buckskin". We use tabulated element oxide abundance data produced by the Alpha Particle Xray Spectrometer (APXS) instrument team for samples analyzed between sols 129-487 and 696-1091 from the YkB and Murray fms., respectively. Results, Discussion: In the upper panel of Fig. 1, we group the phases detected by CheMin to show the relative proportions of salts (mainly Ca-sulfates), amorphous materials, clastic igneous minerals (incl. silica polymorphs), and secondary minerals (incl. opaline silica). In the lower panel of Fig. 1 we show the phases that comprise the "secondary" category in order to demonstrate that there is significant variation in secondary mineralogy between the YkB and Murray fms., and within the Murray fm. itself. We recognize two significant changes in secondary mineralogy: (1) 1751.pdf

Fig. 2: CIA (%) vs. SiO2 (wt %) for the YkB and Murray fms. and vectors modeling SiO2 and sulfate addition (crosses represent 10% addition). Also shown: examples of terrestrial basaltic weathering [16, 17]  there is a decrease in the abundance of phyllosilicate minerals, and an overall increase in the oxidation state of redox sensitive secondary Fe-minerals (oxides, sulfides, sulfates) between the YkB fm. and the base of the Murray fm. (2) Stratigraphically higher in the Murray fm., phyllosilicates are absent, and a significant component of amorphous silica is observed. We posit that the observed changes in the nature and abundance of secondary minerals contained in the YkB and Murray fms. reflect evolving chemical conditions within the lake (or pore) waters that these sediments were deposited in. We suggest that the first major transition reflects a change in the redox state of the lake waters, with anoxic, neutral-alkaline pH waters promoting the formation of clay minerals and magnetite and the preservation of sulfide minerals in the YkB fm, while the lower Murray fm. reflects oxidative, lower pH water conditions (at least locally) in which the precipitation of ferric oxides and jarosite was promoted, consistent with detrital sulfide mineral dissolution by oxidizing lake/pore waters [12]. Interestingly, higher in the Murray formation, magnetite is the dominant redox sensitive mineral phase, perhaps reflecting a return to less oxidizing water conditions. The second major transition is associated with the formation of a significant component of amorphous silica (also associated with crystalline tridymite [13], which we classify as a detrital clastic mineral) and an increase in the overall SiO2 content (YkB fm. avg. SiO2 = 42.5 ± 3.2 wt%, Murray fm. = 53 ± 7.7 wt%). We posit that these changes could be driven by chemical processes within a lake water column. For example, the evaporative concentration of water that is slightly undersaturated with respect to amorphous silica could readily drive silica precipitation [3], as could a reduction in pH from an alkaline condition (pH>9), where silica solubility is high (100's-1000's ppm), to a circum-neutral pH condition, where silica solubility is a constant 125 ppm [14]. Major element geochemical relationships (Fig. 2) support the process of silica addition that we invoke to explain silica enrichment in the Murray fm (also see [15]). On this diagram, which plots the Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA, [1]) vs. SiO2 (wt %), we see that, relative to lower silica YkB and Murray fm. samples, the highest silica samples from the Murray are displaced horizontally, along a line of silica (and sulfate) addition. The observed relationships are inconsistent with silica enrichment from post-depositional weathering processes at neutral or acid pH [16, 17]. Finally, we note that the Murray fm. exhibits higher CIA values relative to the YkB fm., consistent with an increase in the extent of chemical weathering experienced by the source regions that were providing detrital sediment to the Murray fm. Viewed in the context of terrestrial sedimentary geochemistry [e.g., 1], these changes in CIA could be inferred to  reflect a change in climate between the YkB and Murray fms. Conclusions: Overall, the mudstones of the YkB and Murray fms, deposited in fluvio-lacustrine settings, preserve a dynamic record of variations in the chemical and redox state of lake waters in Gale Crater. Similar to terrestrial examples, e.g., Banded Iron Formation [3], the observed chemical and mineralogical variations can be used to understand the evolution of the climate and atmosphere on the ancient surface of Mars.
