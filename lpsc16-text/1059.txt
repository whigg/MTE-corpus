Introduction:  We propose to advance upon previous work by studying the effects of debris cover on terrestrial glaciers in order to ascertain how to best apply terrestrial  flow models to debris-covered Martian Lobate Debris Aprons (LDAs). We will follow the approach of Vacco et al. (2010; [1]) to incorporate the effects of debris cover into existing ice-flow models that we have already developed (e.g., [2], [3]). Our modeling  will  simulate  internal  deformation  of  ice  due  to gravitational  driving  stress  subject  to  a  physically based surface mass-exchange pattern (i.e., ablation and accumulation)  that  accounts  for  the  effects  of  debris cover,  and  we will  consider  rock  avalanches,  spatial variations in debris, and evolution of debris cover. For different problems, ice-flow models have been developed with different physical complexity, numerical  approximations, and computational sophistication. A basis of an ice-surface evolution model is mass conservation (e.g. [4]),                     ¶h(x) ¶t = - 1 W (x) ¶q(x) ¶x æè çö ø÷+ ḃ(x)                      (1) where along-flow gradients in the volumetric  flux of ice  q(x),  in  a  flowband  with  surface  profile,  S(x), bedrock profile,  B(x),  and width,  W(x),  must balance the rate of surface accumulation or ablation,  ḃ (x);  ice thickness  h = S−B. If applicable, inclusion of glacier width variations is considered a "flowband" model; if width is constant this is a "flowline" model. The surface calculation we use is  a  dynamic calculation because it incorporates the constitutive relation for strain rate. One constitutive relation, called Glen's flow law, describes ice flow by a non-linear relationship between strain rate and deviatoric stress, where deformation occurs primarily by dislocation creep. The flow-law exponent,  n,  is typically assumed to have a value of 3. However, under different temperature and stress conditions, and for different ice-grain sizes, deformation of ice may be influenced by, or even controlled by, processes other than dislocation creep. The mechanisms of dislocation  creep,  grain-boundary-sliding-limited creep,  and  basal-slip-limited  creep,  can  have  unique flow-law exponents  n, ice-grain-size exponents  p, and activation energies for creep Q (e.g., [5]). Assumptions for different flow-parameter values can be tested using ice-flow models. For this work we will develop a model that calculates  glacier  ice-surface  evolution  (including  supraglacial debris) and handles the protective influence of debris cover on ablation. We will use this model to (1) calculate the sensitivity of a generic glacier,  (2) evaluate the past decades evolution of the thinning Nisqually Glacier  and  the  thickening  Emmons  Glacier  on  Mt. Rainier, and then (3) test evolution hypotheses for select Martian LDAs. In  our  ice-dynamic calculation,  the  depth-averaged horizontal velocity in our flowline model comes from the Shallow Ice  Approximation (SIA,  [4]).  The SIA is a simplifying assumption that applies in cases where the ice thickness is much smaller than the characteristic horizontal length scales over which thickness or stress change significantly. If the characteristic horizontal length scale is the lateral extent of the glacier, then derivatives of velocities and stresses with respect to  x (horizontal axis) are generally much smaller than derivatives with respect to z (vertical axis). For Glen's flow law, the SIA depth-averaged horizontal velocity can be written as:      )( 2)(~2)( 1 1xH dx dS dx dSg nxAxu n nn               (2) where ρ is density,  g is gravitational acceleration, S(x) is ice-surface elevation, H(x) is ice thickness, and )(~ xA is an effective isothermal softness parameter. In the supraglacial debris calculation, following [1], debris is advected along the ice surface and also moved downslope by mass wasting. This is calculated as a mass diffusion: ¶hdebris ¶t =k ¶ 2Sdebris ¶x2 - ¶ ¶x hdebrisuice (Sice )( )+D       (3) Where hdebris is the thickness of supraglacial debris (meters), Sdebris is the supraglacial debris surface elevation, Sice is the ice-surface elevation,  uice(Sice) is the ice-surface velocity, κ is the mass diffusivity of debris (m2/yr), and D is the mass source of debris (m/yr). In this treatment of debris conservation and evolution, a mass diffusivity must be prescribed.  Vacco et  al.  [1]  pointed out that this process has not been well-studied, so they showed that their calculations were not affected by diffusivities an order of magnitude larger or smaller than their best estimate; we can perform a similar sensitivity test. If  the debris cover is thick enough, it will introduce an additional overburden stress. We will modify the  SIA  model  to  account  for  the  sediment  and  ice load, incorporating the debris-layer thickness and density.   Figure 1: (left from Reznichenko et al., 2011; [6]) Schematic showing evolution of a glacier after a rock avalanche. (right from Vacco et al., 2010; [1]) Model results for a glacier with a 2-km long and 35-cm thick rock avalanche at the terminus. Cartoon panels B-E roughly correspond to the model snapshots. Modeled debris layer shown with a thin black line in right panels, and is vertically exaggerated by 200 times. To treat the insulating effects of debris, we apply the melt-rate parameterization [1]: ṁdebris = ṁexp hdebris Hdebris *æ èç öø ÷             (4) where ṁdebris is the ablation rate with debris cover, ṁ is the ablation rate of bare glacier ice,  hdebris is the thickness of supraglacial debris, and H*debris is the thickness at which insulation of ice is effective ('e-folding thickness'  of  the debris).  H*debris is  usually assumed to be ~0.1 meters because even a thin layer of debris typically insulates underlying glacier ice [6]. However, if sitespecific information is available another value could be used: one of the main objectives of our field experiments will be to provide a better constraint on the effective insulating thickness.      We will parameterize terrestrial  ablation via the commonly-used Positive Degree Day (PDD) approach, which assumes that the ablation rate is proportional to the number of days above 0°C (positive degree days) and  utilizes  measured  temperature  and  precipitation fields. Running this model requires standard inputs of the glacier  geometry (bed topography,  ice thickness), the ice softness,  and the calculated surface mass exchange (accumulation and ablation), but also requires information about debris-cover thickness and the thickness at  which debris insulates underlying glacier  ice. Since there is no single terrestrial glacier that is a perfect  analogue to  Martian  ice  masses,  we will  design new model experiments relating to LDA evolution by first  exploring  the  sensitivity of  a  generic  terrestrial glacier, and then modeling two glaciers on Mt. Rainier, Washington that are the locations of our new field studies.  Mt.  Rainier  is  an  interesting  target  for  process-based  analogue  studies  because  many  glaciers flanking the volcano are debris-covered, there is a 40+ year observation record, and we will conduct new studies on Emmons Glacier (which has some of the most positive  thickness  change)  and  on  Nisqually Glacier (which  has  some  of  the  most  negative  thickness change).     Figure 1 illustrates the type of calculations we propose for new model scenarios relevant to our study. We will consider the effects of a rock avalanche at different locations along the glacier, as well as uniform and nonuniform debris cover that either insulates or promotes ablation. We will also parameterize the formation of a debris cover as a function of total surface ablation. We will present our preliminary results at the conference. References: [1]  Vacco  et  al.
