INFLUENCE OF DEBRIS COVER ON GLACIER-SURFACE EVOLUTION.  M.R. Koutnik1, A.V. Pathare2,C. Todd3, and E.D. Waddington1 1University of Washington, Earth and Space Sciences, Seattle, WA 98195 (mkoutnik@uw.edu), 2Planetary Science Institute (pathare@psi.edu), 3Pacific Lutheran University, Tacoma, WA.Introduction:  We propose to advance upon previous work by studying the effects of debris cover onterrestrial glaciers in order to ascertain how to best apply terrestrial  flow models to debris-covered MartianLobate Debris Aprons (LDAs). We will follow the approach of Vacco et al. (2010; [1]) to incorporate the effects of debris cover into existing ice-flow models thatwe have already developed (e.g., [2], [3]). Our modeling  will  simulate  internal  deformation  of  ice  due  togravitational  driving  stress  subject  to  a  physicallybased surface mass-exchange pattern (i.e., ablation andaccumulation)  that  accounts  for  the  effects  of  debriscover,  and  we will  consider  rock  avalanches,  spatialvariations in debris, and evolution of debris cover.For different problems, ice-flow models have beendeveloped with different physical complexity, numerical  approximations, and computational sophistication.A basis of an ice-surface evolution model is mass conservation (e.g. [4]),                     ¶h(x)¶t= - 1W (x)¶q(x)¶xæèçöø÷+ b˙(x)                      (1)where along-flow gradients in the volumetric  flux ofice  q(x),  in  a  flowband  with  surface  profile,  S(x),bedrock profile,  B(x),  and width,  W(x),  must balancethe rate of surface accumulation or ablation,  b˙ (x);  icethickness  h = S−B. If applicable, inclusion of glacierwidth variations is considered a “flowband” model; ifwidth is constant this is a “flowline” model. The surface calculation we use is  a  dynamic calculation because it incorporates the constitutive relation for strainrate. One constitutive relation, called Glen’s flow law,describes ice flow by a non-linear relationship betweenstrain rate and deviatoric stress, where deformation occurs primarily by dislocation creep. The flow-law exponent,  n,  is typically assumed to have a value of 3.However, under different temperature and stress conditions, and for different ice-grain sizes, deformation ofice may be influenced by, or even controlled by, processes other than dislocation creep. The mechanisms ofdislocation  creep,  grain-boundary-sliding-limitedcreep,  and  basal-slip-limited  creep,  can  have  uniqueflow-law exponents  n, ice-grain-size exponents  p, andactivation energies for creep Q (e.g., [5]). Assumptionsfor different flow-parameter values can be tested usingice-flow models.For this work we will develop a model that calculates  glacier  ice-surface  evolution  (including  supraglacial debris) and handles the protective influence ofdebris cover on ablation. We will use this model to (1)calculate the sensitivity of a generic glacier,  (2) evaluate the past decades evolution of the thinning NisquallyGlacier  and  the  thickening  Emmons  Glacier  on  Mt.Rainier, and then (3) test evolution hypotheses for select Martian LDAs. In  our  ice-dynamic calculation,  the  depth-averaged horizontal velocity in our flowline model comesfrom the Shallow Ice  Approximation (SIA,  [4]).  TheSIA is a simplifying assumption that applies in caseswhere the ice thickness is much smaller than the characteristic horizontal length scales over which thicknessor stress change significantly. If the characteristic horizontal length scale is the lateral extent of the glacier,then derivatives of velocities and stresses with respectto  x (horizontal axis) are generally much smaller thanderivatives with respect to z (vertical axis). For Glen’sflow law, the SIA depth-averaged horizontal velocitycan be written as:      )(2)(~2)( 11xHdxdSdxdSgnxAxu nnn          (2)where ρ is density,  g is gravitational acceleration, S(x)is ice-surface elevation, H(x) is ice thickness, and )(~ xAis an effective isothermal softness parameter. In the supraglacial debris calculation, following[1], debris is advected along the ice surface and alsomoved downslope by mass wasting. This is calculatedas a mass diffusion:¶hdebris¶t=k ¶2Sdebris¶x2- ¶¶xhdebrisuice (Sice )( )+D       (3)Where hdebris is the thickness of supraglacial debris (meters), Sdebris is the supraglacial debris surface elevation,Sice is the ice-surface elevation,  uice(Sice) is the ice-surface velocity, κ is the mass diffusivity of debris (m2/yr),and D is the mass source of debris (m/yr). In this treatment of debris conservation and evolution, a mass diffusivity must be prescribed.  Vacco et  al.  [1]  pointedout that this process has not been well-studied, so theyshowed that their calculations were not affected by diffusivities an order of magnitude larger or smaller thantheir best estimate; we can perform a similar sensitivitytest. If  the debris cover is thick enough, it will introduce an additional overburden stress. We will modifythe  SIA  model  to  account  for  the  sediment  and  iceload, incorporating the debris-layer thickness and density.1059.pdf

Cartoon panels B-E roughly correspond to the model snapshots. Modeled debris layer shown with a thin blackline in right panels, and is vertically exaggerated by 200 times.To treat the insulating effects of debris, we applythe melt-rate parameterization [1]:m˙debris = m˙exp hdebrisHdebris*æèçöø÷             (4)where m˙debris is the ablation rate with debris cover, m˙ isthe ablation rate of bare glacier ice,  hdebris is the thickness of supraglacial debris, and H*debris is the thicknessat which insulation of ice is effective (‘e-folding thickness’  of  the debris).  H*debris is  usually assumed to be~0.1 meters because even a thin layer of debris typically insulates underlying glacier ice [6]. However, if sitespecific information is available another value could beused: one of the main objectives of our field experiments will be to provide a better constraint on the effective insulating thickness.      We will parameterize terrestrial  ablation via thecommonly-used Positive Degree Day (PDD) approach,which assumes that the ablation rate is proportional tothe number of days above 0°C (positive degree days)and  utilizes  measured  temperature  and  precipitationfields. Running this model requires standard inputs ofthe glacier  geometry (bed topography,  ice thickness),the ice softness,  and the calculated surface mass exchange (accumulation and ablation), but also requiresinformation about debris-cover thickness and the thickness at  which debris insulates underlying glacier  ice.Since there is no single terrestrial glacier that is a perfect  analogue to  Martian  ice  masses,  we will  designnew model experiments relating to LDA evolution byfirst  exploring  the  sensitivity of  a  generic  terrestrialglacier, and then modeling two glaciers on Mt. Rainier,Washington that are the locations of our new field studies.  Mt.  Rainier  is  an  interesting  target  for  process-based  analogue  studies  because  many  glaciersflanking the volcano are debris-covered, there is a 40+year observation record, and we will conduct new studies on Emmons Glacier (which has some of the mostpositive  thickness  change)  and  on  Nisqually Glacier(which  has  some  of  the  most  negative  thicknesschange).     Figure 1 illustrates the type of calculations we propose for new model scenarios relevant to our study. Wewill consider the effects of a rock avalanche at differentlocations along the glacier, as well as uniform and nonuniform debris cover that either insulates or promotesablation. We will also parameterize the formation of adebris cover as a function of total surface ablation. Wewill present our preliminary results at the conference.References: [1]  Vacco  et  al.
