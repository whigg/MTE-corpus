GRAND FALLS DUNE FIELD – AN ANALOG LESSON ABOUT SEDIMENT FLUX.  T. N. Titus,1 R. K. Hayward1 and R. Bogle1, 1U.S. Geological Survey, Astrogeology Science Center, 2255 North Gemini Drive, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA.   Introduction:  The modern surface of Mars is modified by interactions with the atmosphere through polar and aeolian processes.  This abstract focuses on aeolian processes, specifically the characterization of sediment flux and what lessons are to be learned from terrestrial analogs. One such analog site is the Grand Falls (GF) dune field.  Analog Site: The GF dune field (~1.6 km x 1 km) is located ~70 km NE of Flagstaff, AZ, and just north of the Little Colorado River (LCR). The dunes at GF are in a local topographic minimum, migrating toward higher ground that will impede their progress. This setting is analogous to the setting of an estimated 1000 dune fields on Mars that occur within craters and valleys [1]. A more detailed description of the analog site can be found in Bogle et al. [2].  Most of the dune sand on Mars is likely of basaltic composition [e.g., 3]. Basalt sand is also present in significant amounts at GF, allowing us to observe its behavior under various atmospheric conditions. Bimodal grain size is another sand characteristic common to both GF and Mars [e.g., 4]. Instrumentation: We installed the following equipment (Figure 1) at GF: one custom-designed sediment sampler, three weighing BSNE (Big Spring Number Eight) sediment samplers that passively sample near-surface airborne particles and record the weight of the sample at one minute intervals, three anemometers, one directional anemometer, one solidstate saltation sensor, one CR-1000 data logger, two solar panels, and a battery power supply. The equipment has been actively collecting data since November 2013 and is shown in Fig. 1. The data collected from this suite of instruments will be released later this year as a U.S. Geological Survey Open File Report.   Figure 1: Equipment/instrument installation at Grand Falls dune field, 11/2013. The instruments shown are the anemometers, the weighing BSNEs, the Mars BSNE, and the Sensit™ saltation sensor. Sediment Flux Calculations: Sediment flux is usually expressed either in units of mass per unit area per unit time (horizontal mass flux (HMF), see equation 1) or as mass per length per unit time (horizontal mass transport (HMT), see equation 2) [5]:  [1]  𝐻𝐻𝐻 = �̇� = 𝑑𝑞𝑑𝑑= 𝑚 𝐴𝑑𝐴� = 𝜎𝑒−𝑧 𝑧0⁄  where m is the sediment mass, A is the areal crosssection of the BSNE opening, t is the integration time, and ε is the BSNE efficiency which is usually 0.4 [6]. If the HMF (𝑞̇) is measured at multiple heights (z), then an exponential function can be determined where 𝜎 is the HMF at one scale height (𝑧0).  [2]  𝐻𝐻𝐻 = 𝐻 = � �̇�∞0 𝑑𝑧 =  𝜎𝑧0 Equation 1 is the sediment flux through a unit area at a specified height – which is what an individual BSNE measures. Equation 2 is the sediment flux that passes through a horizontal unit length, vertically integrated from ground level to the top of the atmosphere – thus providing an estimate of the total amount of sediment transported by the atmosphere.   Figure 2: Height vs. Sediment Flux. The black curve is the best-fit curve if one assumes a single scale-height. The blue curve shows the best-fit if one assumes a bimodal sediment population with two distinct scale-heights. The red and green represent the basaltic and quartz components, respectively.  Sediment Flux Estimates from Bulk Samples: Several large wind events have occurred, providing the opportunity to compare wind events. The scale heights of the sediment flux vary little between these events, typically ranging between 17 cm and 22 cm. Sediment flux (HMT) appears to be independent of the sediment flux scale height and can vary from 2.6 to 6.7 kg/m/s. These estimates are based on assuming a single scale 1201.pdf

height (Eq. 1 and 2). An example of one of these fits is shown in Fig. 2 as the black line.    Figure 3: Sediment Flux Estimates assuming a bimodal grain size/density distributions.  (left) The blue line is the estimated sediment flux assuming a bimodal population, the black assumes a single population, the red and green lines are the sediment fluxes for the two populations separately.   Figure 4: A comparison of sediment flux estimates assuming a bimodal distribution vs. a single population. This is based on the model and not on actual sediment samples. The red pluses are the quartz and the green pluses are the basalt. The black pluses represent the total estimated flux. The dashed red line has a slope of 0.5 and shows that quartz tracks 50% of the flux if assuming a single population. The dashed black line has a slope of 1. The solid black line is the combined flux estimate and shows that single population assumption works well at low flux but can underestimate flux by a factor of 3 at high flux rates.  Sediment Flux Estimates for Bimodal Populations: The poor-fit of the standard single scale-height law to the measured sediment flux (as shown in Fig. 2) suggested that the combination of larger grain basaltic sediment and finer grain quartz sand could not be simply modeled with a single scale height. While not a unique solution, the use of a bimodal form of the standard flux equation provided a better fit.  [3] 𝐻𝐻𝐻 =  �̇� =  𝜎1𝑒𝑧 𝑧1� + 𝜎2𝑒𝑧 𝑧2�   Integrating equation 3 from z=0 (ground) to z=∞ (top of the atmosphere) results in equation 4.   [4] 𝐻𝐻𝐻 =  𝜎1𝑧1 +  𝜎2𝑧2  A comparison of sediment flux estimated using equations 2 and 4 are shown in Fig. 3. Based on these model fits, the sediment flux of a bimodal sediment population could be three times greater than the estimate from the simple “classical” model. Fig. 4 shows the “theoretical” sediment flux for each population. As the flux increased the relative amount of the larger grain population increased nonlinearly. Conclusions: The data analyzed from GF has provided evidence that sediment flux estimates are dependent upon assumptions about the grain-size distribution of the population. Sediment flux can be underestimated by a factor of three if the sediment is composed of two distinct grain-size populations. The smaller grains are mobilized at lower wind speeds and have a smaller scale-height than larger grains. This results in a single scale height for lower velocities but two scale heights for higher wind velocities.
