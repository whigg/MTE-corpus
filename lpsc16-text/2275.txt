A MASSIVELY DISTRIBUTED SEARCH FOR IMPACTS IN ALUMINUM FOIL ON THE STARDUSTINTERSTELLAR COLLECTOR A. J. Westphal1, A. L. Butterworth1, B. T. De Gregorio2, R. Lettieri1, W.Marchant1, R. M. Stroud2, D. Zevin1, 90 stardust@home “dusters”3, 1 Space Sciences Laboratory, University ofCalifornia at Berkeley, Berkeley CA 94720, USA, 2 Nanoscale Materials Section, Naval Research Laboratory, 4555Overlook Ave SW, Washington, DC 20375 USA, 3 WorldwideIntroduction: The Interstellar Dust Collector on theStardust spacecraft was exposed to the interstellar duststream for ∼200 days in two intervals prior to the encounter of the spacecraft with comet Wild 2. The ∼0.1m2 collector consisted of silica aerogel tiles (∼85% ofthe area), and Al foils (∼15% of the area). The collecting media are complementary: aerogel is superior inpreserving impactor mineralogy and in preserving trajectory information, and foils are superior in ease of isotopic analysis, in being free of the major-rock formingelement Si, and in allowing identification of smaller impactors.A consortium organized to identify and characterizeimpacts on the Interstellar Collector, the Interstellar Preliminary Examination (ISPE)[1], developed techniquesto identify and characterize impacts in aerogel and foilcollectors. In the aerogel tiles, impacts could be identified through optical microscopy. We and our colleaguesdeveloped an automated optical microscope to collectoptical imagery, and we developed an online “virtualmicroscope” to enable citizen scientists to search fortracks, in a project called Stardust@home[2]. More than30,000 citizen scientists have collectively carried outmore than 108 searches, and this ongoing project hasresulted in the indentification of >200 impactors in theaerogel tiles. Both individual and ensemble-wide detection efficiency was measured using calibration images,which constituted approximately 20% of the images.(The volunteer “dusters” were aware of the calibrationimages, but the identify of specific calibration imageswas hidden. The use of calibration images also enabledthe generation of a score for each user, which servedas a motivator, and was publicly posted on the Stardust@home website.) Among 71 tracks identified during the ISPE, three had characteristics consistent withan interstellar origin[4]. In contrast with tracks in theaerogel tiles, impacts in the foils result in craters thatare too small to resolve optically, so the ISPE developedautomated scanning procedures for Scanning ElectronMicroscopy[5]. The images were searched by eye andusing automated algorithms[3], and as a result 25 impacts were identified, four of which were consistent intheir characteristics with an interstellar origin[4].As a complementary approach to searching within research groups and to automated identification, we havedeveloped a new and separate instantiation of Stardust@home for the identification of craters in SEM images of the Al foils.Methods: The foils were removed from the Stardustcollector using a double-bladed “pizza cutter”, resultingin strips ∼2mm wide and 15 mm or 30 mm long, depending on whether the foil was adjacent to the shortor long side of the aerogel block. We used mounts developed for the purpose during ISPE, which stretchedthe foils flat to minimize focusing problems. We followed contamination control protocols[5], to avoid excessive carbon deposition on the foils during scanning.The foils were scanned at NRL with a FEI Nova 600FIB-SEM at 40nm/pixel. We scanned foils I1020W andI1126N, resulting in 24405 total images, which weresplit and compressed, and 219, 555 images were uploaded to the Amazon Storage for access to the foilssearch Virtual Microscope. Figure 1 shows a typicalfield of view.Fig. 1: A typical field of view on the foils search VM.The width of the field of view is 41µm.Results: During the pilot phase of the foils search,∼90 volunteers carried out ∼277,000 searches of∼103,000 individual fields of view. As we do withStardust@home, we measured detection efficiencyusing calibration images: based on responses to11, 965 calibration images we measured a 96.4%ensemble-wide, single-volunteer detection efficiency.The scanning is still in progress, and the images werenot distributed in a uniform manner. However, so far 17features were identified as potential impactors at leastfour times, and 90 features were identified at least threetimes. As with the track search of Stardust@home, thegoal of the foils search is not to definitively identify2275.pdf

Actual impacts are confirmed by subsequent high-resolution imaging, and EDX analysis toidentify residues. We present the follow-up analyses onthese candidates in an accompanying abstract in thisconference proceeding[6].In Fig. 2 we show images of the candidate impactorsidentified at least four times by Stardust@home foilssearch volunteers.Discussion: The Stardust@home project has demonstrated that a massively distributed search with citizenscientists is an effective approach to identification ofimpact features in aerogel that are otherwise problematic to identify by automated means. Preliminary resultsfrom the Stardust@home foils search indicates that asimilar approach may be effective for identification ofimpacts in aluminum foils.References: [1] Westphal, A. J. et al.
