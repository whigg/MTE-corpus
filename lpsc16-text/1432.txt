Roffey1, 1Centre for Planetary Science and Exploration, Dept. of Earth Sciences, Western University, 1151 Richmond St. London ON, Canada N6A 5B7 (bshanka@uwo.ca)    Introduction:  Impact cratering produces numerous lineament features such as fractures, faults, dykes, ridges, and scarps. These structures may be influenced by a number of factors [1] including the target lithology (e.g. sedimentary vs. crystalline). The geological activity of a target surface (erosion or deposition activity) can influence the exposure of lineaments. Earlier studies have used low-resolution remote sensing datasets and manual mapping techniques to asses the extent of structures associated with impact structures [e.g. 2, 3]. New lineament mapping needs to be revisited using better images, datasets, and techniques. Assessing the structural characteristics of impact craters through the use of current remote sensing datasets (with improved spatial and spectral resolutions than earlier) can help constrain the crater morphology, and perhaps be used to determine the true diameter.  In this study, we use an automated algorithm technique to extract and map lineaments for four complex craters located in Canada. The craters we chose are located in the Canadian high Arctic with nearly similar crater morphologies (eroded complex structures), more or less close in size, but the two of the structures formed in sedimentary targets and two into crystalline targets. The four craters we investigated (listed with apparent crater diameters) are: Haughton (~23 km),  Tunnunik (~28 km), Clearwater (~32 km), and Mistastin (~25-30 km) [4-7].  Methods: Lineaments were extracted using an automated approach tested by [8] and that was further refined by this and our companion study (also presented at this conference, [1]). For each crater site, the analysis was done over a region spanning at least two crater diameters in width from the crater centre. DEMs with 23-46 m/pixel spatial resolutions and 10 m vertical resolution were downloaded from the Canadian Digital Elevation Data (CDED) portal, and further processed using ArcGIS. Hillshade maps were derived from DEMs using using low sun and multiple azimuth directions (0o, 45o, 90o, 135o). The EDGE algorithm was applied to enhance lineament before extraction. The LINE algorithm in PCI Geomatica was used to run the automated lineament extraction, with parameters summarized in Table 1. Two different methods of extraction were tested. The first case followed the same methods outlined by [9], in a technique called “Combine Shaded Relief”, where the LINE tool was applied to the combined shaded relief maps with several look directions.  In the second technique, the LINE tool was applied to each individual shaded relief map with variable look directions before being combined, a technique termed “Merged Lineaments” (Fig. 1). The Combine and Merge tools were applied from the ArcGIS toolbox library.  Figure 1: Pictoral representation of the two lineament extraction processes.   Statistics such as lengths, density, and trends were collected for the filtered lineaments. Stereoplots were plotted using the freeware GeOrient program. Lineaments were classified and filtered out using ArcGIS to exclude non-impact generated features (e.g. pre- or post-impact tectonism, and some waterbodies). From the filtered set, the results were further classified based on the measured trend orientation in cardinal directions.

Results: We present our preliminary results of an automated lineament extraction methods for a smaller 10x10 km sub-section from the Haughton impact structure (Fig. 2). This NW subsection transects outwards from the melt-bearing breccias deposits of the crater interior towards the wall-terrace zone of Haughton. This section includes numerous relatively long and short lineaments (summarized in Table 2) with directional trends indicating that the extracted lineaments are most dense along the SW direction.

[3], the automated technique identifies more lineaments than  previously mapped, including what are likely structures missed by previous field mapping efforts.

Discussion: We noticed that the technique of processing hillshade maps prior to extracting lineaments plays a significant role with regards to the lineament density. The number of extracted lineaments are fewer in count if extracted using the “Combined Shaded Relief” method (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the radial and concentric features are more intensily highlighted in the Merged technique.   Statistics on the lineaments indicate that fracturing is greater closer to the crater centre, and decreases as the transect moves outwards (Fig. 4), consistent with the density of structures from models and mapping of impact craters [e.g. 4]. Radial and concentric features are clearly distinguishable here, the most strongest expressions are within the NE quadrant of the subset area. Radial and concentric features are also apparent in our prelimnary results on Tunnunik (sedimentary target), but are not as apparent in the Clearwater and Mistastin structures (crystalline targets). The less apparent occur-  Figure 3: Lineament maps for the full study area for Haughton crater. Lineaments were derived using both extraction techniques. The merged technique extracts a higher density of lineaments.  rences of radial and concentric patterns in other areas at Haughton may be due to the overprinting by nonimpact related structures. Overall, more lineaments have been extracted using the automated lineaments technique thereby removing human bias on structural mapping.             Figure 4: Stereoplot results for the automated lineaments extracted using CDED DEM data for FOV area in Fig. 2.   Future work: Our work will: 1) Explore lineament patterns in more detail, 2) Determine what type of lineaments they are (e.g., fracture, fault, etc.), 3) Determine which are pre-, syn- or post-impact lineaments, 4) Use the concentrations of fractured lineaments to determine the maximum extent of the impact structure, 5) Further constrain the influence of target lithology with reference to the pattern and mapped density of lineaments.
