Introduction: The optical characteristics of Mercury’s surface include a low albedo relative to the Moon, a spectrally red slope (increasing reflectance with wavelength), and an absence of absorptions in the visible to near infrared. Past studies tested whether the presence of opaque minerals on the surface could explain the observed low albedo, but found iron and titanium abundances are too low and the lack of correlation between the spatial distributions of sulfur and iron [1,2]. Instead, they suggest that the majority of iron is present in the metallic phase.  Other earlier work tested whether the optical characteristics of Mercury’s surface could be caused by the presence of submicroscopic iron particles, which consist of nanophase (<10–100 nm in size) and microphase (>100 nm in size) iron particles using the radiative transfer technique [3]. They found a greater global iron abundance compared to the MESSENGER Gamma-Ray Spectrometer (GRS) measurements and ultraviolet to near-infrared studies [i.e, 4–6].  Recently, several studies have proposed carbon in surface materials as the darkening agent that lowers the global albedo [7–9]. The detections and observations of [7,8] prompted us to use the work of [3] to include carbon in the radiative transfer models to determine whether it influences optical properties of Mercury within the constraints of the elemental measurements [e.g., 1, 4–8].  Methods: We used spectra from the VIRS (Visible and Infrared Spectrograph), a component of the MESSENGER’s MASCS (Mercury Atmosphere and Surface Composition Spectrometer) instrument [10] for our modeling. VIRS had a spectral range between ~0.3–1.45 µm with a specral bandwidth of about ~2.3 nm. The VIRS data set covers nearly the entire surface [6,10].   The radiative transfer model [3,11,12] requires knowledge of the optical and physical properties of the host and submicroscopic particles. We assume that the host particles consist of agglutinates and minerals with a grain size of about 20 µm [13]. We set the reflectance of the host particle to ~0.8. Because the submicroscopic particles would consist of carbon and iron particles, we use the amorphous carbon optical constants from [14] and iron optical constants from [15]. Also, we defined the microphase grain size to 1 µm, as this is about the size of the largest wavelength in the study [3]. By defining these inputs, we are able to build any modeled spectrum at any abundances of various submicroscopic particles. We matched each VIRS spectrum with a modeled spectrum by adjusting the submicroscopic particle abundances.  Results: We find that modeled spectra based only on submicroscopic iron particles cannot match the VIRS spectra because they produce a curvature at about 0.4 µm (Fig. 1).   Fig. 1: Modeled spectra based only on nanophase and microphase iron (solid red line) cannot fit the observed VIRS spectra (solid black line) because these particles produce a spectral curvature at ~0.4 µm. Dotted red line is the residual.  Modeled spectral based on nano- and microphase carbon and iron particle were able to consistently fit almost every VIRS spectrum (Fig. 2). Hence, the need for carbon in our model.   Fig. 2: Modeled spectra based on nano- and microphase carbon and iron resulted in consistent matches to spectra of every major terrane on Mercury.  The mean nano- and microphase carbon abundances are 1.3 and 0.1 wt.% C, respectively. Together, the mean submicroscopic carbon abundance is ~1.4 wt.% 1396.pdf

C. This result matches the GRS measurement of 1.4 wt.% C on the surface [7]. The agreement between this study and the GRS observations suggests that carbon is largely present as ≤ 1 µm particles on the surface.  The mean global nanophase iron and microphase iron abundances are 0.4 wt.% and 1.0 wt.%, respectively. By combining the abundances of the two iron particles together, the mean submicroscopic iron is ~1.2 wt.%. MESSENGER X-ray Spectrometer (XRS) reported a global iron abundance of 1–4 wt.% [1], while the GRS found global iron to be 1.9 wt.% Fe [5]. The submicroscopic iron abundance from our models was below the elemental measurements. This was expected, as we modeled iron only in the nano- and microphase form, whereas the XRS and GRS measured total iron on the surface. This difference in measuring iron is probably responsible for the contrast between our space weathering iron abundance map and the XRS iron abundance map [16].  We derived global nano- and microphase iron and carbon abundance maps by modeling the full VIRS data set (Fig. 2). The global abundances in all four components exhibit longitudinal and latitudinal variations, which correlate with the hot poles (0°E and 180°E) and at the equator. This spatial pattern is similar to that of maximum surface temperature (e.g., [17]). The relationship between the microphase carbon and iron abundances and maximum surface temperature is likely due to Ostwald ripening, where particles enlarge due to diffusion [18]. In addition to these spatial variations, nanophase carbon abundance is sensitive to fresh craters (Fig. 2a) and the microphase carbon abundance highlights the Low Reflectance Material (LRM) (Fig. 2b), which was predicted to contain a larger abundance of carbon compared to the global mean [8].  Discussion: The addition of carbon is necessary to consistently model the VIRS spectra and to agree with the constraints as found by various previous studies [1–9,13]. The source of the carbon may be exogenous and endogenous. Our models predict that carbon particles to be present as ≤1 µm particles suggesting that submicroscopic carbon and total carbon abundance are the same. The observation that fresh craters are low in carbon implies that the carbon is exogenous. However, the microphase carbon abundance is sensitive to LRM, which indicate that some of the carbon is endogenous.    References: [1] Nittler et al. (2011), Science, 333, 1847–1850.
