Development on program code for extraction of physical libration of the moon using the numerical theory spin-orbital motion DE432.  1A.Zagidullin, 1,2N Petrova, 1Kazan Federal University, Kazan, Kremlevskya str., 18, Russia (arhtur.zagidullin@ya.ru) 2Kazan Power Engineering University, Kazan, Russia (nk_petrova@mail.ru)   Introduction:  The Moon was  always interesting to the learning and nowadays there are a lot of space experiments, which give plenty of new results. There are realized the latest missions of USA: LRO-CROSS (which have proved the existence of aqueous ice), GRAIL (which  have measured gravitational field with accuracy to 1200 order), LADEE (which have explored exosphere of the Moon ) and also planned missions: the Russian Luna-Glob-Recourse (investigation of the internal structure of the Moon using  seismic instrument), the Japanese mission SELENE-II (setting of the telescope on poles of the Moon with further determination of  physical parameters of  lunar subsoil  using observations of librations)  and many others. Numerical Dynamical Ephemeries:  On the basis of processing of laser data and mathematical and programming software American researchers from the institute JPL NASA have constructed the best theory of spin-orbital  motion of the Moon, called numerical ephemerides DE432. The model, which describes lunar rotation in this ephemeride , includes compression of the earth, nonsphericity of the Earth and Sun, perturbation from other planets, at that Mercury shows its influence only in libration of the Moon on longitude, tidal effects, dissipation effects on the core-mantle boundary and other thin effects.   But using these ephemerides for practical purpose is a not trivial problem. Data of the numerical theory include orbital and rotational parameters. Rotation of the Moon according to the numerical theory is described by Euler angles -  ,, , which determine the Moon body's position concerning geoequator on the J2000 epoch.  Difficulties of working with them are in the fact, at first, that the data of the theory were wrote in ICRF-system and, at second, in the form of Chebyshev's coefficients in ASCII format.        Data reducting algorithm into the traditional libration angles: To bring this data into a form applicable for practical calculations, we had to learn the  procedures that are presented with numerical data on the NASA website (ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets). The texts of these programs are written in Fortran. Following the recommendations, which are presented in the description of the ephemeris, we have completed the following tasks: - Conversion of ephemerides (Chebyshev coefficients)  to binary format - program asc2eph; - Interpolation of data with necessary step- the program de421yomi; - Calculation of precession-nutation of the Earth's axis, that use as an correction for converting  the ICRF  frame of reference (vector r2) into ecliptic frame of reference (vector rdata) - the program nut_prec_correct  21 )( rNPBRrdata                                     (1) - Obtaining classical angles of the physical libration of the Moon Iσ, ρ, и τ (the conversion from the dynamic coordinate system, which is tied to the principal axes of lunar inertia (Principle axes - PA) (unit vector r1 in the polus PA), to the system of axes setting on the mean direction of the Earth (Mean Earth-ME) (unit vector rsel  in the polus ME).  selrRRRr )1462'.'0()0768'.'79()8986'.'63( 1231     (2) For this purpose, the three rotation Nimerical data for the angles in (2) are taken from Williams et al[2].

To do this we use the angles, which were obtained on stage of interpolation of the ephemerides' data,  and the angles obtained after the processing in the program nut_prec_correct) the program  matric_rotation       13132 )()()( rRRRr             (3) As a result, we obtained the values of Eulerian angles for any given period of time from the DE432, and it's possible to extract the parameters of the traditional physical libration - libration on the longitude  (fig.  1), on the inclination -  (fig. 2),  on the node - I (fig. 3), which are connected with Eulerian angles via the well known relation: ..ML,I,о180          (4) The obtained data will be use for comparison with the results of numerical theory of the Moon's rotation, which is being developed at the Kazan Federal University.
