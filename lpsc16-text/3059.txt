3D-MAPPING OF FAYALITE OXIDATION USING SYNCHROTRON: IMPLICATIONS FOR VOLATILES EVOLUTION DURING PLANETARY CRUST FORMATION.  A. M. Martin1, E. MÃ©dard2, T. Lanzirotti3, 1Case Western Reserve University, OH (USA) (aud.martin23@gmail.com), 2LMV-UBP ClermontFerrand (France), 3CARS - University of Chicago, IL (USA).   Introduction:  Several Martian meteorites show evidence that volatiles (H, C, S, O, Cl, F) were present during the crust formation [1] [2] [3] [4]. These volatiles influenced magmatic processes (e.g., melt extraction, fractional crystallization, degassing, assimilation, magma mixing), and are, therefore, recorded in minerals that are chemically zoned. In particular, redox variations may bring crucial information on volcanic activity and atmosphere evolution. Detecting these variations is, however, challenging considering the small width of zoning and the precision of the current analytical methods. Point analyses have given proof of iron oxidation variations inside minerals, as well as mineral transitions caused by oxidation [5]. Acquiring large (crystal-size) redox maps is now necessary to get a larger view of the potential mineralogical and crystallographic evolutions caused by volatiles circulation.  Mapping method:  We used EXAFS on a synchrotron (APS, Argonne) to map the oxidation state of iron in fayalite crystals from Obsidian Cliffs (Oregon) that crystallized inside gas-filled lithophysae. Considering their high Fe content and the composition of the gas wherein they formed, these crystals represent good analogs for the fayalite found in nakhlites [6]. Point analyses have already been run on similar crystals using EMPA and EELS on TEM [5]. They show that fayalite was progressively oxidized to laihunite, "oxyfayalite" and hematite. In this study, we selected similarly oxidized crystals, and oriented them in three different orientations to observe the role of crystallography on the iron oxidation process. We acquired maps at several selected energy values on each crystal. The iron redox maps were then corrected from the effect of the total iron.  Results:  Two types of iron redox variations are observed on the iron redox map (Fig. 1): Fracture-related redox variations.  These late redox variations correspond to the thin oxidation zones analyzed by [5]. They are oriented in particular crystallographic orientations. Redox zoning. These variations are present at the edge of the crystals. They are of much larger extent, and precede in time the fracture-related variations. The redox profiles show several Fe oxidation plateaux, some sharp edges, and shoulders (Fig. 2).   Figure 1. Iron redox maps (EXAFS) of fayalite crystals oriented in three crystallographic directions (Fe2+ is in red, Fe3+ in blue). Oxidized areas (in purple) are made of laihunite, hematite and "oxyfayalite" [5].  Interpretation: The iron redox maps allow to highlight various oxidation zones in a single fayalite crystal. They also bring evidence for multiple oxidation events of variable extent and length. The last event is related to fracturation in the fayalite crystals, which probably occurred at low temperature.   Application to planetary processes: Similar analyses of planetary samples like nakhlites crystals could help constraining the volatiles evolution during magmatic processes. They could also help explaining the formation of oxidized minerals (e.g., oxides) in various planetary samples, in relation to magmatic, alteration, or/and impact processes.  3059.pdf
