Introduction: We report on the completion of a global control network of Enceladus containing Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) images, and associated photogrammetric and cartographic accomplishments. This effort was in support of a new global geologic map of Enceladus [1]. The resulting products include a preliminary global monochrome basemap and improved camera pointing for individual images. The basemap and ancillary data will be available through USGS Astrogeology Online Planetary Data and Services (PDS Annex/MAP2) [2-4]. The updated pointing is recorded in the Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF)/SPICE ck kernel format [5] and released to the community via the Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers (ISIS 3) [6] public release in February 2016.  Image selection for the global control network: A total of 586 images in CLR, GRN, UV3, and IR3 filters were selected for the control network. The image selection criteria were based on coverage, quality, and a spatial resolution between 50 and 500 m/pix with phase angles less than 120o. While this collection of images was sufficient for global coverage of Enceladus, the coverage in some filters, specifically UV3 and IR3, were inadequate. Control Network: All processing was performed in ISIS 3. The ISS images were radiometrically calibrated, random noise removed, and an average boxcar filter applied to "fill in" common dropped lines. The network development plan included a dense distribution of tie points and ensuring all overlapping images were well connected. Global and polar image footprints and point distributions are shown in Figure 1. Photogrammetric Control: Multiple least-square bundle adjustments were performed with jigsaw, the ISIS 3 bundle adjustment application [7]. In all adjustments, we solved for camera pointing and the 3D coordinates of all tie points (latitude, longitude, radius). Spacecraft position was held fixed, a priori camera pointing constrained to ±2°, and the a priori radius of each control point constrained to ±150 meters. Statistics from the final solution are shown in (Table 1). Visually, image-to-image registration improved significantly after adjustment.  Generation of a Basemap: A global basemap at a scale of 100 m/pix was generated using images of the CLR and GRN filters updated by the latest bundle adjustment (Figure 2). Preserving the use of high resolution images for the mosaic was our primary motivation in image selection. Consistent viewing and illumination geometry was achieved by trimming images at emission and incidence angles boundaries to allow "better" overlapping images to show through. The short term purposes of the preliminary basemap are to demonstrate improvement from bundle adjustment and to provide initial support for geologic mapping efforts. Uniform image brightness was achieved by applying a large high-pass filter to the individual images, suppressing various photometric variations before mosaicking. A separate effort is currently underway to generate a photometrically normalized basemap. Solving for Target Body Parameters: The global control network also proved useful in demonstrating new jigsaw functionality to solve for target body pa  Figure 1: Image footprints with tie points overlaid in blue.

rameters. This capability is exercising the ISIS 3 Integrated Photogrammetric Control Environment that is under development but not ready for public release [8]. Comparisons between IAU parameters and those obtained by jigsaw are promising (Table 2).  Future Work: We plan to augment our control network with recently acquired images of the North Pole and also hope to incorporate additional high resolution images. A final photometrically normalized basemap will be generated utilizing a further refined bundle solution. Updated SPICE results and basemap will be publicly released upon completion. The global control network is itself a valuable product and will continue to serve multiple purposes.  References: [1] Bland, M.T., et al. (2015) LPS XLVI, Abstract#2303. [2] Hare, T.M., et al.
