We examine the morphometry of simple impact craters measured  from  high-resolution  topography  created using  stereo  images  from  the  HiRISE  and  CTX cameras  on  the  Mars  Reconnaissance  Orbiter  [1,2]. Our goal in this work is to quantitatively characterize the modification sequence of simple impact craters in diverse geological settings on Mars.  This involves the use  of  rigorous  statistical  comparisons  to  identify distributions  of  morphometric  parameter  values  that are characteristic of specific processes and conditions.      Previous work has addressed similar questions for larger impact craters on Mars using photoclinometric topography and laser altimetry [3,4,5].  More recently, HiRISE-derived topography and rover data have been used to characterize the modification of simple craters [e.g., 6,7,8,9].  A theoretical framework was long ago developed for understanding crater modification on the Moon [10],  which has recently been examined using high-resolution topography [11,12].  Crater  populations. We  have  assembled  three catalogs of distinct impact crater populations and are working to expand these data sets by the time of the meeting.  First is a globally-distributed population of 1,328 simple impact craters  with diameter exceeding 500 m that occur in CTX stereo imagery and within ±30o latitude  to  avoid  regions  in  which  ice-related processes  dominate  the  landscape  evolution.   All craters in this population derive from catalogs mapped by Robbins and Hynek [13,14].      Second, we examine 324 craters in the range 20 m < D < 800 m that occur in five HiRISE stereo pairs of the Meridiani  hematite  unit,  including  one  that  covers most of the Opportunity rover landing site [15].  The third population consists of 376 impact craters at the Spirit rover landing site, that occur dominantly in the Gusev floor plains surrounding the Columbia Hills: a densely-cratered  region  contained within a published HiRISE Science Team digital elevation model (DEM) [16].  The  Meridiani  and  Gusev  populations  were selected  for  this  study because  the  dominant  surface materials and processes are relatively well-understood in  light  of  results  from the  Mars  Exploration  Rover missions [6,7,8].  Many of the craters visited by these rovers are included in our database.    Data products. DEMs were generated for the global and  Meridiani  crater  populations  using  the  Ames Stereo  Pipeline  [17].   Image  pairs  were  filtered  to guarantee  significant  overlap  and  to  ensure  suitable illumination and viewing geometry to optimize DEM quality.   In  particular,  we  computed  the  parameters defined in [9] and used these to identify optimal stereo partners.  All HiRISE stereo pairs used to generate the Meridiani DEMs were acquired as stereo observations in  accordance  with  conventions  prescribed  by  the HiRISE Science Team [2].    Shape extraction.  A Hough circle transform was used  to  refine  the  locations  of  craters  in  cropped imagery  and  elevation  models  [18].  An  automated process developed in-house and described in [9] was then  used  to  trace  the  crater  rim  and  extract  radial topographic profiles.  A minority of craters for which automatic techniques failed (e.g., failure to locate the crater or trace the rim accurately) have been discarded by manual inspection.  In future work, these will  be incorporated  as  our  algorithm is  refined,  or  else  via manual and semi-automatic methods.   Morphometric  parameters.  We have computed morphometric parameters defined in [9] for all craters. These include traditional parameters such as rim height (h),  rim-to-floor  depth  (d),  and  rim-to-rim  diameter (D),  in  addition  to  measures  of  rim  profile  and planform  shape,  cavity  and  flank  slopes,  and  cavity shape.  Cavity shape is characterized by fitting a power law to radial cavity profiles. The exponent  (αc) is  ≈1 for a conical cavities and ≈2 for paraboloidal cavities. Future  work  will  make  use  of  linear  and  nonlinear diffusion  models  to  estimate  parameters  related  to degradation state [12].   Measured distributions. Fig. 1 is a plot of d vs. D for  all  three  populations,  illustrating  that  the  Gusev sample exhibits a much shallower d/D cut-off (roughly 0.07).  Fig.  2  shows  the  diameter-normalized  depth versus rim height for all three populations, illustrating a much tighter distribution in both parameters for the Gusev population, despite having more craters than the Meridiani  sample.  Fig.  3  compares  the  cumulative distribution  functions  for  the  cavity  shape  exponent (αc) of all three populations.  The two-sample KS test indicates  an  enormous  difference  between  the Meridiani and Gusev cdfs for this quantity (p value  ≪ 0.01).     Discussion.  Surfaces  on  the  Gusev  plains  are armored with a thin lag of relatively coarse grains [19]. The uppermost ~5-10 m are composed of a volcanic regolith;  no  bedrock  exposures  were  encountered  by the  Spirit  rover  outside  the  Columbia  Hills  [6].  The Meridiani  plains  are  underlain  by  a  relatively  soft evaporitic  sandstone  covered  with  <  1  m  layer  of mobile basaltic sands and a thin lag of coarse hematitic fragments  [20].   At  Meridiani,  exposed  (unarmored)  bedrock is quickly abraded and destroyed and cavities are sand-filled; these processes create  a modification sequence  that  has  been  characterized  using  a combination of rover and orbiter imagery [6,7].  Fig. 1. Rim-to-floor depth (d) versus rim-to-rim diameter (D) for  Meridiani  Planum,  the  Gusev  plains  surrounding  the Columbia Hills (C.H.), and a global sample of larger craters. Fig. 2. Plot of diameter-normalized rim-to-floor depth versus crater rim height at Meridiani planum (gray circles) and the Gusev plains (black diamonds).  Fig. 3. Exponent of power-law fit to crater cavities (αc). Meridiani Planum craters exhibit a relatively conical shape on average (αc nearer to 1). Our results indicate differences between the Gusev and Meridiani  populations,  although  additional  work  is needed  to  establish  their  significance.   Based  on preliminary  findings,  we  hypothesize  that  Meridiani craters tend to exhibit a more conical shape on account of  the  combined  processes  of  episodic  but  efficient erosion  and  backwasting  of  crater  rims  mediated  by sand abrasion and aeolian infilling of cavities [6].  By contrast, the more paraboloidal Gusev population may result  from  less  efficient  erosion  versus  relatively efficient  infilling, which may be more typical  of the martian surface in general at low latitudes.      An important challenge facing studies of this kind is to distinguish (a) the effects of variations in original crater shape caused by mechanical properties of target materials  and  the  style  of  cratering,  from  (b)  the variation that results from local, long-term degradation processes.  The distinct trend and sharp cutoff in Fig. 1 for  Gusev  craters  in  d vs.  D may  imply  that  this population is dominated by secondaries, as previously concluded from rover observations [6]. Alternatively or in  addition,  the  relatively  tight  bounds  of  the distribution of h/D and d/D may result from relatively restricted geographic sampling.  After  expanding  our  database,  future  work  will consist of detailed comparisons of the distributions of measured parameter values for a wide range of settings across Mars using rigorous statistical tests.
