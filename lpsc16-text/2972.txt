MORPHOMETRIC  CHARACTERIZATION  OF CRATER  MODIFICATION  IN  DIVERSE  SETTINGS  ONMARS; W.  A.  Watters1 (wwatters@wellesley.edu),  C.  I.  Fassett,2 C.  Hundal,1 R.  Gibson1.  1Dept.

We examine the morphometry of simple impact cratersmeasured  from  high-resolution  topography  createdusing  stereo  images  from  the  HiRISE  and  CTXcameras  on  the  Mars  Reconnaissance  Orbiter  [1,2].Our goal in this work is to quantitatively characterizethe modification sequence of simple impact craters indiverse geological settings on Mars.  This involves theuse  of  rigorous  statistical  comparisons  to  identifydistributions  of  morphometric  parameter  values  thatare characteristic of specific processes and conditions.      Previous work has addressed similar questions forlarger impact craters on Mars using photoclinometrictopography and laser altimetry [3,4,5].  More recently,HiRISE-derived topography and rover data have beenused to characterize the modification of simple craters[e.g., 6,7,8,9].  A theoretical framework was long agodeveloped for understanding crater modification on theMoon [10],  which has recently been examined usinghigh-resolution topography [11,12].  Crater  populations. We  have  assembled  threecatalogs of distinct impact crater populations and areworking to expand these data sets by the time of themeeting.  First is a globally-distributed population of1,328 simple impact craters  with diameter exceeding500 m that occur in CTX stereo imagery and within±30o latitude  to  avoid  regions  in  which  ice-relatedprocesses  dominate  the  landscape  evolution.   Allcraters in this population derive from catalogs mappedby Robbins and Hynek [13,14].      Second, we examine 324 craters in the range 20 m <D < 800 m that occur in five HiRISE stereo pairs of theMeridiani  hematite  unit,  including  one  that  coversmost of the Opportunity rover landing site [15].  Thethird population consists of 376 impact craters at theSpirit rover landing site, that occur dominantly in theGusev floor plains surrounding the Columbia Hills: adensely-cratered  region  contained within a publishedHiRISE Science Team digital elevation model (DEM)[16].  The  Meridiani  and  Gusev  populations  wereselected  for  this  study because  the  dominant  surfacematerials and processes are relatively well-understoodin  light  of  results  from the  Mars  Exploration  Rovermissions [6,7,8].  Many of the craters visited by theserovers are included in our database.    Data products. DEMs were generated for the globaland  Meridiani  crater  populations  using  the  AmesStereo  Pipeline  [17].   Image  pairs  were  filtered  toguarantee  significant  overlap  and  to  ensure  suitableillumination and viewing geometry to optimize DEMquality.   In  particular,  we  computed  the  parametersdefined in [9] and used these to identify optimal stereopartners.  All HiRISE stereo pairs used to generate theMeridiani DEMs were acquired as stereo observationsin  accordance  with  conventions  prescribed  by  theHiRISE Science Team [2].    Shape extraction.  A Hough circle transform wasused  to  refine  the  locations  of  craters  in  croppedimagery  and  elevation  models  [18].  An  automatedprocess developed in-house and described in [9] wasthen  used  to  trace  the  crater  rim  and  extract  radialtopographic profiles.  A minority of craters for whichautomatic techniques failed (e.g., failure to locate thecrater or trace the rim accurately) have been discardedby manual inspection.  In future work, these will  beincorporated  as  our  algorithm is  refined,  or  else  viamanual and semi-automatic methods.   Morphometric  parameters.  We have computedmorphometric parameters defined in [9] for all craters.These include traditional parameters such as rim height(h),  rim-to-floor  depth  (d),  and  rim-to-rim  diameter(D),  in  addition  to  measures  of  rim  profile  andplanform  shape,  cavity  and  flank  slopes,  and  cavityshape.  Cavity shape is characterized by fitting a powerlaw to radial cavity profiles. The exponent  (αc) is  ≈1for a conical cavities and ≈2 for paraboloidal cavities.Future  work  will  make  use  of  linear  and  nonlineardiffusion  models  to  estimate  parameters  related  todegradation state [12].   Measured distributions. Fig. 1 is a plot of d vs. Dfor  all  three  populations,  illustrating  that  the  Gusevsample exhibits a much shallower d/D cut-off (roughly0.07).  Fig.  2  shows  the  diameter-normalized  depthversus rim height for all three populations, illustratinga much tighter distribution in both parameters for theGusev population, despite having more craters than theMeridiani  sample.  Fig.  3  compares  the  cumulativedistribution  functions  for  the  cavity  shape  exponent(αc) of all three populations.  The two-sample KS testindicates  an  enormous  difference  between  theMeridiani and Gusev cdfs for this quantity (p value  ≪0.01).     Discussion.  Surfaces  on  the  Gusev  plains  arearmored with a thin lag of relatively coarse grains [19].The uppermost ~5-10 m are composed of a volcanicregolith;  no  bedrock  exposures  were  encountered  bythe  Spirit  rover  outside  the  Columbia  Hills  [6].  TheMeridiani  plains  are  underlain  by  a  relatively  softevaporitic  sandstone  covered  with  <  1  m  layer  ofmobile basaltic sands and a thin lag of coarse hematiticfragments  [20].

bedrock is quickly abraded and destroyed and cavitiesare sand-filled; these processes create  a modificationsequence  that  has  been  characterized  using  acombination of rover and orbiter imagery [6,7].  Fig. 1. Rim-to-floor depth (d) versus rim-to-rim diameter (D)for  Meridiani  Planum,  the  Gusev  plains  surrounding  theColumbia Hills (C.H.), and a global sample of larger craters.Fig. 2. Plot of diameter-normalized rim-to-floor depth versuscrater rim height at Meridiani planum (gray circles) and theGusev plains (black diamonds).  Fig. 3. Exponent of power-law fit to crater cavities (αc).Meridiani Planum craters exhibit a relatively conical shapeon average (αc nearer to 1).Our results indicate differences between the Gusev andMeridiani  populations,  although  additional  work  isneeded  to  establish  their  significance.   Based  onpreliminary  findings,  we  hypothesize  that  Meridianicraters tend to exhibit a more conical shape on accountof  the  combined  processes  of  episodic  but  efficienterosion  and  backwasting  of  crater  rims  mediated  bysand abrasion and aeolian infilling of cavities [6].  Bycontrast, the more paraboloidal Gusev population mayresult  from  less  efficient  erosion  versus  relativelyefficient  infilling, which may be more typical  of themartian surface in general at low latitudes.      An important challenge facing studies of this kind isto distinguish (a) the effects of variations in originalcrater shape caused by mechanical properties of targetmaterials  and  the  style  of  cratering,  from  (b)  thevariation that results from local, long-term degradationprocesses.  The distinct trend and sharp cutoff in Fig. 1for  Gusev  craters  in  d vs.  D may  imply  that  thispopulation is dominated by secondaries, as previouslyconcluded from rover observations [6]. Alternatively orin  addition,  the  relatively  tight  bounds  of  thedistribution of h/D and d/D may result from relativelyrestricted geographic sampling.  After  expanding  our  database,  future  work  willconsist of detailed comparisons of the distributions ofmeasured parameter values for a wide range of settingsacross Mars using rigorous statistical tests.
