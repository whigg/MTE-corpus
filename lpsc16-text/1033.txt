TEKTITE SUBORBITAL SUMMARY T.H.S. Harris, Orbit Analyst (retired) THSHarris@mindspring.com   Introduction:  Several elements of the Australasian (AA) tektite strewn field stand out given the lack of parent impact structure yet identified.  The large scale of the event is worrisome [1].  To show how a small impact could sire the AA tektites, one attempt [2] ignores more than half of the kinetic energy of the 10+ km/s tektite reentry speed for Australite and Central Indian Ocean button-forms [3,4].  10 km/s is ~ 90% of Earth escape velocity, a feature of the AA imprint that may not be ignored, as elaborated on below.   All signatures of the AA tektites must be explained in order to locate the impact structure, while  Ignoring any imprint detail may continue to foil the source search.  This most recent and largest of known tektite events is important to fully understand. Consideration of Transport:  Shock alone fails to explain transport of AA tektites, since the SiO2 content of the melt would most likely be vaporized before reaching post-shock speeds ≥ 10 km/s.  Complete disruption of inviscid liquid melt would be expected during such transient.  The associated suborbital loft times of ~5 to ~15 hours or more imply a source far distal from the strewn field centroid, i.e. inter-hemispheric transport [5].  This larger fraction of Earth's escape velocity originally led to the far-distant AA tektite source concept of Lunar Origin [3,4] for good reason.   Emplacement Definitions.  Different workers have applied microtektite abundance contours to identify the concentration centroid of the AA tektite strewn field, and thereby the impact structure.  The application of such ejecta blanket metrics to a sub-planetary tektite strewn field is inappropriate: emplacement is convoluted by planetary rotation during extended loft [6].   Additional Imprinted Information:  Australite button-form tektites and similar ablated cm-scale splash-form tektites from the Central Indian Ocean (CIO) indicate ≥ 10 km/s reentry [7].  The CIO buttonform showed hypervelocity impact pitting and spalls on its anterior face, after post-ablation solidification.  The high relative velocities required could not have happened underwater, so the collisions took place during atmospheric descent.  On microtektites (µ-tektites) recovered from the same CIO region, similar anterior impacts were accretionary, with µ-tektite fragments found embedded within spalls and pits [8]. Since the ablated cm-scale tektites reentered at ≥ 10 km/s and their loft duration was ~ 5 to 15 hours or more, the µ-tektites they overtook had essentially the same loft duration for collision during atmospheric descent.  The impacting µ-tektites may have come from other ablating tektites.  Many CIO µ-tektites have extensive pitting, spalls and accretionary impacts from other µ-tektites [8].  After ~ 5 to 15 hours to disperse through space during suborbital transport, this descending traffic pile-up is both an astonishing and telling feature of the AA tektite/µ-tektite imprint.   The atmospheric pile-up of AA µ-tektites suggests that they may have come from a significant swarm of larger scale ablating tektites during reentry, and that they must have been launched identically to intersect after ~ 5 to 15 hrs of suborbital loft.  The imprint implies: 1) splash forms on virtually identical trajectories were fully melted into µ-tektites by ablative droplet shedding, and 2) a large fraction of the entire 34 billion tons of melt was propelled to 10+ km/s. As importantly, this means cm-scale volumes of inviscid melt were either 1) accelerated to 10,000+ m/s without complete disruption, or 2) they collided as smaller liquid droplets at those speeds to form cmscale spheres that later ablated upon reentry.  The latter is unlikely without further disruption due to high relative speeds, even at the slightest of convergent angles.  The former seems impossible.  Yet, the imprint is clear.  Another possibility must exist: the proto-tektite parent mass may have been launched during disruption and accelerated before complete melting to the inviscid liquid state required to form spheres in a vacuum.   Interpretation of Imprint Signatures:  Blast outflow must have carried and heated the proto-tektite solid mass, melting it during acceleration.  Velocity and/or heating must have been added until a period of completely laminar outflow during expansion of the blast effluent, to avoid complete disruption of the accelerating inviscid fluid by turbulence or shear in the hypervelocity flow.  Complete atmospheric blowout is implied to explain the observed imprint.  Shock partitioning to volatiles allowed continued heating and acceleration of the semi-melted (proto) tektite mass while carrying it above the atmosphere.  Some large chunks could have melted to inviscid liquid, forming kg-scale spherical tektites [9].  Others, even larger and from deeper in the layered target, would have reached outflow rarefaction before melting to liquid, forming Muong Nong-type layered tektites. Fe oxidation, water content & black body UV.  The AA melt is believed to be formed primarily from a single unit of rock with sandstone-greywacke-shale composition [10].  The uniform Fe oxidation state of splash forms [11] differs from inhomogeneous Fe oxidation in layered tektites [12], suggesting mixing/transport involvement in the uniform Fe oxidation of the liquid melt.  Giuli et al. [12] do not report their sample depth within the layered tektite, so more data is needed to check for radial oxidation gradients. 1033.pdf

Heat, Fe oxidation & steam plasma.  If water or ice overburden atop the AA target rock was shocked during the impact, ionic OH or O species may have persisted over time scales sufficient to imprint the observed uniform Fe oxidation on the subjacent AA tektite precursor mass.  Oxygen disassociates to a charge state matching the uniform ~O2+ (and slight O3+) Fe oxidation in AA tektites at 40,000 K to 45,000K [13].  Black body peak radiant wavelength of that temperature is around 100 nm [14], in the UV, which coincides with the 100% absorption band of quartz.  Associated radiant power is ~106 W/cm2, enough to melt a 1 cm deep layer of quartz every seven (7) milliseconds. Steam plasma source.  Watt et al. [15] note the higher water content of AA tektites vs. other tektite families, observing "water in the immediate atmosphere in the ejecta cloud from which the tektites emerged must have slowed or buffered exsolution of dissolved water from the tektites."  Their rough conservative estimate for molar water fraction is 0.3 for AA tektite formation.  Watt et al. [15] further suggest "…an enormous quantity of water vapor at the impact site" due to the water content of the AA tektite imprint. Conditions within the shocked volume.  Work by Kurosawa et al. [16] concludes that electrons are an important energy reservoir during energy partitioning of shock.  Tagle et al. demonstrated Kelvin-Helmholtz Instabilities (KHIs) within the shocked volume of a 30° oblique impact [17] using a high-resolution 2D model.  KHI development before τ = 0.5 [17] implies high centripetal acceleration coincident with high shear gradients in the vortex cores of the shocked volume.   KHIs demonstrate a unique mode of mixing within the shocked volume of the oblique impact development, with restricted depth of target mass mixing involvement.  Mixing is bound and concentrated within the KHI vortex sheet in the shocked volume, where overburden depth can limit bolide/substrate interaction. Reduced pressure cores of the KHI vortices appear in early stage [17].  At some shearing threshold, stripping of shock-energized electrons should introduce electromagnetic (EM) effects such as for magnetic flux rope dynamics [18], enabling axial currents and associated charge separation along KHI flux rope structures.  In this oblique impact environment, the electrons will be physically separated from positive ionic species by the KHI core currents.  Electro-magnetic charge segregation in the shocked volume offers prolonged availability of donor ions O2+ and O3+ for Fe oxidation, and large electrical currents. Entrainment and ablation.  Muong Nong-type layered tektites are though to fall close to the impact structure.  This may not be true at all.  Higher mass-tosurface area ratios of larger tektites offer more internal heat absorption for lower peak surface temperature during reentry.  Irregular shapes also promote reentry tumbling, applying heat over more area.  We should expect less or even no significant ablation in larger tektites and in irregular-shaped layered tektites for these reasons.   Summary And Conclusions:  Plasma entrainment and heating of disrupted target mass and adiabatic expansion could deliver both semi-solid Muong Nongtype and inviscid melts above the atmosphere for gentle release upon rarefaction in vacuum.  Suborbital injection of all target mass would be at the entrained speed of adiabatic outflow.  10+ km/s ejecta entrainment yields inter-hemispheric or even antipodal emplacement from launch, per imprint detail [3,4] and governing suborbital mechanics [5], without question.   Kurosawa et al. [16] demonstrate endothermic shock-induced ionization.  Sun et al. [18] and the improved resolution Tagle et al. [17] oblique impact model illustrate how ionized species could be generated and preserved by KHIs and electrical current within the shocked volume.  For oblique impact into ice overburden, KHI-enforced EM charge segregation could provide extended time scales for energized ion infusion to the shock-disrupted proto-tektite target mass.   Oblique impact into an ice-covered rock substrate explains reduced excavation volume, shearing disruption and substrate block plucking during post-shock hypersonic steam plasma scouring [19].  Adiabatic expansion would be immediately available to accelerate and further heat disrupted proto-tektite mass.  With shock no longer the sole transport engine, kg-scale aplash forms and tektite speeds above the post-shock vaporization velocity of quartz become viable results.  This is in agreement with the observed imprint. References:  [1] Schmidt G. et al. (1993) Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 57, 4851-4859. [2] Artemieva N. (2013) LPSC abstract 1410.
