Its hydrothermal system, and the geochemical and mineralogical signatures it produces as it interacts with the high-Fe basaltic substrate, provides an exceptional analog for potential hydrothermal alteration on Mars. We introduce multiple hydrothermal sites in southwest and northeast Iceland (Fig. 1), and discuss their suitability for Mars analog research based on the results of our pilot study.  Fig. 1: Map of Icelandic thermal areas, from [1]. Yellow stars: hydrothermal fields visited during our pilot study. In SW Iceland: Reykjanes, Krýsuvík, Hengill, and Hveragerði. In NE Iceland: Krafla, Námafjall, and Þeistareykir. In south central Iceland: Landmannalaugar.  Reykjanes: Near the SE tip of the Reykjanes peninsula, acidic hot springs and fumaroles (pH 2.3-3). Previous work suggests that the fluids here derive from heated seawater [2], though our observations point to more dilute fluid compositions, with Cl- concentrations consistent with other Icelandic hydrothermal fields.   Krýsuvík: On the Reykjanes peninsula. Previously studied by [3]. Acidic hot springs and fumaroles (pH 2-5), substrate is 11.15% Fe2O3T and 14.82% Al2O3. The surface is largely oxidized, but [3] report an oxidation front at shallow depths. We previously reported a wide range of alteration phases including Ca, Al, Fe2+, Fe3+, Mg, and multi-cation sulfates [4].  Hengill: A dispersed hydrothermal field behind the Nestjavellir power plant and in small valleys leading up the slopes of Hengill to the south. The substrate is high-Fe and there is a range of different hydrothermal fluids, from acidic to near neutral (pH 2.5-6.6) [5].   Hveragerði: Mud pots, hot springs, and fumaroles surrounding the town of Hveragerði and slopes towards Hengill to the north. Includes both near-neutral (pH 7-8), sinter-forming hot springs with obvious microbial activity, and acid-sulfate fumaroles, along with both oxidizing and reducing conditions [6]. Our results reveal abundant amorphous silica (depleted in Ti) associated with the hot springs, formed by precipitation from near-neutral fluids. Altered substrate is more clay rich (smectites or kaolinite) with some anatase but few sulfates (minor alunogen in few samples).  Landmannalaugar: multiple areas with hot springs and fumaroles [7], with obvious microbial activity. pH varies over short distances from acidic (pH 2.14) to slightly alkaline (pH 8.25), and all water samples analyzed were oxidizing and dilute. However, the substrate is rhyolitic rather than basaltic, which leads to a lower abundance of Fe-sulfate minerals.    Námafjall: fumaroles, mud pots, and hot springs at the base, slope, and summit of a hill [8]. Surface fluids are acidic (pH 2-2.9). The substrate of Námafjall hill is largely basaltic hyaloclastite, which has lower Fe than the basalts of our other Icelandic hydrothermal fields, though fumaroles at its base are in contact with higher Fe basalts. Surface mineral assemblages reflect more oxidizing conditions, but there is an oxidation front at Náma%all'pit'samples' Amorphous'Kaolinite'Anatase'Sulfur'Fe'sulﬁde'Fe3+'sulfate'Alunite/'natroalunite'Top'yellow' XXX' @' X' XX' @' X' X'Middle'grey' XXX' @' X' X' @' X' X'BoDom'grey' X' +' X' @' XX' @' @'B'Fig. 2a: Pit next to Námafjall fumarole, showing a pronounced oxidation front with darker sulfide-rich material below and light sulfur and amorphous silica material above (see table B below for XRD results). 1207.pdf

shallow depth (Fig. 2) and distance (Fig. 3), which we reported in more detail in [9].  Krafla: hot springs and fumaroles within the Krafla caldera, with both active and fossil hydrothermal alteration. Conditions are consistently acidic and largely oxidizing. Krafla has both rhyolitic and basaltic subtrates, and the hydrothermal system appears to be largely associated with the rhyolites; however, these fluids interact with basalts at the surface [5]. We previously reported [10] a range of sulfate minerals including a diversity of Mg-rich minerals such as hexahydrite, pickeringite, alpersite, and leonite, consistent with higher Mg content in the hyaloclastite substrate.  Fig. 3: Schematic showing changes in mineral assemblage with distance from a Námafjall mud pot. Conditions are reducing at and near the mud pot, with pyrite, but become more oxidizing with distance (the Fe enters Fe2+ and then Fe3+ sulfate phases instead). From our previous work [11].

[12] MER Spirit Adirondack (RAT), [13] MER Opportunity Bounce Rock (RAT), [14] Shergotty meteorite, [15] Hengill lava. Hengill, Krafla, and the Námafjall lavas have elevated Fe concentrations (reported as total iron in Fe2O3) compared to most terrestrial basalts, similar to many from Mars. The Námafjall hill hyaloclastite, and hyaloclastite substrate at Krýsuvík, are lower in Fe and higher in Al.  Our work builds on previous Mars analog research involving Icelandic hydrothermal systems (e.g. [1620]). We find that Krafla, Námafjall, and Hengill make excellent analogs for Mars basaltic acid-sulfate alteration because of their substrate compositions and dominantly acidic conditions. Hengill/Hveragerði show a more diverse range of alteration conditions (pH, redox) that can be used to test competing hypothesis for the formation of Mars hydrothermal deposits, such as acidsulfate fumarole leaching vs. near-neutral sinter deposition of silica-rich materials near Home Plate, Gusev crater [e.g. 21].
