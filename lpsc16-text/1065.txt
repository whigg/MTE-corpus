A detailed understanding of the solar wind interaction with lunar magnetic anomalies (LMAs) is essential to identify its implications for both robotic and human exploration and to enhance our physical understanding of the particle dynamics in partially and/or fully magnetized plasmas. We present threedimensional full-kinetic and electromagnetic simulations of the solar wind interaction with both a vertical and a horizontal dipole model, resembling a mediumsize LMA. We find that, in contrast to a horizontal dipole, a vertical dipole twists its field lines and cannot form a mini-magnetosphere. Instead, it creates a ringshaped weathering pattern and reflects up to 21% of the incoming solar wind ions, that is ~4 times more than the horizontal case. We deliver hereby a vital piece to fully comprehend and interpret lunar observations as we find the amount of reflected ions to be a tracer for the underlying field structure. Observing more reflected ions, however, does not necessarily point to the existence of a (larger) density cavity.
