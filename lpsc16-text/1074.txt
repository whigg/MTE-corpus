Methodology of conjoint photogrammetric processing of images obtained at different periods with various illuminations and resolution (Zubarev et al., 2015a) allows using of archive images from Galileo (1994 - 2003) and Voyager (1979 - 1981) missions, as well as newer remote sensing data from ongoing Cassini mission (2004 - 2017). Data source: We used improved orbit data for Galilean satellites (Ganymede, Europa Calisto and Io) in Jovian system and Enceladus (Saturnian system) based on larger numbers of images than were available before, resulting in a more rigid 3D-control point networks, for example, for Ganymede (Zubarev et al., 2015b) that significantly surpasses its predecessors (Davies et al., 1998). Also the new stereo pairs were found for producing digital terrain models (DTMs) based on images that have never been used before. New DEMs and corrected orthoimages have been used for studying geomorphological phenomena of the surface and mapping.  Geomorphologic studies: New high-resolution DTMs of Ganymede allowed us to perform the assessment of the small craters degradation, including their different morphological types. Analysis of a studied regions showed that small craters of Ganymede are shallower than their lunar and Martian counterparts of the same size. In addition to craters emissions of ice formed by impact events have been allocated. Also among the volcanic landforms were allocated some objects such as domes, as well as sulcus border and ruts on them. Mapping: Based on updated shape models and global orthomosaics, derived from new image processing as well as results of geomorphologic studies, new mapping of outer moons have been done on various levels of detail (Fig. 1-2).  Conclusion: The new geodetic parameters and global and local topography allow us to make maps for new series of planetary multilingual maps of outer planet moons to support the idea proposed early by Kira Shingareva [4].
