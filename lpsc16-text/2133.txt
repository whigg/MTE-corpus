Among the experiments onboard the spacecraft, the ROSINA experiment (Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis) includes two mass spectrometers to analyse the composition of neutrals and ions, and a pressure sensor to monitor the density and velocity of neutrals in the coma [1].   For this presentation, we analyse and compare the data of the Reflectron-type Time-Of-Flight (RTOF) mass spectrometer and the Double Focusing Mass Spectrometer (DFMS) during the comet escort phase. RTOF possesses a wide mass range and a high temporal resolution while the DFMS has high mass resolution and sensitivity. Both sensors were designed to measure the composition of the cometary neutral gas as well as cometary ions. The third instrument is the Comet Pressure Sensor (COPS), which measures total density and bulk velocity of the gas. We will provide a detailed description of the main volatiles dynamics (H2O, CO2, CO) and of the heterogeneities in the coma. The influence of various parameters is investigated on a statistical basis: distance to the comet, heliocentric distance, longitude and latitude of sub-satellite point, local time and phase angle. Our analysis of the data obtained in fall 2014 shows enhanced water vapour mostly in the illuminated northern summer hemisphere near the neck region with cyclic diurnal variations whereas CO2 was confined more to the cold southern hemisphere with a more spatially homogeneous composition. Both of these findings are in agreement with previous observations of 67P [2] and Hartley 2 [3]. We finally compare RTOF data with COPS total density and DFMS measurements. This comparison is made to show that the observations performed with each ROSINA sensor are indeed consistent and, in particular, to investigate the temporal evolution of the CO2/ H2O ratio derived by the two mass spectrometers RTOF and DFMS.    Figure 1: CO2/H2O detection maps from RTOF and DFMS data recorded from mid-november 2014 until mid-february 2015. White line represents topography. Center of the maps (0,0) is the small lobe of comet 67P. Both maps show three high ratio regions but RTOF data appear to be more diffuse. The region corresponds to specific location (rich in CO2) in the big lobe of the comet.
