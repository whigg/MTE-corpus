REDUCED, AGED AND DISTURBED: AL HAGGOUNIA 001, THE LARGEST KNOWN ENSTATITE METEORITE, A FOSSIL EL CHONDRITE AND A VESICULAR IMPACT-MELT BRECCIA.                Alan E. Rubin, Dept. Earth, Planet. & Space Sci., University of California, Los Angeles, CA  90095-1567, USA.         Introduction. The Al Haggounia 001 meteorite and its numerous paired NWA specimens have a combined mass >3 metric tons, making it by far the largest known enstatite meteorite. It is also a “fossil meteorite” with a 14C age of 23,000±2000 years [1]. Portions of the meteorite were excavated from 0.6 – 0.7 m beneath a sabkha (salt flat) lake in southern Morocco [2]. Cobbles of some specimens are cemented along with terrestrial limestone clasts and rhyolite pebbles within sedimentary conglomerates [1,3,4].          Weathering. Severely weathered, dark-brown regions of the meteorite, typified by Al Haggounia 001 specimens, contain a plethora of secondary minerals (calcite, barite, jarosite, gypsum, halite, sylvite, melanterite, native S, clay) [2,3,5]. They also contain much more limonite (weathered metallic Fe-Ni) than lessweathered, typically bluish-gray specimens such as Northwest Africa (NWA) 7401 and NWA 2828: limonite constitutes 38.4 wt.% of Al Haggounia 001, but only 0.40 wt.% of NWA 7401. Unaltered opaque phases are also much more abundant in Al Haggounia 001 than in NWA 7401 – sulfide: 5.1 vs. 0.56 wt.%; metallic Fe-Ni: 0.63 vs. <0.1 wt.%. The lessweathered, bluish-gray specimens typically have relatively high porosity [3].        Chondrules. Although some of the paired specimens (e.g., NWA 2965) have few relict chondrules [5], many others (e.g., NWA 7401, NWA 2828, Al Haggounia 001) contain readily identifiable relict RP, BP and PP chondrules. The mainly intact relict chondrules in NWA 7401 range from 510 – 1800 µm in apparent diameter and average 1160±420 µm (n=10). The modal abundance of relict chondrules observed in NWA 7401 is 7.5 vol.% (1532 points).         Voids. Voids in NWA 7401 vary in shape – some are rounded, some are elongated and some are irregular. The voids range in apparent diameter from 50 – 610 µm and average 200±140 µm (n=40); their modal abundance is 6.8 vol.% (1318 points).        Classification. Al Haggounia 001 was initially misclassified as an aubrite; its paired specimens have been classified as aubrites and different types of enstatite chondrites (EL6, EL6/7, E6, EL3) [2,3,6]. It is clear that Al Haggounia 001 and its paired specimens are enstatite meteorites. This is indicated by the predominance of enstatite, the high state of reduction, the occurrence of graphite, the presence of characteristic sulfide phases (Ti-bearing troilite, Mn-bearing daubréelite, alabandite, oldhamite, and probably djerfisherite), and bulk 17O values near 0‰ (Met.Bull.).  The presence of relict chondrules indicates that the rock is an enstatite chondrite, not an aubrite [2,3,5]. The low amount of Si in kamacite (~1 wt.%; Met.Bull.) and the presence of alabandite instead of niningerite or keilite indicate that the meteorite is a member of the EL chondrite group.         Vesicles. The abundance of voids in the meteorite (e.g., in NWA 7401) coupled with the paucity of metallic Fe-Ni (<0.1 vol.%) were attributed to differential dissolution of the metal under “unusual Eh/pH conditions in a semi-arid environment” [2]. If it is assumed that NWA 7401 initially had a normal EL3 metal/sulfide volumetric ratio of ~1.1 [7], that the voids were formed from the dissolution of both metal and sulfide, and that there was no additional metal and sulfide in the rock that vanished without much of a trace, then NWA 7401 should have had ~4 vol.% metal and ~3 vol.% sulfide. This is far lower than the mean EL3 modal abundances of 10.1 vol.% metal and 8.9 vol.% sulfide [7]. This suggests that the voids did not form from dissolution of opaques. Furthermore, terrestrially weathered metal-rich meteorites are typically enriched in limonite, goethite and other Fe-Ni oxides and hydroxides. This also applies to meteorites subjected to peculiar Eh/pH weathering conditions – Al Haggounia 001 contains 32.6 vol.% limonite (formed from weathered metallic Fe-Ni). It seems clear that the voids in NWA 7401 and its paired specimens do not represent the “leaching out” of primary metal (and sulfide).        I interpret the voids as vesicles formed mainly from S2 bubbles produced from evaporating sulfide during impact melting of the whole rock. Vaporization of sulfide and subsequent condensation of S2 in impact-melted H-chondrite breccias (e.g., Smyer, Myersville, Zag, Rose City) is probably responsible for their sulfide-rich regions (wherein the sulfide/metal ratio can reach ~500:1 [8,9], far exceeding the eutectic weight ratio of 7.5:1.        Although there are no previous reports of vesicular enstatite chondrite breccias, the Maya Belwa aubrite is an impact-melt breccia that contains ~5 vol.% vesicles [10]. In addition, literature data show that several OC impact-melt rocks and impact-melt breccias have appreciable abundances of vesicles: e.g., Shaw, L6; Yamato (Y) 790143, LL6; Y-790964, LL6; Cat Mountain, L5; Patuxent Range 91501, L impact-melt rock; and Larkman Nunatak 06299, LL impact-melt breccia. In Shaw there are light-colored vesicular regions in which metallic Fe-Ni and sulfide are essentially absent 1049.pdf

[11]. During impact heating, some sulfide proibably evaporated. Bubbles of S2 were produced and infused the silicate melt; the denser, immiscible metal-sulfide melt (now depleted in S) separated and drained away.       The same process probably affected Al Haggounia 001/NWA 7401. In some regions of the sample (bluish-gray, metal-poor specimens like NWA 7401), the sulfide was partly vaporized, leaving a vesicular, somewhat frothy silicate-rich rock; the metal-sulfide melt (now depleted in S) drained away, leaving the residual rock rich in pores, but highly depleted in opaque phases. The paucity of metal in these samples diminished their susceptibility to terrestrial weathering.           Transportation of metallic Fe-Ni and sulfide. The metal-sulfide melt may have been transported a few tens of centimeters; it became concentrated in other regions of the meteorite (such as Al Haggounia 001). The UCLA thin section of Al Haggounia 001 has very few vesicles, but contains 32.6 vol.% limonite, 0.29 vol.% unaltered metal, and 4.0 vol.% sulfide. The abundance of metal in these regions of the meteorite enhanced their susceptibility to weathering.         Impact-melt breccia. NWA 7401 and its paired specimens possess several petrographic features consistent with being impact-melt breccias: (1) Vesicles, (2) Euhedral lath-like graphite grains up to 500 µm long, (3) Kamacite-rich veins, (4) Melt globules up to 2 mm across, (5) Partly resorbed chondrules, (6) Enstatite that nucleated on relict chondrules, (7) Opaquefree enstatite overgrowths mantling opaque-rich enstatite grains wherein the opaque-rich grain centers are probably shocked, silicate-darkened relict grains that survived impact melting, (8) Plagioclase containing small rounded enstatite grains that formed after quenching of a feldspathic impact melt; this resulted in the trapping of opaques and mafic silicate grains within plagioclase and feldspathic glass.        Bulk chemical composition. The peculiar bulk composition of NWA 2828 (determined by INAA) relative to mean EL can be attributed to impactmelting and severe terrestrial weathering: (1) Enrichment in alkalis (Na, K) by factors of ~1.7 – 2 is due to the formation of alkali-rich secondary phases during weathering. (2) Depletion in common siderophile elements (Fe, Co, Ni) by factors of 11 – 50 was caused by impact melting coupled with the formation and separation of an immiscible metal-rich melt. (3) Depletion in most rare-earth elements (La, Sm, Yb, Lu) by factors of ~2 – 4 is due to weathering of oldhamite (a watersoluble phase that is the major REE carrier in enstatite chondrites). (4) Slight enrichment (by 4%) in Eu is due to the preferential shock melting and concentration of plagioclase. (5) Depletion in Mn by a factor of 20 is due to loss of alabandite (MnS) along with other sulfides and metallic Fe-Ni during impact melting. (6) Depletion in Cr and Zn by factors of ~2 – 4 is due to loss of sphalerite (ZnS) and daubréelite (FeCr2S4) during impact melting. These elements are not as depleted as Mn possibly because Cr3+ substituted for Fe3+ in jarosite, and Zn was enriched along with Se and As during the formation of secondary sulfate. (7) Enrichment in Se by 17% was probably caused by contamination and growth of secondary S- and Se-rich sulfates (e.g., barite, jarosite, gypsum and melanterite). (8) Enrichment in As by 25% was probably due to the growth of S-rich secondary phases. (9) Enrichment in Ga by a factor of ~1.6 resulted from Ga concentrating in secondary jarosite (wherein Ga3+ replaces Fe3+ in solid solution). (10) Enrichment in Au by a factor of ~1.6 may be due to contamination involving redistribution of Au by  groundwater and electrochemical precipitation during weathering.        Origin of Al Haggounia 001. The massive Al Haggounia 001/NWA 2736/NWA 2828/NWA 7401 EL chondrite suffered a high-energy collision on its parent asteroid, producing numerous shock effects: (1) shock deformation of silicate grains and the development in them of strong undulose and weak mosaic extinction, (2) dispersion of metal-sulfide blebs along fractures within the silicate grains causing “silicate darkening,” (3) extensive, but incomplete, impact melting of the whole rock, allowing the preservation of some relict chondrules, (4) vaporization of a significant fraction of the troilite resulting in the production of S2 bubbles that infused the melt, (5) concomitant formation of immiscible silicate and metal-sulfide melts, (6) separation and transportation (perhaps over distances of tens of centimeters) of the dense metalsulfide melt, (7) partial resorption of the relict chondrules and coarse silicate grains by the surrounding silicate melt, (8) crystallization of enstatite in the matrix and as overgrowths on coarse relict silicate grains and relict chondrules, and (9) quenching of the silicate melt, freezing in the S2 bubbles to form vesicles.
