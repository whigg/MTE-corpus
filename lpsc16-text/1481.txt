However, the spatial locations of these events & processes are not well constrained because specific parent bodies of most meteorite types have not yet been identified. Since most of the larger main belt asteroids are still located near their relative heliocentric formation distances, they provide a glimpse of the distribution of inner solar system materials during the formation epoch.  Meteorites represent fragments of main belt asteroids that escaped into Earth-crossing orbits, many via the chaotic zones associated with the proper motion & secular resonances with Jupiter and/or Saturn [e.g.1,2]. Similarly, most near-Earth asteroids appear to have originated in the main belt and escaped through these same resonances assisted by the Yarkovsky effect. Researchers use meteorites and asteroids to underst and nebular processes and history and to formulate and constrain models of the early solar system [e.g., 3-8]. The Kirkwood Gaps (KG) are severely depleted zones in the asteroid belt located at proper motion resonances with Jupiter. Objects near the 3:1 KG are subject to excited eccentricities (e) and repeated planetary encounters, which ultimately remove asteroids and asteroidal fragments from the resonance. Theoretical models indicate the majority of asteroidal material delivered to the inner solar system, particularly to the Earth, originates from the 3:1 and ν6 resonances [2, 915]. Asteroids and collisionally-ejected fragments with semi-major axes (a) in the 2.47-2.53 AU range undergo chaotic orbital evolution on short timescales [1]. Changes in (e), (i), and (a) due to gravitational encounters with planets and non-gravitational forces such as collisions with other asteroids and Yarkovsky effects can deliver nearby m-kms scale objects into the chaotic zone of the 3:1 KG [1, 15-19]. These objects are rapidly transferred to Earth- and Mars-crossing orbits making the 3:1 KG a major source for meteorites and NEAs [19-22]. Collisions play a vital role in liberating meteoroids from their parent bodies. Once liberated, the fragments are subjected to gravitational forces and the Yarkovsky effect, which are key in delivering bodies from their source region to the chaotic zones capable of moving material into near-Earth space [23].  These fragments spend a majority of their dynamical lifetime subjected to Yarkovsky to bring them to the resonance in which they undergo chaotic orbital evolution such that the actual time required to reach a planet crossing orbit ranges from several Myr to Gyr, which accounts for the paucity of long cosmic ray exposure ages seen among the stony meteorites [17].  The shallow size distribution of NEOs suggests collisional injection into the resonance is not the sole mechanism supplying meteorites and NEOs; however, an interplay between collisions and Yarkovsky act together to bring a robust number of fragments into the resonance [17]. [12] developed The Fragment Injection Model, which predicted specific asteroids that could efficiently deliver material from the 3:1 KG into Earth-crossing orbits via collision/impact acceleration. Even the fragments not directly inserted into the resonance have a high probability of making it to the resonance's chaotic zone via the Yarkovsky effect. Since the chaotic zone of the 3:1 KG is not dominated by any one particular assemblage, observation and characterization of individual 3:1 KG objects is necessary to test possible meteorite affinities [24-28]. Probable parent bodies have been identified for only five  [25, 29-31] of the ~135 meteorite classes [32]. These parent bodies (4) Vesta (HEDs), (3103) Eger (enstatite achondrites/aubrites), (6) Hebe/ (695) Bella (H- chondrites & IIE iron meteorites), & the Maria Asteroid Family (mesosiderites) account for ~40% of terrestrial meteorite falls.  Thus, the sources of ~60% of the meteorite flux and ~97% of the meteorite classes still need to be accounted for. Asteroids within the "feeding zone" of the 3:1 KG are candidates for parent bodies. Previous spectral studies of a small set of asteroids near the 3:1 KG in search of the parent bodies of the ordinary chondrites were limited to VNIR spectra [33-37]. Such limited wavelength coverage does not permit detailed mineralogical analysis required to rigorously test meteorite affinities. This research has provided validation of the original work of [36] and has linked several asteroids as probable or plausible parent bodies for some meteorite type, as well as the potential discovery of a small H-chondrite family [38]. Observations & Data Reduction:  NIR spectra of asteroids (17) Thetis, (900) Rosalinde, and (2834) Christy Carol were taken on June 26, 2015 at the NASA IRTF using the SpeX instrument [39] in the low-res spectrographic mode. Asteroid and standard star observations were interspersed within the same airmass range to allow modeling of atmospheric extinc    tion. Data reduction was done using previously outlined procedures [40,41].  Analysis: Band analysis is currently being conducted. So far, only one of this particular subset of asteroids has absorption features located near 1- and 2- μm. The band centers and band area ratios (BAR) are diagnostic of the abundance and composition of the mafic silicates [e.g.,40-49], and will be measured relative to a linear continuum fit tangent to the spectral curve outside the absorption feature [e.g. 44]. To estimate the error, several polynomial fits will be used to sample different ranges of points within the Band I & II spectral intervals. The uncertainty is estimated from the difference between the min & max determined values. After initial measurement of the Band I & Band II centers, the pyroxene chemistry will be determined using [40].  If the pyroxene chemistry is consistent with an HED assemblage, the [48] equations will be used to verify the pyroxene chemistry and if the pyroxene chemistry is consistent with an ordinary chondrite assemblage the [49] equations will be applied as verification of the derived silicate mineralogy.
