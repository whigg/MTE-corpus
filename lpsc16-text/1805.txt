Introduction:  Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) is the study of the kinetic energy of electrons after they have interacted with a thin specimen in the transmission electron microscope (TEM). As such, it is capable of providing information on structure, chemistry and local atomic bonding environments with high spatial and energy resolution. Significant advances in instrument capabilities that include high energy resolution energy spectrometers, aberration correctors and monochromators improve and expand the types of measurements that can be made by TEM-EELS has brought spatial resolutions down to the atomic level. Monochromators in particular have improved working energy resolution to the 0.02-0.10 eV range [1-3]. Here we focus on the 0-120 eV region of the energy loss spectrum where UV and near-IR optical transitions appear and where core losses from key light elements like H and He, and the Si-L edge can be measured. The 100-120 eV region may be especially informative of the state of silicates: The ability to measure optical properties, detect H and He and to measure oxidation states and other solid state properties of silicates provides details on their state of preservation, exposure to space weathering and crystalline or amorphous character. This region is especially attractive for examination of beam-sensitive materials like amorphous silicates because signal-to-noise is high allowing specimens to be probed with shorter acquisition times and relatively lower (electron) doses [1-2].  In extraterrestrial samples, the low-loss region may enable better assessment of the state of preservation of silicates. Most interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) are heated to incandescence for several seconds during atmospheric entry, and the presence of solar flare tracks has long been used as an indicator of minimal alteration since it limits peak heating temperature to below ~650°C [4]. However, recent in-situ TEM heating experiments reveal that chondritic porous (CP) IDPs, believed to originate from comets, can undergo significant chemical and mineralogical alteration below 400°C [5]. In returned Stardust comet samples, the low-loss region may enable us to address a major outstanding question: how to better distinguish aerogel from bona fide cometary amorphous silicates like the GEMS (glass embedded with metal and sulfides) abundant in CP IDPs. While the question of whether the Stardust sample contains amorphous silicates (i.e. GEMS) remains unresolved, the link between comet 81P/Wild 2 and CP IDPs remains incomplete. Results and Discussion:  Figure 1 shows low-loss  spectra from standards and unknowns.  Polyaromatic   Figure 1:  Low loss 0-25 eV spectra.

See also [2].  hydrocarbons (PAHs) like anthracene exhibit a lowloss 5.7 eV feature (Fig. 1a) that corresponds to the 217.5 nm astronomical UV feature linked to ubiquitous PAHs in the interstellar medium [6].  Hydrogen gas exhibits a H-K feature at ~13 eV (Fig. 1b) [7]. Water/ hydroxyl exhibits an prominent H-K feature closer to 14 eV and a weaker feature at ~8.5 eV corresponding to the band gap (Fig. 1c) [1].  The He-K edge onset energy is found to be constant at ~22 eV regardless of its local (solid state) environment (Fig 1d-f).    The astronomical UV feature remains ambiguous but likely corresponds to the π-π* plasmon transition in highly conjugated organics. Figure 1a shows that some organic functionality of astrophysical significance is detectable using low-loss EELS. This feature has also been detected in some IDPs [8], Improvements in energy resolution below ~0.1 eV may extend detection of organic functionality into the near-IR [3]. Detecting H and He in meteoritic specimens is challenging because we find that local solid-state environment is as important as abundance. If they are concentrated in vesicles, they produce strong features in or nearby the vesicles (Fig. 1d & e). If they are dispersed, for example in amorphous silicate matrix, the features are weaker and more difficult to detect (Fig. 1f).  The Si-L core scattering edges from individual GEMS underscore the subtle complexity of local solidstate environments within their silicate matrices. There is significant variation in the Si-L edge jump ratios from one GEMS grain to another, independent of the silicate vs. metal+sulfide volume fraction (Fig. 2). Remarkably, fine structure on the edge from the GEMS with Mg/Si=1 (at.%) is a better match to αSiO2 than to a Mg-rich silicate [9], suggesting that Mg may not be strongly bonded to the silicate network, which is consistent with exposure to H+ and He+ irradiation in space [10]. In other GEMS, the decreasing jump ratio and lack of fine structure may be due to even less short-range order. We also note a strong correlation of jump ratio with C content (C/Si ratio given in wt.%) (Fig. 2b-d). This is consistent with prior work [11] that shows GEMS contain carbon that results in lower overall densities for Si in GEMS. The onset of the Si-L edge at ~105 eV confirms that the oxidation state is predominantly Si4+ in all of the GEMS grains.  Conclusions: New capabilities in the 0-120 eV region of the energy loss spectrum now allow TEMEELS investigations of UV and near-IR optical transitions and core loss studies of key elements including the light elements H and He and the rock-forming element Si. These will be valuable in assessing finegrained extraterrestrial samples for presence of conjugated organics, space weathering effects on grain surfaces, and details of structure and chemistry of silicates, especially amorphous silicates.
