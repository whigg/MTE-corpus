Introduction: PLAty hibonite Crystals (PLACs) and isotopically related hibonite-rich Ca-Al-rich inclusions (e.g., non-platy crystals and aggregates, collectively referred to as PLAC-like CAIs hereafter) are among the most isotopically anomalous materials believed to have formed inside the Solar System [1,2]. Isotope anomalies in PLAC-like CAIs can be of similar magnitude as those in presolar grains (e.g., PLAC-like CAIs show a δ50Ti range of ~300‰ [1,2], which is comparable to many mainstream silicon carbide grains [3]). However, several lines of evidence indicate a Solar System origin for PLAC-like CAIs. For example, with diameters up to ~200 µm, PLAC-like CAIs are significantly larger than presolar grains (typically sub-µm-sized). Furthermore, their Δ17O values fall within the range of Solar System materials [2,4] and their mass-independent isotopic characteristics strongly resemble those of FUN CAIs (i.e., variations in Δ17O, large variations in the neutronrich isotopes 48Ca and 50Ti that tend to correlate in sign, a link between 26Al-depletions and presence of largescale anomalies [4,5 and references therein]). The highly anomalous isotopic character of PLAClike CAIs may indicate that these CAIs formed at an early stage in Solar System history, prior to a widespread distribution of 26Al and large-scale dilution of nucleosynthetic effects. They could thus be among the first materials that formed inside the Solar System. The resulting long residence times inside the solar nebula make PLAC-like CAIs interesting samples to look for effects that could have affected disk materials. Among these is the possibility that nebular materials may have been exposed to high fluxes of solar energetic particles, for example during an early, active period of the young Sun [6], which could have manifested itself in the presence of noble gas isotopes formed by spallation. Therefore, we have analyzed two Murchison hibonite grains for their He and Ne isotopic composition. Here, we report the preliminary results.  Samples and methods: Two hibonite crystals (a stubby, ~50 µm crystal and a platy, ~200 µm crystal) were chosen for this study and analyzed together in one step ('bulk analysis'). These two grains were extracted from an HCl-HF-treated density separate of the Murchison (ME 2752, Field Museum of Natural History) residue alongside other hibonite-rich CAIs presented in [4]. While no isotopic characteristics were determined prior to noble gas measurement, their morphologies and mineral chemistry determined by energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS; average composition of 1 wt% MgO, 89 wt% Al2O3, 8 wt% CaO, 2 wt% TiO2) resemble properties of other PLAC-like CAIs [4]. The total mass of the two grains (1.4×10–6 g) was calculated from volume estimates using scanning electron microscope (SEM) images taken at different stage rotation and tilt angles and an assumed density of 3.84 g cm–3. A conservative ~50% uncertainty was assumed for the volume determination and propagated.  For noble gas analysis, the grains were first cleaned with OptimaTM quality isopropanol and water, then dried and pressed into gold. Noble gases were extracted with a Nd-YAG 1064 nm laser and He and Ne isotopes were measured with an ultra-high-sensitivity noble gas mass spectrometer at ETH Zurich [7]. We used an analytical protocol developed specifically for analyses of very low gas amounts [8]. SEM work after noble gas measurements showed that the hibonites were fully melted, and Ca- and Al-enrichments were found in the gold in the analysis region by EDS. Results: The measured amount of 3He is ~9×10–13 cm3 STP (standard temperature and pressure; 1 cm3 STP = 2.6868×1019 atoms) with an uncertainty on the order of 3–4%, the 3He concentration is (6.0±2.8)×10–7 cm3 STP g–1 (uncertainty dominated by volume estimate). The measured Ne isotopic composition plots close to a mixing line between air [9] and the cosmogenic Ne isotopic composition produced within hibonite ([10]; Fig. 1a). Assuming that the measured composition is a mixture of these two components, the cosmogenic amount of 21Ne (21Necos) is ~2×10–13 cm3 STP, with an uncertainty on the order of 3–4%. The concentration of 21Necos is (1.6±0.7)×10–7 cm3 STP g–1.  Figure 1. a) The measured Ne isotopic composition plots close to the mixing line defined by air Ne [9] and by cosmogenic Ne produced within hibonite during meteoroid exposure [10]. b) The measured 3He and 21Ne gas amounts (gray) are higher than the calculated amounts expected for a ~1.6 Ma [11] meteoroid exposure (solid, red). The difference (dotted, blue) corresponds to the gas amount we ascribe to precompaction exposure in space or the regolith on the parent body. 0.E+00 2.E-13 4.E-13 6.E-13 8.E-13 He-3  Ne-21 Abundance (cm3  STP) Measured Expected for meteoroid exposure Possible preexposure 0 2 4 6 8 10 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 20Ne/22Ne 21Ne/22Ne Cosmogenic,hiboniteMeasuredAira3He 21NeAbundance9(cm3STP)b1689.pdf

Discussion: Assuming that these concentrations of cosmogenic 3He and 21Ne were entirely acquired in the Murchison meteoroid would lead to exposure ages of the hibonites of 34±11 Ma and 51±21 Ma, respectively (assuming the same shielding assumptions for the Murchison meteoroid as [11] and production rates calculated by [10] using the elemental abundances of the hibonites obtained by EDS). These nominal exposure ages are significantly longer than the bulk meteoroid exposure age of Murchison of ~1.6 Ma  [11], indicating that at least one of the two grains analyzed experienced an additional phase of exposure to cosmic rays. This could have occurred at small depths in the parent body regolith before compaction (scenario I), while the grains were free-floating in the solar nebula, possibly close to the young Sun (scenario II), or in interstellar space if the grains are presolar (scenario III). We consider scenario III unlikely, based on the arguments outlined in the introduction.  Scenario I: Support for a regolith precompaction exposure of the analyzed hibonites may come from the long nominal exposure ages of ~30 Ma that have been reported for some Murchison chondrules [11,12]. A regolith irradiation by GCR was favored by [11,12] for the 3He and 21Ne excesses in chondrules, because the excess Ne had a 22Ne/21Ne ratio as expected for GCR production and because excesses were exclusively found in chondrules separated from the clastic matrix, not in chondrules from primary rock fragments (i.e., aggregates that are thought to have experienced the same precompaction exposure history in the parent body). The petrological context of our hibonites within the meteorite (primary rock fragment vs. matrix) could therefore help to distinguish between preexposure origins [12]. However, this context is not known as the studied hibonites were picked from an acid residue obtained from bulk Murchison. Therefore, a nonregolith (scenario II) precompaction exposure history for hibonites cannot entirely be excluded at this point.  Scenario II: If the excess 3He and 21Necos were the result of precompaction exposure while the grains were floating in the solar nebula, nominal precompaction exposure ages for solar and cosmic rays can be calculated from adjusted precompaction exposure concentrations (i.e., cprecompaction floating exposure = cmeasured – cmeteoroid) of 3He and 21Ne using the present-day SCR and GCR production rates at 1 AU from [13]. The resulting precompaction exposure ages are 30±8 Ma and 13±5 Ma for 3He and 21Ne, respectively. As the maximum time between formation of CAIs and incorporation into the meteorite parent bodies is thought to be on the order of ~5 Ma, these ages are too high for free-floating hibonites. In this, perhaps less likely scenario, the enhanced 3He and 21Necos abundances would thus require that cosmic ray fluxes were significantly higher in the early Solar System or that prolonged irradiation occurred close to the young Sun. Conclusions and outlook: The high abundances of 3He and 21Ne found during the analysis of two Murchison hibonites indicate that at least one of the two grains experienced a precompaction exposure to cosmic rays that occurred in a currently unknown setting, either in the parent body regolith or while floating in the solar nebula before parent body formation. If exposure occurred within the solar nebula, the high gas abundances would require a significantly higher cosmic ray flux, e.g., due to higher activity of the young Sun (early active Sun) or in close proximity to the Sun, in an optically thin region of the nebula.  Additional work is planned for the near future to identify the setting of this precompaction exposure. In particular, we plan to analyze a larger number of individual Murchison hibonites for their He and Ne isotopic compositions to improve statistics and to look for variations in the noble gas concentrations among different grains. To explore whether the high gas abundances are due to regolith exposure, we also plan to analyze spinel grains from the same Murchison acid residue. A number of the selected hibonite and spinel grains have already been cut into two pieces using a focused ion beam to allow subsequent isotopic analyses (e.g., 26Al-26Mg).
