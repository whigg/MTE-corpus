Introduction:  SHERLOC is an instrument that is part of the Mars 2020 payload.  It utilizes a deep UV laser (248.6 nm) to induce Raman and fluorescence in organics and minerals [1].  Samples of interest are spatially scanned with the laser to stimulate fluorescence emissions and Raman scattering from the sample. Specifically, fluorescence is generated from electronic transitions in aromatic organics and Raman scatter is generated from vibrational bonds in both organics and minerals [2].  The fluorescence spectra and weaker Raman spectra are collected on the same detector.  This is possible due to separation of the regions of interest in Raman (~251-275 nm) and fluorescence (~275-400 nm) spectra.  SHERLOC will be used on Mars to identify, in situ, interesting samples for sample caching and potential subsequent return to Earth.   The mineral transparency at the wavelengths of interest (250-400 nm) for both the incident laser light and the sample specific photons from fluorescence emission or Raman scattering will affect the interrogation volume of analysis and thus constrain the limits of detection.  To date the depth of penetration of UV photons into natural minerals has not been well characterized.    Here we report on preliminary results using a SHERLOC-like laser to detect organics under thin layers of MMS basalt (Mojave Mars Simulant) [3], kaolinite and gypsum.  These thin layers were formed using crushed mineral powder and a mechanical pellet press. Methods:  Sample preparation. Pellets consisted of three layers. The bottom layer consisted of MMS dust mixed with 10 wt.% cellulose (as a binder).  A second layer consisted of the powdered organic to be analyzed (see figure 1A).  The top layer was a thin layer (~100-200 μm) of organic free-MMS.  The thickness of this layer was measured using a Mitutoyo digital thickness indicator before being applied on top of the organic layer (figure 1B-C). Figure 1.

Each pellet was analyzed at 58 micron spot size over 300 discrete points.  Fluorescence spectra were obtained with 25 pulses and Raman spectra with 1200 pulses.  Theresulting spectra were averaged to yield the spectra seen in figures 2-4. Results and Discussion:  Preliminary results have been obtained for phenanthrene, phenylalanine and alanine under MMS basalt.  The aromatic compounds have been analyzed using fluorescence while the aliphatic alanine was analyzed using Raman spectroscopy.  Figures 2-4 show the averaged spectrum for these three organics (n=300).  In each case there was substantial variability from point to point, ranging from 0 to near 100% transmission.  This is likely due to natural heterogeneity in the MMS matrix.  Natural martian rocks will also show significant variability in their compositions, but these results indicate that the SHERLOC instrument should be able to detect aromatic and aliphatic organics with Raman and fluorescence spectroscopy to a depth of >100 μm in basalt. Fluorescence Results. Fuorescence occurs when a molecule absorbs a UV photon, causing the molecule to enter an excited state. As the molecule relaxes back to the ground state a photon is released, typically of a longer wavelength than the incident photon.  Aromatic compounds typically fluoresce well, making fluorescence spectroscopy ideal for detecting these molecules. Figure 2 shows the averaged fluorescence spectrum for phenanthrene, a representative polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) which has been found in numerous meteorites and chondrites [4].  Peak locations correlate well with peaks observed by analysis of pure phenanthrene, although the relative peak intensity is different, suggesting a possible wavelength dependence on transmission.  The intensity averages ~0.4% of the intensity observed for a pure sample of phenanthrene on top of a mineral surface.  Figure 3 shows the averaged fluorescence spectrum for phenylalanine, an aromatic amino acid essential for all life on Earth.  Peak locations and relative intensities correlate well to the spectrum of pure phenylalanine, with the exception of the peaks at 348 and 365 nm, which have been identified as being caused by a contaminant in the sample.  The intensity was found to average ~2.6% of the intensity of pure phenylalanine on a surface.  Figure 2. Averaged fluorescence spectrum of phenanthrene under 161 ± 19 μm MMS.

Raman results.  When monochromatic light hits a sample a small percentage of the incident photons are scattered inelastically off of the sample.  Raman spectroscopy is based on the collection of these inelastically scattered photons, whose energies depend upon the vibrational energy levels of the analyte.  Raman typically produces signals of much lower intensity than fluorescence spectroscopy but it is highly useful for analysis of molecules which do not fluoresce such as aliphatic hydrocarbons. Figure 4 shows the averaged Raman spectrum for alanine, an aliphatic amino acid.  Peak locations and relative intensities correlate well to the spectrum of pure alanine.  Although the intensity is significantly lower than the intensity of the fluorescence spectra in figures 2 and 3, the relative intensity between subsurface and surface samples of alanine was on the same order of magnitude at ~1.5%.

Conclusions:  Preliminary results show that organic molecules can be detected by the SHERLOC instrument at depths in excess of 100 μm in basaltic minerals.  Aromatic compounds such as phenanthrene and phenylalanine can be detected via fluorescence spectroscopy to a depth of >160 μm.  Aliphatic compounds such as alanine can be detected to a depth of >100 μm using Raman.  The spectra of the subsurface organics investigated herein have been found to correlate well with the spectra of the pure organic.  Further experiments will be performed to constrain the maximum depth and minimum concentrations at which organics can be detected using this method.  The detection depth of these and other organics in various other Mars relevant minerals such as kaolinite and gypsum will also be investigated.  References: [1] Beegle et al. (2015) IEEE, 90, 1-11.
