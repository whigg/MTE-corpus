GEOCHEMISTRY, THERMAL EVOLUTION, AND CRYOVOLCANISM ON CERES WITHA MUDDY ICE MANTLE. M. Neveu and S. J. Desch. School of Earth and Space Exploration,Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287, USA. (mneveu@asu.edu).Introduction: Interpretation of data acquiredat Ceres by the Dawn spacecraft demands a modelfor the evolution of Ceres' structure and composition to date. In a recent paper [1], we presentedsuch a model, consistent with pre-Dawn observations and preliminary data returned by Dawn. Here,we describe this model, compare its physico-chemicaloutcomes to reported observations, and outline possible tests by ongoing Dawn measurements.Internal structure: Constraints on Ceres' density and structure come from its mass of 9.4× 1020kg [2], size, shape (assuming Ceres is hydrostatic)of ≈ 482× 480× 446 km [3], and gravity measurements [3,4]. These suggest a bulk density near 2150kg m−3, with a central density concentration [3].Following [5,6], we assume that Ceres accreted iceand both µm- and mm-sized rock particles (mostlysilicates and organics), and that micron-sized finesstayed suspended in liquid during differentiation,yielding a core of chondrules and a mantle of mixedice and fines ("mud"). This assumption reconcilesapparently conflicting observations of Ceres' nearsurface composition: on one hand, it appears icy,exhibiting little large-scale topography [2]; pit craterssuggestive of volatile basement material [7]; a lowsimple-to-complex crater transition diameter [7]; flows,domes, and evidence for glacial mass wasting [8];and production of water vapor [9]. It also lacks acollisional family, possibly because icy mantle fragments sublimate after ejection [10]. On the otherhand, Ceres' surface is dark and uniform, with meangeometric albedo < 0.1 [11,12] and spectra consistent with hydrated minerals whose unique composition suggest an (in part) endogenic origin [13-15].Moreover, Ceres' small-scale topography requires amaterial stronger than ice [16].Many two-layer structures can be matched tothe above observables by adjusting the bulk rockdensity (which sets the bulk ice:rock ratio) and fraction of rock in fines. Here, we choose a rock densityρc = 2900 kg m−3, that of grains in CM chondrites[1]. Assuming hydrostaticity, the wide range of reported shapes [2,3,17] can be matched by interiorswith a rocky core size up to 360 km. We explore endmembers with 75% of the rock in chondrules and25% in fines, yielding a 360-km core and a mantlecomprising 74 vol% ice and 26 vol% fines; and with1% of the rock in chondrules and 99% in fines (85km core with a mantle comprising 62 vol% fines).Early hydration and differentiation: Our1-D numerical simulations of thermal evolution [1]suggest that following accretion, radionuclide decay heating melts ice in the central layers. Meltingcan occur quickly throughout the interior if Ceresaccretes abundant short-lived radionuclides such as26Al (accretion within 4 Myr after Ca-Al-rich inclusions), or within tens of Myr and only at depthotherwise. In the first case, we assume that chondrules and fines are quickly hydrated and emplacedon the surface, overturned by impacts. In the second case, we calculate analytically that in muddyliquid of density ρl and viscosity η, chondrules of radius D fall distances ∆R by Stokes flow on decadaltimescales:tsettle ≈ 50(ρc − ρl800 kg m−3)−1 ( η0.18 Pa s) ( ∆R100 km) (D1 mm)−2yr(1)This leads to a gravitationally unstable undifferentiated mantle atop a chondrule-free ocean, whichoverturns by Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities within 50Myr at 170 K [18]. In either case, ice sublimatesfrom the surface, leaving a lag deposit of hydrated,µm-sized fines within Ceres' first few tens of Myr.Crater counts to derive surface ages can test thesemodel predictions. Surface particle size may be determined by fits to reflectance spectra.Thermal evolution and present state: Wesimulated Ceres' thermal evolution until the presentday [1], using the same code as [19,20], modified toimplement the assumption that fines and ice arewell mixed by forcing differentiated layers to retaina set percentage of their initial rock mass. Rockyfines have lower thermal conductivity (≈ 1 W m−1K−1) than ice (≈ 3 W m−1 K−1), making the mantle insulating [19]; they also increase its viscosityby a factor (1-φ/0.63)−2 ≈ 3 or 4000 for volumefractions φ = 0.26 and 0.62, respectively [21].These simulations suggest that the present-daycore-mantle boundary in the large-core case is warmenough (≈250 K) to allow liquid brine pockets. Forthe small-core case, the muddy hydrosphere remainsliquid below 110 km depth. These results are robustto various amounts of long-lived radionuclides (COto CI chondrite abundances).Geochemistry: The above scenarios provideample opportunities for water-rock interaction.

investigated equilibrium fluid and rock compositionsusing the geochemical modeling software PHREEQC[22]. Initial rock minerals and abundances werechosen to match representative elemental [23] andmineralogical [24] compositions of CM chondritesto within a few percent for each element and mineral group, including all elements more abundantthan 500 ppm, plus N and other elements. Two initial fluid compositions were simulated: pure waterand water with 5 mol% C, 2 mol% N, 0.5 mol% S,and 520 mol ppm of Cl to approximate the volatile(C, N, S) content of comets [25] and the chlorinecontent of CI chondrites [23].Water-rock interactions yield fluids rich in S (S5O2−6 ),C (methane), and N as NH3 or NH+4 , with <25% ofthe solutes being Na and Ca. Hot fluids can be richin H2. The main mineralogies are magnetite andclays (saponite smectite; antigorite, cronstedtite,and greenalite serpentines; chlorites; NH4-clays),notably in qualitative agreement with those observedby Dawn instruments [15]. Carbonates, which seemprominent on Ceres [14,15], are absent from ourequilibrium mineral assemblages, but present in somesolutions from which they could precipitate uponfreezing or vaporization.Ongoing cryovolcanism? Ceres' surface displays several peculiar, geologically young features:several bright spots, prominent in Occator crater,and domes exemplified by Ahuna Mons [26]. Thebright spots have been interpreted as salt leftoverfrom sublimated water [1,26], and Ahuna Mons asa volcanic construct [27].Cryovolcanism is remarkably plausible in thecontext of our evolution models. Extant subsurface liquid is expected as a refreezing ocean in thesmall-core scenario, bearing solutes leached from itsinteraction with rock; and as brine reservoirs in thelarge-core scenario. As just 2% of a liquid reservoirfreezes, it compresses the liquid, overpressurizing itby the ∼10 MPa needed for it to ascend ∼100 km[28-30]. In the large-core case, the liquid density ρl= 1526 kg m−3 and fines volume fraction φ = 0.26yield a hydrosphere volume increase of 4.1% uponfreezing, equivalent to a global layer 77 m thick (20m once the ice has sublimated away). In the smallcore case, with ρl = 1526 kg m−3 and φ = 0.62,the volume increase is 1.4%. Our simulations suggest that only the upper 110 km have refrozen sofar, corresponding to a global layer 18 m thick aftersublimation. Liquid is likely to effuse to the surfacethrough preexisting fractures, such as those in thebasements of craters [31]. Perhaps basement fractures formed during the Occator impact intersectthe large NW-SE oriented fracture network in theEbisu and Palo mapping quadrants, favoring ongoing effusion in this particular region of Ceres. Evidence of slow effusion might be restricted to largecraters, without sufficient material erupted (<20 mequivalent global layer) to significantly erase impact morphologies at the scales observed by Dawn'sFraming Camera.Because sulfates freeze only a few degrees below0◦C, leaving chlorides in the brine, chloride saltsmay be concentrated relative to sulfates in areas ofcryovolcanic effusions. Fines of aqueously alteredminerals may be erupted along with the fluids.Acknowledgements: This study was fundedby a NASA Earth & Space Science Fellowship andthe Outer Planets Research program.References: [1] Neveu M. and Desch S.
