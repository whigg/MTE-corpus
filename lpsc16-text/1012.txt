Bataillon, 34095 Montpellier cedex 5, France.    Introduction:  Enstatite chondrites, while isotopically close to Earth [1-2], display a most unusual reduced mineralogy, with silicates dominated by almost FeO-free enstatite and miscellaneous sulfides from nominally lithophile elements such as oldhamite (CaS), niningerite (MgS) etc. [3]. The enrichment of oldhamite in rare earth elements (REE) [4-5] has long suggested that enstatite chondrites result from a condensation sequence at supersolar C/O ratios, in which oldhamite would be one of the earliest condensates. Yet evidence of other predicted condensates is lacking and the few refractory inclusions encountered resemble that in other chondrite clans [3]. Evidence has been mounting recently in favor of a sulfidation event during chondrule formation itself [6-7]. Olivine grains, while now in minority, may be relicts [8] from earlier, more “normal”/less reducing formation conditions in the enstatite chondrite reservoir, as backed by their oxygen isotopic composition [9]. We [10] have thus set out to analyze by LA-ICP-MS trace element of individual silicate phases in olivinebearing chondrules (e.g. Fig. 1) in the Sahara 97096 EH3 chondrite.    Figure 1: Composite X-ray map of porphyritic olivine chondrule S14 (Mg = blue, Al = yellow, Si = pink, S = cyan, Ca = green, Fe = red).  Results and interpretation: Results on enstatite and olivine (Fig. 2) are generally fairly comparable to their counterparts in type I chondrules in LL3 ordinary chondrites [11] (and for enstatite, to previous SIMS analyses in unequilibrated enstatite chondrites by [12]). As to mesostasis, negative anomalies in Eu and Yb (and sometimes Sm) not uncommonly occur. As these are generally lacking in the ferromagnesian silicates, mesostasis seems to have evolved out of equilibrium with the latter.    Figure 2: Average REE patterns of silicate phases in the analyzed chondrules compared with our results on LL3 type I chondrules [11].  It is then tempting to link the negative Eu and Yb anomalies of mesostasis to the positive ones than characterize the majority of Sahara 97096 oldhamite [5]. Indeed, an equilibrium between oldhamite and incompatible-element-enriched mesostasis could explain the enrichment in REE of the former (not unlike the explanation put forward by [13] for aubritic oldhamite). The anomalies themselves (difficult to otherwise explain in oldhamite in a condensation scenario, e.g. [5]) would presumably reflect Eu and Yb having been in the divalent state rather than the usual trivalent state underlying 1012.pdf

the nominal smooth “lattice strain model” [14] dependence of the partition coefficient on atomic number.   The emerging scenario to account for such a partitioning would be (i) a sulfidation event affecting the mesostasis [6,7], perhaps at moderate temperature, leading to the formation of oldhamite along with other sulfides followed by (ii) expulsion (by surface tension effects or inertial forces) of the opaque phases now found as independent nodules (see also [15]). This would explain the REE complementarity of silicates and oldhamite in enstatite chondrites [16]. Two of the analyzed chondrules showed anomalous patterns, with light REE (LREE) being enriched over heavy REE (HREE) in the ferromagnesian silicates (Fig. 3). In one of them (S16), complementary anomalies in Sm, Eu, Yb occur, bringing direct evidence of a partitioning of those in divalent state, and possibly the first evidence for occurrence of Sm2+ in natural minerals. The reason of LREE enrichment is not known, though it was experimentally produced by [17] near liquidus conditions. Perhaps the general overabundance of LREE relative to equilibrium predictions seen in chondrules from all chondrite clans (e.g. [11,12,1820]) could be a less extreme manifestation of the same process. Conclusion: Our observations indicate that the REE systematics of enstatite chondrite oldhamite may relate to igneous partitioning with chondrule mesostasis subsequent to a sulfidation event, before expulsion from the chondrules. This would obviate the need of a special condensation sequence in the reservoirs of enstatite chondrite so that condensation may have essentially been a single event at the scale of the solar system. Still, the conditions prevailing during at least part of the enstatite chondrite chondrule formation processes would be peculiar, and have yet to be better quantified (requiring e.g. experimental work on the conditions under which Yb and Sm may be divalent; see already [21]).
