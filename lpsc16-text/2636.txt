Introduction: Shatter cones are the only known macroscopic feature considered as evidence for shock metamorphism. Their distinct conical and curved fracture surfaces, with diverging striae, and their hierarchical bifurcation (horse-tailing), makes them easily identifiable in the field. Nonetheless, their occurrence is heterogeneous throughout the crater record and their mode of formation still not understood. To date, several models of shatter cone formation exist. Most authors align the formation of shatter cones with the passage of the shock front or the release from shock loading [1-3]. Several reports of melt films on shatter cone surfaces might shed a new light on the formation mechanism (e.g., [4-7]) and help to constrain pressuretemperature-time conditions of shatter cone formation. In this study, we present a detailed description of fresh melt films found on shatter cones from hypervelocity impact experiments [7], in the context of the Multidisciplinary Experimental and Modeling Impact research Network (MEMIN). Materials and Methods: A series of hypervelocity impact experiments was performed using two-stage light-gas guns at the Fraunhofer Ernst-Mach Institute for High-Speed Dynamics in Freiburg. We thoroughly examined the MEMIN hypervelocity cratering experiments by handpicking and soft stimulated fracturation of the crater subsurface in the search for slightly curved or conical and striated fracture surfaces. A detailed 3D model and a morphometric analysis of each potential shatter cone fragment was carried out with white-light interferometry (WLI) [7]. Here, we present scanning electron microscopy (SEM) data of the fracture surfaces, performed with a Zeiss Leo 1525 field-emission SEM at the ALU Freiburg and a JEOL JSM-6610LV SEM at the MfN Berlin. Results: So far we recovered 14 fragments with slightly curved or conical geometries and diverging striation patterns which were formed in the hypervelocity experiments. Those ejecta fragments fulfilling the morphological criteria of shatter cones, were found in experiments with 20 to 80 cm sized target cubes of sandstone, quartzite and limestone impacted with 2.5 to 12 mm sized aluminum, steel and iron meteorite projectiles and impact velocities ranging from 4.6 to 7.8 km/s. Here, we present shatter cone fragments recovered from experiments A15-5185, 5 mm aluminum projectile shot onto dry sandstone at 4.59 km/s (Fig.1a), and E3-3384, 12 mm Campo del Cielo iron meteorite shot onto water-saturated sandstone at 4.95 km/s (Fig.1b). The striated fracture surfaces of those fragments are typically covered with a 1 to 10 µm thin film of melt-textured material very different from the fractured and crushed sandstone underneath (Fig.2). The fragments revealed a variety of melt textures: (i) a very vesicle-rich film of melt splats and splashes, a (ii) "frothy", reticulate film with melt smears and fibers, which alternates with (iii) smooth, almost polished surfaces marked by very fine melt striations. In addition we also observed scattered microspherules firmly attached to the surface or trapped in vesicles (Fig.1a).

The smooth, vesicle-poor and SiO2-rich (>90 wt.%) films are preferentially visible at the ridges of the superordinate striation pattern and always elongated parallel to the groove and ridge system and show very fine, needle-like striations and smears which are also stretched strictly parallel to the grooves, along the smooth melt surface (Fig.1a).

melt, mainly of accessory phyllosilicates, is marked by fine, nose-like fibers, smeared towards the cones apex and elongated parallel to the grooves and ridges (Fig.1b). The frothy textures are patchier distributed than the smooth films resembling the initial distribution of phyllosilicates in the parent rock. The vesicle-rich melt splashes, having high TiO2 (~43-56 wt.%) contents represent a mixture of varying degree with the reticulated phyllosilicate melts and molten accessory rutile (for a more detailed description of melt composition and mixing please refer to the companion abstract by Hamann et al. (this volume)). The melt splashes appear less smeared than the frothy textures and have irregular and curved fibers and are overlaying adjacent melt films. The entire melt film is interrupted by sharp polygonal crack patterns. Discussion: The melting of rutile, the mixing of melt and vaporization supports very high process temperatures localized in the narrow µm-thick melt film along the shatter cone surface as proposed by [8] and [9]. Our melt textures resemble the fibers and smears as well as the basaltic glass foam or "froth" from shatter cones of the Sudbury impact structure documented by [9]. They also put forward the idea of very high stages of shock metamorphism localized along the shatter cone surface. We think very high pressures are probably not the driving force but intense heating is. For the vesiculated TiO2-Al2O3-rich melt splashes, rapid pressure release can be an explanation. But in addition we also observe a clear directional sinistral shear movement, shown by stair-stepping, melt fibers and deformed vesicles. The combination of both, rapid pressure release and intense frictional heating, due to very high strain rates and shear stresses, could produce severe heating. Thus we hypothesize the vesiculated melt-splashes form at locations of pressure release and the smooth melt surfaces as shear movement, showing the mixed mode fracture character of shatter cones.
