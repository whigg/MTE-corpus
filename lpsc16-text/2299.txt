Introduction:  Comets are icy remnants of Solar System formation, and as such contain the most primitive volatile and organic materials. The NRC Planetary Science Decadal Survey for the period of 2013-2022 [1] listed Comet Surface Sample Return (CSSR) mission concepts as a high-priority for the New Frontiers program. Such a CSSR mission could be the first to penetrate a comet surface, collect a sample, and potentially return it to Earth for subsequent detailed analysis in the laboratory. In order to achieve this objective, tool design and testing with relevant simulants is key to demonstrate that a comet sample of a volume of 500 cc containing materials originating from a depth of ~ 10 cm can be collected. These requirements provided the essential inputs to the design of a new sampling system at Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the Biblade Sampler [2]. This sampler is a new technology that must be tested and validated in realistic comet simulant materials to achieve a high Technology Readiness Level. The surfaces of cometary nuclei have been studied closely through flyby missions such as Deep Space 1, Deep Impact, and Stardust. From these missions, we can make inferences regarding the physical properties of cometary surfaces. The surface shear strength of comets has been reported to be 1-100 kPa [3]. Numerous reports on the low bulk density of comets, on the order of 0.4-0.8 g/cm3, suggest that comets are highly porous in nature [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. With the recent landing of Philae on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, it has been suggested that the surface of the comet at the landing site location have a penetration resistance above 4 MPa [10]. Additionally, comets are thought to contain a wide range of grain sizes [11]. Here we describe the Mechanical Porous Ambient Comet Simulants (MPACS) suite of materials currently used to test and validate the Biblade Comet Sampling System [2]. We developed MPACS to represent the range of properties expected at a comet surface and characterized their properties (microstructure, density, porosity). MPACS is a homogeneous geological material that can be produced with weak strengths, brittle failure modes and low densities, while allowing researchers to tune specific mechanical properties. This permits the manufacture of simulants that mimic the mechanical properties expected for a variety of planetary surfaces. The material can be made in a selection of strengths allowing targeted strengths and even variable strengths within samples. The manufacturing process also allows for "inclusions" to be added, providing heterogeneity among samples. Methods: Mix Designs. For the purpose of creating ambient comet simulant materials for the Comet Surface Sample Return program that mechanically represent the surface of comets, shear strength, grain size, porosity and homogeneity have been identified as key properties. The simulant materials were initially developed to fall within a shear strength range of 1-100 kPa, densities between 0.2-0.8 g/cm3 and porosities greater than 50%. This suite of materials have a measured uniaxial compressive strength between 40-300 kPa and cone penetration resistance range of 0.3-6.5 MPa. A baseline mix design of MPACS was developed using equal parts Quikrete® Quick Setting Cement and (< 40 µm) Pumicite combined, and added to water and a foaming agent. The wet and dry components were then whisked using a Hobart A-200 Stand Mixer for 120 seconds. It was then cast into the desired mold, ranging from small cylinders to various box sizes. The mix designs require a minimum of 21 days to cure and fully dry out. The curing process is a mineralization process that occurs between the water and the cement to generate a binder that cements the aggregate grains together (Figure 1). The shear strength and density of the material was tuned by varying the amount of foaming agent and binder to aggregate ratio within the mixture. A relationship was found within the current mix designs between the amount of foaming agent and shear strength.  This relationship was used to tune simulants at incre Figure 1.

Presented here are three strengths of MPACS materials (termed A, B, and C) that differ in their physical and mechanical properties. Investigations are currently underway to produce additional variations of the MPACS materials. Material Properties. Density measurements were obtained on cured MPACS samples and porosity was calculated as the ratio of the densities of the solid components to total density of the sample. Shear strength measurements were conducted on 1.5-inch diameter sample cylinders to ensure samples were within the 1-100 kPa desired range using an actuated direct shear mechanism linked to a Mark-10, 7-Series force gauge recording at 1000 Hz. The comet simulant material was completely sheared and the force gauge measured the force curve required to do this. To validate our shear testing apparatus, samples of the MPACS materials were sent to California Testing and Inspection, a Los Angeles based geological materials testing laboratory. Cone penetration resistance measurements were obtained for each of the current mix designs. A Mark-10, 7-series force gauge with an attached cone penetrator of ¼-inch diameter is moved by a linear stage and motor into the MPACS material that is secured on a table top (Figure 2). Materials properties data of the MPACS suite is described in Table 1. Discussion: MPACS materials provide an opportunity to simulate variable features at ambient temperatures and pressures to appropriately challenge sample acquisition systems for comets, asteroids, and planetary surfaces. These simulants were invented to mechanically represent the known properties of cometary surfaces under ambient conditions thus allowing testing of hardware to be completed in a less tedious and more cost effective manner. Previous testing of comet surface mechanical hardware has been conducted using Grill Brick© and Foam Glas© materials. These materials are different from MPACS in that both consist of a framework structure with unnaturally large pore spaces and a high bulk compressive strength. MPACS materials contain a composite structure of bonded grains and induced pore spaces. Thus, MPACS is the highest fidelity existing comet simulant for comet surface hardware mechanical testing applications.
