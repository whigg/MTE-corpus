Introduction:  A thick reflection-free zone (RFZ) detected by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) Shallow Radar (SHARAD) instrument beneath Planum Australe on Mars has been interpreted as multiple layers of nearly pure, low-porosity CO2 ice [1-3].  If the ice were to be released today it is estimated that the global atmospheric pressure would double to more than 12 mbar, and thus significantly increase the stability of liquid water on the surface.  Because the CO2 ice was likely deposited as a result of atmospheric collapse during geologically recent obliquity minima [1,2], it follows that CO2 was a more abundant climate buffering agent in the geologically recent past. The spatial extent of the detected CO2 ice coincides with surface albedo and landforms consistent with sublimation (polygonal ground and pits) and perhaps glacial flow [3].  It corresponds nearly perfectly to a mapped geologic unit (AA3) that is dark-toned and  non-layered, and commonly exposed in large troughs underlying the thin residual cap's water ice and CO2 ice layers (AA4a and AA4b, respectively) [4,5].   Here we report on the effort to analyze areas where the AA3 geologic unit is exposed using hyperspectral visible/near infrared (0.4-3.9 µm) data from the MRO Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) [6].  Even though the sampling depth of CRISM data is limited to tens of microns, we characterize the spectral properties of the upper surface to determine what, if any, ice signatures may be attributable to the buried ice detected by SHARAD.  If there are no definitive signatures, then buried ice layers may be thermodynamically stable and isolated from the current atmospheric environment by several meters of water ice and dust lag.  Alternatively, a convincing CO2 ice signature associated with this unit could suggest a slowly dwindling reservoir and corroborate a young age for the observed landforms.   Observations:  Very few CRISM images covering the AA3 unit were acquired during previous Mars years (MY).  Consequently, a new imaging campaign was developed and implemented during the late southern summer season of MY 32 (Ls = 300-360°) in order to minimize the presence of seasonal surface frost.  Hyperspectral targeted (~20m/pix) and hyperspectral mapping (~200 m/pix) observations were scheduled to achieve both high spatial resolution coverage of select locations and increased coverage to explore broad differences between surface units. After preliminary examination, images of the troughs near the beginning of this time period remained largely obscured by clouds [see 7] and/or complicated by seasonal frost; therefore, subsequent analysis was limited to observations acquired from ~Ls = 330-360° (Fig 1). CRISM images were reduced from calibrated I/F to corrected I/F with associated spectral summary parameters calculated using the CRISM Analysis Toolkit (CAT) [8,9]. Preliminary Results:  Two targeted images have been the focus of detailed analysis so far.  FRS00029D7A (Ls = 336.4º; -88.45ºN, 10.63ºE) covers a high latitude trough that exposes the AA3 unit (Fig 2).  Its surface morphology is consistent with previous descriptions of lag, including decameter-scale polygons and lack of layering.  FRS00036651 (Ls = 327.9º; -86.74ºN, 248.89ºE) covers a ~4 km diameter circular depression interpreted as a sublimation pit within the AA3 unit (Fig 3).  We also examined HSP00036F50 (Ls = 343.8º; -86.739ºN, 16.175ºE), which crosses the residual cap units and low albedo troughs, as well as several water ice outliers.    Water ice and CO2 ice are distinguished at visible/near-IR wavelengths by distinct sets of absorptions. Broad bands at 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0 µm indicate water ice, whereas narrow bands at 1.435, 2.28, 2.34, 3.01, and Figure 1. Planum Australe geologic units [4,5] with late summer season (Ls = 300-360°) CRISM coverage overlain. Red footprints indicate targeted images (FRT, HRL, HRS, FRS) while yellow represent hyperspectral mapping (HSP). The AA3 unit is shown in a dark rose color with dashed line indicating extent of buried CO2 ice.  Locations of Figures 2 and 3 are circled and labeled in black. 2130.pdf

3.32 are diagnostic of CO2 ice (Fig 4). (Several narrow bands near 2.0 µm are difficult to disentangle from water ice and residual atmospheric CO2.) Extracted CRISM spectra reveal materials dominated by 1) water ice, 2) CO2 ice, 3) CO2 + water ice, and 4) little to no ice of either variety. The strongest CO2 ice-only and water ice-only signatures are found in the stratigraphically higher residual cap units, as expected. The AA3 trough (Fig 2) exhibits weak water ice absorptions in some locations; there is a possible CO2 ice contribution at 1.435 µm, though this feature is quite weak so the upper surface is dominated by non-ice materials. The floor of the sublimation pit (Fig 3) also hosts high   albedo outcrops of residual cap units.  The sloping walls of the pit, however, exhibit weak but distinct spectral features consistent with the presence of water + CO2 ice.    Summary: Understanding the stability of the substantial subsurface CO2 ice reservoir discovered by SHARAD has important implications for modern Mars’ climate fluctuations. Our investigation reveals a tantalizing CO2 ice signature associated with exposures of the spatially correlated AA3 geologic unit which may support net sublimation.  However, at this time, we are unable to rule out spectral contamination by sub-pixel seasonal frost, because the slightly enhanced CO2 ice signature occurs in locally darker and/or more shadowed (colder) locations.  Additional analysis, or targeting that includes active exposure of the AA3 unit, may yield a more definitive verdict. References:  [1] Phillips, R. J. et al. (2011) Science, 332, 838–841.
