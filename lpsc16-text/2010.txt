Introduction: Seismology is a vital tool for understanding the interior structure of planets and Solar System objects. The InSight mission to Mars will potentially deploy both a three-component broadband (SEIS-VBB) and three short period seismometers (SEIS-SP) onto the surface of Mars. These instruments will be used to constrain the interior structure, including determination of the size and state of the Martian core [1-4]. In this study we use a single terrestrial analog station and random draws of seismic events to investigate 1) the quality and quantity of events needed to accurately recover the terrestrial core with ScS and PcP phases, and 2) estimate the total uncertainty in the size of the core that would be obtained from a Marslike distribution of events. Methods: Using InSight as our model planetary seismic mission, we design our analog to simulate a Mars-like dataset using terrestrial events spanning two years, roughly the same timespan of InSight's data collection during the prime mission (Fig. 1). We analyze the terrestrial dataset using algorithms that will be applied to the InSight dataset, and put artificial limitations on our knowledge of source location, timing and internal velocity models. To better simulate the data expected from InSight, events are randomly selected with a probability assigned to mimic the distribution of magnitudes and distance ranges expected for a planet without the strong signature of plate tectonics [5]. Uncertainty in source location and timing are also added before stacking for core reflected phases. Here we focus on investigating the utility of ScS and PcP phases for detecting core radius of the Earth; these seismic phases travel down through the mantle as shear (S) and compressional (P) waves, reflect off the outer core, and return the surface (Fig. 2). ScS and PcP waves are highly sensitive to the depth and impedance contrast at the core mantle boundary (CMB) and have been used to resolve the size of the lunar core [6].  Analog Earthquake Database: Seismic data were obtained from the Incorporated Research Insitutions for Seismology (IRIS) Data Management Center [7]. These data include all teleseismic earthquakes with magnitudes >4.6 during the years 2010-2011 recorded at the Black Forest Observatory in Germany (BFO). The choice of station is somewhat arbitrary, but BFO is located away from plate boundaries and has previously been used as a Martian analog site [1]. This initial database consisted of over 4000 events, and we visually inspected each time window using the Seismic Analysis Code [8] to remove seismograms with multiple events or very low signal-to-noise ratios. The final database contained 1461 events with well-defined surface wave and body wave arrivals. Fig. 1 shows histograms of the final database based on magnitude and distance from the station. This database is complete down to magnitudes >5.0. Future work will include additional events at lower magnitudes, but here we focus on the detection of teleseismic events >50ยบ in epicentral distance.  Simulated Martian database: From this terrestrialdatabase we selected a random subset of events to simulate the seismicity of Mars. This is based upon global maps of fault structures and a prediction for the expected seismicity of Mars [5]. The event selection is also designed to remove the epicentral distance bias created by plate tectonics. For example, we downweight the likelihood of selecting events that occur between 80-90 degrees away from BFO as they are associated with the Sumatran subduction zone. These quasi-random draws of events provide a better estimation for a Mars-like distribution of events and will be used to study the quantity and quality events needed to constrain core size and its associated uncertainty. These uncertainties will be compounded by the uncertainites in the source location and distance, as well as the underlying uncertainites in the Martian crustal and mantle structure.  Figure 1. Distribution of source magnitudes and epicentral distances in our refined analog dataset. A) Magnitude bins to which the probability of selection was assigned. Bins are 4.65, 5-5.5, 5.5-6, 6-6.5 and all events > 6.5. B) Distribution of events based on distance, each bin size is 10ยบ.  Core Models: To search for the core in our analog dataset, a seismic velocity model is needed to compute expected travel times for core reflected phases. We constructed three separate velocity models and use these models to predict travel time curves with the TauP toolkit [9]. These models were initially based on Magnitude 5 6 7 8 9 No .

In the future we plan to use models that are derived only from constraints that would mirror those available to the InSight mission, such as 1-D velocity models derived from multiple orbit surface waves [1] and mineral physics-based models [11]. The resulting shift in the travel time curves for these models is shown in Figure 3. A solid line indicates that there is no change in travel times, as should be expected for phases P and S where the waves do not interact with the core. A shaded region for travel times of PcP, ScS, and PKiKP illustrate how much the travel time is affected by shifting the distance to the CMB.   Figure 2. Seismic approach to detecting the depth of the core. A) Different paths of the ScS wave; black lines are the depth to CMB. B) Seismic velocity models for different outer core radii. The solid line is the PREM model and the dashed are the two models which have core radii of 2771km and 2971km. Blue lines are P wave velocities, red lines are S wave velocities.   Measuring core depth: To search for the depth of the core, we use the transverse component of motion for ScS arrivals, and the vertical for PcP detections [10]. The travel time difference in ScS from a 200 km change in the depth of the core ranges from about 55 seconds at a distance of 0 degrees to 8 seconds at a distance of 98 degrees. This is outside the expected error from source location and traveltime heterogeneity from the background model [1,4].Using the predicted travel times from each model, we stack along the moveout of the ScS and PcP phases. Models that accurately predict the core phase moveouts will result in a coherent ScS or PcP while other models will defocus the core reflections. To simulate uncertainties associated with a single station location, we will adjust the predicted arrival time of the core phases by typical uncertainties obtained from the literature [13].   Summary of Expected Results: Future work will attempt to both locate the identified quake and stack for structure simultaneously to obtain a fully quantified estimate for the error in core structure. Given a sufficiently well located marsquake, core reflected phases will be invaluable for determining the depth of the Martian CMB. Approaches such as locating impacts and surface disturbances via orbital imaging [12] will also be invaluable for constraining the Martian interior. Our work will improve measurements of the Martian core obtained through single-stangle seismic data and aid understanding the uncertainties inherent in a single-station approach, and is applicable to other seismically active objects throughout the Solar System.
