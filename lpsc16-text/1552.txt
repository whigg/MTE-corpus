Introduction: Sediments from the Late Eocene (ca. 34-37 Ma ago) show signs of extraterrestrial events affecting the Earth at the time: 1) a long-duration  3Hepeak [1]; 2) at least five large impact structures, among them Popigai (~90 km), the largest known in the Cenozoic,  and  Chesapeake  Bay (~40  km)  [2];  3)  global ejecta layers and Ir  peaks, some of which have tentatively been connected to known impacts [3]; 4) a shortlived  peak  of  extraterrestrial  spinel  grains  identified within a  65  cm interval  at  Massignano  (Italy),  right above the  lowest  ejecta  layer  at  that  site  [4].  There might actually be two slightly overlapping spinel grain peaks, as the 17 spinel grains in the lower 25 cm of the peak appear to  be H-chondritic in chemical composition, while 7 of the 8 grains in the upper 40 cm appear to  be  L-chondritic  (and  only one  H-chondritic)  [4]. Several explanations have been put forward to explain at least one of the signs, including a comet swarm [1], interstellar clouds [5], dust ejected from the Moon [6], the break-up of a Mars-crosser asteroid [7], an asteroid break-up  event  which formed  the  Brangäne  asteroid family [8],  gravitational perturbations of  the  asteroid belt and dust from asteroid tails [4]. The spinel grains confirm that ordinary chondritic bodies were involved, and add an interesting twist to the interpretation of the events of the Late  Eocene.  Why are the spinel grain peaks so short-lived (10s of ka at most) compared to the 3He peak (~2.2 Ma), and why do they appear in the middle of the 3He interval? The bed in which the grains were  found starts  immediately above the ejecta  layer associated with Popigai (Chesapeake Bay ejecta is not present at Massignano) [2]. Schmitz et al. [4] suggest that the H- and L-chondritic grains were detached from the regoliths of the Popigai and Chesapeake Bay impactors, respectively, by tidal forces in space, and only settled on Earth a few 100 to  1000 years later.  This would explain the gap in deposition of spinel grains between the Popigai ejecta blanket and the layer in which the lower spinel grain peak is found. However, a possible alternative interpretation of the gap is that the spinel grain peaks are not directly connected to the Popigai / Chseapeake bay events. Here we propose and discuss two such alternative scenarios. Scenario  1:  Tidal  disruption  of  a  Temporarily Captured Orbiter (TCO):  TCOs are Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) which approach the Earth on slow trajectories, completing at  least one orbit within three Hillradii around the Earth in a geocentric reference frame, often  following near-chaotic  trajectories  [9].  At  any time, Earth should have one TCO of no more than 1 m diameter,  but  larger  NEOs  are  occasionally captured over geologic time-scales [9].  About 1% of all TCOs eventually impact the Earth, and given the near-random distribution  of  their  geocentric  orbital  elements  as mapped  by  [9],  roughly  10%  of  them  should  pass within the Roche limit at  20'000 km. Internally weak, large TCOs (i.e., rubble piles with a significant fraction of regolith) could then undergo tidal disruption. Fragments of tidally disrupted TCOs would continue their orbital evolution on  TCO-like,  near-chaotic  orbits  of their own, some of them eventually (typically within a few years [9]) colliding with the Earth. Using the spinel grain abundances (>63 μm) in ordinary chondritic meteorites  given by [10],  and an assumed global spinel grain layer similar in thickness to  the one at  Massignano, the 18 H-chondritic grains imply a globally deposited meteoritic mass of (0.14-5.5)  × 1011 kg. The 7 L-chondritic grains imply a meteoritic mass of (0.041.3)  ×  1011 kg. If we conservatively assume that  only 1% of the debris from the disrupted TCOs collides with the Earth (i.e., a piece of debris from a TCO tidal disruption has no higher chance of colliding with the Earth than a random TCO), the disrupted asteroids were kmsized, i.e., 1.1-3.7 km for the H-chondritic grains, and 0.9-2.3 km for the L-chondritic grains. Given the observed  size-frequency distribution  of  NEOs  [11]  and the  present-day  capture  frequency for  H=24  objects given by [9], a km-sized (H < 18) TCO should be captured roughly once every ~3 Ma. Tidal disruption of a km-sized TCO should occur every ~30 Ma, and more frequently during times of increased impactor  flux. A ~20 time higher flux of km-sized asteroids can likely account for the two spinel grain peaks during the Late Eocene (assuming both peaks are  from TCO disruptions). Incidentally, similarly short-lived peaks of spinel grains from TCO disruptions might also be observed at other times in the Earth's sedimentary record. Scenario 2:  An Eltanin-like marine impact: In this  interpretation  of  the  Late  Eocene  spinel  grain peaks, they represent the weathering-resistant remains of  an  ejecta  layer  of  a  deep  marine  impact  in  the Mediterranean region at  the time, similar to  the more recent  (~2.15  Ma)  Eltanin  impact  in  the  Southern Ocean. The Eltanin impact site was discovered by the recovery of  strongly disturbed Eocene to  Pleistocene sediments,  strongly enriched  in up  to  cm-sized,  unmelted  meteoritic  debris  [12].  From  mass  estimates based on meteoritic debris density and Ir fluxes, an im pactor diameter of 1-4 km has been suggested [13]. A surface  density of  meteoritic ejecta  of  about  2000 8000 g/m2 is observed in the central regions of the debris field, extending for several 100 km. In comparison with the Late  Eocene site  at  Massignano,  the 18 Hchondritic grains of the lower peak and the 7 L-chondritic grains of the upper peak can be translated into surface densities of 0.03 - 1.1 g/m2, and 0.007 - 0.26 g/m2, respectively, using again the values given by [10]. These values are 3 to 5 orders of magnitude below the values observed at the Eltanin sites. Since the thickness of ejecta blankets scale with the inverse cube of the distance to the impact site [14], this might indicate a distance of a few 1000 km to the impact site, but local sea floor topography, currents and the asymmetrical shapes of ejecta blankets might also affect  the debris density [15].  Given that  at  least  five large  terrestrial  impact structures are known in the Late Eocene [2], we expect at  least  ten  similarly large  impact  structures  in  the ocean. There is a ~35% chance that a random location on the sea-floor would be within 2000 km of one of these  marine  impact  sites  (however,  land  dominates within that radius of the Late Eocene Massignano). An internal consistency test of the marine impact scenario is given by the Ir abundance of 50-200 pg/g in the sediment layer in which the grains were found [16] (note that  even higher  Ir  abundances are  found within the ejecta blanket further below). Using an Ir concentration of 500 ng/g for H- and L chondrites [17], the meteoritic mass fraction is (1-4)  × 10-4, i.e., 100 kg of limestone from these layers should contain 0.01-0.04 g of meteoritic material. This is within (and close to the geometric mean of) the ranges of 0.005-0.18 g and 0.002-0.07 g derived from the spinel grain abundances in the lower and upper spinel grain peaks,  respectively. Therefore, there was no selective fractionation of the Ir-carrier and the spinel grains, relative to ordinary chondritic values. Testable  predictions  for  the  scenarios: In  the TCO  scenario,  the  spinel  grains  are  distributed  uniformly over the surface of the Earth. One would thus expect to observe a similar H- and L-chondritic spinel grain peak at other Late Eocene sites world-wide, regardless whether the site is marine or sub-aerial. Since the typical deposition time of TCO debris is a few years at most, sampling of a non-bioturbated section at high time-resolution  should  also  provide  a  much  sharper peak than the one found in Massignano. Furthermore, if all grains are derived from a loose asteroidal regolith, they would likely show a characteristic correlation between cosmic-ray-produced and solar wind (SW) light noble gases, as observed e.g. by [18,19]. The short time of space exposure after a TCO disruption (a few years) is unlikely to  strongly influence the  cosmogenic and SW content.  If  the H- and L-chondritic spinel grains represent two separate tidal disruption events of TCOs, their average SW content and cosmic-ray exposure age will likely differ, each representing the individual history of the disrupted asteroid. There is a small chance that the Popigai impactor  was a large  fragment  of  a  disrupted TCO, and thus the spinel grains and the asteroid would have the same origin. In that  case, the time of deposition of the spinel grains should be within a few years after the deposition of the ejecta blanket. In  the  marine  impact  scenario,  the  spinel  grain peaks at Massignano would be a local feature (within several 1000 km) and thus not expected at equal intensity at  sufficiently remote  places  (other  marine sites might have other,  unrelated spinel grain peaks,  while terrestrial sites should not have them). One could argue that since the grains are most likely sampling an interior position of the asteroid,  they may not  have been exposed  to  cosmic rays or  SW implantation.  However, [20]  found cosmogenic radionuclides in a  sample of Eltanin material, implying a position of that sample near the surface, within a few 100 ka before impact. In fact, since most  large asteroids are  rubble piles [21],  it  is conceivable that all interior material has at some point been close to  the surface,  where it  was irradiated by cosmic rays and/or SW. The detection of cosmogenic and/or solar wind derived noble gases would thus not be sufficient to exclude the marine impact scenario.
