TWO  ALTERNATIVE  SCENARIOS  TO  EXPLAIN  THE  STRANGE  EXTRATERRESTRIAL SPINELGRAIN RECORD OF THE LATE EOCENE M. M. M. Meier1, N.

Theremight actually be two slightly overlapping spinel grainpeaks, as the 17 spinel grains in the lower 25 cm of thepeak appear to  be H-chondritic in chemical composition, while 7 of the 8 grains in the upper 40 cm appearto  be  L-chondritic  (and  only one  H-chondritic)  [4].Several explanations have been put forward to explainat least one of the signs, including a comet swarm [1],interstellar clouds [5], dust ejected from the Moon [6],the break-up of a Mars-crosser asteroid [7], an asteroidbreak-up  event  which formed  the  Brangäne  asteroidfamily [8],  gravitational perturbations of  the  asteroidbelt and dust from asteroid tails [4]. The spinel grainsconfirm that ordinary chondritic bodies were involved,and add an interesting twist to the interpretation of theevents of the Late  Eocene.  Why are the spinel grainpeaks so short-lived (10s of ka at most) compared tothe 3He peak (~2.2 Ma), and why do they appear in themiddle of the 3He interval? The bed in which the grainswere  found starts  immediately above the ejecta  layerassociated with Popigai (Chesapeake Bay ejecta is notpresent at Massignano) [2]. Schmitz et al. [4] suggestthat the H- and L-chondritic grains were detached fromthe regoliths of the Popigai and Chesapeake Bay impactors, respectively, by tidal forces in space, and onlysettled on Earth a few 100 to  1000 years later.  Thiswould explain the gap in deposition of spinel grains between the Popigai ejecta blanket and the layer in whichthe lower spinel grain peak is found. However, a possible alternative interpretation of the gap is that the spinelgrain peaks are not directly connected to the Popigai /Chseapeake bay events. Here we propose and discusstwo such alternative scenarios.Scenario  1:  Tidal  disruption  of  a  TemporarilyCaptured Orbiter (TCO):  TCOs are Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) which approach the Earth on slow trajectories, completing at  least one orbit within three Hillradii around the Earth in a geocentric reference frame,often  following near-chaotic  trajectories  [9].  At  anytime, Earth should have one TCO of no more than 1 mdiameter,  but  larger  NEOs  are  occasionally capturedover geologic time-scales [9].  About 1% of all TCOseventually impact the Earth, and given the near-randomdistribution  of  their  geocentric  orbital  elements  asmapped  by  [9],  roughly  10%  of  them  should  passwithin the Roche limit at  20'000 km. Internally weak,large TCOs (i.e., rubble piles with a significant fractionof regolith) could then undergo tidal disruption. Fragments of tidally disrupted TCOs would continue theirorbital evolution on  TCO-like,  near-chaotic  orbits  oftheir own, some of them eventually (typically within afew years [9]) colliding with the Earth. Using the spinelgrain abundances (>63 μm) in ordinary chondritic meteorites  given by [10],  and an assumed global spinelgrain layer similar in thickness to  the one at  Massignano, the 18 H-chondritic grains imply a globally deposited meteoritic mass of (0.14-5.5)  × 1011 kg. The 7L-chondritic grains imply a meteoritic mass of (0.041.3)  ×  1011 kg. If we conservatively assume that  only1% of the debris from the disrupted TCOs collides withthe Earth (i.e., a piece of debris from a TCO tidal disruption has no higher chance of colliding with the Earththan a random TCO), the disrupted asteroids were kmsized, i.e., 1.1-3.7 km for the H-chondritic grains, and0.9-2.3 km for the L-chondritic grains. Given the observed  size-frequency distribution  of  NEOs  [11]  andthe  present-day  capture  frequency for  H=24  objectsgiven by [9], a km-sized (H < 18) TCO should be captured roughly once every ~3 Ma. Tidal disruption of akm-sized TCO should occur every ~30 Ma, and morefrequently during times of increased impactor  flux. A~20 time higher flux of km-sized asteroids can likelyaccount for the two spinel grain peaks during the LateEocene (assuming both peaks are  from TCO disruptions). Incidentally, similarly short-lived peaks of spinelgrains from TCO disruptions might also be observed atother times in the Earth's sedimentary record.Scenario 2:  An Eltanin-like marine impact: Inthis  interpretation  of  the  Late  Eocene  spinel  grainpeaks, they represent the weathering-resistant remainsof  an  ejecta  layer  of  a  deep  marine  impact  in  theMediterranean region at  the time, similar to  the morerecent  (~2.15  Ma)  Eltanin  impact  in  the  SouthernOcean. The Eltanin impact site was discovered by therecovery of  strongly disturbed Eocene to  Pleistocenesediments,  strongly enriched  in up  to  cm-sized,  unmelted  meteoritic  debris  [12].

pactor diameter of 1-4 km has been suggested [13]. Asurface  density of  meteoritic ejecta  of  about  2000 8000 g/m2 is observed in the central regions of the debris field, extending for several 100 km. In comparisonwith the Late  Eocene site  at  Massignano,  the 18 Hchondritic grains of the lower peak and the 7 L-chondritic grains of the upper peak can be translated intosurface densities of 0.03 - 1.1 g/m2, and 0.007 - 0.26g/m2, respectively, using again the values given by [10].These values are 3 to 5 orders of magnitude below thevalues observed at the Eltanin sites. Since the thicknessof ejecta blankets scale with the inverse cube of the distance to the impact site [14], this might indicate a distance of a few 1000 km to the impact site, but local seafloor topography, currents and the asymmetrical shapesof ejecta blankets might also affect  the debris density[15].  Given that  at  least  five large  terrestrial  impactstructures are known in the Late Eocene [2], we expectat  least  ten  similarly large  impact  structures  in  theocean. There is a ~35% chance that a random locationon the sea-floor would be within 2000 km of one ofthese  marine  impact  sites  (however,  land  dominateswithin that radius of the Late Eocene Massignano). Aninternal consistency test of the marine impact scenariois given by the Ir abundance of 50-200 pg/g in the sediment layer in which the grains were found [16] (notethat  even higher  Ir  abundances are  found within theejecta blanket further below). Using an Ir concentrationof 500 ng/g for H- and L chondrites [17], the meteoriticmass fraction is (1-4)  × 10-4, i.e., 100 kg of limestonefrom these layers should contain 0.01-0.04 g of meteoritic material. This is within (and close to the geometric mean of) the ranges of 0.005-0.18 g and 0.002-0.07g derived from the spinel grain abundances in the lowerand upper spinel grain peaks,  respectively. Therefore,there was no selective fractionation of the Ir-carrier andthe spinel grains, relative to ordinary chondritic values.Testable  predictions  for  the  scenarios: In  theTCO  scenario,  the  spinel  grains  are  distributed  uniformly over the surface of the Earth. One would thusexpect to observe a similar H- and L-chondritic spinelgrain peak at other Late Eocene sites world-wide, regardless whether the site is marine or sub-aerial. Sincethe typical deposition time of TCO debris is a few yearsat most, sampling of a non-bioturbated section at hightime-resolution  should  also  provide  a  much  sharperpeak than the one found in Massignano. Furthermore, ifall grains are derived from a loose asteroidal regolith,they would likely show a characteristic correlation between cosmic-ray-produced and solar wind (SW) lightnoble gases, as observed e.g. by [18,19]. The short timeof space exposure after a TCO disruption (a few years)is unlikely to  strongly influence the  cosmogenic andSW content.  If  the H- and L-chondritic spinel grainsrepresent two separate tidal disruption events of TCOs,their average SW content and cosmic-ray exposure agewill likely differ, each representing the individual historyof the disrupted asteroid. There is a small chance thatthe Popigai impactor  was a large  fragment  of  a  disrupted TCO, and thus the spinel grains and the asteroidwould have the same origin. In that  case, the time ofdeposition of the spinel grains should be within a fewyears after the deposition of the ejecta blanket.In  the  marine  impact  scenario,  the  spinel  grainpeaks at Massignano would be a local feature (withinseveral 1000 km) and thus not expected at equal intensity at  sufficiently remote  places  (other  marine sitesmight have other,  unrelated spinel grain peaks,  whileterrestrial sites should not have them). One could arguethat since the grains are most likely sampling an interiorposition of the asteroid,  they may not  have been exposed  to  cosmic rays or  SW implantation.  However,[20]  found cosmogenic radionuclides in a  sample ofEltanin material, implying a position of that sample nearthe surface, within a few 100 ka before impact. In fact,since most  large asteroids are  rubble piles [21],  it  isconceivable that all interior material has at some pointbeen close to  the surface,  where it  was irradiated bycosmic rays and/or SW. The detection of cosmogenicand/or solar wind derived noble gases would thus notbe sufficient to exclude the marine impact scenario.Acknowledgements: We thank Birger Schmitz forhis helpful comments on this abstract.References: [1] Farley K.
