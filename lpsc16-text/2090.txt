MINERALOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS IN EAST CANDOR CHASMA, VALLES MARINERIS, MARS AND IMPLICATIONS. Mahima Singh* and V.J. Rajesh, Department of Earth and Space Sciences, Indian           Institute of Space Science and Technology, Thiruvananthapuram- 695 547, India (*Corresponding author: <snghmahima@gmail.com>).   Introduction: Candor Chasma is one of the     largest canyons in the Valles Marineris region of Mars and has been considered into two division: East    Candor Chasma and West Candor Chasma [1]. With the several proposed mechanisms for the origin of canyon features on Mars, which is an unclear topic till date, it will be of much importance to investigate the mineralogy of the regions with the similar features in order to add the scientific information to the existing knowledge. Compact Reconnaissance imaging      spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) datasets on-board Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) has been proved to be the most informative as far as mineralogy is  concerned at the maximum resolution limit. The     results have proved the presence of suphates, hydrous sulphates and iron oxides mostly in interior layered deposits (ILDs) in different regions on Mars [1, 2]. The mineralogy of West Candor Chasma has been investigated extensively; and polyhydrated sulphates, pyroxenes and iron oxides are reported using CRISM datasets [1]. Here we are reporting the mineralogical assemblages identified using MRO-CRISM datasets in East Candor Chasma.      Geological Background and Methodology:   Candor Chasma is well known for polyhydrated     sulphate deposits and particularly, West Candor Chasma have been studied quite in detail for its      mineralogy (Fig. 1) [1, 2, 3]. CRISM datasets were processed based on the methodology explained in 1, 4 and refrences therein and spectral results were        obtained for mineralogical interpretation of the area. Obtained  reflectance spectra from the area have been compared with the mineral spectra from CRISM   spectral library.    Figure 1. Location of Candor Chasma on Mars with East and West Candor Chasma. This study focuses on the mineralogical investigations in East Candor  Chasma. Results: We have studied the mineralogical       variation present in East Candor Chasma region of Valles Marineris of Mars using MRO-CRISM datasets. The major mineralogical groups identified from the area belongs to sulphate and carbonate group of    minerals. Interior layered deposits show the          composition of palagonite (red) with the absorption bands at 1.46, 1.96 and 2.52 µm which are exactly matching with the palagonite spectrum of CRISM spectral library (Fig. 2). Calcite (sky-blue) was      identified based on the absorption bands at 1.44, 1.6, 1.96, 2.36 and 2.52 µm, which are matching well with the full spectral profile of calcite from CRISM spectral library. Hydromagnesite (black) was confirmed by the presence of characteristic absorption bands at 1.4, 1.44, 1.46, 1.6, 2.36, 2.52 µm and comparison was made with the hydromagnesite spectrum of CRISM spectral library. Kieserite was confirmed based on the absorption band at 1.6 µm.  Further, chasma floor also showed the variations in the mineral compositions and confirms the minerals calcite (violet) with the main absorption bands at 2.32, 2.52 µm which are exactly matching with the calcite spectrum of CRISM spectral library, diaspore with the absorption bands at 1.88 and around 2 µm (green), and vermiculite with the peculiar absorption bands at 1.52, 1.98, 2.32 and 2.4 µm (black) (Fig. 3). Absorption bands at 3.28, 3.44 and 3.78 µm which are              characteristic of calcite were also identified as        confirmation of  carbonates could only be made if the absorption bands are also present in 3.1-3.9 µm region of electro-magnetic spectrum (Fig. 4). Summary and Conclusions: Interior layered    deposits and plateau regions in the East Candor  Chasma are found to be rich in carbonates and        sulphates. These mineral species would have been formed either through deposition by surface alteration or during the weathering of the plateau material.   Presence of carbonates in the area suggest the activity of water/hydrothermal activity. Additionally, sulphates and carbonates require liquid water at least at 2-3 km depth to form. Therefore, presence of these minerals helps in identifying the hydrologic conditions in the area. Sulfates detected in the  studied area require the presence of liquid water to form by precipitation,   2090.pdf
