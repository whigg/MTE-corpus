Introduction:  Calcium-, aluminium-rich inclusions (CAIs), the first Solar System solids, seem to have formed over a period as short as 50,000 years [1]. Chondrule formation began contemporaneously with CAIs, but there is debate as to how long chondrule formation lasted and when the chondrite parent bodies formed. Al-Mg and Pb-Pb data suggest that, if 26Al was uniformly distributed throughout the Solar System, chondrule formation may have lasted 2-3 Ma [1,2]. The chondrite parent bodies must have accreted at some point after CAIs and chondrules formed, by which time 26Al had decayed beyond the point where it could provide sufficient heat to cause planetesimals to melt and differentiate (but could still power metamorphism). Alternatively, CAIs may have formed in a region of high 26Al concentration at around the same time as chondrules and other materials which ultimately made up the chondrite parent bodies [3]. In this scenario the chondrule formation period was shorter than if 26Al was uniformly distributed, and the chondrite parent bodies formed earlier.  There is evidence that thermal metamorphism of the H chondrite parent body took place according to the so-called "onion-shell" model [e.g. 4-6], whereby the most metamorphosed, type 6 material was more deeply buried, with material becoming less metamorphosed with increasing distance from the centre. In this model more metamorphosed material cooled more slowly than less metamorphosed material, and so should have later radiometric ages. Whether this model is accurate is debatable [7].  The I-Xe chronometer [8] provides an additional means of studying the history and thermal evolution of the H chondrite parent body. It enables us to examine the sequence and timing of events that occurred during the first few millions of years of Solar System evolution with high resolution. Previous I-Xe analyses of mineral separates from H chondrites show a range of ages. Feldspar separates from Ste. Marguerite (H4) have relatively early ages, and the age of phosphate separates are slightly later [9]. Allegan (H5) feldspars, which show evidence of shock disturbance, have a model age within uncertainty of Ste. Marguerite [10]. In order to reset the I-Xe system, a planetesimal must accrete when there is still sufficient 26Al to provide a source of heat, and be sufficiently large that the centre is insulated by the outer shells, to enable it to reach the high peak metamorphic temperatures (~1220 K for H6 chondrites [11]). These minerals are fragments of chondrules which were incorporated in to the H chondrite planetesimal. The early I-Xe ages of the feldspars suggest the I-Xe system has a high closure temperature: it either dates the formation of the original chondrule, in which case it survived high peak temperatures of metamorphism, or it dates the cooling of the planetesimal during metamorphism, in which case closure to Xe-loss occurred at high temperature soon after peak metamorphism. There is a "forbidden zone" of ages in the onion-shell model between chondrule formation and resetting during metamorphism, when the planetesimal is heating up.  In this study we are examining the I-Xe ages of mineral separates from H chondrites of different metamorphic grades to investigate the history and thermal evolution of the H chondrite parent body. Experimental:  I-Xe dating relies on the  decay of 129I to 129Xe (t½ = 16 Ma). The aim is to determine the 129I/127I ratio at the time of closure to Xe-loss. Samples undergo artificial neutron irradiation prior to analysis, to convert stable 127I to 128Xe. This allows for the simultaneous measurement of 129Xe produced from the decay of 129I and 127I as 128Xe. A correlation is sought between 128Xe* and 129Xe* (* denotes an excess over the trapped component) over a number of sequential steps in a stepped heating experiment. The ratio 129Xe*/128Xe* is determined, which is proportional to the 129I/127I ratio at the time of closure to Xe-loss, and from this a relative age, in relation to other material, can be determined. The absolute age is calculated by reference to a standard of known age - enstatite from the meteorite Shallowater is used as the irradiation standard, the absolute age of which is 4562.3 ± 0.4 Ma [12]. This Shallowater age is calculated from the correlation between Pb-Pb ages and I-Xe intervals. It does not account for recent revisions to Pb-Pb ages [e.g. 2,13]; taking this into account would make the absolute ages 1.1 Ma younger than those reported here [14].  Mineral separates of the meteorites Forest Vale (FV) and Ste. Marguerite (SM), both H4, and Allegan (H5) were produced by crushing and hand picking of individual grains. Aliquots of the different minerals ranging in mass between ~ 0.1 and 1 mg were irradiated. Following irradiation, samples were analysed using the RELAX (Refrigerator Enhanced Laser Analyser for Xenon) mass spectrometer [15,16]. Samples were step 2128.pdf

heated using a laser, in a series of sequentially increasing powers. The gas extracted in each individual heating step was analysed to determine the Xe isotope ratios and the absolute amount of Xe released.  Laser step heating typically uses a continuous wave laser, the output power of which is gradually increased to increase the equilibrium temperature of the sample. The RELAX sample heating laser has recently been upgraded to a fiber laser (JK Lasers, JK50FL, λ = 1080 nm, min output ~6 W, max 50 W), and here we report data from the first samples analysed using this laser. Low output powers can be obtained from the fiber laser by pulsing the beam at 104 Hz. The average power is adjusted by changing the fraction of the duty cycle for which the laser is on and the sample is illuminated.  Results and Discussion:  Pyroxene, olivine, troilite, FeNi metal separates and a chondrule from Allegan have been analysed, alongside pyroxene, chromite and troilite separates from FV, and a pyroxene separate from SM. Further minerals from SM (enstatite, olivine, plagioclase troilite and FeNi metal) will be analysed in due course. All Allegan samples and the pyroxenes from FV and SM contain evidence of excess 129Xe derived from the decay of 129I. These samples also show excess 131Xe produced from neutron irradiation of 130Ba. There is evidence in the Allegan samples of a small contribution to the heavier isotopes which is attributed to neutron induced fission of 235U, but no evidence of this is seen in the FV or SM samples.  The FV pyroxene defines a preliminary age of 0.1 ± 1.0 Ma younger than Shallowater, corresponding to an absolute age of 4562.2 ± 1.0 Ma This age agrees within uncertainty with that of the SM pyroxene which has a preliminary age of 1.0 ± 2.0 Ma younger that Shallowater, corresponding to an absolute age of 4561.3 ± 2.0 Ma. Moreover, these two pyroxene ages also agree with the I-Xe feldspar age of SM [9]. Allegan displays an older I-Xe age of 4565.8 ± 1.0 Ma for a high-Ca pyroxene, identical to that obtained from olivine and a chondrule fragment, as previously reported [17].  If the onion-shell model is valid, there are three different scenarios which could account for these ages: (1) the ages of the H4 and H5 chondrites all reflect chondrule formation, (2) the ages of the H4 samples date metamorphism and the H5 age dates chondrule formation, or (3) the H4 and H5 ages date metamorphism.  If scenario 1 were to be the case then it seems the model whereby CAIs formed in a region of elevated 26Al cannot hold because once the chondrules had subsequently accreted to form a planetesimal there would be insufficient 26Al left to drive thermal metamorphism.  Scenario 2 seems unlikely because that would require metamorphism to reset the I-Xe chronometer in a H4 chondrite, but for it not to have been reset in the same minerals in H5 material, which reached a higher peak temperature.  Scenario 3 requires the planetesimal to be cooling down, after achieving its peak temperature, and the IXe ages date when the samples cooled through the closure temperature for Xe-loss. Considering the thermal evolution models of Gail et al. [18], the H4 ages are after the samples have reached their peak temperatures, and correspond to closure to Xe-loss around 700-750 K. However the Allegan pyroxene age lies in the period while the parent body is heating up, i.e. in the "forbidden zone". These models assume instantaneous accretion of the parent body; models of incremental accretion can produce significant differences and in certain cases the more highly metamorphosed material in the centre of the body may reach its peak metamorphic temperature before the outer, less metamorphosed regions [19]. This could account for H5 material reaching its peak temperature before H4 material, but it cannot account for inner parts of the body cooling through the closure temperature to Xe-loss before outer parts.  Although only a small number of samples have been analysed to date and more data are clearly needed, these data suggest thermal evolution of the H chondrite parent body was more complicated than can be accounted for in the simple, onion-shell model. The onion-shell model may not be valid if the parent body has been disrupted by impacts. Impact heating, rather than 26Al decay, can induce metamorphism. Impact disruption can complicate the cooling history of a body - it can expose previously buried material and lead to periods of rapid cooling (cf. lodranites [20]). It can also have the effect of narrowing the forbidden zone of ages. References: [1] Bizzarro M. et al. (2004) Nature, 431, 275-278. [2] Connelly J.N. et al. (2012) Science, 338, 651655.
