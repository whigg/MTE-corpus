(haolantang@ucla.edu).   Introduction: Chlorine-36 (t1/2=0.3 Myr) decays to either 36Ar (98%, β-) or 36S (1.9%, ε and β+). This radionuclide can be produced either by local irradiation of gas and/or dust of solar composition [1-2] or by stellar nucleosynthesis in AGB stars or Type II supernovae [3]. Evidence for the presence of 36Cl in the early Solar System (ESS) comes from radiogenic excesses of 36Ar [4] and/or 36S [5-9] in secondary phases (e.g., sodalite and wadalite) in ESS materials such as Calcium, Aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) and chondrules. Though the presence of 36Cl in the ESS has been demonstrated, the inferred initial 36Cl/35Cl ratios vary a lot (from 1.0×10-7 to 2×10-5) from one inclusion to another [5-9]. Interestingly, all secondary phases measured so far lack resolvable 26Mg excesses that could be due to the decay of 26Al (t1/2 = 0.7 Myr), implying that 36Cl and 26Al may not have been derived from the same source. Given that 26Al could have come from a stellar source [10] and that secondary phases should have formed late, we are left with either a very high 36Cl/35Cl initial ratio (~ 10-2) in the ESS, or a late (> 3 Myr after CAI formation) irradiation scenario for the production of 36Cl [9]. 36Cl/35Cl ~ 10-2 far exceeds the predictions from any model (stellar nucleosynthesis or irradiation); therefore, a late irradiation scenario producing 36Cl at the observed level is  favored. In this framework, 36Cl is produced in the early solar nebula and incorporated into CAIs via aqueous activities, which could also lead to the formation of sodalite. The Allende Curious Marie fine-grained (nonFUN) CAI is a special sample. It is characterized by an extremely large 235U excess (δ235U ~59 ‰ rel. to CRM112a) [11], providing strong evidence that 247Cm was alive in the ESS, as previously suggested by [12]. This CAI lacks primary refractory phases, but instead contains a wide distribution of chlorine-rich phases (sodalite and nepheline), which are characterized by large, yet uniform, 26Mg excesses (δ26Mg*) of ~43‰ over a large range of 27Al/24Mg values [Fig 1A; 13]. This observation contrasts largely with previous findings and implies that 26Al could have still been alive when sodalite formed, and the homogeneous δ26Mg* found in all spots measured could have resulted from later closedsystem resetting [13]. Therefore, this CAI offers an excellent opportunity to investigate the relationship between 26Al and 36Cl, as well as the evolution of this strange CAI. We performed isotopic analysis for the 36Cl-36S systematics, and the preliminary results are reported here. Method: Secondary minerals such as nepheline, sodalite, Fe-rich pyroxene, and Fe-rich spinel were observed in Curious Marie. Analyses for the Cl-S system were performed on the new Cameca ims-1290 ion probe in UCLA. Sulfur isotopes (33S, 34S, and 36S) as well as chlorine isotopes (35Cl and 37Cl) in sodalite were measured in a peak jumping mono-collection mode, with the mass sequence of 32.8, 33S, 34S, 35Cl, 36S and 37Cl. Negative secondary ions were produced by a 0.6 nA Cs+ primary ion beam focused to a <10 µm spot. A long pre-sputtering time was required (>20 mins) to minimize the surface S contamination. A mass resolving power of 5000 was used to resolve interferences from the peaks of interest. Besides, of special importance in the measurement of 36S is the potential contribution from the scattered ions of 12C3 and 35ClH, but this did not appear to be a problem under our analytical condition. The instrumental mass fractionation (IMF) was internally corrected by using standards of Balmat pyrite, Canyon Diablo troilite, CAR 123 pyrite, and NIST 610 glass. The transmission was decreased to avoid QSA effect (Quasi-Simultaneous Arrival) in pyrite and troilite standards and data were reduced from total counts. The excesses of 36S were calculated by following a linear law with a mass fractionation exponent of -0.489 obtained from standards. In addition, a terrestrial sodalite (35Cl/34S = 15,000) was applied to verifying the validity of mass spectrometry. The relative sensitivity factor of 35Cl/34S (~0.93) used throughout this study was determined from NIST 610 glass (Cl/S=1). Results and discussion: Significant excesses in 36S are clearly resolved in Curious Marie over a large range of 35Cl/34S values (from 500 to 20,000).  However,  the 36S excesses are uniformly elevated, with a weighted average of 95±28‰ (2σ error, reduced χ2 = 3), independent of the Cl/S ratio. Therefore, no isochron is observed and no initial 36Cl/35Cl ratio can be inferred for this CAI. In our previous study we proposed that the presence of homogeneous δ26Mg* to be 43±6‰ (2σ error, reduced χ2 = 3) and negative δ25Mg (from ~-9‰ to 19‰) in Curious Marie indicates that Mg isotope exchange must have taken place in a closed system to avoid dilution with chondritic Mg [13]. Although the uniform 26Mg excess independent of Al/Mg precludes the determination of an isochron, a model 26Al/27Al ratio = (6.2±0.9)×10−5 can still be inferred by using the bulk 27Al/24Mg ratio (~95, measured by solution ICPMS; [11]) and assuming δ26Mg0 = 0.

that either the secondary phases in the Curious Marie CAI formed while 26Al was still at the canonical level, or the CAI remained intact until a late-alteration event, which took place after 26Al had completely decayed away, homogenized the 26Mg excesses and formed sodalite. The latter scenario would be less likely as the elevated uniform δ26Mg* requires closed-system homogenization, contrary to the fact that the formation of sodalite requires an external Cl-rich fluid. Besides, the significant Mg loss resulted from this alteration can achieve a higher bulk 27Al/24Mg ratio in this CAI relative to the normal range (~2-10) with the δ26Mg* value similar to or lower than that in the primary mineral (<5‰). Therefore, we propose that alteration resulting in the formation of sodalite in Curious Marie must have taken place extremely early, probably right after the condensation of this CAI, so that the Cl-rich fluid involved in this process can wash Mg (and perhaps U) away without diluting δ26Mg*.   Fig. 1. (A) 26Al-26Mg and (B) 36Cl-36S systematics in Allende CAI Curious Marie (2σ error). The black dash line in A indicates the average δ26Mg of ~43‰ in Curious Marie. The black dash line in (B) represents the average δ36S of ~95‰.    The Cl-S result can also be understood in the context of the aforementioned alteration scenario. Although it is impossible to form an isochron, and thus an initial 36Cl/35Cl ratio, based on the CAI's Cl-S isotopic results, the 36S excesses in the sodalite would still require the presence of 36Cl. This radionuclide can be introduced into the CAI via a Cl-rich fluid involved in the formation of secondary phases or be produced by late local irradiation on the sodalite. The former interpretation implies that 36Cl was present in the early solar nebula at the time of CAI condensation, which would require that 36Cl originated from a stellar source or early local irradiation. In the context of the latter explanation, 36Cl would be produced in-situ inside sodalite by late irradiation, similar to the proposed scenarios in [5-9]. However, knowledge about the Cl and S elemental abundances is required to estimate the 36Cl/35Cl production ratio for Curious Marie. The final event would be that both δ26Mg and δ36S were homogenized in the entire CAI in a closed system after the complete extinction of 26Al and 36Cl. Conclusion: We find elevated and uniform excesses in 36S, similar to those for 26Mg excesses, in the Udepleted fine-grained CAI Curious Marie, implying a complicated multi-stage history. The CAI precursor condensed with the 26Al/27Al canonical ratio and might have experienced an extremely early alteration process with a Cl-rich, Mg-free fluid to form the secondary phases including sodalites and nephelines. The presence of 36S excesses can be interpreted as a decay product of 36Cl, which was either introduced from a Cl-rich fluid in early alteration or produced through in situ local irradiation on the CAI after sodalite formed. Further studies of the Al-Mg and Cl-S systematics in other finegrained CAIs are ongoing to investigate their condensation in the early solar nebula and alteration in the chondritic parent bodies as well as the origin of 36Cl in different early-formed objects.
