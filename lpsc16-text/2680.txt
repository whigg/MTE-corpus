MINERALOGICAL AND CHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF CORES FROM LAKE TOWUTI, INDONESIA AS A COMPARATIVE STUDY FOR CURIOSITY OBSERVATIONS AT GALE CRATER, MARS.  R. E. Sheppard1, R. E. Milliken1, and J. M. Russell1, 1Dept. Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912, rachel_sheppard@brown.edu   Introduction: Paleolake environments have been interpreted for a number of craters across Mars [1], including ongoing investigation by the Curiosity rover at Gale Crater, as well as a proposed landing site (Jezero crater) for the Mars 2020 rover. Some of these ancient lake environments host hydrous minerals, as detected by orbital [2] and in situ rover investigations [3]. However, it is difficult to determine whether these aqueous minerals are detrital or authigenic in origin from orbital data alone. In situ observations can provide higher-fidelity chemical and morphological data that may help to distinguish between these origins [e.g., 3], but ambiguity remains [4,5]. Similarly, the pH of ancient lake waters and/or diagenetic fluids has been debated, particularly at Gale Crater [6-9]. Here, we present a spectral, mineralogical, and chemical study of sediment cores from Lake Towuti, Indonesia to better identify detrital and authigenic mineral assemblages, chemical variations, and redox state in ultramafic/mafic-dominated systems as they may relate to Gale Crater and other purported Martian paleolakes. Lake Towuti has been proposed as a modern analogue to Martian paleolakes based on the underlying mafic rock and the resulting suite of aqueous alteration minerals [10]. Constraining the history of Lake Towuti from its current sediment record could lend new insight towards the nature of Mars' past climatic transitions and Gale Crater's history as a paleolake basin [11]. To examine spectral, mineral, and chemical relationships, we compare elemental (XRF) and phase analyses (VNIR spectroscopy and XRD) on a series of drill cuttings collected from the center of the lake by the Towuti Drilling Project in 2015 (Fig. 1).  Lake Towuti is located in a geologically diverse catchment in Indonesia. Most of the bedrock is ultramafic, and there is little eolian or volcanic input, meaning sediment variation is strongly controlled by changes in the relative input of sediment from three source regions [12]. The oxidation state of Lake Towuti sediments has been linked to its past climate, with cold and dry periods corresponding to enhanced mixing of lake waters, bringing additional oxygen to deeper waters and increasing the prevalence of Fe oxides within the sediment record [12].  Methods: At the end of each core segment during drilling, a small amount of sediment was collected, resulting in samples approximately every 3 m. Of   these, 51 samples from Core F were analyzed, representing a depth range of 150 m corresponding to approximately 1 million years of the sediment record. These drill cuttings were exposed to ambient conditions and powdered for analyses at Brown University. Reflectance spectra were collected using an ASD FieldSpec (0.35-2.5 µm) and an FTIR spectrometer (0.8-4.75 µm), with data spliced together at 1.7 µm to provide a continuous spectrum over this wavelength range. Band depths for minerals of interest were calculated and plotted as a function of core depth. Relevant minerals and their characteristic absorptions include iron oxides (0.48 µm and 0.7 µm), Al-clays (2.2 µm), serpentine (2.32 µm), and carbonates (4.0 µm) (Fig. 2).   Figure 2. Example spectrum of a drill cutting sample with important minerals and their characteristic spectral features marked.  Powder XRD measurements were obtained on a Bruker D2 Phaser (Cu source) system to determine major and minor mineral components of the samples and to confirm mineral identifications based on the reflectance spectra. XRF and flux fusion ICP-AES were also used to quantify elemental abundances in the core samples to assess chemical trends with depth (and thus time).  Results: The cores exhibit strong color variations at visible wavelengths, from dark green to bright red, that are associated with changes in oxidation state (Fig. 1). Red sections are associated with higher Fe3+ and 2680.pdf

green sections are associated with higher Fe2+ and organic carbon [12], consistent with the spectral data.  Mineralogy. We use reflectance band depth as a proxy for abundance and to assess downcore trends in mineralogy. Shallow sediments exhibit a relative increased in iron oxides (0.48 µm), whereas deeper sediments have higher levels of clay minerals (Fig. 3). The contrast between the two iron oxide bands (0.48 and 0.7 µm) is likely due to different mineral hosts of Fe and will require further investigation, possibly through Raman and/or Mössbauer spectroscopy.  Figure 3. Band depths of relevant absorption features varying with depth within the core. Total Clay is normalized based on a composition of FeO, Al-clays, Mg-clays, and carbonates.   XRD results confirm a general transition from high carbonate (mid core) to high clay (deep core). The data also show an abundance of quartz and kaolinite in all samples, with pulses of high carbonate (mostly siderite), oxides (e.g. goethite), and other phyllosilicates (saponite, montmorillonite, Mg serpentines). Ongoing analysis of the XRD patterns will help to identify the mineral host of Fe at shallow depths, as will mapping via electron microprobe. Mineralogical Connection to Gale. Several minerals are common to the Lake Towuti samples and Gale Crater. For example, Curiosity identified Mg/Fe smectites, Fe oxides, ilmenite, and magnetite from CheMin measurements of the John Klein and Cumberland drill samples from the Sheepbed mudstone. An authigenic origin has been suggested for the smectite and magnetite [3], and both have been observed in later drill samples. Future characterization of the Lake Towuti clays, including possible authigenic magnetite, with methods such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) may provide a higher level of detail than currently available from rover instruments, and may help resolve the origin of these minerals detected at Gale.  Of particular interest for applications to Mars is the positive, near-linear correlation between Ti and Si abundances from XRF and ICP-AES data (Fig. 4). A similar correlation has been used in previous work as evidence for severe acid leaching on Mars [13-14]. The presence of a similar signature in the neutral Lake Towuti system [12] provides a counterexample: sediments with this signature need not have been formed in or affected by low-pH fluids, as has been proposed for rover observations at Gusev Crater [15]. Ongoing analyses will determine the host mineral(s) of Ti, but some may be present in magnetite and ilmenite.  Figure 4. Correlation between Ti and Si in Lake Towuti sediments.    Conclusions and Future Work:  Identifying mineralogical and chemical similarities between Lake Towuti and Gale Crater contributes to our understanding of how these aspects may vary in mafic-dominated lake systems. This will allow a better understanding of how to link rover chemical/mineralogical data to orbital spectral data in terms of geologic process. Future work will include collecting samples from complete cores to provide more accurate data on the timescale of these variations, and SEM/EMP analyses will be used to investigate clays in coarser (sand) facies to determine detrital/authigenic origin in the Lake Towuti system.
