Introduction: In petrological smelting models [1], ureilites (a group of ultramafic achondrites) are inferred to have formed at particular depths within their parent body. They may then have been excavated by catastrophic disruption of that parent body [2]. In a previous study [3], we simulated numerically the catastrophic disruption of a 250 km-diameter asteroid as a result of a collision with a smaller projectile and the subsequent reaccumulation of fragments as a result of their mutual gravitational attractions. We then investigated the original location within the parent body of the small pieces that eventually reaccumulate to form the largest remnants of the disruption as a function of the internal structure of the parent body, ranging from fully molten to fully solid. We found that the extent of the original region where the small pieces come from within the parent body varies considerably depending on the internal structure of the parent. It seems to shrink with the degree of solidity of the body. That investigation showed that such modeling has the potential to test the degree to which a group of meteorites is a selective sample of their original parent body, and to test competing petrogenetic models that predict their original depths of formation. We extended this study to larger targets in order to check whether our results apply to the ureilite parent body, which is estimated to be 428 km diameter (max) in a smelting model [4], as well as test a wider range of impact parameters to better understand the types of selective sampling that can occur during large impacts. Initial Conditions: We considered a 428 kmdiameter parent body. We considered again 4 kinds of internal structure: fully molten, ½-molten (i.e., a ~44 km-deep outer layer of melt containing half of the mass), solid with a thin molten layer (8 km thick) centered at 10 km depth, and solid (with basalt properties).  Regarding the impact energy regime, we first considered catastrophic disruptions as in our previous study to determine the influence of the parent body's size on the outcome. The impact conditions were chosen so that Mlr/Mtot (where Mlr is the mass of the largest remnant and Mtot the total mass) is of the same order as in the previous study. Then we also investigated a transitional regime between cratering impacts and catastrophic disruptions. In effect, one could visualize transitional, sub-catastrophic parameter combinations (e.g., low-speed, large impactors) where a portion of the outer layers of the target is ejected (as in cratering) but where the ejections speeds are slow enough to allow reassembly of escaping debris. Such reassembly/escape combinations may plausibly produce daughter asteroids that represent more restricted outer regions of the target than found in the catastrophic disruption model of our previous study, and more closely matching what is expected to form the ureilites. To study this transitional regime, we considered a fixed impact speed of 5 km/s and two different projectile diameters of 124 km and 86 km, respectively.  0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 0.08 0  20  40  60  80  100  120 dm /M FDepth (km) F1 F2 F3 0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 0.08 0  20  40  60  80  100  120 dm /M FDepth (km) F1 F2 F3 0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 0.08 0  20  40  60  80  100  120 dm /M FDepth (km) F1 F2 F3 0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 0.08 0  20  40  60  80  100  120 dm /M FDepth (km) F1 F2 F3 Solid Molten Solid with molten layer Half molten Dt = 250 km Catastrophic disruption Solid Molten Solid with molten layer Half molten 0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 0.08 0  50  100  150  200 dm /M FDepth (km) F1 F2 F3 0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 0.08 0  50  100  150  200 dm /M FDepth (km) F1 F2 F3 0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 0.08 0  50  100  150  200 dm /M FDepth (km) F1 F2 F3 0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 0.08 0  50  100  150  200 dm /M FDepth (km) F1 F2 F3 Dt = 428 km Catastrophic disruption Fig. 1: Catastrophic disruption. Fraction of mass contained in the three largest reaccumulated bodies (F1, F2, F3, in decreasing size), as a function of original depth within the parent body for the 4 considered internal structures. The curves are normalized by the mass of the corresponding body. Top: diameter Dt = 250 km, bottom: diameter Dt = 428 km. Results: In the catastrophic disruption regime, an examination of the solid body with a molten layer shows that the third-largest remnant (F3) of the larger (428 km) parent body samples a region that is at shallower depth than for the smaller parent body and closer to the depth expected for most ureilites (11 km) in the smelting model (Fig. 1). This seems to be the case  (sampling shallower depths) for all considered internal structures, except the fully molten one that does not show a difference, at least qualitatively. In summary, the largest remnants basically sample a region which extends to shallower depth. The shape of those zones shows some differences but not dramatic ones (Fig. 2).

For the transitional/sub-catastrophic regime, in the higher considered impact energy regime (124 kmdiameter projectile), fairly deep regions still seem to be sampled; this is even more true for the solid with molten layer than for the pure solid, as the curves flatten towards deeper zones (Fig. 3), which does not solve the ureilite issue. In the lower impact energy regime (86 km-diameter projectile), fragments are smaller and come from a shallower depth, providing the best fit so far to the ureilite depth distribution. Interestingly, there is a sort of a bimodal distribution in the case of the target with a molten layer (Fig. 4).  Conclusions: Our new results show that depending on the parent body's size and internal structure, and considered impact energy, the material that reaccumulates to form the largest remnants of a disruption can sample different depths. Using a parent-body diameter of 428 km, which is consistent with the current ureilite smelting model, allows preferential extraction of material from a depth close to the one expected for the ureilite. This is even more true when we consider a low impact energy in a transition/cratering regime where the largest remnants are still formed by reaccumulation. Interestingly, low impact energies are also more likely than higher ones, just given the larger number of smaller impactors in the asteroid belt.  0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0  50  100  150  200 dm /M FDepth (km) F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 F7 F8 F9 F10 0.7294 0.0138 0.0108 0.0104 0.0078 0.0067 0.0061 0.0057 0.0054 0.0046 Sub-catastrophic regime Dt = 428 km, Dp = 124 km, Vp = 5 km/s Mlr/Mtot = 0.73 Mf/Mtot 10 largest fragments Solid with molten layer   0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0  50  100  150  200 dm /M FDepth (km) F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 F7 F8 F9 F10 0.8246 0.0060 0.0059 0.0052 0.0049 0.0044 0.0040 0.0038 0.0037 0.0037 Sub-catastrophic regime Dt = 428 km, Dp = 124 km, Vp = 5 km/s Mf/Mtot Mlr/Mtot = 0.82 Solid 10 largest fragments Fig. 3: Original position of the particles that will reaccumulate and form the 10 largest offsprings.
