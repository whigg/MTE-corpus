(daminton@purdue.edu)  Introduction: Crater rays are an ubiquitous feature on various planetary surfaces, from terrestrial bodies to icy bodies. Visible crater rays diminish with time due to space weathering and other erosional processes, so the initial extent of rays is poorly constrained. Within the last 40 years, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) has recorded small craters (~6 m in radius) shortly after initial formation, allowing us to understand and study fresh lunar craters before they have had a chance to diminish [1-2]. The process by which rays are generated from ejecta outflow is still poorly understood [3]. Shoemaker [4] looked into Tycho crater’s images from Ranger VII at a resolution of 300 m/px, and noted the secondary crater field within rays, which shed some light on the formation of crater rays [4]. Baldwin [6] compiled the work of Kuiper [5] of a photometric study of lunar craters. He measured the maximum ray length for 50 lunar ray craters, and noted that ray length increases with the size of the primary crater (Fig. 1). He gave an empirical formula of the maximum ray length (Rr) for a given radius of a primary crater (R) by [5] [6]:   𝑅!   =   10.5  𝑅!.!"   Eq. (1)  This empirical formula motivates us to examine the initial extent of rays shortly after formation. In this study, we will use higher resolution (0.5 m/px) images from LROC and examine if the Baldwin’s trend between ray length and size of a crater is biased by lower resolution images. To explain Baldwin’s curve, we propose two hypotheses: 1) that the curvature of the Moon’s surface causes far-reaching rays to be longer than they would be given a flat surface, or 2) that the non-linear scaling between ejecta mass, velocity, and secondary crater production produce equivalent sized secondary craters at further and further distances for larger primary craters. Methods: JMARS (Java Mission-planning and Analysis for Remote Sensing) was used to identify and map lunar craters and their ray systems. Larger craters (>600m in radius) were identified using the LROC Normalized Reflectance 643 nm product, with a resolution of 100 m/px. Smaller craters were identified using LROC Narrow Angle Camera images, with a resolution of 0.5 m/px [2]. Data acquired from the mapping process includes number of rays per crater, ray length, ray width, and crater OMAT value.  Lunar Curvature Hypothesis Testing: As an object travels a short distance along a curved surface, the surface can be treated as flat and the trajectory appears parabolic. When the distance traveled is further, the surface begins to curve away from the travelling object    and the trajectory is revealed to be elliptical. Thus, rays long enough to be influenced by the curvature of the Moon’s surface will be longer than they would be on a flat surface.  To compare landing distances between parabolic (short distance) and elliptical (long distance) trajectories, a set parabolic landing distance was chosen at 5 primary crater radii. Given landing distance (𝜓) and ejection angle (𝜙, assumed to be 45°), ejection velocity (v) was then calculated by,   𝑣 = !!!"# !!   Eq. (2)  and used as the velocity for an elliptical trajectory along a curved surface [7],   𝜓 = 2 cos!! !!!"#!!!!!! !!! !"#!!   Eq. (3)  where Q is a non-dimensional parameter dependent on 𝑣, and 𝜙 is the ejection angle (assumed to be 45°).   Crater Scaling Hypothesis Testing: Upon close inspection, distal rays are composed of numerous secondary craters. If we assume that the visibility of a crater’s rays is related to the size of its secondary craters, then ejecta must travel farther in order to generate Figure 1: The distribution of lunar crater ray length against primary crater radius. Each box contains the ray population for an individual crater.  The color fill represents the crater’s age based on OMAT value (young: <108 Mya, intermediate <810 Mya, old: >810 Mya). The purple dashed line represents Baldwin’s [1963] proposed ray length (Eq. 1). The black solid and dashed lines are from our crater scaling and curvature model, respectively. The labels for ‘Calculated’ represent the equivalent secondary crater radius. 2774.pdf

the same relative size of secondary craters for an increasing primary crater size [7]. Because we assume that both ejection velocity and size of fragments that generate secondaries scales with the size of a primary crater, the fragment from a larger crater would generate larger secondary at a given landing distance than from a smaller crater. However, the size of ejecta fragment as a function of landing distance is still controversial. We assume that the size of ejecta fragment is proportional to the thickness of ejecta curtain which decays in a power law as a function of landing distance by [8]:    𝛿 = 0.1 !! 0.74 !!! !!  Eq. (4)  where 𝛿 is the ejecta thickness, which represents the ejecta fragment in this model, D is the size of the primary crater, and r is the distance from the center of the primary crater. Given the ejection velocity (𝑣!, from Eq. 3) and the size of an ejecta fragment, the size of a secondary crater (𝐷!") can be estimated by crater diameter scaling [9]: 𝐷!" = 1.161𝛿!.!"𝑣!!.!!𝑔!!.!! sin!! 𝜙  Eq. (5)  Several secondary crater radii (1 cm, 10 cm, 25 cm, 50 cm, 100 cm) were assumed and the distances at which these appear were calculated (Fig. 1).  Results and Discussion: We mapped 18 craters, ranging in diameter from 12 m to 84 km, and 176 associated rays. In general, rays followed the expected trend given by Baldwin [1963], with rays increasing in relative length as the primary crater increases in size (Fig. 1). However, the smallest and freshest craters do not follow this trend. Instead, these craters’ rays are several orders of magnitude larger than expected.  It is suspected that the fresh rays’ increased length is due to their age (~40 years), meaning they have not had much time to decay. Other small craters follow this apparent trend, with the older craters having the smallest rays. However, the larger craters do not appear to follow this trend. There may be an absolute decay rate which influences smaller craters more than larger craters, due to the fact that any decay of a smaller ray will have a proportionally larger effect than the same decay of a larger ray. The lunar curvature hypothesis test examined a line of constant ray length distance for a parabolic trajectory (eg. ray length is always 5 radii, which was chosen because it bisects the ray lengths of smaller craters) to model the trajectory pattern for a small crater’s ejecta.     As shown in Fig. 1, there is no noticeable increase in landing distance. There is only a ~7% increase in proportional ray length for a 50 km crater, as compared to a 100 m crater. We conclude that there is not enough travel distance for the curvature of the Moon to have a sizeable effect on ray length. The crater scaling model attempted to explain the increasing length trend by means of non-linear ejecta mass and velocity scaling. As seen in Fig. 1, the 25 cm equivalent secondary radius curve follows Baldwin’s curve closely. This suggests that the increasing length trend with increased primary crater radius is due to the fact that an equivalent-sized secondary will be created further away for a larger crater (e.g. given craters A and B, if B is twice as large as A, B will produce similar-sized secondaries at more than twice the distance that A does).  There remains the question as to which secondary line to follow when estimating ray length. Baldwin’s curve was estimated using images with a resolution of 300 m/px. The smallest craters, which do not follow his curve, were imaged at 0.5 m/px. It seems that, as image resolution increases, visible ray length increases. This may be due to smaller secondary craters remaining visible. At lower resolutions, small secondaries may be washed out by background lunar material and the ray length will appear shorter. However, at higher resolutions, small secondaries remain visible and thus increase the apparent ray length. References: [1] Lucey, P. G. et al. (2000) JGR, 105, 20377-20386. [2] Robinson, M.
