It also complements our investigation of the  Leibnitz crater [5] that inferred paleomagnetic pole locations from Kaguya's magnetometer observations. In these studies, the central basin magnetic anomaly is assumed to result from thermoremanent magnetization like that observed for the Earth's Chixulub crater [6] Kaguya's orbital magnetic observations were carefully screened to minimize solar wind and other external field effects including the plasma signature that has been observed around crustal magnetic anomalies even in the Moon's wake [7].  Crustal magnetic anomalies were estimated from 34 selected lower-altitude (< 60 km) orbits measured between Nov. 2008 and Jun. 2009.  These orbits were spectally correlation filtered to enhance the presence of the temporally and spatially static crustal anomalies, which in turn were gridded at 30 km altitude by equivalent point source inversion [8].   Figure 1. LOLA-inferred topography (color bar in km) of the Nectaris basin with superimposed contours of 0.5ogridded Kaguya magnetic anomalies at 30 km altitude.  The magnetic data include the A) northward (X), B) eastward (Y), and C) upward (Z) component and D) scalar total field anomalies  with solid positive and dashed negative contours at a 0.5 nT contour interval.   Figure 2. Kaguya's three component and scalar magnetic anomalies over the Nectaris basin gridded and color-filled. The thick black line delineates the basin's boundary, and the enclosed small NNE-trending ellipse outlines the source body used in this study.   Analysis: Figure 1 shows the contours of the gridded three-component and scalar Kaguya magnetic anomalies at 30 km altitude superimposed on the LOLA-inferred topography of the Nectaris basin with the color bar in km. The magnetic anomaly data reveal well defined central basin magnetization variations associated with the impact. Figure 2 presents these anomalies colorized with the heavy black line delineating the Nectaris basin's boundary.  The small black ellipse centered on (32.5˚E, 17.1˚S) inside the basin and trending about N30˚E outlines the disk-shaped body used to test for the paleomagnetic pole properties of the gridded magnetic anomalies.  In particular, the roughly 60 km-long magnetic source body was modeled for a thickness of 2 km and a magnetization intensity of 1.6 A/m. The modeled Nectaris magnetic anomalies by Gauss-Legendre quadrature integration (e.g., [9]) are shown in Figure 3. The best-fit model estimates were obtained with a magnetization inclination of -7˚ and declination of 330˚. These magnetization attitudes imply an early Nectarian north paleomagnetic pole at roughly (57˚S, 36˚W). This estimate falls within the mid-latitude pole position clusters centered at (44˚S, 1914.pdf

8˚E) for the Lunar Prospector anomalies and (35˚S, 12˚W) for the Kaguya anomalies obtained by Takahashi et al. [10].   Figure 3. Forward model estimates of the three magnetic components and their scalar intensities in Figure 2.  Further work:  Additional analysis to better separate and detail the regional and residual components of the central Nectaris basin anomalies is warranted.  These efforts include evaluating the dipole feature located northeast of the model at about (38˚E, 15˚S) for its magnetization properties. The central anomalies featured in other Nectarian basins such as MendelRydberg, Moscoviense, Bailly and Humboldtiaum also should be investigated for their paleomagnetic pole properties. These efforts may contribute further insights on the geological context of the central basin magnetic anomalies.  This context is important to establish because the geology controls the sign of magnetization's intensity contrast, and thus the signs of the magnetization's inclination and declination and related paleomagnetic pole.
