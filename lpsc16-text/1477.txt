EFFECT OF VARIABLE THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY ON LUNAR THERMAL EVOLUTION.  Y. Zhao1,A. P. van den Berg1 and W. van Westrenen1,  1Faculty of Earth and Life Sciences, VU University Amsterdam, theNetherlands, email y.zhao@vu.nlIntroduction:  The Moon is a relatively small planetary  body.  Its  high surface-to-volume ratio  suggeststhat  it  is  expected  to  have  cooled  relatively rapidly.However, recent observations suggest that it still maintains a high temperature in its present-day interior [1,2], raising questions about the mechanism(s) behind adelayed cooling. Temperature-dependent viscosity hasbeen studied as a first-order factor [3] in controlling therate of planetary cooling. The effect of variable thermalconductivity has been studied before for other planetary bodies [4, 5], but not the Moon.The lunar crust is mainly composed of anorthositicplagioclase [6], with a small volume of mare basalt onparts of the surface. Both of these phases have a thermal conductivity of around 2 W/m/K [5, 7]. We consider the effect of variable conductivity in the lunar interior, including the low value in the lunar crust, andassess how it influences cooling history. This variablethermal conductivity is compared to a uniform value of4 W/m/K, generally assumed for mantle materials andapplied in many previous studies [4, 5, 8, 9].An updated conductivity profile:  To arrive at amore  refined  conductivity  profile  for  the  Moon,Hofmeister's [10] temperature- and pressure-dependentconductivity model for average mantle material is applied under lunar conditions. Temperature is obtainedfrom the mantle convection models of [8]. Pressure isobtained from a depth-dependent gravity profile calculated from uniform mantle density and assuming an Ferich core  radius of 350 km. Thermal expansivity decreases with depth and has a negative effect on conductivity. Results obtained from the GRAIL mission showthat the lunar crust is 34-43 km thick [11]. In this study,we assume the crust has a thickness of 40 km, and athermal conductivity of 2 W/m/K.The resulting temperature- and pressure-dependentthermal  conductivity  profile  changes  during  secularcooling. A few snapshots from model H1 (Table 1) areshown in Figure 1. As van den Berg et al. have calculated for the Earth [4, 9] and exoplanets [12],  due tostrong  temperature  dependence,  conductivity  in  thethermal  boundary  layers  (e.g.  the  lithosphere)  decreases  rapidly  with  increasing  temperature.  For  theabove-mentioned  planets,  conductivity  increases  withdepth in the convective mantle, due to the dominanceof pressure dependence over temperature dependencein the deeper mantle. This creates a low-conductivityzone (LCZ) at the base of the lithosphere [4,  9,  12],which affects the style and efficiency of planetary cooling. On the contrary, in the Moon, the positive effect ofpressure is significantly smaller due to the low gravity,decreasing with increasing depth. The negative effectof  temperature  almost  cancels  the  positive  effect  ofpressure in the bulk mantle. Although a sharp change ofgradient is observed at the bottom of the lithosphere, itdoes not represent a clear minimum.In our preliminary studies, we verify that the maininfluence of variable thermal conductivity on planetarycooling comes from the thermal boundary layers. Thelow conductivity in the lunar crust leads to overall highthermal resistance of the lithosphere,  which acts as astrong resistor to the heat flow caused by the temperature contrast between the mantle and the surface.Model setup:  Convection equations are solved foran incompressible, infinite Prandtl number fluid, usingthe extended Boussinesq approximation. Modeling experiments are performed using a cylindrical finite element mesh with a total of 20000 elements.Figure 1.  Evolution  through time of  the variablethermal conductivity in the lunar mantle in model H1.The initial conductivity profile (red) is identical in theH models.Our  models  start  from the  end  of  lunar  magmaocean (LMO) solidification [13]. Density and the internal distribution of heat-producing elements are basedon the stratified structure of the cumulates [13].  Theinitial  temperature distribution follows a laterally homogeneous profile  that  increases  linearly in the convective part  of the bulk mantle.  The rate  of increasewith depth is obtained from a linear approximation of aconvecting lunar mantle in previous model results [8].1477.pdf

In our preliminary studies, the viscosity scale value is1x1023  Pa  s.  This  results  in  a  Rayleigh  number  of1.005x104.A set of four models is used, summarized in Table1.  H1  and  H2  use  the  variable  conductivity  model.They are compared to U1 and U2 which use a uniformconductivity of 4 W/m/K. H1 and U1 assume that theheat-producing elements of the KREEP layer remain inthe lunar crust, whereas H2 and U2 assume they followthe  ilmenite-bearing  cumulates  (IBC)  in  the  mantleoverturn after solidification of the LMO.Table 1.

Evolution  of  average  mantle  temperatures.Figure 3. Evolution of average core temperatures.The effect of variable conductivity can be seen bycomparing the H models to the corresponding U models. The different conductivity models result in differences  in  present-day  average  mantle  temperature  ofmore than 100 K. This corresponds to a delay of cooling of 2 Gyr or more, for the H models to reach thesame present-day mantle temperature. This means thatvariable thermal conductivity, including low values inthe crust, is a significant controlling factor in the thermal evolution of the Moon.Core  temperature  evolution  is  sensitive  to  bothvariable  thermal conductivity and the location of  theKREEP layer  heat  production.  Variable  thermal  conductivity moves the onset of mantle overturn back intime by more than 0.5 Gyr.Figure 4. Heat flux across the core-mantle boundary, compared to the Qad criterion.A variable conductivity does not result in significant differences in present-day surface heat flux. Coremantle boundary heat flux is compared to a necessarycondition of lunar dynamo, which computes the minimum amount of heat flow (Qad) out of the core to sustain an adiabat in the outer core [14]. Models with avariable conductivity in general imply an earlier timerange of dynamo existence.Conclusion:  For  small  planetary  bodies  with  ahigh surface-to-volume ratio, including the Moon, thermal conductivity in the lithosphere can be a strong limiting factor in their thermal evolution. The high concentrations  of  plagioclase  in  the  lunar  crust  significantly increase  thermal  resistance  of  the  lithosphere,and therefore insulate the convecting mantle.Our results show that a variable conductivity profilepredicts  higher  present-day  mantle  temperatures  bymore than 100 K, an early mantle overturn and an earlier dynamo existence.
