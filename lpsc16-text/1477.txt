 EFFECT OF VARIABLE THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY ON LUNAR THERMAL EVOLUTION.  Y. Zhao1, A. P. van den Berg1 and W. van Westrenen1,  1Faculty of Earth and Life Sciences, VU University Amsterdam, the Netherlands, email y.zhao@vu.nl Introduction:  The Moon is a relatively small planetary  body.  Its  high surface-to-volume ratio  suggests that  it  is  expected  to  have  cooled  relatively rapidly. However, recent observations suggest that it still maintains a high temperature in its present-day interior [1, 2], raising questions about the mechanism(s) behind a delayed cooling. Temperature-dependent viscosity has been studied as a first-order factor [3] in controlling the rate of planetary cooling. The effect of variable thermal conductivity has been studied before for other planetary bodies [4, 5], but not the Moon. The lunar crust is mainly composed of anorthositic plagioclase [6], with a small volume of mare basalt on parts of the surface. Both of these phases have a thermal conductivity of around 2 W/m/K [5, 7]. We consider the effect of variable conductivity in the lunar interior, including the low value in the lunar crust, and assess how it influences cooling history. This variable thermal conductivity is compared to a uniform value of 4 W/m/K, generally assumed for mantle materials and applied in many previous studies [4, 5, 8, 9]. An updated conductivity profile:  To arrive at a more  refined  conductivity  profile  for  the  Moon, Hofmeister's [10] temperature- and pressure-dependent conductivity model for average mantle material is applied under lunar conditions. Temperature is obtained from the mantle convection models of [8]. Pressure is obtained from a depth-dependent gravity profile calculated from uniform mantle density and assuming an Ferich core  radius of 350 km. Thermal expansivity decreases with depth and has a negative effect on conductivity. Results obtained from the GRAIL mission show that the lunar crust is 34-43 km thick [11]. In this study, we assume the crust has a thickness of 40 km, and a thermal conductivity of 2 W/m/K. The resulting temperature- and pressure-dependent thermal  conductivity  profile  changes  during  secular cooling. A few snapshots from model H1 (Table 1) are shown in Figure 1. As van den Berg et al. have calculated for the Earth [4, 9] and exoplanets [12],  due to strong  temperature  dependence,  conductivity  in  the thermal  boundary  layers  (e.g.  the  lithosphere)  decreases  rapidly  with  increasing  temperature.  For  the above-mentioned  planets,  conductivity  increases  with depth in the convective mantle, due to the dominance of pressure dependence over temperature dependence in the deeper mantle. This creates a low-conductivity zone (LCZ) at the base of the lithosphere [4,  9,  12], which affects the style and efficiency of planetary cooling. On the contrary, in the Moon, the positive effect of pressure is significantly smaller due to the low gravity, decreasing with increasing depth. The negative effect of  temperature  almost  cancels  the  positive  effect  of pressure in the bulk mantle. Although a sharp change of gradient is observed at the bottom of the lithosphere, it does not represent a clear minimum. In our preliminary studies, we verify that the main influence of variable thermal conductivity on planetary cooling comes from the thermal boundary layers. The low conductivity in the lunar crust leads to overall high thermal resistance of the lithosphere,  which acts as a strong resistor to the heat flow caused by the temperature contrast between the mantle and the surface. Model setup:  Convection equations are solved for an incompressible, infinite Prandtl number fluid, using the extended Boussinesq approximation. Modeling experiments are performed using a cylindrical finite element mesh with a total of 20000 elements. Figure 1.  Evolution  through time of  the variable thermal conductivity in the lunar mantle in model H1. The initial conductivity profile (red) is identical in the H models. Our  models  start  from the  end  of  lunar  magma ocean (LMO) solidification [13]. Density and the internal distribution of heat-producing elements are based on the stratified structure of the cumulates [13].  The initial  temperature distribution follows a laterally homogeneous profile  that  increases  linearly in the convective part  of the bulk mantle.  The rate  of increase with depth is obtained from a linear approximation of a convecting lunar mantle in previous model results [8].  In our preliminary studies, the viscosity scale value is 1x1023  Pa  s.  This  results  in  a  Rayleigh  number  of 1.005x104. A set of four models is used, summarized in Table 1.  H1  and  H2  use  the  variable  conductivity  model. They are compared to U1 and U2 which use a uniform conductivity of 4 W/m/K. H1 and U1 assume that the heat-producing elements of the KREEP layer remain in the lunar crust, whereas H2 and U2 assume they follow the  ilmenite-bearing  cumulates  (IBC)  in  the  mantle overturn after solidification of the LMO.

Evolution  of  average  mantle  temperatures. Figure 3. Evolution of average core temperatures. The effect of variable conductivity can be seen by comparing the H models to the corresponding U models. The different conductivity models result in differences  in  present-day  average  mantle  temperature  of more than 100 K. This corresponds to a delay of cooling of 2 Gyr or more, for the H models to reach the same present-day mantle temperature. This means that variable thermal conductivity, including low values in the crust, is a significant controlling factor in the thermal evolution of the Moon. Core  temperature  evolution  is  sensitive  to  both variable  thermal conductivity and the location of  the KREEP layer  heat  production.  Variable  thermal  conductivity moves the onset of mantle overturn back in time by more than 0.5 Gyr. Figure 4. Heat flux across the core-mantle boundary, compared to the Qad criterion. A variable conductivity does not result in significant differences in present-day surface heat flux. Coremantle boundary heat flux is compared to a necessary condition of lunar dynamo, which computes the minimum amount of heat flow (Qad) out of the core to sustain an adiabat in the outer core [14]. Models with a variable conductivity in general imply an earlier time range of dynamo existence. Conclusion:  For  small  planetary  bodies  with  a high surface-to-volume ratio, including the Moon, thermal conductivity in the lithosphere can be a strong limiting factor in their thermal evolution. The high concentrations  of  plagioclase  in  the  lunar  crust  significantly increase  thermal  resistance  of  the  lithosphere, and therefore insulate the convecting mantle. Our results show that a variable conductivity profile predicts  higher  present-day  mantle  temperatures  by more than 100 K, an early mantle overturn and an earlier dynamo existence.
