Introduction: CM chondrites exhibit evidence for aqueous alteration to variable degrees [1,2]. Physicochemical conditions (e.g., temperature, water to rock ratio, and open/closed system) under which aqueous alteration occurred have been the subject of debate. Carbonate is a secondary mineral of aqueous alteration and recorded O and C isotopic compositions of water and dissolved inorganic C species (e.g., CO32-) from which it formed [e.g., 3,4]. The O and C isotopic compositions of water and dissolved C changed with increasing alteration, and their evolution depends on water/rock ratios and whether aqueous alteration occurred in an open or closed system [5-8]. The O and C isotopic ratios of carbonates were also determined by formation temperatures [9]. Thus, carbonates potentially provide information about the alteration environment in the CM chondrite parent body. Although the O and C isotopic compositions of carbonates are highly variable even in a single meteorite [e.g., 10], much is unknown about how the O and C isotopic compositions changed and what predominantly controlled them. In this study, we conducted in-situ O- and Cisotope measurements on calcite grains in the Nogoya CM 2.2-2.3 chondrite. Detailed petrological and mineralogical observations along with O-isotope measurements in previous studies have suggested that carbonates in CM chondrites did not form in a single event but formed intermittently [11,12]. Isotope measurement of carbonates in multiple “generations” could shed light on the evolution of O and C isotopic compositions during aqueous alteration. Experimental: We prepared a polished thin section of the Nogoya CM chondrite and coated it with Au. We observed the thin section with an SEM-EDS and searched for Ca-carbonate grains large enough for subsequent isotope measurements. Oxygen- and C-isotope measurements were performed with the NanoSIMS 50 at AORI, UTokyo. 16,17,18O-  ions (in O-isotope measurement), or 12,13C-, 18O-, 12C14N-, and 28Si-  ions (in Cisotope measurement) produced by a 20-30 pA Cs+ ion beam were detected with a FC and two EMs, or with four EMs, respectively. In C-isotope measurement, 12,13C- ions were detected with the same EM in a combined peak-jumping/multi-detection mode. 18O-, 12C14N-, and 28Si- ions were monitored in the C-isotope measurement to check the presence of possible contamination such as organic matter or silicate. Typical errors on 17,18O and 13C values were 5.3 ‰ and 6.4 ‰ (2), respectively. Oxygen and C isotopic ratios were normalized by using terrestrial calcite with known O and C isotopic ratios measured by a conventional method. Results and discussion: We found many Cacarbonate grains by the SEM observation. Although we do not have any data to distinguish the polymorphism of the Ca-carbonate (i.e., calcite or aragonite), we hereafter describe the Ca-carbonate as calcite because aragonite is less common in more-heavily altered CM chondrites [13].

As reported in the previous studies [11-13], two types of calcite grains with distinct mineralogical characteristics were found. Following the definition by [13], we describe these calcite grains as type 1 and 2 grains. Most type 1 grains are single crystals and have serpen20 m 100 m (a) (b) 1712.pdf

tine/tochilinite rims (Fig. 1a). They are likely to have precipitated from pore fluids. On the other hand, type 2 grains are polycrystalline and microporous, and do not have rims. They appear to have replaced other minerals (Fig. 1b). Some type 2 grains appear to have replaced whole chondrules. Type 2 grains typically have sulfide inclusions. Oxygen isotopic compositions are highly different between type 1 and 2 grains, but similar within each type (18OSMOW = 34.7 ‰ (type 1) and 19.3 ‰ (type 2) on average) (Fig. 2). The average 17O values are  -2.5 ‰ (type 1) and -5.4 ‰ (type 2). These data are in good agreement with those reported by previous studies [11,12]. The 18O and 17O values indicate that type 2 calcite formed later than type 1 calcite, because progressive alteration led to O-isotope exchange between water and anhydrous silicate with lower 18O and 17O values than water. The lack of serpentine/tochilinite rims around type 2 grains also suggests that type 2 grains formed after type 1 grains were replaced by serpentine/tochilinite. -505101520250 10 20 30 40 5018O17OTFLCCAMType 2Type 1 Fig. 2: Oxygen isotopic ratios of type 1 and 2 calcite grains.  01020304050607010 15 20 25 30 35 40 4518O13CType 2Type 1~28 % loss ofdissolved CFig. 3: 13C values against 18O values of type 1 and 2 calcite grains. Carbon isotopic ratios of type 1 grains are similar (13CPDB = 31.8 ‰ on average), whereas type 2 grains have variable 13C values ranging from 28.8 to 61.2 ‰ (Fig. 3). These observations indicate an increase in 13C values in later stages of aqueous alteration. The O and C equilibrium isotopic fractionation factors between carbonate and water, and between carbonate and dissolved/gaseous C species, respectively, are smaller at higher temperatures. As a result, both 18O and 13C would have changed to lower values with increasing temperatures assuming reasonable O and C isotopic compositions of water and dissolved/gaseous C species. Therefore, the variation in O and C isotopic compositions of calcite observed in this study cannot be explained by change in formation temperatures alone as suggested by [9]. No components with 13C > 40 ‰ in organic matter from a less-altered CM chondrite, Murchison, has been found [14]. Therefore, the apparent 13C increase in later stages of aqueous alteration observed here is unlikely to be attributed to the addition of a 13C-rich C from organic matter to aqueous fluids by oxidation. It has been suggested that the Rayleigh-type isotopic fractionation driven by the escape of 13C-poor CH4 could have led to 13C enrichments of the dissolved inorganic C [7]. The observed 13C increase of ~30 ‰ can be explained if ~28 % of the dissolved C was reduced to produce CH4 and was lost at 28 oC. If true, aqueous alteration in CM chondrites would have occurred in an open system at least in later stages. References: [1] Brearley A. J.
