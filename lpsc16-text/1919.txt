Introduction:  Yamato-82094 (Y-82094) is an ungrouped type 3.2 carbonaceous chondrite, with abundant chondrules making 78 vol.% of the rock [1]. Among these chondrules, an unusual porphyritic Alrich magnesian chondrule is reported that consists of a cordierite-like phase, Al-rich orthopyroxene, cristobalite, and spinel surrounded by an anorthitic mesostasis [2]. The reported chemical formula of the cordieritelike phase is Na0.19Mg1.95Fe0.02Al3.66Si5.19O18, which is close to stoichiometric cordierite (Mg2Al3[AlSi5O18]). Although cordierite can be present in Al-rich chondrules [3], it has a high temperature polymorph (indialite) [4] and it is therefore necessary to determine whether it is cordierite or indialite in order to better constrain its formation conditions. In this abstract we report on our synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction (SR-XRD) study of the cordierite-like phase in Y82094. Methods:  We studied a thin section of Y-82094 by energy-scanning SR-XRD which we developed at SPring-8, Hyogo, Japan [5]. At beam line BL37XU an undulator is installed and white undulator radiation is further monochromatized using a Si (111) doublecrystal monochromator. A Kirkpatrick and Baez mirror is equipped upstream of the sample giving a beam size of ~0.7 x 2 m on the sample position. Diffraction patterns were measured on the two-dimensional detector (CMOS Flat panel detector, Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.). The thin section analyzed was attached on the XYZ-stage, and the target point was adjusted on the micro-beam position under an optical microscope. We applied energies from 30.00 to 20.00 keV (=0.41330.6199 Å) at steps of 40 eV with each exposure time being 0.5 seconds to obtain diffraction data without rotating the sample. Results:  We could obtain sharp diffraction spots from the core of a cordierite-like phase in Y-82094 (Figs. 1, 2). Such sharp diffraction spots are consistent with relatively low shock grade (S2) of the meteorite [1]. The obtained diffraction pattern was analyzed by using the parameters of the indialite crystal structure [6] because it is likely that this Al-rich chondrule was formed at high temperature where indialite is stable over cordierite [4]. We found that the calculated diffraction pattern employing the indialite structure gave the best match, with the observed diffraction spots and the calculated indices being shown in Fig. 3. Then, 57 strong diffraction spots were used to refine the cell parameters. The obtained cell parameters are: a = 9.800(3) Å, b = 9.792(2) Å, c = 9.330(2) Å,  = 89.99(3)°,  = 90.09(5)°,  = 120.00(2)°, a/b = 1.0009(4). These are very close to the literature data of indialite (hexagonal, space group: P6/mcc, a = 9.800(3) Å, c = 9.345(3) Å,  =  = 90°,  = 120° [6]) Discussion and Conclusion:  The crystal structures of cordierite and indialite are highly related because distortion of the indialite cell (hexagonal) gives the cordierite cell (orthorhombic, space group Cccm, a = 17.079(3) Å, b = 9.730(2) Å, c = 9.356(2) Å [7]) [e.g., 4]. Before we worked on SR-XRD, we tried both Raman analysis and electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD) using FEG-SEM [2]. However, we could not clearly distinguish between cordierite and indialite because of their structural similarity. The SR-XRD study of the cordierite-like phase in an unusual Al-rich chondrule in Y-82094 revealed that the obtained diffraction pattern could be indexed by the indialite structure. The successful indexing using the hexagonal cell means that the phase is indialite rather than cordierite.  Cordierite is a common mineral in terrestrial metamorphic rocks, but an extremely rare phase in extraterrestrial samples. The few reports of cordierite include cordierite-spinel troctolite known in lunar highland rocks [8], the Allende CV3 chondrite [9, 10], and a mesosiderite [11]. Indialite has never been found in extraterrestrial samples although cordierite in Allende is reported to be "hexagonal cordierite" [9]. The stability field of indialite is not well constrained, but [4] and [12] reported that indialite is stable above 1450 oC. This is consistent with the occurrence of cristobalite in this chondrule. Such high temperature is quite normal during Mg-rich chondrule formation. Thus, if a cordierite-like phase is found in 1919.pdf
