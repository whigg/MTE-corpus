Introduction: Imaging of Mercury by the MESSENGER (MErcury Surface Space ENvironment, GEochemisty and Ranging) spacecraft included a series of targeted and untargeted stereo image observations by the Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS) camera, obtained at resolutions of 15-75 m/px, which allowed digital terrain models (DTMs) to be created at a factor of 3× lower resolution, ~45-250 m/px. We have used the Ames Stereo Pipeline (ASP) [1-3] to process 96 regions with multiple overlapping stereo pairs into DTM mosacs (Fig. 1) [4] (available on the web at http://www.calebfassett.com/mercurydtms).  These stereo DTMs are complementary to the data from Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA) [5].  MLA data provide more precise elevation meaurements, but with sparse spatial sampling except at the highest northern latitudes.  For most of these stereo DTMs, sufficient MLA coverage existed to act as a geodetic reference, but the resolution and coverage of the stereo data was superior. The vertical accuracy of the stereo datasets is approximately the pixel resolution of the original images. Here, these new DTMs allowed us to analyze morphometric properties of craters in a variety of locations on Mercury and characterize the topography of degraded craters. Earlier work on this topic with MESSENGER [6-8] used MLA and shadow measurements, and focused primarily on depth/diameter (d/D) along with Trask’s class system to assess degradation. In this study, we also derived d/D, as well as quantitative estimates of degradation using diffusion profiles (following [9]). The goal was to analyze the rate of crater degradation and landform evolution on Mercury.  Because the initial morphometry of complex craters is highly variable [see, e.g., 7], we limited our initial analysis to simple craters with diameter 2.5<D<5 km.    Our expectation was that crater degradation was likely to be enhanced on Mercury relative to the Moon because of more energetic cratering due to increased impact velocities at the innermost planet. Other evidence supports this hypothesis, including observations of faster destruction of rays [10] and faster regolith  Fig. 1.

growth [11].  Crater Measurements: We mapped craters on 82 of the 96 DTMs that were created, excluding scenes where few craters were resolved or virtually all the craters in the scene were obvious secondaries. For our initial analysis, radial profiles for 1842 unique craters were extracted. In addition, repeat coverage in multiple DTMs of 25 craters allowed us to test the quality of our measurements. Results and Discussion: We found craters in the 2.5 km to 5 km size range on Mercury are much shallower than post-maria lunar craters from [9] (Fig. 2a).  If this is entirely attributable to difference in inferred degradation, we estimate a factor of ~10× faster degradation on Mercury than the Moon (Fig. 2b).   There are a few reasons to be cautious about this result. First, the Mercury stereo data are lower resolution and less accurate than the lunar data.  However, the freshest and deepest craters are the best resolved in the stereo analysis. Only 10% of craters in the Mercury dataset have d/D>0.15, compared to 94% in the lunar data (Fig. 2a).  A difference in age between the sampled regions can explain part of this discrepency but not all of it; such a difference (is also at least notionally) corrected for in Fig. 2b.   Second, Mercury’s crater population in this sizerange may be substantially contaminated by secondaries, which are initially shallow. Secondaries are thought to be a more serious contaminant on Mercury than the Moon [12], and are thus likely to be part of the crater population we measured.  However, arguing that secondaries make up the vast majority of our observed population would require Mercury’s primary flux to be much lower than currently understood, or Mercury’s surface to be much younger than is generally thought.   Third, it is possible that primary craters are initially shallower, or more variable in d/D, than those on the Moon are (as implied, e.g., by [13]’s Table 2). No physical reason for such an effect is known, however. Fourth, linking the observed crater degradation states to age assumes a cratering flux model for Mercury [e.g. 14] (Fig. 2b). Mercury’s flux is more uncertain than the lunar flux because it lacks the calibration provided by the lunar sample collection. For errors in Mercury’s chronology to explain the whole disparity in degradation states would require that the vast majority of craters in our dataset (97-98%) date back to the LHB era. This in turn would again require a much lower post-LHB flux on Mercury than the Moon, contrary to current expectations. Conclusions: Our observations show that D~2.5 to 5 km craters on Mercury have shallower topography than expected, suggesting they experienced degradation at a rate approximately an order of magnitude faster than on the Moon. This higher rate of crater degradation has important implications for the evolution of Mercury’s topography and its crater population.  References: [1] Broxton, M.J., Edwards, L.J.
