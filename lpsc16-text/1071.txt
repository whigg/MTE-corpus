Semjonova, Vernadsky Institute of Geochemistry and Analytical Chemistry, RAS, Moscow, 119991 Russia (anat@chgnet.ru).   Introduction. The nature of phases-carrier (Q phase) of trapped (primordial planetary) noble gases in meteorites is one of the unsolved problems of cosmochemistry now. Q-phase is basically accepted as organic substance (e.g., [1, 2]). At the same time, research of troilite of iron meteorite of Mundrabilla was shown that this sulphide is similar to the Q-phase by Xe and Kr degassing during acid processing and, therefore, sulphides can be subcomponents of Q-phase [3]. For the purpose of identification of sulphides as phase-carrier of the trapped gases in Saratov chondrite, we analysed contents of C, N, Ar, and Xe in finegrained (≤150µm) fraction enriched by Fe-Ni metal grains. Experimental and results. The enriched with metal grains (≤150 µm) fraction (designated as 3СМ) was released from crushed Saratov sample by means of a hand-magnet. This fraction was addition cleared by soft crushing in a spirit. Grains in 3CM fraction are basically metal with silicate intergrows in some cases. Viewing under a microscope of 3CM polished section after etching by Nital has shown, that the basic phases of grains are kamacite (prevails) and taenite. The sulphide and silicate are observed on periphery of grains and in their internal areas also. The concentrations and isotopic compositions of C, N and noble gases in 3CM were analysed by stepped combustion in the temperature range from 200 to 1400 oC by A. Verchovsky (Open University, UK) using Finesse machine [4]. Results of measurements are given in the Table and Fig. 1. The data for the bulk sample of Saratov [5] and of troilite from iron meteorites of Mundrabilla [3] and Saint-Aubin [6] are cited also. Discussion. Histograms of Ar and Xe release from 3СМ are multimode (Fig. 1) that point out discontinuity of degassing parameters of their phase- carriers. The 3СМ differs from a Saratov bulk on kinetics releasing of noble gases by following: (1) basic quantities of 36 Ar and 40 Ar from 3СМ are released in the intervals of 300-600 and 700-1100 o С with maxima at 600 and 1000 oС whereas from a bulk the release maxima of 36 Ar and 40 Ar are observed at 600 and 1200 oС, accordingly (Fig. 1a, b); (2) the release of the basic part of 132 Хе from 3СМ occurs in the range of 300-600 oС whereas from a bulk the Xe is allocated almost equally both up to 600 oС, and after 1000 oС (Fig. 1c, d). These distinctions point out different contents of phases-carriers of gases in 3СМ and a bulk, in particular, on depletion of 3СМ by silicate. The kinetics of carbon and nitrogen release from 3СМ and from bulk is similar: in both cases the basic quantities of these elements are released up to 400 oС (Fig. 1e, f). Fraction 3СМ and a bulk are similar also to that during stepped oxidation the content of released carbon does not correlate with nitrogen and with noble gases. It is notice that the nitrogen cosmogenic component in 3СМ is practically absent, accurately shown in high-temperature area of bulk oxidation (Fig. 1f). Release of the basic quantity of C and N from 3СМ at oxidation up to 400 oС is caused, possibly, by carbonaceous phase(s). On a surface of metal grains these phases could be formed in Fischer-Tropsch-type reactions [7] before accretion of a parental body of a Saratov meteorite. A source of the basic part of noble gases in 3СМ is, as we assume, pentlandite. This assumption is made on the basis of following factors: (1) in temperature intervals 300-600  and 700-1100 oС of gases releasing from 3CM there are both a temperatures of pentlandite decomposition and of subsequent melting incongruently of formed phases ([8] & refs. therein; (2) temperature interval of 132 Хе and 40 Ar release (700-1100 oС) partially or completely coincides with those for troilite samples of iron meteorites (Fig. 1a, c); (3) in the range of 700-1100 oС oxidations 3СМ the 129 Хе/ 132 Хе ratio is raised that also is observed at pyrolysis of troilite (Fig. 1c); (4) low temperature (up to 1100 o С) allocation of 40 Ar from 3СМ can be caused by presence a potassium sulphide [6], (5) almost same the kinetics of 36 Ar and 40 Ar release (Fig. 1a) point out either similar degassing parameters of their phases of carriers or on contents of 40 Ar and 36 Ar in one carrier. Such carrier can be sulphide with a 40 К and noble gases. Almost equal the 40 Ar/ 36 Ar ratio in intervals of 300-600 and 700-1100 oС during oxidation of 3СМ (Table) show that at decomposition of pentlandite and the subsequent incongruently fusion of products of its disintegration, the association 40 К with 36 Ar basically remains. At the same time, in these temperature intervals the 36 Ar/ 132 Xe ratio essentially differ (Table). Possibly, process of reconstruction of pentlandite structure at its decomposition led to Xe atoms removal from a crystal lattice in a greater degree than Ar.    Conclusion. Results of the analysis of the small metal-sulphide intergrows of Saratov (L4) meteorite were shown, that the noble gases are in pentlandite. They can be either dissolved in sulphide or are in its carbonaceous inclusions. Capture of gases or their phase-carrier by pentlandite could occur at various stages of meteoric substance evolution, e.g., during condensation in the protoplanetary cloud and in processes of forming chondrules.
