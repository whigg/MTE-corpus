Introduction: Tektites were formed by hypervelocity impact events and collected from the four strewn fields (Australasian, North American, Central Europe and Ivory Coast). The source craters for three of the four strewn fields have been identified: the Chesapeake Bay crater for the North American strewn field, the Bosumtwi crater for the Ivory Coast strewn fields and the Ries Crater for the Central European strewn field [1]. However, the crater of the Australasian strewn field has not been identified. Meteoritic components have been identified from impact glasses, melts and breccias by using highly siderophile elements, while obvious signature of meteoritic components has not been clearly identified from tektites except Ivory Coast tektites [2,3]. In this study, we determined elemental abundances including platinum group element (PGE) for Australasian tektites from Dalat, Vietnum, in order to identify the meteoritic type of impactor and place constraints on the precursor materials of the Australasian strewn field tektites. Analytical methods: Thirteen Dalat tektites which were bought in a market of Dalat were used. Before analyses of these tektites, samples were cleaned with 1M HCl, deionized water and aceton in order to remove soil attached on the surface. After cleaning, these tektites were carefully ground in clean agate mortars. Aroung 10 g of each homogenized powder sample was taken for the determination of PGE abundances by using NiS fire-assay combined with isotope dilution and ICP-MS [4]. About 50 mg and 15 mg were used for INAA, and ICP-AES and ICP-MS, respectively,  to determine as much elements as possible. Results and Discussion: Major and minor elements. Our data of thirteen Dalat tektites are consistent with literature values [5-7]. The homogeneity of chemical compositios was found to be less than 10% (1Ïƒ; n=13) for all most major and minor elements, while the large heterogeneity was observed in Cr, Co and Ni. Nickel and Co abundances for Australasian tektites are compared in Fig. 1, where those for crustal materials, mafic materials, CI chondrites and iron meteorites are also shown for comparison. About half of Australasin tektites have similar Ni and Co abundances to those for crustal materials, while the other Australasian tektites including our Dalat tektites have higher abundances. A positive correlation between Ni and Co abundances can be seen in Australasin tektites. Chromium is also positively correlated against Ni (not shown). These positive correlation have been considered to be due to the mixture of different source rocks [6,7] and meteoritic components [8]. Assuming that precursor materials of Australasin tektites are crustal materials and that Ni and Co abundances are represented by the mixture of crustal materials and CI chondrites, their mixing calculation results are shown in Fig. 1. As seen in Fig. 1, observed positive correlation could be explained by the presence of meteoritic components. However, mafic materials and iron meteorites have similar Ni/Co ratios to CI chondrites. Mixings between crustal materials and mafic materials, and crustal materials and iron meteorites also are able to explain the observed positive correlation.  Figure 1.

PGE can be excellent tracers for detection of meteoritic components and identification of the types of meteoritic impactors [9]. CI chondrite-normalized PGE abundances in Australasian tektites [this work, 8,10,11] along with those for upper continental crust [12,13] are shown in Fig. 2. PGE abundances for thirteen Dalat tektites are 10-3 to 10-4 times lower than those of CI chondrites and have similar PGE abundances to those for upper continental crust. Compared with upper continental crust, our Pt and Pd values are lower than Rh. Our data for Ir are consistent with literature values [8,10], indicating that our values are reliable. Morgan [8] determined some siderophile elements (Os, Re, Ir, Au, Pd and Ni) abundances for Australia tektites and observed that one tektites sample has higher abundances of these elements and its CI-normalized abundance pattern is al most flat. It was concluded that higher Ir and Pd abundances for one Australia tektites are due to the presence of carbonaceous chondrite type materials [8]. Assuming that precursor material of Dalat tektites is upper continental crust and impactor is CI chondrite, Dalat tektites include meteoritic component of less than 0.013% by mass based on Ir contents. This estimated proportion of a meteoritic component cannot explain higher Ni, Co and Cr abundances. As seen in Fig. 1, about 1% of meteoritic components is necessary to explain Ni and Co abundances in Dalat tektites when precursor material of Dalat tektites are mixture of upper continental crust and CI chondrite.  Figure 2. CI-normalized PGE abundances for Australasian tektites. For comparison, those for upper continental crust (UCC) [12,13] also are shown. Iridium abundances for Australasian tektites are plotted against Ni and Cr in Figs. 3 (a) and (b), respectively. Iridium, Ni and Cr abundances of mixtures of crustal materials with mafic materials, CI chondrites and iron meteorites are estimated and the calculated results are plotted in Figs. 3 (a) and (b). As shown in Fig. 3 (a), our Dalat tektites fall in the range of mixture of mafic materials and crustal materials. In addition, literature values for Australia tektites [8] are also plotted in the mixing area of crustal materials and mafic materials. Even one Australia tektite which has chondritic siderophile element abundances pattern fall in the this area. Although a plot of Ir and Ni abundances could rule out a possibility of the presence of CI chondrites in Australasian tektites, a possibility of the presence of iron meteorites could not be excluded. Iridium abundances are plotted against Cr for Australasian tektites in Fig. 3 (b). Being similar to the plot of Ir vs. Ni, Australasian tektites fall in the mixing area of crustal materials and mafic materials. As shown in Fig. 3 (b), the presence of iron meteorites in Australasian tektites could be ruled out. Therefore, higher Cr, Ni and Co abundances in Dalate tektites could be explained by the presence of mafic materials.  Peucker-Ehrenbrink and Miller [14] carried out a study on quantitative bedrock geology of east and southeast Asia and concluded that the estimated bedrock area contain 18.2% of mafic materials. In consideration that the formation age of Australasian tektites is 0.77 Ma [15], a possibility of incorporation of mafic materials in the Australasian tektites is acceptable. Figure 3.

Red, blue and green soild lines represent mixings between crustal materials and CI chondrites, crustal materials and iron meteorites, and crustal materials and mafic components.
