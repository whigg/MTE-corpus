Introduction:  Three large-scale chemical cycles appear to dominate the chemistry in Venus' atmosphere: the carbon dioxide, sulfur oxidation, and polysulfur cycles [1]. The first maintains the chemical stability of the atmosphere's primary constituent. The second produces the global sulfuric acid cloud layers and links with the CO2 cycle through the production and loss of O, as shown in Figure 1. The third may be responsible for producing the unidentified ultraviolet absorber [e.g., 1,2,3], which, along with CO2 near the tops of the clouds, appears to be responsible for absorbing about half of the energy deposited in Venus' atmosphere [4].  The CO2 cycle comprises photodissociation of CO2 at wavelengths < 210 nm to form CO and O, production of O2 from two O, and reformation of CO2 from CO and O2. Fast O2 production has been confirmed by observations of intense O2(a1∆-X3∑) airglow on the day and night sides [e.g., 5,6]. Production of CO2 is believed to proceed primarily via catalytic cycles involving chlorine compounds [e.g., 1,7,8,9], but no model has yet identified process(es) for producing CO2 that are sufficiently fast to generate a modeled O2 abundance which is consistent with the observational upper limit (vmr) of 3×10-7 [10,11,12]. Heterogeneous catalyzed CO2 production is a possible fast mechanism [13].  Methods:  The Venus photochemical model used for the initial parametric study is based on that used for [9]. It solves the 1-d continuity equation for simultaneously for all species over 58-110 km altitude with 2km thick layers. The global-average simulations used high solar irradiance fluxes [14] at 45° latitude at local noon. The eddy diffusion coefficient profile was set based on observations, chemical data was drawn primarily from [15], and the water vapor profile was fixed to match the equilibrium vapor pressure over 75 wt% sulfuric acid. The mixing ratios for CO2, CO, HCl, OCS, and SO2 at 58 km were set to 0.965, 45 ppm, 0.4 ppm, 1 ppb, and 1 ppm, respectively.  Heterogeneous oxidation of CO was simulated by Reaction (1) with reaction rate constant given by Equation (2) [16] and efficiency described by γrxn,  (1) CO + O + aerosol → CO2 + aerosol  (2)  K = γrxn Ji naer 4 π r2aer   where Ji is the flux onto the aerosols and naer and raer are the aerosol particle number density and radius, respectively. No attempt has been made to identify a mechanism by which the hypothesized heterogeneous reaction might occur.  Preliminary Results:  Initial calculated O2 abundance and CO mixing ratio profiles are shown in Figures 2 and 3, respectively. For γrxn < 10-5, the calculated O2 column abundance is ≥ 2×1018 cm-2. For γrxn = 10-4, the calculated O2 column abundance is 1.2×1018 cm-2, which is smaller than the original interpretation of the most stringent upper limit, 1.5×1018 cm-2 [10] but larger than the most recent interpretation, 0.8×1018 cm-2 [12]. Below 75 km altitude, significant differences between the calculated and observed CO profiles are evident whenever heterogeneous oxidation of CO is important.  Preliminary Conclusions: Heterogeneous chemistry with a plausible reactive uptake coefficient can significantly increase the rate at which CO is oxidized and reduce the calculated O2 abundance. However, the actual abundance of ground-state O2 is not yet known and the calculated CO mixing ratios in the globalaverage model below 75 km are significantly smaller than has been observed. The broader impacts remain to be investigated, further study is required to assess whether conditions exist under which heterogeneous chemistry can satisfy simultaneously observational constraints on both O2 and CO, and the viability of a specific mechanism needs to be established in laboratory studies.
