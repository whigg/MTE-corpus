This is a highly weathered region will numerous craters and etched terrains. Due to a long time space weathering effects, most of the visible near-infrared spectra are featureless. However, with more and more lunar remotely sensed imaging spectral datasets with higher spatial and spectral resolutions (e.g. Chandrayaan-1 Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M 3), Kaguya Multi-band Imager (MI), and Chang'e-1 Imaging Interferometer (IIM), etc.), we have the opportunity to check the diversities of lunar highlands in great details.  The mineral assemblages and rock types of this basin furnishes a key to understand the origin of the basin and early history of lunar crustal evolution. Visible near-infrared (VNIS) spectroscopy is one of the most popular methodologies in Lunar remote sensing studies. It's commonly thought that the rock forming minerals on the surface of lunar include orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, olivine and plagioclase, etc. Pyroxene and olivine minerals dominate mare regions and plagioclase is the major mineral in highlands [3-9]. Characteristic absorption features near 1 µm and 2 µm of VNIS spectra for lunar minerals are the most significant feature of pyroxene [3, 10] and olivine, which is associated with Inter-Valence Charge-Transfer (IVCT) and crystal-field electronic transitions in Fe 2+ [3, 11].  Data:  The high spectral and spatial resolution data from the Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M 3) instrument on Chandrayaan-1 is used in this abstract, which is ~140 m per pixel with 85 bands [12, 13]. The level 2C data is used in this study  Fig 1 The radial gravity of the Lorentz basin. Method:  Lunar gravity field model (LGM2011) [14] is employed to show the gravity of Lorentz (Fig 1). It's possible that flexural uplift of the annulus causes the uplift and positive gravity anomalies within the basin center, which is likely a dominant reason for global non-mare masons [15].   Fig 2 (a) is the Lorentz basin. (b) is the M 3 maturity color composite: R, continuum ratio; G, albedo; B, band depth. Fig 2(a) shows the region we studied including Lorentz basin. It's easy to find that almost the whole part of the Lorentz basin eroded by space weathering heavily, consistent with high optical maturity as shown in Fig 2 (b). Three spectral parameters are used to quantify the spectral effects generally thought in connection with increasing optical maturity, which is reddening (increase in spectral slope), darkening (decrease in albedo), and reduction in absorption band depth [12]. In this abstract, we select small and fresh craters based on a maturity color composite map created with the  parameters above. The value of Albedo is the reflectance at 1.579 µm; continuum ratio is the slope from 0.73 µm to 1.508 µm; band depth is the sum depths from 0.73 to 1.508 µm. Fresher craters have higher value of albedo and band depth with lower albedo. Therefore, the yellow-green regions mean higher maturity, and the light blue ones mean fresher parts.  There are nearly 159 craters per 106 km 2 [16], the small and fresh ones (less than 1 km in diameter) of which are used in this abstract to characterize the mineral composition of highlands within Lorentz basin. Selected craters should be small enough so that they can be supposed to conclude constant composition and fresh enough to decrease the disturbance of space weathering [12]. The locations of selected craters are in Table 1. The reflectance spectra images are shown in Fig 3.

Otherwise, we add an absorption feature whose center is around 0.5 µm. We don't consider that feature for the first two useless bands (0.461 µm and 0.501 µm) of M 3 data. The absorption features of low-calcium pyroxenes (e.g., orthopyroxene) are at 0.91~ 0.94 µm and 1.88~ 2.06 µm, while those high-calcium pyroxenes (e.g., clinopyroxene) are at around 1.03 µm and 2.3 µm [17, 18]. From the results we have gotten, the absorption features at 1 µm and 2 µm approaching the absorption features of orthopyroxene (Fig 3 (c)). The region we select is dominated by norite.  Future Work:  For the next step, we will continue to select more small fresh craters, extract their spectral data, derive their mineral information and rock types of highlands by MGM. We hope that our study will provide a key to understand the early history of lunar crustal evolution.
