Introduction: The shergottite Northwest Africa (NWA) 7320 was recovered in Zagora (Morocco) in 2011 and has no known paired meteorites. NWA 7320 is classified as a gabbroic shergottite solely based on its coarse-grained texture. Here we present the mineralogy and petrographic characteristics of NWA 7320, suggesting that this shergottite is an intrusive martian sample. Analytical methods: In situ major and minor element compositions were measured using the JEOL JXA-8900 electron microprobe (EMP) at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Mineral compositions were determined using an accelerating voltage of 15 kV, beam current of 20 nA, and beam sizes of 1-5 µm. Mosaic element maps were obtained using 15 kV and 60 nA current and were used to measured the phase modal abundances. In situ trace element compositions were measured using the New Wave UP213 solid-state laser ablation system attached to a Thermo-Fisher X-series II quadrupole ICP-MS at the University of Cape Town with beam sizes ranging from 55 µm for silicates to 40 µm for phosphates.

Petrography and mineral chemistry: The shergottite NWA 7320 shows a phaneritic texture and is composed a complexly zoned pyroxene (47%), subhedral to lath-shaped maskelynite (shocked plagioclase: 51%), silica (1%), and merrillite (1%), with minor amount of ferroan olivine, ilmenite, titanomagnetite, and apatites (Fig. 1). Terrestrial calcite and barite are also present in veins. NWA 7320 pyroxenes are elongated with long-axes up to 3 mm long. They show a complex patchy zoning with pigeonite cores (from Wo10En49Fs41 to Wo20En21Fs59), subcalcic augite mantles compositions (between Wo21En20Fs59 and Wo37En39Fs24), and pyroxferroite rims (from Wo20En17Fs61 to Wo14En4Fs82) (Fig. 2). Pigeonite cores or augite mantles are not always present and often display irregular boundaries. Augites are slightly more enriched in Rare Earth Elements (REE) than the pigeonites (Fig. 3a). The maskelynite compositions range from An40 to An61 and display a large positive Eu anomaly (Eu/Eu* = 2*Eu/(Sm+Gd) = 65). Merrillites are the major carrier for REE in NWA 7320 (Fig. 3a). Three phase-symplectites (hedenbergite + olivine + silica) were also observed in NWA 7320. The threephase symplectite is thought to form after pyroxferroite breaks down during slow cooling (>1000ºC for three days) [5].

Discussion:  NWA 7320 Oxygen fugacity Oxygen fugacity was calculated using ilmenitetitanomagnetite pairs by applying both Ca-QUILF model [6] and the Ghiorso-Evans model [7]. We obtained an average ƒO2 at the Fayalite-Magnetite-Quartz  (FMQ) buffer with Fe-Ti temperature of 963°C using the Ghiorso-Evans model and an equilibrium temperature of 840°C using the Ca-QUILF model. This represents the late assemblage oxygen fugacity.  REE bulk composition The REE bulk composition of NWA 7320 was calculated using the modal abundances of the major phases and is represented in Figure 3. NWA 7320 bulk REE  composition shows a relatively flat profile, showing that this meteorite is an enriched shergottite with (La/Lu)CI = 0.6 (Fig. 3). In addition, a large positive Eu anomaly (Eu/Eu* = 2.2) was observed, suggesting that NWA 7320 shows accumulation of plagioclase during fractionation of parental magma. Thus, NWA 7320 likely represents an intrusive sample of the martian crust, as also implied by its very coarse-grained texture and slow cooling suggested by presence of symplectite. The negative Ce-anomaly observed in the bulk REE profile likely indicates subsequent terrestrial alteration in hot desert environment as suggested by [8]. The NWA 7320 bulk rock composition is overall depleted in REE compared to the enriched shergottites Los Angeles and NWA 5298, which both display similar pyroxene composition and texture to NWA 7320. However, only NWA 7320 displays a large Eu positive anomaly.   Fig. 3: a) Rare Earth Element profiles of the different NWA 7320 phases. The bulk-rock composition was calculated using modal abundances. b) REE profiles of melt in equilibrium with pigeonite and augite and bulk rock REE compositions of NWA 5298 [1] and Los Angeles [10]. Open-system crystallization is also suggested by the REE composition of melts in equilibrium with the different NWA 7320 phases, which were calculated using partition coefficients from [9]. NWA 7320 pigeonite displays the highest Mg# and is the first crystallizing phase in NWA 7320 magma. The melt in equilibrium with this phase does not match the bulk rock composition, which indicates that NWA 7320 does not represent a liquid.  Summary: NWA 7320 is an enriched gabbroic shergottite that underwent slow cooling and accumulation of plagioclase. NWA 7320 is one of the first intrusive samples from Mars along with the NWA 6963 shergottite studied by [11-12].  References:  [1] Hui et al. (2011) MAPS, 46, 1313-1328. [2] McSween et al.
