 ON THE EVOLUTION OF THE MAIN BELT ASTEROIDS.  K. A. Holsapple1 and T.

One of the main benefits of those observations is information on asteroid spins.  There are spin data for almost six thousand asteroids from the efforts of observers  from all  over the world.  The present  spin  of any asteroid is a result of its history.  The analysis of that history is the subject of this contribution. Theoretical Approaches: Figure 1 shows the distribution of asteroid spin versus its diameter. There are some well-described features that  are evident  in  that plot;  the  most  well-known  now is  the  gravity  spin limit  at  the  period  of  about  2.3  h.  (We emphasize again that the limit does not imply rubble-pile asteroid structure, a rock asteroid would have that same gravity limit.) Other features still remain puzzling. A common way to understand such a distribution is to construct a theoretical model and run numerical simulations of an artificial population of asteroids and try to reconstruct what we observe. The previous studies that attempted to do so include [1], [2], [3], [4],  [5], [6] and others. Here we update those approaches with several important modifications. The primary elements of the prior  studies and of the present one are 1) a population of asteroids in a finite region, 2) a distribution of impact velocities and angles, 3) the efficiency of angular  momentum transfer in an impact, 4) the loss or gain of mass and angular  inertia,  5) the amount,  direction and speed of the cratering ejecta. We note that the characteristics of the ejecta  are  especially  important,  firstly  identified  by [2].  We upgrade the ejecta analysis to include recent results on ejecta scaling ([7], [8]). We use some recent experimental results on the angular momentum transfer efficiency and we also update the asteroid population estimates. Contrary to the previous studies, we do not average over the distribution of the impact velocities and angles. A key outcome of such averaging is a quadratic accumulation of spin magnitudes from averaged single impacts.  We  reject  that  approach  for  two  reasons. First, because of the momentum drain effect, the result of any one impact is not independent of the prior ones. Second, it has been found that the current spin of an asteroid is more likely caused by a very few large impacts  and  not  by an  accumulation  of random  small ones. Therefore, we performed Monte Carlo analyses of the effects of a large number of impacts into a large number of target asteroids. The outcomes are distributions of spin versus asteroid size, which can then be compared to the actual data. Some of the typical simulations are shown in Figure 2. Results:  First (and as found by others), the spins of the large asteroids cannot  have resulted from impacts with the current population. A much larger population is required.  Second, both the average spin and the maximum spin at any given size falls off with increasing  asteroid size.  Third,  there  may be "average equilibrium  spin  states",  defined  by a  curve of spin versus  diameter.  For  asteroids  spinning  faster  than that  state,  the average next  impact  will  always slow the  spin;  but for an  asteroid  with  a  spin  below that state the average impact will increase its spin.  That is an  effect of the  preferential  ejection  of ejecta in  the spin direction of the surface. There are reasonable parameter choices that result in  the average equilibrium curve consistent  with the average  spins,  and  with  the  resulting  distributions centered along that curve. Then there is also a "maximum equilibrium spin curve" defined as the maximum possible spin an asteroid can attain,  again  as a function of asteroid size.  That  bounds the upper limit  of asteroid  spins,  and  has  a  downward  power slope of 0.65.  The fact  that  the  maximum equilibrium  curve intersection with the gravity limit curve occurs right at the 10 km upper bound of the data for binary asteroids strongly suggests that  it  is collision spin-up and  not YORP that creates the spins that result in binaries. Finally, a single large impact into an asteroid with a preexisting average spin can easily reduce its spin to near zero. That may explain the excess of slow spinners (as compared to Maxwellian) for the spin distributions of the asteroids with diameters larger than 10 km. These results  and  others will be presented at  the conference. References: [1] McAdoo D.  C.  and  Burns  J.  A. (1973)  Icarus,  18, 285-293.  [2]  Dobrovolskis A. R. and Burns J. A.
