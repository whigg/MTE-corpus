The phase function  f(α)  bears  information aboutthe structure of a surface, as it is sensitive to changes ofphotometric conditions during observations.Several different equations for the phase functionsof the lunar surface have been proposed.  One of themost  commonly used  is  the  4-parameter  formula  byAkimov [1,2]:f() = A1 exp(–μ1α) + A2 exp(–μ2α),            (1)where  α is  the  phase  angle,  A1,  μ1,  A2,  and  μ2 arecoefficients. Note that  A1 + A2 is equal to the normalalbedo  A0.  This  formula  provides  a  goodapproximation  of  phase  curves  deduced  fromobservations, but an ambiguity is observed frequentlybetween the first and the second terms of (1). We herepropose a new expression for the lunar phase function: f() = A0 exp(–ηαρ),            (2)where A0, η, and ρ are, respectively, the normal albedo,slope  and  bend  of  the  phase  curve  (the  greater  theparameter  ρ,  the smaller the bend).  This formula hasonly 3 parameters and may be easily linearized, whichis useful for effective photometric calculations.Application to  LROC WAC  data:  The  LROCWAC  data  set  suggests  unique  information  forphotometric investigations of the lunar surface, becauseit provides multiple coverage (up to hundreds of times)of  the  same  areas  under  different  illumination andobservation  conditions  [3].  Building  seamlessphotometric mosaics is a difficult task, as many thingsshould be taken into account, e.g., (1) variations of αwithin a frame are large, up to 60°; (2) the influence oflocal slopes of the surface on photometric data; and (3)the position of the same point of the surface in differentfilters  differs  due  to  the  parallactic  effect.  Theprocedure of primary processing of the LROC  WACdata has been described in detail [4]. To map the parameters of functions (1) and (2), weconsider each point of the lunar surface in two scenes,applying  the  mean-square  method  to  all  availableLROC  WAC  images  (up  to  150..200)  acquired  atdifferent  phase angles.  The first  scene comprises  theReiner- formation (Fig. 1).  The phase curves of twopoints (P1 and P2 in Fig. 1) are shown in Fig. 2 withapproximations using Eqs. (1) and (2). P1 is located inthe area of a photometric anomaly (negative correlationbetween the phase curve slope and albedo) and P2 is ina typical area. Tables 1 and 2 contain parameters of theapproximations  (rc is  the  correlation  index).  Theequations  show good  agreement,  but  Eq.  (2)  worksbetter.  In  rare  cases,  when   > 1,  the  newapproximation suggests unusual smoothing out of thephase  curves  at  small  α,  which  is,  perhaps,  ashortcoming of the approximation (see P1 in Fig. 2).

(2)  for  mapping  thephase-function parameters of the photometric anomalyin Mare Nubium [5] (Figs. 3-5). The anomaly is almostinvisible on  the  map of  η, but is clearly seen in the  ρmap. We also found that parameter  η demonstrates aclose inverse correlation with albedo and depends onthe  wavelength;  whereas,  the  parameter  ρ is  almostindependent of the wavelength (Fig. 6).Conclusions: We here propose an empirical  phasefunction  having  only  three  parameters,  which  maydescribe  the  phase  dependence  of  brightness  over  awide range of phase angles better than the 4-parametricformula (1). The new approximation should be appliedwith caution at  small phase angles if   > 1,  which isobserved rarely. The parameter η describes the generalslope of the phase curve and  inversely correlates withalbedo.  The  parameter  ρ describes  the  bend  of  thephase curve. The typical value of ρ is 0.63±0.12. Thiswas calculated for seven lunar areas using more than 1million points. The parameter   is almost independentof  wavelength.  Areas  of  photometric  anomalies  arecharacterized by increased values of  ρ (smaller bend).This can indicate roughness caused by rock fields. References: [1] Shkuratov et al.
