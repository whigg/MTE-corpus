Introduction:  The phase function is a necessary component for studying the physical properties of the lunar surface and for valid photometric transformations of  data  of  ground-based  and  spacecraft  observations [1].  The phase function  f(α)  bears  information about the structure of a surface, as it is sensitive to changes of photometric conditions during observations. Several different equations for the phase functions of the lunar surface have been proposed.  One of the most  commonly used  is  the  4-parameter  formula  by Akimov [1,2]: f() = A1 exp(-μ1α) + A2 exp(-μ2α),            (1) where  α is  the  phase  angle,  A1,  μ1,  A2,  and  μ2 are coefficients. Note that  A1 + A2 is equal to the normal albedo  A0.  This  formula  provides  a  good approximation  of  phase  curves  deduced  from observations, but an ambiguity is observed frequently between the first and the second terms of (1). We here propose a new expression for the lunar phase function: f() = A0 exp(-ηαρ),            (2) where A0, η, and ρ are, respectively, the normal albedo, slope  and  bend  of  the  phase  curve  (the  greater  the parameter  ρ,  the smaller the bend).  This formula has only 3 parameters and may be easily linearized, which is useful for effective photometric calculations. Application to  LROC WAC  data:  The  LROC WAC  data  set  suggests  unique  information  for photometric investigations of the lunar surface, because it provides multiple coverage (up to hundreds of times) of  the  same  areas  under  different  illumination and observation  conditions  [3].  Building  seamless photometric mosaics is a difficult task, as many things should be taken into account, e.g., (1) variations of α within a frame are large, up to 60°; (2) the influence of local slopes of the surface on photometric data; and (3) the position of the same point of the surface in different filters  differs  due  to  the  parallactic  effect.  The procedure of primary processing of the LROC  WAC data has been described in detail [4]. To map the parameters of functions (1) and (2), we consider each point of the lunar surface in two scenes, applying  the  mean-square  method  to  all  available LROC  WAC  images  (up  to  150..200)  acquired  at different  phase angles.  The first  scene comprises  the Reiner- formation (Fig. 1).  The phase curves of two points (P1 and P2 in Fig. 1) are shown in Fig. 2 with approximations using Eqs. (1) and (2). P1 is located in the area of a photometric anomaly (negative correlation between the phase curve slope and albedo) and P2 is in a typical area. Tables 1 and 2 contain parameters of the approximations  (rc is  the  correlation  index).  The equations  show good  agreement,  but  Eq.  (2)  works better.  In  rare  cases,  when   > 1,  the  new approximation suggests unusual smoothing out of the phase  curves  at  small  α,  which  is,  perhaps,  a shortcoming of the approximation (see P1 in Fig. 2).

(2)  for  mapping  the phase-function parameters of the photometric anomaly in Mare Nubium [5] (Figs. 3-5). The anomaly is almost invisible on  the  map of  η, but is clearly seen in the  ρ map. We also found that parameter  η demonstrates a close inverse correlation with albedo and depends on the  wavelength;  whereas,  the  parameter  ρ is  almost independent of the wavelength (Fig. 6). Conclusions: We here propose an empirical  phase function  having  only  three  parameters,  which  may describe  the  phase  dependence  of  brightness  over  a wide range of phase angles better than the 4-parametric formula (1). The new approximation should be applied with caution at  small phase angles if   > 1,  which is observed rarely. The parameter η describes the general slope of the phase curve and  inversely correlates with albedo.  The  parameter  ρ describes  the  bend  of  the phase curve. The typical value of ρ is 0.63±0.12. This was calculated for seven lunar areas using more than 1 million points. The parameter   is almost independent of  wavelength.  Areas  of  photometric  anomalies  are characterized by increased values of  ρ (smaller bend). This can indicate roughness caused by rock fields. References: [1] Shkuratov et al.
