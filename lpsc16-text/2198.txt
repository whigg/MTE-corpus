Introduction:  As soon as the Dawn mission [1] approached Ceres, the homogenous surface and very low albedo differences shown by the Hubble Space Telescope observations [2], were only partially confirmed, because the first Framing Camera (FC) [3] images revealed small but very intense bright spots (BS). In some of these bright spots the reflected light was so intense to saturate both the FC images and the VIR spectrometer data [4]. Next Dawn observations were planned to optimise the signal from these regions. The compositional comparison of the bright spots is the objective of this work. Apart from the few widest and brightest features such as Haulani (6°N 10°E) and Occator (20°N 240°E) discovered so far, directly by looking at the FC images, there could be smaller and “darker” BS that are still undetected on Ceres. Our first step has been to build a catalogue of the BS present on the surface. After that, a thorough spectral and compositional analysis will be performed to point out possible differences among them. BS VIR catalogue:  In order to build a catalogue of the bright spots we used an approach similar to [5] that were used for Vesta. We firstly corrected photometrically the VIR data using the method implemented for Vesta [6] and whose application on Ceres is described in more detail in [7]. This methodology allowed to obtain for each pixel the equigonal albedo at 1.2 m (R30) which would be observed under a phase angle of 30°. We adopted a relative definition for bright pixels. For each VIR cube we obtained the R30 value averaged on the frame (R30m), then we defined as bright all the pixels whose R30 is 30% larger than R30m. If bright pixels are grouped (and not isolated), this group of bright pixels constitutes a bright spot. This catalogue presents the result of our survey applied to the VIR data obtained during the Approach, Rotational Characterization (altitude of 13500 km), Survey (4400 km) and HAMO (1450 km) orbit phases of the Dawn mission.  From the list of so obtained BS, we excluded regions not detected as bright in the FC images. This disagreement has been ascribed to the fact that these regions are mostly corresponding to crater rims, hence are observed at extreme illumination conditions, therefore their high R30 is due to an overphotometric correction. BS types: We identified 38 bright spots and their distribution on the surface of Ceres is shown in Fig.1. Most of the BS show a R30 of 0.05-0.06, 40% more than the Ceres average (i.e. 0.035). However, due to the relative criterion adopted, it is possible to find bright units presenting an (absolute) R30 even lower or comparable to the Ceres average. The Occator bright spot is a very peculiar feature since it is the only region showing a very large albedo even more than three times with respect to the average (i.e. R30>0.10). The majority (70%) of the BS are observed only in HAMO data and therefore are relative to small-scale units, even if large-scale units (i.e. observed also on Survey and Approach phases) are mostly evident. Most of BS are found at Southern latitudes, but the BS at Northern and equatorial latitudes show a larger R30 and hence are more evident. Regarding the geological features related to BS, 18 BS are related to ejecta and 13 to crater walls, floors or rims. Therefore more than 80% of BS is related to features generated by impacts. The other cases concern diffused material (Yafode), spots (Tahu, B34 feature and two units on the Samhain Chain), a rupe (Gerber) and the Ahuna Mons. Spectral properties. The analysis of spectral properties of BS is in progress. Each BS will be characterized by spectral descriptors, such as band depths and center at 2.7 m, 3.0 m, 3.4 m and 3.9 m, infrared and visible slopes. This analysis will help to understand the reasons for the higher albedo (e.g., different compostion or different regolith physical properties), the possible differences among Ceres BS’s.
