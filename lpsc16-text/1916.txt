Introduction: The CI chondrites are considered as the most primitive materials available in our solar system. CI chondrites comprise of only five falls and possibly a few finds from Antarctica [1]. Antarctic CI chondrites are metamorphosed and are petrologically different from those of CI falls, i.e., Ivuna, Orgueil and Alais [2]. Therefore, Antarctic CI chondrites could have been derived from a parent body different from that of CI chondrite falls [2]. Even with the importance of CI chondrites, chemical compositions of Antarctic CI chondrites have not been reported.  The CM chondrites were previously considered not to be thermally metamorphosed until the finding of the some unusual CM chondrites (e.g., Belgica 7904). These unusual CM chondrites were metamorphosed on the their parent body after aqueous alteration [2,3], and they have petrological and mineralogical characteristics similar to those of CI and CM chondrites. Such unusual meteorites have been studied in the view of petrology and mineralogy [2-5], while their chemical characteristics are less known. The understanding of metamorphism on the CM parent body based on chemical compositions were not well studied.  Here, the chemical compositions, especially rare earth elements (REE), Th and U, of four Antarctic carbonaceous chondrites (Yamato (Y) 980115, Belgica (B) 7904, Yamato (Y) 86720 and Yamato (Y) 793321) were reported in order to unravel their formation histories. Samples and Experimental procedures: A total of 4 Antarctic carbonaceous chondrites (one CI and three CM2 including two CM2-ungroup) were analyzed. These meteorites were all recovered from Antarctica. About 500 mg of each meteorite was ground in an agate mortar, and ~15 mg of each powdered sample was used for the determination of REEs, Th and U by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) [6]. Besides, several other elements (Mg, Al, P, Ca, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr and Ba) were analyzed by ICP atomic emission spectrometry (ICPAES) [7,8]. In addition, the Smithsonian Institute (SI) Allende and the Murchison meteorites also were analyzed as control samples. Results and discussion: By repeating analyses of the SI Allende sample, the accuracy of our data for most elements are estimated to be less than 5% except for Cu (7%) and Ba (6%); the relative standard deviations (RSD) for 5 individual experiments are less than 5% except for U (6.4%).   Figure 1 Mg and mean CI-normalized abundances for Y-980115 along with those of Alais, Ivuna and Orgueil chondrites from literatures [1,9,10]. The elements were ordered from left to right according to decreasing nebular condensation temperatures. Figure 1 shows chemical compositions of Y980115 and other CI fall (Alais, Ivuna, Orgueil [1,9,10]). It is clear that the chemical composition of Y980115 for most elements lie in the range of other CI chondrites within errors with some minor differences (e.g., Sr and Cu), but Sr and Cu values of this study are very close to CI mean.   Figure 2 Mg and mean CM-normalized abundances for the three Antarctic CM and Murchison chondrites. The elements were ordered from left to right according to decreasing nebular condensation temperatures. The CM-normalized values are taken from [1,9-13]. Although meteorites collected from Antarctica may have suffered from terrestrial weathering [11], chemical compositions of Y-980115 for major and minor elements are less affected by terrestrial weathering. In Figure 2, chemical compositions of B-7904, Y-793321 and Y-86720 are compared with those for Murchison. 1916.pdf

Based on mineralogical study, Nakamura (2005) [3] showed the degree of heating for several carbonaceous chondrites including B-7904, Y-793321 and Y-86720. Y-793321 has experienced the thermal metamorphism as the stage II (300oC – 500oC), while B-7904 and Y86720 have undergone the thermal metamorphism as the stage IV (> 750oC), and the Murchison has not been subjected to heating (< 250oC). Even though Y793321 was metamorphosed, there is no any noticeable difference between Y-793321 and Murchison. Although B-7904 and Y-86720 have similar chemical compositions to those for other CM chondrites, their Zn abundances are strongly depleted. Considering that these meteorites were strongly metamorphosed [3], these depletions of Zn may be due to thermal metamorphism on its parent body. REE, Th and U abundances for B-7904 are enriched compared with those for other CM chondrites (Figure 2). Figure 3 shows the REE, Th and U abundance patterns of Y-980115 and those of other CI chondrites. In general, Y-980115 has similar REE, Th and U abundances to those for other CI chondrites.  Figure 3 CI-normalized REE, Th and U abundances patterns of Y980115 and other CI chondrite falls (CI-normalized values are taken from [14]). Nevertheless, it is noticed that there are slight differences between Y-980115 and other CI chondrites: (1) Y-980115 is slightly depleted in LREE relative to HREE. Y-980115 has low ratios of (La/Lu)CI (0.947±0.018) and (Lu/Yb)CI (0.945±0.019), whereas (La/Lu)CI and (Lu/Yb)CI ratios for other CI chondrites are in range of 0.981~1.069 and 0.968~1.062, respectively; (2) Y-980115 has no Ce and Tm anomalies ((Ce/Ce*)CI = 1.003±0.012 and (Tm/Tm*)CI = 0.987±0.022), while all other CI chondrites have negative Ce anomaly ((Ce/Ce*)CI: 0.976~0.989) and positive Tm anomaly ((Tm/Tm*)CI: 1.025~1.055). It is well known that negative Ce and positive Tm anomalies are characteristics of REE abundances pattern of type II CAI [15]. Probably, Y-980115 contains less amount of such CAIs than those in other CI chondrites. It is suggested that Y-980115 and other CI chondrites have different formation history and/or parent body. Figure 4 shows the REE, Th and U abundance patterns for the three Antarctic CM chondrites, Murchison and Allende.  Figure 4 CI-normalized REE, Th and U abundances patterns of B-7904, Y-793321, Y-86720, Murchison and Allende meteorites (CI-normalized values are taken from [14]). It is recognized that B-7904 has a high (~1.4 × CM) and fractionated REE, Th and U abundances and comparable to those of Allende. Negative Ce and Eu anomalies, and a positive Tm anomaly along with enrichment in LREE and depletion in HREE are main features of REE abundance pattern in the SI Allende, implying that B-7904 contains amount of early condensed material such as type II CAI. Although having undergone the different thermal metamorphism histories [3,4,5], Y793321 and Y-86720 have the similar REE, Th and U abundance patterns to those for other CM chondrites (Figure 4), suggesting that REE, Th and U abundances are not affected by thermal metamorphism. The Th/U ratio of Y-980115 (3.76±0.14) is median between those of Ivuna (3.85, [1]) and Orgueil (3.67, [1]), but is higher than that of Alais (2.95, [1]). B-7904, Y793321 and Y-86720 have the similar Th/U ratios to each other, being 3.77±0.10, 3.76±0.12 and 3.75±0.12, respectively. References: [1] Barrat J. A. et al. (2012) GCA, 83, 79-82. [2] King A.
