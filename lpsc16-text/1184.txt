Vander Kaaden1,3 1NASA Johnson Space Center, mailcode XI2, 2101 NASA Parkway, Houston, TX 77058. 2Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, American Museum of Natural History, New York, NY, 10024. 3Institute of Meteoritics, 1 University of New Mexico, MSC03-2050, Albuquerque, NM 87131 (francis.m.mccubbin@nasa.gov).  Introduction: The mineral apatite [Ca5(PO4)3(F,Cl,OH)] is present in a wide range of planetary materials. Due to the presence of volatiles within its crystal structure (X-site), many recent stud-ies have attempted to use apatite to constrain the vola-tile contents of planetary magmas and mantle sources [1-5]. In order to use the volatile contents of apatite to precisely determine the abundances of volatiles in co-existing silicate melt or fluids, thermodynamic models for the apatite solid solution and for the apatite compo-nents in multi-component silicate melts and fluids are required. Although some thermodynamic models for apatite have been developed [i.e., 6, 7-10], they are incomplete. Furthermore, no mixing model is available for all of the apatite components in silicate melts or fluids, especially for F and Cl components. Several experimental studies have investigated the apatite-melt and apatite-fluid partitioning behavior of F, Cl, and OH in terrestrial and planetary systems [i.e., 10, 11, 12-14], which have determined that apatite-melt parti-tioning of volatiles are best described as exchange equilibria similar to Fe-Mg partitioning between oli-vine and silicate melt [14-18]. However, McCubbin et al., [14] recently reported that the exchange coeffi-cients may vary in portions of apatite compositional space where F, Cl, and OH do not mix ideally in apa-tite. In particular, solution calorimetry data of apatite compositions along the F-Cl join exhibit substantial excess enthalpies of mixing [7]. In the present study, we conducted apatite-melt partitioning experiments in evacuated, sealed silica-glass tubes at ~1 bar and 950-1050 °C on a synthetic martian basalt composition equivalent to the basaltic shergottite Queen Alexandria Range (QUE) 94201. These experiments were con-ducted dry, at low pressure, to assess the effects of temperature and apatite composition on the partition-ing behavior of F and Cl between apatite and basaltic melt along the F-Cl apatite binary join, where there is non-ideal mixing of F and Cl in apatite. Experimental Methods: Two powdered mixes were synthesized based on the QUE 94201 composi-tion with approximately 5 wt.% additional P2O5 (to induce early phosphate saturation). The two mixes were either an F or Cl endmember with ~1 wt.% of F and Cl, respectively. The mixes were prepared by first weighing silicates, oxides, Ca2P2O7, CaF2, and MgCl2 powders in the proportions needed for obtaining the target compositions. Next, the powders were mechani-cally mixed sequentially by volume in an automatic agate mortar/pestle grinder for a total of 3.5 hours un-der ethanol. The Fe3+/∑Fe value in the mixture was 0.10. Because MgCl2 is soluble in ethanol, the Cl-bearing mix was ground under dry conditions.  Experiments were conducted in a Deltech vertical quench furnace at LDEO of Columbia University. The mixes were packed into high purity Mo capsules. Weighed capsules were then placed into a silica tube sealed at one end. 0.5″ and 1″ glass spacers were placed just above the capsule to minimize the volume inside the tube. After evacuating for 15 mins, the tube was stretched to form a capillary, sealed, and suspend-ed on a thin Pt-wire. The assembly was gradually low-ered into the hot spot where the horizontal temperature differences were within 1oC. Each sample was first held at 1150oC for 30 mins then lowered to the tem-perature of interest ranging between 1050°C to 950°C where it stayed for 8 hr. The temperature of each ex-periment was controlled by a type S thermocouple. Each experiment was drop-quenched in cold water.  Analytical Methods/Results: Experimental charg-es were mounted in epoxy and polished for subsequent analysis by EPMA. The apatite and quenched glass in each sample was analyzed by EPMA using the proce-dures outlined by McCubbin et al., [14]. The F and Cl contents of glass and coexisting apatites are presented in Table 1 for all 11 experiments based on the average of approximately 5-20 analyses. Table 1.

of H2O would have caused the silica tubes to rupture. From the data in Table 1, we can calculate apatite-melt partition coefficients for F (3-25) and Cl (0.58-2.2).  As discussed previously by Boyce et al., [15] and McCubbin et al., [14], F and Cl are essential structural constituents in the mineral apatite, so their partitioning behavior should deviate substantially from Henrian behavior of trace elements. Similar to the partitioning behavior of Fe and Mg between olivine and silicate liquids, the partitioning behavior of F and Cl between apatite and silicate melt are best described by an ex-change coefficient (Equation 1):  ࡷࡰ࡭࢖షࡸ࢏ࢗ࡯࢒ି =  ࢄࡸ࢏ࢗࡲ ÷ࢄ࡭࢖ࡲࢄࡸ࢏ࢗ࡯࢒ ÷ࢄ࡭࢖࡯࢒                    (1)                    where ࢄࡸ࢏ࢗࡲ  is the wt.% F in the melt, ࢄ࡭࢖ࡲ  is the wt.% F in the apatite, ࢄࡸ࢏ࢗ࡯࢒  is the wt.% Cl in the melt, and ࢄ࡭࢖࡯࢒  is the wt.% Cl in apatite. These exchange coefficients can change as a function of melt composition, pres-sure, temperature, apatite composition, and oxygen fugacity; however, McCubbin et al., [14] reported that ܭ஽ಲ೛షಽ೔೜஼௟ିி = 0.21 ± 0.03 (Figure 1) over a wide range of ternary (F-Cl-OH) apatite compositions at 1.0 GPa and 950-1000 °C. In the present study of apatite along the F-Cl join, ܭ஽ಲ೛షಽ೔஼௟ିி  varies from 0.21 ± 0.02 at F-rich compositions to 0.07 ± 0.01 at Cl-rich composi-tions at ~1 bar and 950-1050 °C (Figure 1). In addition to variable ܭ஽ಲ೛షಽ೔೜஼௟ିி  values along the F-Cl apatite join, the Cl-F KD values consistently decrease with decreas-ing F in the apatite structure, indicating that F becomes proportionally more compatible in apatite compared to Cl as apatite becomes more Cl-rich. This observation holds true until at least 70% chlorapatite, however without additional data, we cannot assess the range 70-100% chlorapatite.  Figure 1. Plot of ܭ஽ಲ೛షಽ೔೜஼௟ିி  values vs. F structural formula units (sfu) in apatite. Error bars on the exchange KD were derived from propagating the standard deviation of the mean from each average analysis through the KD value. The shaded purple region represents the Cl-F exchange KD determined by McCubbin et al., [14] for the F-Cl-OH system at 1 GPa. In addition to apatite composition, temperature also appears to play a role in the partitioning behavior, where the highest T (1050 °C) displays the slowest rate of change in the KD value, which is expected, although 950 °C and 1000 °C seem to display identical behavior within error. Discussion: The results of this study indicate that apatite-melt partitioning behavior is affected by the mixing behavior of F, Cl, and OH in the apatite struc-ture, as predicted by McCubbin et al., [14]. Further-more, the exchange equilibria, which appeared to re-main relatively constant over a wide range of apatite compositions at a fixed P, T, Xmelt, and fO2, are not immune to variability when F, Cl, and OH mix non-ideally on the apatite X-site. In addition, the results herein indicate that F be-comes proportionally more compatible in apatite rela-tive to Cl as apatite compositions become more Cl-rich. This behavior is likely due to the structural ac-commodation mechanism that allows for mixing of F and Cl in OH-free F-Cl apatite, which involves the establishment of an off-mirror F site within the X-site channels. This new site allows apatite to maintain hex-agonal symmetry in space group P63/m and minimize electron density by increasing F-Cl atomic distances in the channels [21]. Fluorine is crucial to this accommo-dation, so it is not surprising that F compatibility rela-tive to Cl increases. At some point along the F-Cl join, the hexagonal symmetry breaks down and the b-axis doubles, resulting in monoclinic symmetry within space group P21/b. We anticipate that this transition occurs at >70% chlorapatite based on existing solution calorimetry data [7]. We anticipate this structural change to affect the exchange KD value as well. This work illustrates the importance of understand-ing the thermodynamic mixing properties of F, Cl, and OH in apatite before employing exchange KD values for apatite-based melt hygrometry even when various intensive parameters (e.g., P, T, Xmelt) are constrained.
