MODELING MELTING OF THE MARTIAN MANTLE USING pMELTS. J.B. Balta, Department of Geology and Environmental Science, University of Pittsburgh, 4107 O’Hara St., Pittsburgh PA 15260, balta@pitt.edu.    Introduction: Early estimates of the composition of the martian mantle were created to explain the chemistry of the shergottite/nakhlite/chassignite (SNC) meteorites, which differ from terrestrial basalts and other meteorite groups. Continued discovery of new meteorites and analyses of rocks on the surface by rovers has expanded our knowledge of martian igneous compositions, giving new constraints on properties such as the temperature of the martian mantle and the thickness of Mars’s crust [1-2]. But, as the SNC meteorites have been analyzed in laboratories on Earth they still provide our best constraints on Mars’s mantle. Melting of these previously estimated mantle compositions under varying conditions is a potential source for some of this newly discovered composition variation and thus an important target for continued study. The most widely accepted estimate of the composition of Mars’s mantle based on the SNC meteorites was produced by Dreibus and Wänke (1986, hereafter DW) [3]. Multiple experimental studies have explored the compositions produced by melting DW mantle; however, compared to natural melting, experiments must generate large enough melt fractions to produce analyzable melt pools and thus are closer to batch/equilibrium conditions. Measurements of rocks on Earth suggest that equilibrium mantle melting is uncommon and instead natural systems are closer to fractional melting [4], with small amounts of melt generated during adiabatic decompression and primary melts aggregated at the top of a melting column. Understanding melting on Mars therefore requires approaches capable of characterizing the effect of fractional melting on martian compositions. In this work, I apply the pMELTS algorithm to explore fractional melting of the DW mantle under plausible martian conditions [5-7]. This work characterizes the variation in melt composition that can be produced across a range of plausible martian conditions and then compares the calculated melt compositions to chemical signatures common in shergottites. Methods: The MELTS algorithm uses petrologic experiments to calibrate the thermodynamic interactions in silicate melts and solids; those calibrated interactions can then be applied to simulate melting of under different conditions and compositions. Recent tests indicate that the MELTS algorithm, and its higherpressure calibration pMELTS, remains the most accurate tool for simulating martian magmatic processes if the limitations of the current calibrations are considered [8]. Using this algorithm through the AlphaMELTS front end [7], a large series of calculations can be conducted rapidly, exploring martian melting in circumstances difficult to match experimentally. Although the pMELTS calibration is the most accurate currently available for martian compositions, multiple known issues involving specific oxides or minerals can bias calculations [8]. As the DW composition has been the subject of multiple recent experiments [9-10], these experimental results can be used to constrain and correct systematic biases in pMELTS calculations. In this work I first conducted melting calculations on the DW composition under conditions matching experimental results. I then varied conditions systematically through ranges relevant to Mars to observe associated changes in melt composition. In these latter calculations the DW composition decompresses adiabatically under fractional and nearfractional melting conditions (requiring small fractions of melt present before removal). Melts generated at each step are extracted and integrated to generate final melt compositions representative of fractional martian magmatic products produced given the input conditions. I varied the ending pressure of melting from 1.5 to 0.25 GPa to simulate a range of crustal thicknesses, varied mantle water contents to produce melts from dry up to 1.7 wt. % H2O, and varied mantle potential temperature (Tp) from 1200 to 1500°C; these variables changed melt fraction and the starting pressure of melting accordingly. I followed suggestions in [8] such as treating K as a trace element and limiting the significance of Cr2O3 to deal with limitations in the pMELTS algorithm. Given these and other known limitations, rather than trying to match individual oxide abundances I looked for general trends consistent with those observed in primitive shergottites. I specifically focused on properties noted as representative of martian magmatism, including MgO content/Mg#, CaO/Al2O3 ratio, SiO2 content, and melt fraction.  Results and discussion: As seen in experiments, the DW composition is more fertile than terrestrial depleted mantle [10] and begins melting at greater depths/lower temperatures. pMELTS calculated solidus temperatures are ~75°C lower than those observed by [9-10], likely due to pMELTS underestimating compatibility of alkali elements at high pressures [11].  FeO, MgO, and Mg #: pMELTS calculations were shown to overestimate FeO in experimental liquids of [10] by up to 5 wt. % and MgO by up to 3 wt. % at 2 GPa, but are closer to accurate at 1 GPa. This misfit suggests that pMELTS is overestimating the contribu1674.pdf

tion of olivine to martian magmas at pressure; however, this misfit can be managed by considering these experiments and the available samples. All calculated melts are in equilibrium with olivines consistent with those observed in many near-primary olivine phyric shergottites, with Mg# between 72 and 79 [12]. Melt Mg # increases as expected with increasing Tp and melt fraction. However, at constant Tp decreasing crustal thickness or increasing water content produces only a small change in Mg# (~1 unit) over a doubling of melt fraction. The highest calculated Mg # melts are found with thin crust (<40 km), high water contents, and elevated Tp; all three settings reinforce each other to elevate the Mg # despite a maximum melt fraction of 30%. The highest calculated Mg# melt is not in equilibrium with the highest Mg # olivines observed from Mars (Mg# 85, Yamato 980459) but calculated values approach those observed in Tissint (Mg # 80) [13]. Given the mismatch in melt Fe contents at pressure, pMELTS calculations suggest that olivines similar to those found in shergottites could be generated from DW-like martian mantle with melt fractions <30%, avoiding high (>50%) melt fractions or previously-depleted sources as has been hypothesized previously to explain high-Mg # samples [10]. CaO/Al2O3: Superchondritic CaO/Al2O3 ratios are distinctive of shergottites and led [14] to propose highpressure melting followed by polybaric differentiation as a possible explanation, but [14] also noted that their experiments could not simultaneously match both the Fe contents and the CaO/Al2O3 ratios of shergottites. pMELTS-calculated CaO/Al2O3 ratios in this work are mostly subchondritic, however CaO/Al2O3 ratios do increase if melting occurs at high Tp and proceeds to shallow depths due to exhaustion of clinopyroxene during melting as predicted in experiments [10,14]. While melt CaO/Al2O3 ratios remain subchondritic during all dry melting calculations, superchondritic CaO/Al2O3 ratios were found when final melt H2O contents were >1.4 wt.%; the additional water increased the average pressure of melting due to a greater volume of melting in the garnet field [15]. If focusing of deep, water-rich melt occurred as happens at mid-ocean ridges on Earth [15] it could cause further overrepresentation of water-rich, deep melts and push melt CaO/Al2O3 ratios still higher in eruptive products. H2O-driven, garnet field melting is therefore a possible contributor to superchondritic CaO/Al2O3 ratios.  SiO2: [10] produced experimental melts from the DW composition with similar SiO2 contents to shergottites at pressures ≤ 1 GPa. However, the Mg content of their melts caused them to suggest derivation pressures of >2 GPa for the shergottites, but melts from that pressure were silica-deficient compared to the shergottites. [16] suggested that elevated H2O could account for this discrepancy, but these pMELTS calculations do not support that hypothesis. SiO2 contents of accumulated melts at P ≥ 1 GPa show little sensitivity to H2O contents; any increasing SiO2 in the melt due to H2O is balanced by decreased SiO2 due to elevated melting pressures. However, [10] shows SiO2 contents in pMELTS are underestimated at high pressures and the lack of experiments on hydrous martian mantle limits my ability to estimate the magnitude of this misfit. Water-bearing experiments may still resolve this inability to explain the SiO2 contents of shergottites, but at present the contradiction between elevated shergottite SiO2 contents associated with shallow melting and MgO contents and CaO/Al2O3 ratios associated with deep melting remains.  Implication for mantle temperature: Finally, as an exercise, I inserted these calculated melt compositions into the thermobarometer of [17] now commonly being used on martian compositions. As these melts are fractional, melting is happening over a range of pressures  and temeperatures. We found that this thermobarometer did reproduce changing average melting pressure with decreasing crustal thickness, but crustal thickness decreases propagate through to large estimated melt temperature changes despite constant Tp. This behavior is unsurprising as average melting temperature will in fact decrease during adiabatic decompression. Although this exercise is one algorithm being used to evaluate another with potential for systematic errors, the exercise is useful as it illustrates that calculations of melting pressures and Tp in the martian mantle may be subject to errors if assumptions of equilibrium melting are incorrect.
