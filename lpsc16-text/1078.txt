Introduction: Chondrules are sub-mm sized spherical materials found in chondritic meteorites. They are  mainly composed of silicates (olivine and pyroxene). Precursors of chondrules had once heated and melted at high temperature conditions  (>1800K) and cooled under the existence of gas in the solar nebula. The estimated cooling rate to explain chondrule textures is about 10 - 1000 K/hour [1]. Isotope chronology of chondrules (e.g., 206Pb-207Pb and 26Al-26Mg) revealed that chondrule formation started at the time of CAI formation and lasted for 3 - 5 Myr [2, 3].  Several theories are proposed for the formation process of chondrules [4]. Planetesimal collisions are one of candidates of chondrule formation [5-7] and supported by a magnetized record found in a chondrite [8]. Impact jetting which can occur during planetesimal collisions could produce chondrules, when the impact velocity of planetesimals (vimp) exceeds 2.5 km/s (vc), as shown by shock physics code and a Monte Carlo approach [6]. The previous study suggests that the fractional mass of planetesimals producing chondrules via impact jetting (Fch) is about 1%. We aim to examine whether a heating event generated by impact jetting would be consistent with mineralogical and isotopic data of chondrules. As a first step, here we report two studies of chondrule formation via impact jetting; the one is to investigate the abundance of chondrules formed by impact jetting and their formation timing, both of which are derived from semi-analytical calculations of planetesimal collisions and the subsequent formation of protoplanets. The other is to examine the ejected mass via impact jetting, considering various kinds of collisions by a shock physics code. Methods: We examine the impact jetting scenario in detail by performing semi-analytical calculations based on the formulation of planetary accretion derived from N-body simulations [9, 10]. We considered a massive disk model, which is about three times larger in disk mass than the minimum-mass solar nebular model [11]. As a protoplanet grow via runaway and oligarchic growth, the random velocity of planetesimals (vran) changes and the vimp also changes, as vimp is given by (vran2 + vesc2)0.5 where vesc is the surface escape velocity for planetesimal collisions. We investigate both protoplanet-planetesimal and planetesimal-planetesimal collisions and their effect on chondrule formation, by assuming an initial mass of planetesimals of 1020 kg (~ 500 km in diameter). Previous studies assume that all kinds of planetesimal collisions can be modeled by collisions of a spherical body with a flat plate. This assumption is reasonable for collisions between big protoplanets and small planetesimals. As shown by N-body simulations [12], however, planetesimal-planetesimal collisions are dominant for the initial and intermediate stages of planetary accretion. It is important to model planetesimal-planetesimal collisions by the collisions between spherical bodies rather than spherical-flat ones. We investigate planetesimal-planetesimal collisions to obtain a better understanding of impact jetting and the resultant chondrule formation, using the iSALE-2D shock physics code [1315]. As a bulk material of planetesimals, we choose dunite such that they are similar to ordinary chondrites [16]. The impact velocity of planetesimals (vimp) is parameterized from 1.0 km/s to 3.5 km/s. The diameter of impactor planetesimals is fixed as 10 km and that of target planetesimals varies from 10 km to 50 km. We compute the mass ratio of ejecta with respect to the impactor (Fch) when the velocity of the ejecta is larger than vimp and its temperature exceeds the melting temperature of dunite (1373K), following [6]. Results: Impact jetting triggered by planetary accretion [7]. We found that the impact jetting via planetesimal collisions can produce chondrules. The chondrule forming impact jetting (vimp > vc) occurs when the mass of protoplanet approaching the isolation mass, at which protoplanets have consumed all the planetesimals in their feeding zone. The formation time of chondrules via impact jetting is shown in Fig. 1.  Those times are well below the disk lifetime of 10 Myr [17] and also less than about 3 Myr after the calculations start at 2 au. If the formation of planetesimals and CAIs occurs contemporary, our results suggest that the formation timing of chondrules by impact jetting is roughly consistent with the results inferred from the isotopic studies of chondrules [2, 3].  Figure 2 shows the total mass of chondrules by impact jetting assuming the value of Fch is 0.01 for the two kinds of collisions.  The major chondrule making collision is the protoplanet-planetesimal one. The resultant abundance of chondrules is roughly about Fch of the isolation mass of protoplanets. The planetesimal-planetesimal collision also makes chondrules but it was much lesser than protoplanet-planetesimal one. It is believed that the parent body of chondrites has been located at the current main asteroid belt during chondrule for mation. The total amount of chondrules formed by impact jetting is larger than the mass of the present asteroids [18] as shown in previous work [6], but less than that of the primordial asteroids [19].  The ejected mass for various kinds of collisions. We now discuss the results obtained by the iSALE. Figure 3 shows the value of Fch for different kinds of collisions in which the value of vimp or the size of target planetesimals vary. We find that as vimp increases also Fch increases because of large impact energy for planetesimal collisions with a high impact velocity. Even if  vimp <  vc, chondrules could form for the same sized planetesimal collisions. This means that the critical velocity is slower for planetesimal-planetesimal collisions than protoplanet-planetesimal ones and the formation time of chondrules would be earlier than our results (Fig. 1).  On the other hand, as the diameter of target planetesimals increases with same vimp, producing mass of chondrule becomes smaller. Protoplanets are the target which generates the least mass of chondrules [6]. However, the Fch of planetesimal-planetesimal collisions does not reach twice of that of protoplanet-planetesimal ones. It looks like this result does not change the total mass of condrules significantly (Fig. 2).  Our results using the shock physics codes show that planetesimal-planetesimal collisions could accelerate the formation time of chondrule and also increase the total chondrule mass slightly. The assumption (vc and Fch are the same for any collisions) used in the semi-analytical study of impact jetting leads to the overestimate of the formation time of chondrules and the underestimate of the total chondrule mass. We will overcome this by doing full N-body simulations and examine more accurately timing and mass of chondrules wherein both vc and Fch depend on the properties of collisions [12].
