Introduction:  The martian basaltic crust has been modified by endogenous (e.g., volcanism), exogenous processes (e.g. cosmic bombardment) and by the interactions between the atmosphere, cryosphere and hydrosphere (e.g., weathering, erosion, transportation, deposition) leading to different surface materials. Even if the main processes responsible of the Mars formation and evolution are well-identified from orbital and in situ investigations, the mechanisms still remain poorly known. For instance, the surface is dominated by basaltic materials but the crystallization mode and the volatile content are still poorly constrained. Former studies also revealed that liquid water played an important role in the surface evolution but fundamental questions on the origin, duration and intensity of those wet events have been highly debated, especially in the clay-bearing units (1-5).  To identify and characterize the geological processes, geomorphological and geochemical clues are commonly used. However, information about the surface microtexture such as the grain size, morphology (e.g., shape, surface roughness) and internal structure can also be used as a tracer of the geological processes. For instance, in an erosion/transportation context, a coherent material is eroded into rough grains, that can be transported by wind or by water, polishing their surface and reducing their size. In the volcanic context, the rapid quenching of liquid magmas produces amorphous glasses, whereas the relatively slow cooling produces a finely crystallized microlithic texture.  Direct in situ imagery can be used to characterize the grain microtexture and give constraints on the local geology but is limited to the rover landing site and along the rover path. Microtexture can also be indirectly estimated from remote photometric measurements by studying the manner in which the solar light is scattered by the surface materials). It has been experimented from in situ measurements from Panoramic Camera measurements on-board Mars Exploration Rover (6,7) and from orbital measurements from High Resolution Stereo Camera on-board Mars Express (8) and from Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) on-board Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (9-11). Methodology:  Taking into account the capability of CRISM on-board MRO to provide multi-angle images (eleven images with varied emission angles from 0-70°) (12) we estimate the surface bidirectional reflectance after aerosols correction using the Multi-angle Approach for Retrieval of Surface Reflectance from CRISM Observations technique (MARS-ReCO) (13).  Fernando et al. (10,11) proposed an approach to estimate the photometric parameters of the surface materials in terms of structural information by using the Hapke photometric model (14) in a Bayesian framework that considers: the single scattering albedo ω which depends on the grain size and the composition, the macroscopic roughness θ-bar which depends on the roughness from the particle to several centimeters and the particle phase function with a 2-term Henyey-Greenstein function that includes the asymmetry parameter b and the backscattering fraction c which qualitatively depends ont the grain morphology and its internal structures (15,16). Maps of the surface photometric parameters are created and are estimated at 750 nm with a spatial resolution of ~200m/pixel.  Site selection and surface photometric results: The photometric parameters are estimated for six sites having various geological contexts, with favorable geometric and atmospheric conditions, avoiding the dust area (17) and with various mineralogy (alteration phases like phyllosilicates precipitation phases like sulfates and salts (e.g., 1,2,4,5), and basaltic materials (e.g., 18). We also provide geological maps estimated from morphological and mineralogical clues in order to discuss the surface photometric parameters regarding the geological units. The photometric results are compared to published laboratory photometric measurements on artificial and natural samples (15,16) to link the surface photometric parameters in term of surface microtexture (e.g., grain morphology, internal structure).  Discussion: The photometric results show a high diversity of surface scattering behaviors (from a broad and backward scattering behavior to narrow and forward scattering behavior) that suggests a high diversity of surface micro texture (Figure 1). A narrow forward scattering behavior has been detected for the first time from orbital data and observed in peculiar regions dominated by salt and clay materials. Hence the martian photometric results suggest that Mars experimented varied geological processes which are still preserved in the material microtextures. The martian sites that we selected show distinct photometric units which fit with the geological units. Thus we put forward the hypothesis that these units can not only be defined by their morphology and mineralogy but also by the photometric properties which they inherited from various processes. In particular, we showed that some areas with clay-bearing materials and salts have a narrow forward scattering behavior. 1665.pdf

The comparison with laboratory measurements suggests that the salt-bearing material behave similarly to clear crystal grains. It suggests that if the salt is dominant in the material, no external contributions (e.g., detritic materials) and no multiple dissolution and recrystallization episodes may have contaminated the medium by impurities in the salt crystals and the matrix. As for the clay-bearing materials that also match the same photometric analog, they may be composed of smooth surface grains. This microtexture could indicate that those materials may have been sufficiently blunted by an aqueous or/and aeolian process implying a long transportation. We also showed that the basaltic materials have a broader and more backward scattering behavior. The comparison with laboratory measurements suggests that the basaltic materials may be grains with a high internal heterogeneity. This grain property is compatible with a formation from a relatively slow cooling rate (crystallization) and/or from high gas exsolution during the magma ascent phase.
