DENSITY RETRIEVALS OF THE MARS HYDROGEN EXOSPHEREFROM MAVEN SOLAR LYMAN-ALPHA OCCULTATIONS E.M.B. Thiemann1,M.S. Chaffin1, F.G Eparvier1, D. Bhattacharyya2 and J.T. Clarke2, 1Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics,University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, 80303 (thiemann@lasp.colorado.edu)2Center for Space Physics, Boston University, Boston, MA, 02215Introduction: Although its primary mission is tocharacterize the solar Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) inputinto the Mars atmosphere, the MAVEN-EUVM [1] instrument has proven sufficiently sensitive to characterize the Mars hydrogen (H) exosphere from 200 km toabove 6000 km via solar H Lyman-α occultation measurements. In 2015, we presented early results of EUVMsolar occultations which did not conclusively constrainthe absolute density values but did suggest solar or seasonally driven variability [2]. Here, we present absolutedensity retrievals of the Mars H exosphere spanning thefirst year of the MAVEN mission.Because the Mars H exosphere originates from dissociated water molecules, it carries information about thehistory of water at Mars [3]. Past surface water levelscan be directly estimated from the contemporary H exosphere if the sources of variability and escape to spaceare adequately constrained; and the historical space environment is properly accounted for. Regular occultation measurements of the H exosphere made by MAVENEUVM can provide a present-day baseline for the absolute magnitude of H contained in the exosphere, andcharacterize relative changes due to both seasonal factorsand solar influences.Previous Observations: The Martian H exospherewas first characterized by the Mariner 6 and 7 fly-bymissions which showed a single population of H with atemperature of 350 K and a density of 3 × 104 cm−3at 250 km [4]. It took over three decades for the Hexosphere to be further characterized with independentH density retrievals from the SPICAM and ASPERAinstruments on-board Mars Express [5,6]. The H exosphere has also been characterized using the HubbleSpace Telescope (HST) during campaigns in 2007 and2014 [7,8]. And currently, the MAVEN IUVS instrument is making regular measurements of the H exosphere, revealing new structure [9], with absolute density retrievals pending final instrument calibration. Theprevious H exosphere measurements have measured theoptically thick H Lyman-α emissions directly; and radiative transfer models, with inherent density and temperature degeneracy, are needed to invert the measuredbrightnesses. Unlike the initial Mariner results, the SPICAM and HST measured and model-predicted brightnesses are improved if a hot component is added. Andthe HST retrievals, in particular, show a seasonal dependence on the hot component. However, unlike Venus,which has a population of hot H in its exosphere [10],the source of a hot H population at Mars has yet to beconclusively explained. Further, both the SPICAM andHST campaigns have revealed unexpected variability inthe exospheric H density [7,11] which can have substantial implications for escape of H to space and past surfacewater estimates based on current conditions. Given thatthe latest measurements yield new questions in additionto answers, it is clear that the H exosphere is still poorlyunderstood and a need for additional measurements exists.MAVEN-EUVM Solar Occultations: When accounting for signal loss due to atmospheric absorptionand/or scattering, the local irradiance, E(~rscλ), incidenton an EUVM channel is related to the irradiance at thetop of the atmosphere, E(λ, rtop), asE(~rsc, λ) = E(rtop, λ)e−Σiσi(λ)ℵi(r). (1)Here, σi(λ) is the wavelength dependent absorptionand/or scattering cross-section for the ith species and thecorresponding column density, ℵi, is given byℵi =∫losn(r)dz′, (2)where the integral is over line-of-sight defined by the z’axis and n(r) is a spherically symmetric density functionof radial coordinate, r.We can rewrite equation ?? in terms of the measuredcounts,N , and instrument solar Lyman-α response function, R(λ), asN(~rsc) =∫ly−αR(λ)N(rtop, λ)e−σH(λ)ℵH(r)dλ, (3)where we assume all signal loss is due to resonant scattering with cross-section, σH .Onion peeling inversion of an occultation scan discretizes the atmosphere into layers of constant n(r) tosolve equation ?? for successively deeper layers whilefeeding back the computed density of the upper layers.Figure ?? shows the onion peel inversion geometry andshould be referred to in the discussion that follows.ℵ(rsc, rh) can be shown to be related to n(ri) asℵ(rsc, rh) = 2∫ rh,maxrhn(r)rdr√r2 − r2h+ ℵtop(rsc, rh),(4)2353.pdf

Using Lh,i,we can write the matrix equation for the column densitiesat each line-of-sight,~ℵ(rsc, rh)− ℵtop(rsc, rh) = ¯¯L~n(ri) (7)which can be inverted for the n(r) using standard methods.In practice, equation ?? is first solved by finding thevalue of ℵ(rh) which minimizes the difference betweenthe predicted and measured counts where N(rtop,λ) istaken to be the maximum signal in an occultation scan.OnceN(rsc, rh) is known for every value of rh, equation?? can be solved iteratively to correct for ℵtop(rsc, rh).Because equation ?? depends on the H temperature, TH ,through σH , solving for n(r) requires additional iteration. Once a solution for n(r) converges on a stable Th,a numerical Monte-Carlo simulation of the H exosphereis run initialized with the retrieved densities and temperatures to compute the final σH(rh, rsc) which are in turnused for a final iteration of the density retrieval.Figure 2: Initial H density retrievals, Orbit 927. Heightis measured from Mars center.As an example, the initial inversion steps are shownin Figure ??, where densities corresponding with assumed H temperatures of 275 and 375 K are shownfor MAVEN orbit 927. Unlike inversion from emissionspectroscopy, no model for the shape of the exosphere isneeded to retrieve the density profiles aside from spherical symmetry, allowing temperature and density to bedecoupled. Tuning the assumed cross-sections results ina higher order refinement of the density profile, but notorder-of-magnitude changes. In our study, we explorethe inversion’s sensitivity to assumed inputs, namely thesolar spectral shape and σH , to quantify the retrieval uncertainty. We then report absolute density retrievals withuncertainties for over a year of EUVM measurements atMars and discuss possible causes of observed variability.References [1]Eparvier, F.G., Chamberlin, P.C., Woods,T.N. & Thiemann, E.M.B.
