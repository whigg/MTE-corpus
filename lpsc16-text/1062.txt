CONVEXO-CONCAVE SHAPE OF CELESTIAL BODIES AND NATURAL RESPONSE TO COMPRESSION AND SQUEEZING  SUBSIDING HEMISPHERE IN FORM OF BULGING (VESTA, CERES, HYPERION, PLUTO); G. G. Kochemasov, IGEM of Russian Academy of  Sciences, 35 Staromonetny, 119017, Moscow, RF, kochem.36@mail.ru  Introduction:   The first theorem of the wave planetology [3] states that all cosmic bodies moving in keplerian non-round obits are subjected to warping action by standing waves of different lengths. They appear due to regularly changing accelerations. Among them the fundamental wave 1 is the longest and strongest (most amplitudinal). It deforms bodies in such way that one hemisphere-segment bulge up and the opposite one presses in (look at the Earth’s form) – a dichotomous structure develops (Fig. 1). The most recent cosmic experiments (Dawn and New Horizons of NASA) confirm this ubiquitous regularity (Fig. 2, 3, 7, 8, 9). Two most important tectonic consequences follow. The bulging hemispheres of increased planetary radius are intensively “cracked”, rifted; the subsiding ones of diminished radius are squeezed, folded that requires squeezing out some extra material (new space in a sphere of smaller radius must hold more voluminous material of previous position). Thus, various uplifts in the subsided hemisphere-segment develop (plateaus, mountains, budges, ridges, volcanoes [2, 3] (Fig. 1). Some impressive examples follow in icy and rocky bodies (Figs. 2-11).      Vestan Reasilvia Basin (obviously tectonic not impact feature) has the central mountain – the highest volcanic peak in the Solar system (Fig. 2). Now being studied by Dawn Ceres shows obvious dichotomy (Fig. 3). Its subsided hemisphere has a wide mountainous elevation in the middle emphasized by a strong negative Bouguer anomaly [1]. Convexo-concave shape is vividly presented in the Hyperion form (Fig. 4-6). And again, a prominent peak develops in the middle of the subsided hemisphere (Fig. 5-6). The southern hemisphere of Pluto, not illuminated by Sun, practically is not studied by images. Still, a belt of black subsided areas of the equatorial zone gradually passes into less black (whitish) terrains in the southern direction (Fig. 89) This transition probably marks beginning of elevated areas in the middle. Some hints on this elevation are in the lighter tones amidst black not illuminated terrains of the southern hemisphere (Fig.10-11).  1. 2 Fig. 1.
