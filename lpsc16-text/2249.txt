 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF LUNAR VOLCANIC TERRAINS USING LRO DATA.  Sriram Saran, Anup Das, Dharmendra Pandey, Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad 380015, India (saran@sac.isro.gov.in)  Introduction: Basaltic volcanism was once common on the Moon and is responsible for the lunar maria that covers 17% of the lunar surface [1], mostly filling the near-side basins. Volcanic features on the Moon include domes, cones, rilles, collapsed lava tubes, depressions, and pyroclastic deposits [e.g. 2, 3]. As indicated in numerous previous analyses, many possible lunar landing sites are in volcanic regions, so it is very important to ascertain their physical properties prior to landing and in-situ sampling. The lunar volcanic domes are particularly interesting as they are shown to have a variety of geologic properties [e.g. 2, 3, 4]. Here, we utilize data sets from LRO including the Mini-RF radar, LROC, and the Diviner Lunar Radiometer, to investigate the morphology, composition, and structure of some volcanic domes and related depressions, with the goal of better characterizing the style of regional volcanism that led to the formation of these constructs. Data and Methods: We analyze multiplewavelength data available from the LRO in order to use the differences in effective scatterer size and penetration depth to further constrain near-surface roughness, abundance of rocks and flow unit scales near the domes. We use Mini-RF radar data (S-band; 15 ×30 m resolution) to study the decimeter- to meter-scale rock abundance, at the surface and buried within the probing range of the radar signal. The 12.6-cm radar signals penetrate up to a meter or two in typical mare regolith, with shallower probing for more ilmenite-rich source material, and are sensitive to surface and buried rocks about ~ 2 cm and larger in diameter [4]. The CPR derived from the radar data can be used as an indicator of surface and subsurface roughness on the scale of the radar wavelength [5]. Previous studies have shown that differences in the abundance of the TiO2 content play a major role in modulating the same-sense circular (SC) diffuse radar echoes (and hence CPR) through changes in the loss tangent of the regolith [e.g. 4, 5, 6]. To understand the variation of CPR with TiO2 content, we use TiO2 maps derived from the global LROC WAC UV-Vis data (at 64 ppd ~ 473 m/pix) using the methods of [7] for comparison with radar data products. The WAC global datasets are preferred for producing TiO2 maps because it is sensitive in the UV-Vis spectral range [8].  Radar can penetrate up to ~10 times the wavelength (depending on the loss tangent) while thermal infrared data probes the upper few centimeters of the surface where embedded rocks influence the thermal signature [3]. We use thermal infrared data obtained from the LRO Diviner radiometer which provides a means of estimating the surface rock abundance (RA), expressed as the fraction of a given field of view occupied by rocks large enough to remain warm through the lunar night [9]. The RA map is sensitive to rocks >1 m in size and is available at 128 ppd (~ 235 m/pix).          Analysis & Discussion: In general, the lunar volcanic domes are topographic rises with irregular surfaces and outlines. Some domes are geographically associated with sinuous rilles, rille-like features, collapse pits, and/or graben, while some of them are associated with volcanic cones and/or vents [2]. A list of lunar volcanic features studied in this work along with their location (centre coordinates) and average values (with one standard deviation) of CPR, TiO2 (wt %) and RA are given in Table 1. The CPR values are not collected from regions influenced by topography, i.e. near the radar-facing slopes of the domes.  Sosignes & Honoris regions: Sosignes graben (Sosignes-1 in Table-1) is a large collapse pit (2800 m wide left-to-right and 300 m deep) floored with an unusual terrain similar to the features observed in [10], while Sosignes-2, 3 are domes. These three features are observed to have similar CPR values but different TiO2 content and RA values. Near Sosignes-3 dome, moderate to high CPR values of 0.3-0.9 are observed while the RA values are very low, around 0.007.

The CPR data is stretched from 0 (purple) to 1.0 (red), and is overlaid on total backscatter image. Diviner data is stretched from 0(purple) to 0.05 (red) and is overlaid on a LROC WAC mosaic.

Two possible local settings might produce this effect: the contamination from ejecta deposits of a fresh crater adjacent to this dome could result in increase of CPR values; or the presence of rugged flow morphology beneath a meter or two of mantling regolith which is undetected in the RA map. Three domes near Sinus Honoris region (Sinus Honoris-1, 2, 3) also revealed differences in RA estimates with respect to the observed CPR values. The RA (overlaid on LROC WAC) and CPR maps of Sosignes graben and Honoris-2 dome are shown in Fig. 1, which highlights these variations. Marius Hills region: The Marius hills dome studied in this work is towards the east of Marius crater and has not been covered in previous studies [e.g. 2, 5]. The central part of this dome is characterized by relatively higher values of CPR and RA indicating greater near-surface rock abundance or more rugged terrain than typical mare lava flows. Some rilles near this dome show evidence for pyroclastic deposits, including optically dark mantled terrain and low radar CPR values. Near Rima Suess region above this dome, the Mini-RF radar data reveal a somewhat greater spatial extent of pyroclastics than is visible in optical and RA datasets.  Rima Prinz and Harbinger region: The PrinzHarbinger area is a constellation region of interest because there is a concentration of sinuous rilles, massifs, and mare filled impact craters, as well as potential lunar resource. The Prinz volcanic dome analyzed in this study is associated with moderate to high S-band radar CPR values and very low RA values, except near young, radar bright impact craters. This suggests the presence of minimal decimeter-scale and larger rocks and/or young mare flows within the upper 1-2 m at this region.  Collapsed lava tube segments may provide access to the subsurface, which act as possible sites to collect rock samples that remain unaltered due to surface weathering on the Moon. One such lava tube is located to the west of Montes Harbinger, and to the east of the Rimae Prinz region. The Mini-RF radar signal was able to penetrate the regolith and reveals for the first time a buried lava flow channel between two collapsed segments of this lava tube. An m-chi decomposition image generated from the Mini-RF data (Fig. 2a) indicates that the lava flow has fairly uniform radar brightness and is beneath the regolith up to a depth of ~1 m. The melt flows are barely visible even in a high resolution LROC NAC image (0.5 m/pix) of the same region (Fig. 2b) and have been smoothed over by a regolith coating. Conclusion: From this analysis, it is apparent there is not a correlation between TiO2 content and CPR values at the locations studied in this work. Even though much variation is not observed in the CPR values, the correlation between CPR and RA values near some regions breakdown significantly, implying a different near-surface structure at the different sites.
