On this basis, these 'magmatic' iron meteorites (e.g., groups IIAB and IIIAB) are thought to represent samples  of  the  metallic  cores  of  small  differentiated planetary bodies. The process of fractional crystallization during core solidification should in principle also have induced an isotopic fractionation between earlyand late-crystallized irons from a given core.  During crystallization  some  elements  are  continuously  removed from the liquid metal and so even a small isotopic  fractionation  between  solid  and  liquid  metal would lead to a large overall fractionation as crystallization  proceeded.  Thus,  the  identification  of  stable isotope  fractionation  trends  within  a  given  group  of magmatic irons would provide strong evidence for the formation of these samples through fractional crystallization of metallic magma. However, until now no stable  isotope  Rayleigh  fractionation  trends  have  been identified in iron meteorites. Here we use Ru stable isotopes to investigate the possible  isotope  fractionation during solidification of planetesimal cores. Ruthenium is a highly siderophile element and as such has been quantitatively removed into the cores  of  differentiated bodies.  Thus,  the Ru isotopic composition of the bulk core should be similar to that of the undifferentiated body. Moreover,  Ru is strongly fractionated  within most  iron  groups,  where early-crystallized irons have high and late-crystallized samples have low Ru contents.  This  strong chemical fractionation makes Ru a promising element to search for  isotope  fractionation  induced  by core  crystallization. For this study we selected six IIAB and seven IIIAB irons covering almost the entire crystallization sequence of both groups. We also analyzed four ordinary chondrites to assess the Ru isotopic composition of undifferentiated material. Additional analyses of IVA and IVB iron meteorites are currently underway. Analytical Methods: Iron meteorite samples (0.05 to 0.2 g) were spiked with a  98Ru-101Ru double spike before digestion with 20 ml of reverse aqua regia in closed Teflon beakers at 120°C for 24 hours. Ordinary chondrites (0.5 g) were spiked prior to Carius tube digestion using reverse aqua regia at 220°C for 48 hours [2]. After digestion, Ru was separated from the sample matrix using a combination of cation exchange chromatography and a SavillexTM PFA distillation unit; the Ru cut from the cation exchange column is oxidized in a  solution  of  H2SO4  and  CrO3,  and  volatile  Ru was trapped in H2O2 [3]. The Ru isotope measurements were conducted using a Neptune Plus MC-ICPMS at Münster combined with an ESI Apex-IR desolvating system. All measurements  were  performed  using  200  ppb  Ru  solutions. Each  measurement  consisted  of  an  on-peak  baseline measurement on a solution blank (40×4.2s)  followed by 50 cycles of 4.2s of sample or standard measurements.  Isobaric  interferences  were  monitored  using 97Mo and  105Pd. The data reduction was made off-line using the Double Spike Toolbox [4]. The Ru isotope results are given in δ102/99Ru as the permil deviation from an  Alfa  Aesar  plasma  standard  solution (Lot#61300952).  The external reproducibility (2 s.d.) of the Ru isotope measurement is 0.04 ‰ for δ102/99Ru. Results: The Ru stable isotope compositions measured for ordinary chondrites and iron meteorites are shown in Fig. 1. The four ordinary chondrites have indistinguishable δ102/99Ru averaging at ca. -0.02 ‰. Iron meteorites, in contrast, show variable δ102/99Ru with values up to ~0.85 ‰. In Fig. 1, the IIAB and IIIAB samples are sorted by decreasing Ru content from bottom to top within both groups. Of note, samples with high Ru contents have Ru stable isotopic compositions similar to ordinary chondrites, while samples with lower Ru contents  display  increasingly  heavier  compositions (Fig. 1).

Errors bars for individual data points are similar to or smaller than symbol sizes. For irons, the Ru concentration (ppm) is given in square brackets.  Discussion:  The  correlation  of  δ102/99Ru with  Ru contents observed for both the IIAB and IIIAB irons (Fig.  1)  indicates  that  solidification  of  planetesimal cores  led  to  Ru  isotope  fractionation,  most  likely caused by incremental extraction of Ru from the metallic liquid into the crystallizing metal. As such, the Ru isotopic data are consistent with formation of the IIAB and IIIAB irons by fractional crystallization of metallic melt.  During  core  crystallization  Ru  is  compatible, meaning  that  early-crystallized  irons  from  a  given group have high, while late-crystallized samples have low Ru contents.  Thus,  the higher  δ102/99Ru for  irons with the lowest Ru content of each group (Fig. 1) indicate that the Ru isotopic composition of the remaining liquid became increasingly heavy during core crystallization; this isotopically heavy melt is then sampled by the late-crystallized irons. To  produce  an isotopically heavy metallic liquid, the solids must be isotopically light compared to the melt they crystallized from. However, the isotope fractionation factor between solid and liquid metal probably is small, because early-crystallized IIAB and IIIAB irons have δ102/99Ru values indistinguishable from those of ordinary chondrites (Fig.  1).  The δ102/99Ru of ordinary chondrites in turn is a likely bulk composition of iron meteorite  parent  bodies and,  because almost the entire Ru resides in the core, of the parental cores of the  IIAB  and  IIIAB  irons.  Thus,  early-crystallized irons should have a very similar Ru isotopic composition compared to the bulk composition; this is consistent  with  the  indistinguishable  δ102/99Ru observed  for early-crystallized IIAB and IIIAB irons and ordinary chondrites (Fig. 1). To quantitatively assess as to whether the observed δ102/99Ru variations are consistent with fractional crystallization of a metallic melt, we modeled the isotopic effects  using  the  Rayleigh  fractionation  equation: 102Ru/99Ru = (102Ru/99Ru)0 ×f (α-1), where (102Ru/99Ru)0 is the initial Ru isotopic composition of the metallic melt and f is the fraction of Ru remaining in the melt at the timing of crystallization for each sample. To estimate f for each sample, a model for the chemical fractionation of Ru during crystallization is needed.  Thus, the isotope fractionation factors α determined in the modeling may be  different  for  different  chemical  fractionation models.  Nevertheless,  a  correlation  between  isotope fractionation  and  chemical  fraction  of  Ru remaining should always be obtained if the Ru isotope data reflect Rayleigh fractionation during solidification of metallic melt. In a first step, we used a simplified chemical fractionation model, where the partition coefficient for Ru does not change during crystallization. We further assumed that  the  starting  composition  is  given  by  the mean  δ102/99Ru  =  -0.02  ‰  determined  for  ordinary chondrites (see above). The model results show that the measured Ru isotope fractionations for both the IIAB and IIIAB irons can be well explained by Rayleigh isotope fractionation during crystallization of an initially molten core (Fig. 2; Fig. 3).

Conclusions: The heavy Ru isotope compositions of  late-crystallized  IIAB  and  IIIAB  irons  combined with the correlation of δ102/99Ru with Ru content is consistent with the formation of these irons by fractional crystallization of metallic melt. The Ru isotopic data, therefore, provide strong support for the interpretation of the IIAB and IIIAB irons as fragments of the metallic cores of differentiated planetesimals.
