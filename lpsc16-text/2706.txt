Ara V Nefian1, Uland Wong1,Oleg Alexandrov1, and Randy Kirk2, 1SGT, NASA Ames Research Center, MS 245-3, Moffett Field, CA, USA (ara.nefian@nasa.gov),2United States Geological Survey Photoclinometric techniques can process in a highly automatic manner the wealth of orbital images retrived by NASA missions and generate high-resolution extensive coverage digital elevation models (DEM) that are extremely detailed and relevant, even when compared to the most advanced stereo reconstruction techniques. In essence this increase in resolution is possible because the photoclinometric technique extracts the elevation information from image metadata and local pixel information rather than from correspondences between image blocks in the stereo pairs. The highly accurate and increased resolution maps are used in planetary science, mission operations, rover navigation and localization. Introduction Photoclinometric reconstruction (or shape from shading reconstruction) of the imagery attempts to estimate the parameters of the image formation model that include surface albedo and elevation. Each pixel of the orbital images is formed by a combination of many factors, including albedo, terrain slope, exposure time, shadowing, and viewing and illumination angles. Image Formation, Modeling and Reconstruction The shape-from-shading problem is formulated as finding a set of 3D points that minimize the cost function Q = ∑k ∑i,j∈M (Ikij −AijRkijT k)2 (1) where k is the number of images, i and j are the row and column number respectively, I is the image, Aij is the albedo corresponding to pixel ij and M is the set of pixels remaining after the binary shadow mask. The reflectance model Rij is given by Rkij = (1− L(α)) cos i+ 2L(α) cos i cos i+ cos e . (2) where L(α) = 1 +Aα+Bα2 + Cα3. (3) and α is the phase angle measured in degrees, A, B, C a set of goven coefficients, e and i are the emission and incidence angles respectively. The optimal set of 3D points Mij are estimated using the iterative Gauss Newton method for the cost function Q described in Equation 1. Given a 3D point Mij corresponding to pixel ij, at consecutive iterations its 3D position is re-estimated according to one of the following rules Mij = M (0) ij + ∆mij M(0) ij M (0)ij  . (4) Mij = O + ∆mij vij vij  (5) where mij is a corection factor estimated iteratively through Gauss Newton algorithm. Equation 4 corresponds to a parametrization along the height in a DEM representation while Equation 5 corresponnds to a parametrization along the rays vij from the optical center of the image (O) through each pixel at location ij in the image. The increment ∆mij is the solution to the normal equations: e = B∆mij (6) where e = JT r B = JTJ and r is the residual vector and J the Jacobian matrix as described next. Let the image be arranged row-wise in a vector such that l = i ×W + j where W is the image width. Then the residual vector and Jacobian matrix can be written as r =  . . .
