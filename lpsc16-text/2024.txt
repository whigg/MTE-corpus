THE  LUNAR  CHRONOLOGY  CAN  NOT  BE  DIRECTLY  SCALED  TO  THE  ASTEROID  BELT.D. P. O'Brien1, S. Marchi2, P. M. Schenk3, 1Planetary Science Institute, 1700 E. Ft.

[1]  construct  acrater  chronology curve for  Vesta  assuming  that  (a)the  primary source region  of impactors  in  the innerSolar System is the main asteroid belt, and (b) that theLunar chronology curve [2] can be scaled to Vesta using the current impact rate in the asteroid belt and appropriate adjustments for the crater  production function due to the different impact velocities on Vesta andthe Moon. A similar  approach is also being used forCeres [3]. Here we show that directly scaling the Lunar curve to Vesta and other asteroids in this mannerimplies  an  extremely  intense  collisional  history  forVesta, and the entire asteroid belt, that is inconsistentwith a range of fundamental constraints.“Lunar-Like Chronology”: Figure 1 shows the Lunarchronology curve for 1 km craters  from [2]  and  thecorresponding curve for Vesta calculated in [1], whichthey refer  to  as  the  “Lunar-like  chronology.”  Thesecurves show the total cumulative number of craters Nthat  would be produced from a time T in the past tothe present  day (T=0),  and can be used to convert  acrater density into an absolute surface age.  The curvesare dashed prior to 4.1 Ga, as there are no good radiometric  constraints  from Lunar  samples for that  timeperiod, although as we will show next, it is possible toset a minimum value for the Vesta curve based on asteroid belt constraints.Figure 1A More Realistic Assessment:  We start with the derivative of the curves in Fig. 1, which gives the craterproduction rate dN/dT at time T. Figure 2 shows thenormalized  crater  production  rate  dN*/dT,  which  isnormalized to 1 at the present time, for the Lunar-likecurve from Fig.  1  as  well  as  the  model  chronologycurve for Vesta proposed by [4] and a linear chronology curve (where the mass of the asteroid belt remainsconstant  with  time).  Because of the assumption  thatthe  primary impactors  are  asteroids  themselves,  thisnormalized impact rate must also be directly proportional  to  the  mass  of  the  asteroid  belt.  Hence,  thecurves in Fig. 2 also give M*, the normalized mass ofthe asteroid belt (equal to 1 at the present time). Whilethe Lunar  chronology may be unconstrained prior  to~4.1  Ga,  the  asteroid  belt  chronology can  be  constrained by the fact that the asteroid belt must actuallyexist prior to 4.1 Ga, and at the very least would havehad a constant  mass prior  to 4.1 Ga. Hence, the redcurve in Fig. 2 is flat prior to 4.1 Ga.Figure 2Figure  2  illustrates  one  of  that  main  problemswith the Lunar-like chronology, namely that the asteroid belt would have to be at least ~1000x its currentmass for the first 400 Myr of Solar System history, incontrast  to the model chronology curve of [4], wherethe belt undergoes an early rapid dynamical depletionevent.  Given  reasonable estimates  for the collisionalstrength  of  asteroidal  material,  such  a  massive  beltwould  be  substantially  depleted  through  collisionalgrinding in much less than 400 Myr [eg. 5-8]. Addingmore mass would not resolve this issue, as that wouldalso increase the rate of collisional  grinding.  Simplyput,  the Lunar-like chronology requires a history forthe asteroid belt that would not be stable against collisional grinding.Integrating the curves in Fig. 2 gives the normalized chronology curves N*(T) shown in Fig. 3, whichare similar to those shown in Fig. 1, although they aresize-independent,  have  units  of  time  (Ga),  and  arenormalized to 1 at T=1 Ga. If the current  productionrate f(D) of a given size crater is known at the present,multiplying  f(D)  by N*(T)  will  give  the  number  ofthose craters formed since time T in the past.2024.pdf

Figure 3Another  interpretation of the curves in  Fig.  3 isthat  they show the  equivalent  time  Tequiv that  wouldhave to elapse in a constant-mass asteroid belt to givethe number of impacts (and the amount of collisionalevolution) that occur in time T. For the linear chronology curve, where the belt has a constant mass, Tequiv =T by definition. For other cases, where the mass of thebelt is initially larger than the present time, Tequiv > T.[6,7] fit a collisional model of the main belt to awide range of constraints including the main-belt andNEA size distributions, asteroid families, and the cosmic-ray  exposure  ages  of  meteorites,  and  find  thatthese constraints are consistent with Tequiv of at most afew tens of Gyr, eg. a small initial mass of the asteroidbelt, or more likely a rapid depletion of a larger initialmass.  From  Fig.  3,  the  Lunar-like  curve  implies  aTequiv of hundreds of Gyr, due to the large and  longlived initial  mass of the belt that  is required,  and isthus wildly inconsistent with the constraints of [6,7]. Figure 4 shows the production rate of craters 200km in diameter and larger on Vesta for the chronologies of [1] and [4]. The curves are offset by a factor ofa few because [1] and [4] assume somewhat differentcrater production functions f(D). While [1] claim thatnothing can be said about the cratering rate on Vestaprior to 4.1 Ga, it is immediately clear that  even themost conservative estimate of a constant-mass asteroidbelt prior to 4.1 Ga implies substantial early crateringin  the Lunar-like chronology. From T=4.5 Ga to thepresent,  roughly 60 basins larger than  200 km in diameter would be expected over the surface of Vesta. Atleast ten of these would be expected to be the size ofVenenia (~400 km) and Rheasilvia (~500 km), or evenlarger.  This is grossly inconsistent  with the observedlarge crater  distribution  on Vesta,  which  is found tohave approximately 5 and 10 craters larger than  200km and 100 km, respectively [1,9]. While a few largecraters may have formed in the past and been erased(perhaps  by the  subsequent  formation  of  Rheasilviaand Venenia), there is no evidence that several tens ofbasins  from  200  km  to  Rheasilvia-sized  and  largercould have formed. For example,  the northern  hemisphere  lacks  any  large-scale  diogenite  signatures  asseen in the Rheasilvia basin [10] and has a shape closeto hydrostatic equilibrium (unlike the south which isheavily deformed by Rheasilvia and Venenia) [11].Figure 4Summary: Schmedemann  et  al.  [1] apply the Lunarchronology to Vesta using a simple scaling approachthat does not take into account the actual physical behavior of the asteroid belt that  would be required, inparticular ignoring processes prior to 4.1 Ga.  Adopting the simple assumption that the mass of the aster oid belt must have at the very least been constant priorto that time, we show that the Lunar-like chronology:(1) Requires an asteroid belt that has a mass of at least1000x the current  mass for the first  400 Myr, whichwould not survive against collisional grinding; (2) Implies a high level of collisional evolution in the asteroid belt that is inconsistent with a wide range of constraints  as  shown by [6,7];  and  (3)  Would  result  inmany times more large (>200 km) impact basins onthe surface of Vesta than are actually observed. We argue that the Lunar-like chronology of [1] is not a validapproach for estimating cratering ages on Vesta, Ceresor any other bodies in the asteroid belt.       Acknowledgements: D. P.
