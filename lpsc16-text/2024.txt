 THE  LUNAR  CHRONOLOGY  CAN  NOT  BE  DIRECTLY  SCALED  TO  THE  ASTEROID  BELT. D. P. O'Brien1, S. Marchi2, P. M. Schenk3, 1Planetary Science Institute, 1700 E. Ft.

[1]  construct  a crater  chronology curve for  Vesta  assuming  that  (a) the  primary source region  of impactors  in  the inner Solar System is the main asteroid belt, and (b) that the Lunar chronology curve [2] can be scaled to Vesta using the current impact rate in the asteroid belt and appropriate adjustments for the crater  production function due to the different impact velocities on Vesta and the Moon. A similar  approach is also being used for Ceres [3]. Here we show that directly scaling the Lunar curve to Vesta and other asteroids in this manner implies  an  extremely  intense  collisional  history  for Vesta, and the entire asteroid belt, that is inconsistent with a range of fundamental constraints. "Lunar-Like Chronology": Figure 1 shows the Lunar chronology curve for 1 km craters  from [2]  and  the corresponding curve for Vesta calculated in [1], which they refer  to  as  the  "Lunar-like  chronology."  These curves show the total cumulative number of craters N that  would be produced from a time T in the past to the present  day (T=0),  and can be used to convert  a crater density into an absolute surface age.  The curves are dashed prior to 4.1 Ga, as there are no good radiometric  constraints  from Lunar  samples for that  time period, although as we will show next, it is possible to set a minimum value for the Vesta curve based on asteroid belt constraints. Figure 1 A More Realistic Assessment:  We start with the derivative of the curves in Fig. 1, which gives the crater production rate dN/dT at time T. Figure 2 shows the normalized  crater  production  rate  dN*/dT,  which  is normalized to 1 at the present time, for the Lunar-like curve from Fig.  1  as  well  as  the  model  chronology curve for Vesta proposed by [4] and a linear chronology curve (where the mass of the asteroid belt remains constant  with  time).  Because of the assumption  that the  primary impactors  are  asteroids  themselves,  this normalized impact rate must also be directly proportional  to  the  mass  of  the  asteroid  belt.  Hence,  the curves in Fig. 2 also give M*, the normalized mass of the asteroid belt (equal to 1 at the present time). While the Lunar  chronology may be unconstrained prior  to ~4.1  Ga,  the  asteroid  belt  chronology can  be  constrained by the fact that the asteroid belt must actually exist prior to 4.1 Ga, and at the very least would have had a constant  mass prior  to 4.1 Ga. Hence, the red curve in Fig. 2 is flat prior to 4.1 Ga. Figure 2 Figure  2  illustrates  one  of  that  main  problems with the Lunar-like chronology, namely that the asteroid belt would have to be at least ~1000x its current mass for the first 400 Myr of Solar System history, in contrast  to the model chronology curve of [4], where the belt undergoes an early rapid dynamical depletion event.  Given  reasonable estimates  for the collisional strength  of  asteroidal  material,  such  a  massive  belt would  be  substantially  depleted  through  collisional grinding in much less than 400 Myr [eg. 5-8]. Adding more mass would not resolve this issue, as that would also increase the rate of collisional  grinding.  Simply put,  the Lunar-like chronology requires a history for the asteroid belt that would not be stable against collisional grinding. Integrating the curves in Fig. 2 gives the normalized chronology curves N*(T) shown in Fig. 3, which are similar to those shown in Fig. 1, although they are size-independent,  have  units  of  time  (Ga),  and  are normalized to 1 at T=1 Ga. If the current  production rate f(D) of a given size crater is known at the present, multiplying  f(D)  by N*(T)  will  give  the  number  of those craters formed since time T in the past.   Figure 3 Another  interpretation of the curves in  Fig.  3 is that  they show the  equivalent  time  Tequiv that  would have to elapse in a constant-mass asteroid belt to give the number of impacts (and the amount of collisional evolution) that occur in time T. For the linear chronology curve, where the belt has a constant mass, Tequiv = T by definition. For other cases, where the mass of the belt is initially larger than the present time, Tequiv > T. [6,7] fit a collisional model of the main belt to a wide range of constraints including the main-belt and NEA size distributions, asteroid families, and the cosmic-ray  exposure  ages  of  meteorites,  and  find  that these constraints are consistent with Tequiv of at most a few tens of Gyr, eg. a small initial mass of the asteroid belt, or more likely a rapid depletion of a larger initial mass.  From  Fig.  3,  the  Lunar-like  curve  implies  a Tequiv of hundreds of Gyr, due to the large and  longlived initial  mass of the belt that  is required,  and is thus wildly inconsistent with the constraints of [6,7]. Figure 4 shows the production rate of craters 200 km in diameter and larger on Vesta for the chronologies of [1] and [4]. The curves are offset by a factor of a few because [1] and [4] assume somewhat different crater production functions f(D). While [1] claim that nothing can be said about the cratering rate on Vesta prior to 4.1 Ga, it is immediately clear that  even the most conservative estimate of a constant-mass asteroid belt prior to 4.1 Ga implies substantial early cratering in  the Lunar-like chronology. From T=4.5 Ga to the present,  roughly 60 basins larger than  200 km in diameter would be expected over the surface of Vesta. At least ten of these would be expected to be the size of Venenia (~400 km) and Rheasilvia (~500 km), or even larger.  This is grossly inconsistent  with the observed large crater  distribution  on Vesta,  which  is found to have approximately 5 and 10 craters larger than  200 km and 100 km, respectively [1,9]. While a few large craters may have formed in the past and been erased (perhaps  by the  subsequent  formation  of  Rheasilvia and Venenia), there is no evidence that several tens of basins  from  200  km  to  Rheasilvia-sized  and  larger could have formed. For example,  the northern  hemisphere  lacks  any  large-scale  diogenite  signatures  as seen in the Rheasilvia basin [10] and has a shape close to hydrostatic equilibrium (unlike the south which is heavily deformed by Rheasilvia and Venenia) [11]. Figure 4 Summary: Schmedemann  et  al.  [1] apply the Lunar chronology to Vesta using a simple scaling approach that does not take into account the actual physical behavior of the asteroid belt that  would be required, in particular ignoring processes prior to 4.1 Ga.  Adopting the simple assumption that the mass of the aster oid belt must have at the very least been constant prior to that time, we show that the Lunar-like chronology: (1) Requires an asteroid belt that has a mass of at least 1000x the current  mass for the first  400 Myr, which would not survive against collisional grinding; (2) Implies a high level of collisional evolution in the asteroid belt that is inconsistent with a wide range of constraints  as  shown by [6,7];  and  (3)  Would  result  in many times more large (>200 km) impact basins on the surface of Vesta than are actually observed. We argue that the Lunar-like chronology of [1] is not a valid approach for estimating cratering ages on Vesta, Ceres or any other bodies in the asteroid belt.       Acknowledgements: D. P.
