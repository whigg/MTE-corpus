Introduction: Besides Earth, Titan is the only known planetary body with a thick nitrogen (N2) atmosphere, and stable liquids on its surface. Titan's nitrogen atmosphere and smaller atmospheric constituent, methane (CH4), allow the surface to have a methane hydrologic cycle [1] and the minor presence of ethane (C2H6), through methane photolysis [2]. These processes create stable mixture lakes of methane and ethane on Titan's surface [2].  The exact concentration of methane and ethane in these lakes is under debate. This is due to the lack of experimental data regarding surface temperature and pressure conditions, causing the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters to be uncertain [3]. This study uses previous data [3, 4], as well as new experiments to determine the solubility of N2 in liquid hydrocarbons under Titan surface, cryogenic conditions. These results are important for thermodynamic modeling but also to understand the behavior of these lakes with respect to various processes like evaporation or freezing.  Methods: The experiments were conducted at the University of Arkansas in a Titan surface simulation chamber [5]. This chamber retains temperature of ~94K and pressure of 1.5 bar using liquid nitrogen and nitrogen gas, respectively. The sample is condensed to liquid phase directly from a gaseous phase and is expelled onto a petri dish connected to a hanging electronic balance. The mass and temperature is then continuously recorded for the duration of the experiment. In this analysis, previous evaporation data obtained for pure CH4 [3] and C2H6-CH4 mixtures [4], and new experimental data acquired for pure CH4, are used. This study focuses on the initial plateau section of the mass conservation curves (Fig. 1), where N2 dissolution is expected [4]. N2 dissolution is then estimated from the horizontal plateau, created by the mass balance between CH4 evaporation and N2 dissolution (Fig. 1A). During this plateau section, it is assumed that CH4 evaporates with the same rate over the duration of the experiments. Then, pure methane and mixture evaporation rates were determined from a least-square fit to the steady-state portion of the mass vs. time curves [3, 4] (Fig. 1A). The deviation from this initial evaporation rate (the plateau section) gives the theoretical amount of N2 dissolved (Fig. 1B).     Figure 1: Experimental data for pure methane.  A. Mass versus time showing the plateau zone after CH4 pour, from 0 to 2000 seconds followed by the steady-state evaporation. B. Data expressed in Part A after linear correction for the steady-state evaporation. The increase of mass during the plateau zone is attributed to the dissolution of N2 in liquid methane. [6]  Results/Discussion: The preliminary data regarding the dissolution of nitrogen in pure methane and methane-ethane mixtures is presented in Table 1. As the concentration of methane increases, the percentage of dissolved nitrogen increases. Regarding pure methane, as the temperature of the liquid decreases, the percent concentration of nitrogen decreases. Even though there is some discrepancy regarding the exponential trend, the relationship with percent methane, temperature, and percentage of dissolved nitrogen is clearly present (Fig. 2). 2380.pdf

The dissolution of nitrogen in methane-ethane mixtures increases from a 1% mole fraction of N2 at 74 mol% methane, to an average of 15% N2 in 100% methane. Even though N2 is soluble in both methane and ethane, it is approximately 2 orders of magnitude more soluble in methane at 100 K and 1 bar [7]. There is also no observable N2 dissolution in the data for pure C2H6 liquid [4], hence, we assume it is negligible compared to the role of methane during the time period of our experiment. This study confirms that nitrogen dissolves far more easily in methane than in ethane [7]. In regards to pure methane, the large spread of N2 mole percent values correlates with the temperature of the sample liquid. In Figure 2, the green circles correspond to temperatures above 92 K, which are closest to Titan surface temperatures of 94.15 K. The red circles correspond to cooler temperatures below 92 K. The triangular points are not considered in this section of the discussion, because they refer to previously collected data, [4] for which the temperature of the liquid was not available. When comparing the mole fraction of nitrogen, the difference between the cooler and warmer temperatures is about a factor 2. The average temperature of the green circles is 93.15 K with an average of 17.5 mole percent of N2, and the red circles have an average temperature of 89.4 K and an average of 8.33 mole percent of N2. The coldest temperature (85.7 K) is also the lowest mole percent of N2. This implies that the amount of N2 dissolution is strongly dependent on the temperature of the sample liquid. This also suggests that the 35 mol% solubility of N2 in pure methane was possibly obtained at a much higher temperature.  Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate that nitrogen is much more soluble in methane than ethane. This explains why the evaporation rates of CH4-C2H6 mixtures are slower than predicted by pure binary mixture theory [4]. Also, the amount of nitrogen able to dissolve in methane is dependent on the temperature of the sample liquid. Further analysis will enable more accurate N2 dissolution estimates involving methane-ethane mixtures at Titan surface conditions and various other temperatures.

Mole fraction of dissolved nitrogen N2 as a function of the initial mole fraction of methane (in a CH4 / C2H6 mixture). Triangles show previous data [6], while green circles represent new data above 92 K and red circles represent new data below 92 K. An exponential increase of N2 solubility is observed with increasing methane above 0.7 mole fraction of CH4, and a decreasing mole fraction with decreasing temperature in pure methane.
