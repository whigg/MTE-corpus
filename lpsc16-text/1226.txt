Introduction: Quasicrystals  (QCs)  are  materials with  quasiperiodic arrangements  of  atoms.  They can have symmetries forbidden for true crystals, e.g., icosahedral  symmetry  for  icosahedrite  (Al63Cu24Fe13),  the first known natural QC [1], and 10-fold azimuthal symmetry  in  the  case  of  the  more  recently  identified decagonite (Al71Ni24Fe5) [2]. Icosahedrite was identified in a mm-sized rock sample belonging to the collection of  the  Natural  History Museum of  the  University of Florence.  The  QCs  were  found  in  regions  rich  in khatyrkite  (CuAl2)  and  cupalite  (CuAl).  Oxygen isotopes in the silicate part  of the Florence sample show that it is extraterrestrial [3]. Its provenance was traced back to a Soviet prospecting expedition. A new expedition to Chukotka, Russia, in 2011 succeeded in retrieving ~10 more mm-sized grains, from >8 ka old sediments of a tributary of the Khatyrka river. The grains had the same O isotopic composition as the Florence sample,  and  some of  them also  contained  khatyrkite [4]. These grains are now known as the CVox chondrite Khatyrka. While the origin and formation of khatyrkite in Khatyrka is still unclear, a shock impact origin has been suggested for the QCs [5]. Here we present He and Ne concentrations and isotopic compositions of six olivine grains from Khatyrka, in order to reconstruct its cosmic history and relationship to other CV chondrites. Methods: We analyzed six forsteritic olivine (#Mg ~0.96) grains <50 μm in diameter, from fragment #126 [4]. The analysis of He and Ne in such small grains is possible  due  to  a  high-sensitivity compressor-source noble gas mass spectrometer connected to an ultra-low blank line at ETH Zurich [6]. Given the low mass of the grains (~0.75  μg total), weighing them was not possible. Instead, we used a μCT scanner with a voxel length of 5.47 μm to determine grain volumes, and calculated grain masses assuming a density of forsteritic (#Mg= 0.95±0.05) olivine (3.33± 0.06 g/cm3). After micro-manipulator transfer of the grains to a sample holder for He-Ne analysis, they were loaded into the mass spectrometer and exposed to ultra-high vacuum for several days before being individually heated with a Nd:YAG laser (λ = 1064 nm) for 60 s to their melting point. HeNe analysis was done using a protocol based on the one originally developed by Heck et  al. [7].  We calculate cosmic-ray exposure (CRE) ages using a cosmogenic nuclide production model [8] for a carbonaceous chondrite matrix and forsteritic target chemistry. Results: Results are given in Table 1. The reported volumes are 20% smaller compared to the ones given in an earlier abstract [9], due to an improved evaluation of grain volumes including a correction for variable voxel brightness near grain boundaries. All grains show cosmogenic 3He and 21Ne, corroborating an extraterrestrial origin. A fully cosmogenic origin was assumed for 3He, while  21Ne was corrected for atmospheric Ne (3-29% of measured  21Ne) using a two-component deconvolution with cosmogenic and atmospheric Ne as end-members. Five grains have an average cosmogenic 3He/21Ne ratio of 3.6±0.3, except for grain 3, where it is 7.3±0.8. All six grains should have the same ratio, as they were irradiated by cosmic rays close to each other within the same mm-sized volume. Since grain 3 has, within uncertainty, the same mass and 3He concentration as grain 1, yet  shows a significantly lower  21Ne concentration, we presume that it was not completely degassed in 21Ne during analysis. A second laser shot onto grain 3 (melt residues) did not result in the release of additional He and/or Ne above detection limit. # Vol. (μm3) Mass (ng) 3He/4He ×10-4 20Ne /22Ne 21Ne /22Ne 3Hec 21Nec R4 (Ma) 1 35800±2300 119 ±8 >470 3.6 ±2.5 0.42 ±0.08 6.6 ±0.3 2.3 ±0.1 <260 2 31200±2100 104 ±7 38 ±6 9.4 ±0.9 0.09 ±0.01 5.3 ±0.2 1.4 ±0.2 2750 ±660 3 37400±2400 125 ±8 400 ±250 11.2 ±1.7 0.13 ±0.02 6.6 ±0.2 0.9 ±0.1 270 ±80 4 47900±3000 160 ±10 330 ±150 5.5 ±2.0 0.40 ±0.06 9.9 ±0.3 3.0 ±0.1 400 ±120 5 44900±3800 209 ±17 >270 7.9 ±0.9 0.12 ±0.01 8.7 ±0.4 2.0 ±0.2 <350 7 29700±2500 99 ±9 >340 2.5 ±5.3 0.29 ±0.08 4.3 ±0.2 1.1 ±0.2 <310 t 227000±6700 756 ±23 8.1 ±0.6 0.18 ±0.01 41.3 ±0.7 10.6 ±0.4 Table 1: Volumes,  masses,  He, Ne isotopic  composition,  cosmogenic 3He, 21Ne amounts (in 10-15 cm3 STP) and radiogenic 4He retention ages ("R4", in Ma) of Khatyrka olivine grains. t = total. As shown in Fig. 1, He is likely a two-component mixture of cosmogenic He (4He/3He = ~6) and radio genic  4He,  similar to  chondrules  from the  CV chondrites Leoville and Allende [10]. To calculate a (U,Th)He age, we use U and Th concentrations of 14-22 and 49-77  ppb,  respectively,  measured  in  Allende  chondrules [11]. All except grain 2 (2.8±0.7 Ga) have retention ages consistent with ~250-300 Ma. To  calculate  the  21Ne CRE age  of  Khatyrka,  we need to determine a production rate, which depends on the position of the sample within the meteoroid and its radius, and thus requires a shielding indicator [8]. Since typical  shielding  indicators  like  the  cosmogenic 22Ne/21Ne ratio or radionuclides are not available for the Khatyrka  grains,  we  use  3He/21Ne instead.  Elemental fractionation between He and Ne (e.g., diffusion losses) since the  start  of  CRE must  be minimal as  the  data points of the grains plot close to the radiogenic-cosmogenic mixing line in Fig. 1. The CRE age curves given in Fig. 2 are for an average cosmogenic 21Ne concentration of 1.51  × 10-8 cm3 STP/g (i.e., excluding partially degassed grain 3). At the 3He/21Ne ratio measured in the grains, the CRE age of Khatyrka is thus likely in the range ~2-5 Ma, although it could be higher if the meteoroid was very large (R > 5 m). The minimal meteoroid radius (based on 3He/21Ne) is 0.5 m. Three  metallic  grains,  initially  thought  to  be khatyrkites and analyzed for He and Ne in July 2015 [9], turned out to be samples unrelated to Khatyrka. At this point, we have not taken any measurements from khatyrkite  found in the Khatyrka  meteorite,  although we plan to do so. Discussion: Khatyrka  likely experienced a  strong shock ~250-300 Ma ago, but the (U,Th)-He clock was reset inhomogeneously, which is expected in the pressure range 10-35 GPa (S3-S5) [12]. This event might thus correspond to the >5 GPa, >1200°C shock event identified by [5] in Khatyrka. Only four CV chondrites have similar CRE ages: Allende [8], ALH 85006 [13], and Acfer 082 and 272 [14]. The former two both have U,Th-He ages >3.8 Ga.  While the U,Th-He ages are <0.5 Ga for the latter  two,  this is likely due to  solar heating [14], which is unlikely for Khatyrka given the nearly unfractionated He/Ne ratio (Fig. 1). Khatyrka is thus unique among CV chondrites  for  having a very short U,Th-He shock age of ~0.3 Ga. This might indicate that Khatyrka is derived from another parent asteroid than the other CVs with known cosmic histories. References: [1] Bindi L. et al. (2009) Science 324, 1306-1309.

Fig 2: Ne-21 CRE ages of Khatyrka olivine as a function of 3He/21Ne, for a range of meteoroid sizes, based on [8]. The shaded region represents the average 3He/21Ne ratio (of the five fully degassed grains) of 3.6±0.3. This range excludes very low shielding in small objects and very high shielding in large objects, and constrains the CRE age to 2-5 Ma.
