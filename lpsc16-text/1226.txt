They canhave symmetries forbidden for true crystals, e.g., icosahedral  symmetry  for  icosahedrite  (Al63Cu24Fe13),  thefirst known natural QC [1], and 10-fold azimuthal symmetry  in  the  case  of  the  more  recently  identifieddecagonite (Al71Ni24Fe5) [2]. Icosahedrite was identifiedin a mm-sized rock sample belonging to the collectionof  the  Natural  History Museum of  the  University ofFlorence.  The  QCs  were  found  in  regions  rich  inkhatyrkite  (CuAl2)  and  cupalite  (CuAl).  Oxygen isotopes in the silicate part  of the Florence sample showthat it is extraterrestrial [3]. Its provenance was tracedback to a Soviet prospecting expedition. A new expedition to Chukotka, Russia, in 2011 succeeded in retrieving ~10 more mm-sized grains, from >8 ka old sediments of a tributary of the Khatyrka river. The grainshad the same O isotopic composition as the Florencesample,  and  some of  them also  contained  khatyrkite[4]. These grains are now known as the CVox chondriteKhatyrka. While the origin and formation of khatyrkitein Khatyrka is still unclear, a shock impact origin hasbeen suggested for the QCs [5]. Here we present Heand Ne concentrations and isotopic compositions of sixolivine grains from Khatyrka, in order to reconstruct itscosmic history and relationship to other CV chondrites.Methods: We analyzed six forsteritic olivine (#Mg~0.96) grains <50 μm in diameter, from fragment #126[4]. The analysis of He and Ne in such small grains ispossible  due  to  a  high-sensitivity compressor-sourcenoble gas mass spectrometer connected to an ultra-lowblank line at ETH Zurich [6]. Given the low mass of thegrains (~0.75  μg total), weighing them was not possible. Instead, we used a μCT scanner with a voxel lengthof 5.47 μm to determine grain volumes, and calculatedgrain masses assuming a density of forsteritic (#Mg=0.95±0.05) olivine (3.33± 0.06 g/cm3). After micro-manipulator transfer of the grains to a sample holder forHe-Ne analysis, they were loaded into the mass spectrometer and exposed to ultra-high vacuum for severaldays before being individually heated with a Nd:YAGlaser (λ = 1064 nm) for 60 s to their melting point. HeNe analysis was done using a protocol based on the oneoriginally developed by Heck et  al. [7].  We calculatecosmic-ray exposure (CRE) ages using a cosmogenicnuclide production model [8] for a carbonaceous chondrite matrix and forsteritic target chemistry.Results: Results are given in Table 1. The reportedvolumes are 20% smaller compared to the ones given inan earlier abstract [9], due to an improved evaluation ofgrain volumes including a correction for variable voxelbrightness near grain boundaries. All grains show cosmogenic 3He and 21Ne, corroborating an extraterrestrialorigin. A fully cosmogenic origin was assumed for 3He,while  21Ne was corrected for atmospheric Ne (3-29%of measured  21Ne) using a two-component deconvolution with cosmogenic and atmospheric Ne as end-members. Five grains have an average cosmogenic 3He/21Neratio of 3.6±0.3, except for grain 3, where it is 7.3±0.8.All six grains should have the same ratio, as they wereirradiated by cosmic rays close to each other within thesame mm-sized volume. Since grain 3 has, within uncertainty, the same mass and 3He concentration as grain1, yet  shows a significantly lower  21Ne concentration,we presume that it was not completely degassed in 21Neduring analysis. A second laser shot onto grain 3 (meltresidues) did not result in the release of additional Heand/or Ne above detection limit.# Vol.(μm3)Mass(ng)3He/4He×10-420Ne/22Ne21Ne/22Ne3Hec 21Nec R4(Ma)1 35800±2300119±8 >4703.6±2.50.42±0.086.6±0.32.3±0.1 <2602 31200±2100104±738±69.4±0.90.09±0.015.3±0.21.4±0.22750±6603 37400±2400125±8400±25011.2±1.70.13±0.026.6±0.20.9±0.1270±804 47900±3000160±10330±1505.5±2.00.40±0.069.9±0.33.0±0.1400±1205 44900±3800209±17 >2707.9±0.90.12±0.018.7±0.42.0±0.2 <3507 29700±250099±9 >3402.5±5.30.29±0.084.3±0.21.1±0.2 <310t 227000±6700756±23 8.1±0.60.18±0.0141.3±0.710.6±0.4 Table 1: Volumes,  masses,  He, Ne isotopic  composition,  cosmogenic 3He, 21Ne amounts (in 10-15 cm3 STP) and radiogenic 4He retention ages (“R4”, in Ma) of Khatyrka olivine grains. t = total.As shown in Fig. 1, He is likely a two-componentmixture of cosmogenic He (4He/3He = ~6) and radio1226.pdf

genic  4He,  similar to  chondrules  from the  CV chondrites Leoville and Allende [10]. To calculate a (U,Th)He age, we use U and Th concentrations of 14-22 and49-77  ppb,  respectively,  measured  in  Allende  chondrules [11]. All except grain 2 (2.8±0.7 Ga) have retention ages consistent with ~250-300 Ma.To  calculate  the  21Ne CRE age  of  Khatyrka,  weneed to determine a production rate, which depends onthe position of the sample within the meteoroid and itsradius, and thus requires a shielding indicator [8]. Sincetypical  shielding  indicators  like  the  cosmogenic22Ne/21Ne ratio or radionuclides are not available for theKhatyrka  grains,  we  use  3He/21Ne instead.  Elementalfractionation between He and Ne (e.g., diffusion losses)since the  start  of  CRE must  be minimal as  the  datapoints of the grains plot close to the radiogenic-cosmogenic mixing line in Fig. 1. The CRE age curves givenin Fig. 2 are for an average cosmogenic 21Ne concentration of 1.51  × 10-8 cm3 STP/g (i.e., excluding partiallydegassed grain 3). At the 3He/21Ne ratio measured in thegrains, the CRE age of Khatyrka is thus likely in therange ~2-5 Ma, although it could be higher if the meteoroid was very large (R > 5 m). The minimal meteoroidradius (based on 3He/21Ne) is 0.5 m.Three  metallic  grains,  initially  thought  to  bekhatyrkites and analyzed for He and Ne in July 2015[9], turned out to be samples unrelated to Khatyrka. Atthis point, we have not taken any measurements fromkhatyrkite  found in the Khatyrka  meteorite,  althoughwe plan to do so.Discussion: Khatyrka  likely experienced a  strongshock ~250-300 Ma ago, but the (U,Th)-He clock wasreset inhomogeneously, which is expected in the pressure range 10-35 GPa (S3-S5) [12]. This event mightthus correspond to the >5 GPa, >1200°C shock eventidentified by [5] in Khatyrka. Only four CV chondriteshave similar CRE ages: Allende [8], ALH 85006 [13],and Acfer 082 and 272 [14]. The former two both haveU,Th-He ages >3.8 Ga.  While the U,Th-He ages are<0.5 Ga for the latter  two,  this is likely due to  solarheating [14], which is unlikely for Khatyrka given thenearly unfractionated He/Ne ratio (Fig. 1). Khatyrka isthus unique among CV chondrites  for  having a veryshort U,Th-He shock age of ~0.3 Ga. This might indicate that Khatyrka is derived from another parent asteroid than the other CVs with known cosmic histories.References: [1] Bindi L. et al. (2009) Science 324,1306-1309.
