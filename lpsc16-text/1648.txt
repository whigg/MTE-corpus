ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF NITROGEN ICE ON PLUTO DUETO SURFACE ICE AND TOPOGRAPHY. Alejandro Soto1, Scot Rafkin1, Tim Michaels2, 1SouthwestResearch Institute, Boulder, CO, USA; asoto@boulder.swri.edu; 2SETI, Mountain View, California, USAIntroduction: Prior to the arrival of the NewHorizons spacecraft, the expectation was that thevolatile surface ice distribution on the surface ofPluto would be strongly controlled by the latitudinal temperature gradient resulting primarilyfrom the slow seasonal variations of radiativeconductive equilibrium [1, 2, 3]. If this were thecase, then Pluto would have broad latitudinal bandsof both ice covered surface and ice free surface,as dictated by the season. Further, the circulation,and thus the transport of volatiles, was thought tobe driven almost exclusively by sublimation anddeposition flows (so-called "condensation flows")associated with the volatile cycle [1, 2, 3, 4]. Incontrast to expectations, images from New Horizonshowed an extremely complex, heterogeneous distribution of surface ices draped over topography ofsubstantial geologic diversity[5]. To maintain suchan ice distribution, the atmospheric circulation andvolatile transport must be more complex than previously envisioned. Topography, the distribution ofvolatile ice, and an overall large-scale atmosphericcirculation at least partly independent of the condensation flows must play a role.Simulations where topography, surface ice distributions, and volatile cycle physics are added individually and in various combinations are used toindividually quantify the importance of the generalcirculation, topography, surface ice distributions,and condensation flows. It is shown that even regional patches of ice or large craters, much likethat of Tombaugh Regio, can have global impactson the atmospheric circulation, the volatile cycle,and hence, the distribution of surface ices. Thiswork demonstrates that explaining Plutos volatilecycle and the expression of that cycle in the surface ice distribution requires consideration of atmospheric processes beyond simple vapor pressureequilibrium arguments.Model description: A newly developed general circulation model (GCM) for Pluto is usedto investigate the unexpected and highly heterogeneous distribution of nitrogen surface ice imaged by the New Horizons spacecraft on the surface of Pluto. The GCM is based on the GFDLFlexible Modeling System (FMS) dynamical core,solved on a latitude/longitude discretized horizontal grid and a pressure based hybrid vertical coordinate [6]. Model physics include a 3-band radiativescheme, molecular thermal conduction within theatmosphere, subsurface thermal conduction, and anitrogen volatile cycle. The radiative-conductivemodel, which is based on the Yelle-Lunine scheme[7], takes into account the 2.3, 3.3 and 7.8 umbands of CH4, including non-local thermodynamicequilibrium effects. The subsurface conductionmodel assumes a water ice regolith. In the case ofnitrogen surface ice deposition, additional suprasurface layers are added above the water ice regolith to properly account for conductive energyflow through the nitrogen ice. The nitrogen volatilecycle is based on a vapor pressure equilibrium assumption between the atmosphere and surface.Simulations: We conducted a suite of simulations for a variety of initial conditions in order tounderstand the interaction between the atmosphericcirculation and Pluto's surface conditions. The initial simulations are simplified, idealized scenariosthat provide insight into the basic circulation patterns. We systematically added new surface features, including surface ice and topography to understand how the atmospheric circulation changedin response to these features. The presence oftopography and regional ice strongly perturbs thegeneral circulation and volatile cycle. Here we discuss two representative simulations: one withoutany initial regional ice or topography and one withan initial regional ice patch overlying a topographicpit.The first simulation was initialized with no surface ice and flat topography. This simulation is theGCM equivalent of previous energy balance modelsimulations [1, 2, 3]. The simulation was started atperihelion and rapidly deposited nitrogen ice on thepoles (see Figure 1). The zonal wind field showsthermal tides in the northern hemisphere and wavesin the polar regions, which are associated with thepolar ice cap edges (see Figure 1). There is slightly1648.pdf

The color contours are the surfacetemperature in Kelvin.The simulation initialized with a Tombaugh Regio style ice patch, as shown in Figure 2, the resulting circulation is drastically different. The simulation begins with an equatorial patch of ice placedin a 500 meter deep pit, which is intended to simulate Tombaugh Regio in an idealized manner. Theexistence of this equatorial ice directly affects theatmospheric circulation, as seen in the near surfacezonal winds, shown in Figure 2. Figure 2 showsthe near surface winds flowing outward from theequatorial pit and interacting with the mean winds.Since there are no polar caps in this simulation,the circulation is dominated by the tropical windsdriven by the equatorial patch of ice.Conclusion: In these two idealized simulations, the different types of surface conditions havedrastically different effects on Pluto's atmosphericcirculation. By systematically adding each surfacefeature individually and then as a collection, wecan identify the various contributions to the overallatmospheric circulation on Pluto.

The currently observed surface features, including the distribution of ice, mayor may not have existed throughout the bulk ofPluto's lifetime.This framework will allow us tospeculate on how Pluto's atmospheric circulationmay have changed through time.References: [1] C.
