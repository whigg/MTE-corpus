Introduction:  Large basin-forming impact events (>100 km diameter) have played an important role in the geological evolution of the terrestrial planets and perhaps even the origin of life [1]. However, there remain few comprehensive studies of large basin impact structures (LBIS) as very few are preserved on Earth. Although impact basin structural models exist [2, 3], models of ejecta emplacement [4, 5, 6] and impact melt emplacement [7] are based on impact craters generally <<100 km diameter; as such, it is not currently understood if such models scale to LBIS. Particularly, studies of the morphology, structure, and mineralogy of LBIS proximal ejecta is lacking as it is generally poorly preserved on Earth. Mars possesses several wellpreserved analogous basin impact structures, having evidence of aqueous interaction [4, 8], and therefore presents an opportunity to understand these structures at the meter to sub-meter scale using current remote sensing datasets. This work focuses on the detailed mapping of the well-preserved ~150-km Bakhuysen Crater (15E, -23), which has a modeled age consistent with the Early Hesperian - Late Noachian period [9], utilizing visible images (6-m/pixel CTX [10] and 25 to 50-cm/pixel HiRISE [11]), thermophysical data (100m/pixel day and nighttime thermal infrared images from THEMIS [12]), and hyper- and multi-spectral data (CRISM [13]). Due to the preservation state, Bakhuysen small basin impact structure is mapped here to extrapolate to larger peak ring basin structures. Observations:  Crater Interior. A pitted unit covers most of the crater floor, with fractures observed in the northern portions of the pitted unit (Fig. 1). Interestingly, unusually large pits are located concentrically where a peak ring feature usually exists in LBIS (~0.3 - 0.6 crater rim diameter) [14, 15]. Arcuate mountainous terrain near the crater center possibly represents a central uplift, partially overprinted by a younger 9 km-diameter crater. The ejecta of the small interior crater has lobes and ramparts consistent with single layer ejecta (SLE) morphology.  Rim-incising channels are found all around the crater rim, but are concentrated and largest on the northern rim. Overlying the pitted unit is a smooth, consistent-toned, continuous unit which is observed where the channels meet the break in slope from the terraces to the crater floor and outward. Small (<1 km) isolated outcrops of crudely layered light-toned material may represent the stratigraphy of the smooth unit, observed in the northern and southern crater floor.    Fig. 1.

Crater Exterior / Ejecta. The short-lobed ejecta blanket consists largely of hummocky terrain, terminating non-continuously at various distances from the crater rim. Although the ejecta clearly displays a radial secondary pattern [4, 5], it is presently unclear whether the ejecta is single or multi-lobed (SLE, MLE; 4, 5). The lobes are best expressed in the northern and northeastern ejecta. Possible ramparts remain intact locally at numerous lobes in the northeastern proximal ejecta (at ~0.4 crater radii). Thermophysical data show stark boundaries between units in the ejecta (Fig. 2A). The areas which are bright white in THEMIS Night IR in Fig. 2A have morphologic similarities consistent with pitted material as observed in HiRISE and CTX visible imagery.  Fig. 2.

[16]; Radar observations of lunar impact melt flows.  Discussion: Pitted materials on the crater floor are consistent with and interpreted as volatile-rich primary impactite deposits, as originally proposed by Tornabene et al. [9]. Fractures present in crater floor pitted units also likely indicate melt-bearing deposits, similar to lunar crater fractures described as contraction features of impact melt deposits [9, 17].  In addition to the crater interior pitted materials, the presence of ejecta lobes and possible ramparts suggest the interaction of the impact process with subsurface volatiles (liquid or ice; [4, 8]). Robbins and Hynek [5] classified Bakhuysen ejecta as radial (Rd), with no indication of a layered ejecta. (No LBIS in that database have classified layered ejecta.) This work suggests that the unusually extensive and locally continuous material in the ejecta, seen as bright areas in THEMIS Night IR in Fig. 2A, have ponded ejecta morphology similar to lunar impact melt flows (e.g., Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the texture of this material is consistent with pitted texture observed elsewhere in the crater and ejecta as seen in HiRISE and CTX visible imagery. Pooled, pitted materials are generally seen on terraces or within ejecta topographic lows just beyond crater rims [9]. This unit occupies the lowest-lying regions of the ejecta and appears to thin out at its margins, gradually yielding to and exposing the underlying ejecta. These units are therefore interpreted as ponded, pitted units in the proximal ejecta, emplaced on top of the hummocky, continuous ejecta unit consistent with models of multi-stage ejecta emplacement [7, 9]. These features of the ejecta may be significant to extend the models of MLE emplacement [4, 5, 6] to LBIS, as well as suggest the availability of volatiles which may have influenced the post-impact crater environment. Biota are thought to flourish in post-impact hydrated environments [1]. On Mars, one mechanism for the formation of post-impact hydrated substrates are fluvial fans and deltas. Crater rim breaches are not observed at Bakhuysen and hence the channels mapped here are interpreted to be internally sourced, carrying sediments to the crater floor and developing the smooth units. Moore and Howard [18] described deposits in Bakhuysen as being a combination of alluvial fan and fluvial deltaic, also suggesting that such fans formed around the Hesperian-Noachian boundary at a period of enhanced precipitation. The light-toned outcrops observed in the smooth units may therefore have exposed hydrated mineralogy, which we hope to better constrain with requested HiRISE color and stereo images as well as CRISM spectral data.  Although a peak ring structure indicative of larger impact basin structures [19] is not apparent in Bakhuysen, the concentrically-emplaced and unusually large pits are interpreted here as being formed due to a subsurface ring structure and potentially associated with degassing of volatiles; Tornabene et al. [9] have previously described structural controls of pitted material. This interpretation would be consistent with impact basin structural models [2, 3] coupled with distribution of hydrothermal activity associated with impactrelated fault and fracture systems [20]. The central feature of Bakhuysen, although partially obscured by the overprinting crater, appears to be an incomplete ringed peak-cluster structure as described by Baker et al. [19].  Preliminary mapping and data processing of Bakhuysen indicates features consistent with a modified but well-preserved LBIS, including 1) extensive impact melt-bearing deposits inside the crater and on the ejecta, 2) a lobed and multi-unit ejecta, 3) postimpact alluvial and fluvial fan deposits, and 4) a distinct central feature structure. These preliminary findings may suggest that mechanisms involved in craters <100 km in diameter may indeed scale to LBIS, with the initial conditions (e.g., target lithology and availably of volatiles [21]), being important factors to consider when determining the formation and post-impact history of a LBIS.
