AUSTRAL WINTER IMAGING OF DON JUAN POND, ANTARCTICA: POLAR DESERT BRINE FLOW AT -40°C ON EARTH AND IMPLICATIONS FOR MARS.  J. L. Dickson1, J. W. Head1 and J. S. Levy2, 1Brown University Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences, Providence, RI 02906 USA, jdickson@brown.edu 2University of Texas Institute for Geophysics, Austin, TX 78758 USA.  Introduction: Orbital observations [1-3] and measurements from the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover [4] indicate that brine flow is likely to be an active process at low and mid-latitudes on Mars. Further, documentation of chloride deposits within ancient basins [5-8] and the presence of perchlorate salts in martian regolith [9-10] suggest that brine activity is likely to have been an important mechanism of fluvial transport throughout Mars’ history, particularly if the surface has always experienced cold conditions. Don Juan Pond (DJP) [11], in the South Fork of Upper Wright Valley in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, is the most saline natural body of water on Earth and provides a unique opportunity to investigate brine formation and fate in a polar desert climate. Austral summer inputs are dominated by discharge of shallow deliquescence-derived brine [12], fresh snowmelt, and potentially input from a deeper aquifer [13]. In this contribution, we provide the first time-lapse imaging of the pond during austral winter, when surface temperatures (~-30˚C - ~-40°C) restrict freshwater processes. Experiment: A Nikon D5100 camera with an external intervalometer was installed on a small peak ~1.25 km from the eastern margin of the pond (Fig. 1). Images were acquired every hour from late January 2015 until mid-November 2015. Reflected sunlight off the gibbous Moon provided sufficient signal for brief periods from May through July when the region receives no direct sunlight (Fig. 2). Images have been synchronized with meteorological station data recorded within Don Juan Basin [12]. Results: Our new results show that, as predicted by its chemistry [14], Don Juan Pond remains unfrozen during the entirety of austral winter. Surprisingly, both positive and negative changes in lake level and shoreline position occur throughout the winter, indicating that discharge into the lake basin occurs to raise lake level. The region of the basin (Fig. 1) that is most active also varies throughout the course of the year, including the winter. Incident solar radiation also changes as a function of season. After the first sunset on Feb. 20, 2015, DJP experienced waning twilight until the end of April (Fig. 2). From May until mid-August, no direct sunlight reached DJP. Finally, twilight returned from mid-August until late-October before Austral Summer.  Here we describe a synthesis of the locations of activity and the nature of the changes spanning Austral Winter and adjacent seasons. Late Summer (February through April). Activity within the basin is primarily focused in the eastern discharge zone (EDZ), where seepage of shallow CaCl2-rich shallow groundwater has been recently documented [12]. Ponding in this zone varies from day to day but gradually recedes such that it is disconnected from DJP by the end of April. Standing water is also observed within the southwestern region of the basin associated with a small channel (Fig. 1) that emanates from a water track adjacent to the southern margin of a prominent debris lobe. Our data show that surface temperatures do not exceed 0°C after February 15, suggesting that all fluvial activity thereafter in Figure 1. IKONOS image of Don Juan Pond.  Figure 2.

volves solute-rich fluids. Daily average temperatures by the end of April are typically less than -30°C. Fall/Winter (May through August). More overland flow and ponding occur in the western portion of the basin during winter months than in the fall or spring (Fig. 3). Channels emerging from the toe of the debris lobe west of DJP (Fig. 1) that have been shown to carry freshwater in austral summer [12-13] are liquidfilled in the winter when temperatures average -33°C (temperatures did not surpass -17°C during the 2015 austral winter). Standing water in the EDZ varies in extent during the winter, at times existing only as a small pool disconnected from the main portion of DJP, and never expanding beyond its fall and spring extents. Early Spring (September through October). Pond levels drop through early spring to summertime levels. Temperatures do not reach 0°C until early November. Activity within the EDZ increases with expansion of ponded fluids eastward, further in extent than had been observed during austral summer. Surface brines are observed extending to the eastern margin of the basin, but only transiently and are correlated with strong katabatic wind events that emanate from the west. Discussion: These initial observations suggest that discharge into DJP occurs from multiple sources at different times of year (Fig. 4). Seepage from the EDZ, known to occur during austral spring and summer [12], appears to continue through the entire year. Discharge and ponding in the western portion of the basin appears to be limited to the coldest portions of the year (May through August). The proximity of this discharge to the debris lobe could be coincidental, but the lobe may serve as (1) a potential reservoir for the fluids or (2) an aquiclude for a deeper groundwater source. In either scenario, fluids could become pressurized and discharged as a result of freezing and expansion within the lobe or beneath it.  Implications for Mars: Surface temperatures at Don Juan Pond in austral winter are comparable to those experienced in the low- and mid-latitudes of contemporary Mars [15], where shallow saline groundwater transport may be occurring on steep slopes [1-3]. Present-day conditions are likely to be too arid to support a hydrological system of the scale of DJP, but a similar mechanism could help explain the existence of chloride units on ancient basin floors [5-8]. If those systems behaved in a similar manner to DJP, then surface temperatures need not have been significantly higher than those observed today [16]. References: [1] McEwen, A. S. et al.
