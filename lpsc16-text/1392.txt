THERMAL DETECTION OF AN EXTENSIVE BURIED FLUVIAL UNIT IN THE AEOLIS DORSA REGION, MEDUSAE FOSSAE FORMATION, MARS.  D. M. Burr1, R. E. Jacobsen1 and Alexandra Lefort1 1University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN USA 37996 (dburr1@vols.utk.edu).  Introduction:  The Aeolis Dorsa (AD; Fig. 1) are a stratigraphically stacked population of inverted fluvial deposits [1-9], located within (possibly beneath) a pervasively eroded Hesperian-aged transitional unit (Htu) of the highland/lowland marginal zone [10, 11].  This regional erosion has revealed distinct fluvial and alluvial morphologies, mostly seen in inverted (positive) relief.  These inverted deposits include: (1) 'flat' topped ridges, interpreted as deposits of meandering rivers; (2) 'thin' ridges, interpreted as deposits of sinuous rivers, (3) fans, interpreted as alluvial fan deposits, and (4) Aeolis Serpens, the longest and most isolated of the fluvial deposits [1,3,6].  The deposits are generally located around the margins of the broad depression between the higher standing Aeolis and Zephyria Plana (AZP), and their orientation suggests flow from the higherstanding plana into the interior depression (although see [4] for an example of ambiguity in flow direction based on planview morphology).  Aeolis Serpens is inferred to have flowed northward [1,4,6].  The inverted fluvial and alluvial deposits range over ~1000m of elevation [5] and show stratigraphic and geospatial trends [5,7,9].  The lowest deposits are both the widest and the most wide-spread, evidencing the greatest discharges and most distributed source of runoff [e.g., 9], although the possibility that ridge widths do not reflect flow widths undermines this simple correlation [6,12].  Stratigraphically higher deposits are less widely distributed and narrower in plan view, indicating more limited runoff.  The stratigraphically highest deposits are alluvial (fan), evidence for intermittent flow and the most localized runoff.  Negative-relief fluvial features are also visible in high-resolution images as scattered small troughs [8,12].  Thus, this region preserves a complex record of fluvial and alluvial activity early in Mars history, showing a general trend from 'wetter' to 'drier' conditions but with considerable variability across the region [5,7,9,10,12]. Whether this trend of 'wetter' to 'drier' environmental conditions extends farther in to the past is unknown.  Previous work [13] has ascribed this fluvial activity to the Noachian-Hesperian transition as a time of enhanced precipitation-fed runoff [14], although without independent evidence for this non-unique possibility.  If correct, this timing would indicate that previous conditions, i.e., previous to the climatic optimum, were drier.  Alternatively, the Hesperian age for the region [10, 11] suggests that the prior environmental conditions, i.e., in the Noachian, were wetter.  Ground-penetrating radar tracks of both lower [15] and higher [16] frequencies have imaged subsurface reflectors beneath some portions of this Hesperian unit (formerly the Medusae Fossae Formation, MFF).  However, in our analysis, these radar data do not show basal reflectors in locations with inverted fluvial deposits. Hypothesis:  Based on the Hesperian age for the region [10,11], our null hypothesis is that that wetter conditions preceded the substantial fluvial runoff evidenced by the extensive inverted fluvial and alluvial deposits.  Based on correlation with enhance precipitation-fed runoff globally [14], our alternative hypothesis is that the fluvial activity now preserved as inverted deposits began at the late Noachian-early Hesperian transition [13], so that this inverted geomorophology records the climatic optimum. Approach and Results:  Our on-going mapping of this region [e.g., 17] provides data for testing these hypotheses. This mapping entails identification and classification of fluvial, aeolian, sedimentological, tectonic, and collapse landforms.  This mapping, at 1:100k for a resulting map to be published at 1:500k, is done using optical images; the map base is a mosaic of images from the Context Camera (CTX; [18]). To preserve maximum feature detectability, the CTX images are not equalized (Fig. 1).  However, we determined during mapping that for a regional view, an equalized mosaic is desirable, and use THermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS; [19]) equalized infrared (IR) mosaics [20] for this purpose.    A result of our use of  the THEMIS nighttime IR data is the unexpected discovery of a distinct night-IRbright unit (Fig. 1).  This  unit forms a contiguous area having relative higher pixel values than the surrounding terrain.  In plan view, this thermally distinct unit consists of an extensive central area with narrow sinuous features that ajoin it from the west, south, and east.  A small population of shorter narrow features are also apparent to the north.  In contrast to the previously mapped deposits, which are concentrated around the AZP margins (Fig. 1), this bright unit is centralized within the broad depression between the two plana (Fig. 1).  In mapping this unit on the THEMIS nighttime IR mosaic, we eschewed mapping any terrain, such as craters rims, yardangs, or other slopes, that was IR-bright due to slope effects.  We consider this approach to have resulted in a unit that reflects substrate properties instead of slopes.   The resulting unit is poorly correlated with surficial landforms or geologic units in the central area.  Sparse optically dark patches that outcrop from beneath a surf1392.pdf

icial cover are located within this night-IR-bright unit and show slightly enhanced night-IR pixel values (e.g., Fig. 2).  However, these optically dark outcrops do not cover the extent of the night-IR-bright unit.    Analysis:  In the absence of slope effect, brightness in night IR data is indicative of enhanced thermal inertia [21].  The co-location of optically dark outcropping material and enhanced night-IR-brightness suggests that the night-IR-bright unit results from this nearsurface dark material.  The elongated sinuous forms that are included within the night-IR-bright unit (Fig. 1) are similar in planview morphology to the 'flat' surficial deposits, the stratigraphically lowest of the inverted fluvial deposits and generally follow the same orientation of the overlyling flat deposits.  This similarity of form suggests a similar controlling cause and environment.  However, the sinuous forms in the night-IRbright unit are wider than the overlying 'flat' deposits.   Interpretation / Implications:  On the basis of similar planform, orientation, and location in a regional topographic low, we interpret the night-IR-bright unit to be a buried fluvial unit, outcropping at the surface in scattered locations.  Based on its stratigraphic position, this unit is inferred to predate the previously mapped  Hesperian-aged fluvial deposits [1-3,6,8-9].  The sinuous features in this unit are interpreted as channelized flow deposits.  Their greater width relative to the overlying 'flat' deposits suggests that the earlier discharges were greater, although this correlation may  be ambiguous [6,12].  The greater areal extent of these buried fluvial deposits (Fig. 1) suggests extensive runoff, which is most consistent with the global climatic optimum at the Noachian-Hesperian transition.   Conclusions:  This buried fluvial unit adds to our understanding of the long and complex fluvial history of this region.  Its detection, suggesting a climate that generated substantial runoff, supports our null hypothesis: that the exposed surficial deposits record Hesperian-aged fluvial activity.
