(E-mail: hasegawah@eps.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp) Introduction:  Primitive achondrites have textures that are indicated to be igneous rocks (achondrites), but have heterogeneity of oxygen isotopic compositions and whole-rock chemical compositions that imply an affinity to chondrites [e.g., 1]. It is suggested that primitive achondrites exceeded their solidus temperature on their parent bodies thus experienced partial melting, but they are derived from parent bodies in which planetary differentiation did not achieve isotopic equilibrium [1, 2]. Among primitive achondrites, brachinite is a very important meteorite group to know the initial planetary differentiation because it is dominantly composed of olivine and suggested to be formed at the early stage of differentiation. Lots of researchers suggest that brachinite is a partial melt residue [e.g., 3] but there has been no consensus on the origin of brachinite. In fact, there is a suggestion that some of them are olivine cumulates and are not primitive achondrites [4]. Additionally, there are numerous ungrouped achondrites with generally similar petrologic, compositional and isotopic characteristics to brachinites [5]. In this view, studying brachinites and olivine-rich ungrouped achondrites (“brachinite-like” meteorites) are of great interest to obtain the information of the differentiation processes in the early solar system. Especially, presence of a certain petrofabric texture has been suggested for some brachinites and brachinite-like meteorites [4, 6] and in this study we search such a texture in brachinite-like meteorites. Samples and Methods: In this study, we selected  Miller Range (MIL) 090206/090340/090405. MIL 090206, 090340, 090356, 090405, 090805 and 090963 have very similar rock textures and mineral compositions, therefore, they are thought to be paired [7]. These meteorites were originally classified as ureilites [8]. However, [9] and [10] suggested that these MIL meteorites should have been classified as brachinite not as ureilite based on their mineralogy and petrology. The polished thin sections (PTSs) of MIL 090206/090340/090405 (hereafter MILs) were observed with optical and scanning electron microscopy. Mineral compositions and elemental mapping were obtained by electron probe micro analyzers (EPMA, JEOL JXA-8900L and JXA-8530F at The University of Tokyo). To analyze the crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) of olivine, we used FEG-SEM (JEOL, JSM-7100F) at the National Institute of Polar Research (NIPR) equipped with an EBSD (electron backscatter diffraction) detector and obtained crystal orientation stereographic nets using HKL’s CHANNEL 5 software. Results:  MILs are mostly composed of olivine. Olivine grains show rounded grain boundaries, triple junctions and a weak foliation (Fig. 1). Average olivine grain size is approximately 0.5 mm. These olivine compositions vary from Fo~70 to Fo~73. In some olivine grains, we found reverse zoning but other olivine grains did not show clear patterns of chemical zoning. Minor minerals are clinopyroxene, chromite, orthopyroxene, Fe-Ni metal and sulfide. Along the boundaries of olivine-olivine, olivine-chromite and within olivine, we observed fine-grained orthopyroxene, iron sulfide and metal. This assemblage is very similar to typical rim materials in brachinites [e.g., 11]. In the PTS of MIL 090405, a very large augite grain (~2 x 8 mm in size; En~46Wo~44) is observed (Fig. 1). This clinopyroxene grain is homogeneous and poikilitically encloses rounded olivine (Fo~70) and orthopyroxene (En~72Wo~2) grains. These observations are consistent with [9, 10] except finding of reverse zoning in olivine. We measured one point per one olivine grain of each PTS to analyze CPO of olivine crystals in MILs by using EBSD and CHANNEL 5 (Fig. 2). MIL 090206, 090340 and 090405 obviously have the same CPO patterns. Fig. 2 shows that olivine grains in MIL Fig. 1 Photomicrograph of a thin section of MIL 090405 (crossed polarized light).

090206, 090340, and 090405 are preferentially aligned along [010] (b axis). The direction of the b axis concentration and the foliation bisect each other at right angles. On the other hand, the dimension of [001] (c axis) is arranged on a plane but [100] (a axis) does not show clear patterns. Discussion and Conclusion: As pointed out by earlier studies [9, 10], the petrography and mineral compositions of MILs are within the range of brachinites. They are mostly composed of coarse-grained olivine which has rounded boundaries and triple junctions. Northwest Africa (NWA) 6112 which is classified as “ungrouped achondrite” looks very similar to MILs. The mineral compositions of NWA 6112 is olivine: Fo73, clinopyroxene: En46Wo43, orthopyroxene: En76Wo2, as reported in [6]. These mineral compositions are comparable to MILs. Large poikilitic clinopyroxene enclosing olivine grains is also common, but MILs do not have any plagioclase unlike NWA 6112.  Fig. 3 shows that oxygen isotopic compositions of MIL 090340 are plotted near NWA 6112 and brachinites [6, 10]. This indicates that MILs and NWA 6112 were possibly derived from the same parent body which is a brachinite parent body (or related one). Equigranular textures, triple junction and foliation of olivine grains indicate that MILs are cumulate rocks. Currently, the petrogenesis of brachinites is a subject of debate. Two main hypotheses exist. One is the formation as residues of various degrees of partial melting and melt migration [e.g., 3]. The other is the formation as cumulates from a magma [e.g., 4]. Perhaps some samples of brachinite are residues and others are cumulates. The CPO patterns of olivine in MILs are characterized by the b axis concentration. A similar pattern of olivine CPO was reported in a wehrlitic intrusion of Oman ophiolites [12]. These CPO patterns are interpreted as resulting from compaction of residual olivine crystals. The (010) plane of olivine has the largest crystal face and is preferentially aligned by the compaction. If olivine grains are subjected to compaction, the direction of b axis focuses on one point on a stereographic projection. This indicates that the MILs may be formed as residues of high degree of partial melting. These CPO patterns of olivine in MILs are different from that of NWA 6112. NWA 6112 has the CPO patterns that are preferentially aligned along [001] (c axis) whereas [100] (a axis) and [010] (b axis) are randomly oriented [6]. The mechanism to form these patterns are not clear but we think that melt flow was involved. Therefore, it is indicated that the formation processes of MILs and NWA 6112 are somewhat different in spite of their mineralogical similarities.  References: [1] Weisberg, M. K. et al.
