Hendrix1, 1Planetary Science Institute (1700 East Fort Lowell, Suite 106, Tucson, AZ 85719-2395; cahill@psi.edu), 2The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (11100 Johns Hopkins Road, Laurel, MD 20723).   Introduction: We use reflectance spectra of Gaspra from the Galileo Solid State Imager (SSI) obtained on 29 October 1991 (Fig. 1). We apply the radiative transfer model of Hapke [1-3] to predict the bidirectional reflectance spectra in a forward modeling approach [4,5]. In Hapke’s model, the reflectance spectrum of a regolith is computed linearly from the single-scattering albedos of mineral end-members [2,3]. The single-scattering albedo is the probability that a photon incident on a regolith particle will be scattered rather than absorbed. It is independent of illumination or viewing geometry and a function of a grain’s scattering behavior and absorption coefficient. The absorption coefficient is governed by the material’s complex index of refraction, which is a function of the optical constants. Optical constants are wavelength-dependent quantities unique to each particle type in a regolith and represent the inherent physical and chemical properties of each material [6].    Figure 1: SSI color image of Gaspra obtained by the Galileo spacecraft.  In order to accurately interpret reflectance spectra for airless bodies, the effects of opaque phases (e.g., Fe, Ni, sulfides) must be considered properly. Opaque metals are present as native igneous minerals in meteorites and on planetary surfaces in the form of grains that are significantly larger than the wavelength of the incident light. However, nanophase metal grains are a key by-product of space weathering [3,7-9] and introduce confounding effects on ultraviolet (UV), visible (VIS), and near-infrared (NIR) spectra as seen in laboratory and spacecraft data for airless bodies.  To address this issue, our model also included optical constants for opaque metal and mineral phases. Metals are present in planetary regolith in three spectrally-significant grain size categories: macroscopic, microphase, and nanophase [3, 10-15]. Macroscopic metal particles are large relative to the wavelength of light and grains of this size are often found as native igneous species in meteorites and lunar samples [16]. Microphase particles (e.g., mpFe0) have diameters from ~50 nm to ~3000 nm, produce an overall decrease in reflectance with few effects on the continuum slope of a spectrum [9, 14, 15]. Finer-grained metal (<50 nm in diameter) is referred to as “nanophase metal” (e.g., npFe0) and decreases the overall reflectance and introduces a strong positive spectral slope across the visible to NIR (i.e., spectral “reddening”) [8, 9]. Methods: The model used for this study was adapted from the work of [17], which uses optical constants for metals (Fe, Ni) to introduce the darkening and/or reddening effects of microscopic and nanophase metal on a reflectance spectrum. Required inputs are the abundance and composition of phases (including plagioclase, ilmenite, olivine, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, glass, agglutinates, macrometal, nanophase metal, microphase metal) as well as the grain sizes of the (macrophase) host particles and the microphase metal. Use of a look up table allows the user to vary the amounts of macroscopic host phases to produce spectra that can then be compared to a spectrum of interest (SOI). Microphase metal particle sizes are modeled for a range of sizes (50-3000 nm) and compared to the SOI.  We have adapted the algorithm for applications to other airless planetary bodies [17], including Mercury and asteroids. For our Gaspra study, we sought to extend the opaque phases available for spectral mixing and space weathering, which were previously centered on the Fe-rich nature of the Moon (e.g., metallic Fe). Results of these models relative to laboratory and planetary spectra will be presented. To identify the model spectrum that provided the best fit to the observed spectrum, we calculate a goodness of fit parameter based on matching the overall albedo and shape of the observed spectrum. To quantify the match to the overall albedo, we used a simple sum of the square of the residuals (SSR). To quantify the match to the overall spectral shape, we calculated a sum of the slope differences (SSSD). Much like the SSR, this calculation examines the difference between measured and modeled slopes between each pair of 2229.pdf

bands, squared those values, and then summed the squared values. For both the SSR and SSSD, a low value indicates a good match to the measured spectrum. Finally, we calculate a “goodness of fit” parameter from the product of these two quantities, and the lowest fit parameter is identified as the “best fit” to the measured spectrum. Gaspra model assumptions and limits: In order to constrain the model and processing times, we have adopted several assumptions regarding the phases that are present and their compositions.  Macrophase abundances and compositions. The macrophase phase abundances of olivine, orthopyroxene, and the macrometal (Fe) phase are varied from 0100% at a 5% step size and the abundance of the opaque phase (Ilmenite or FeS) was varied 0-50% at a 5% step size. This produced 1,551 mineral combinations that total 100%. Submicroscopic phase abundances and sizes. The microphase (mp) and nanophase (np) metals were varied in composition between Fe And FeS. Both mp and np metal abundances were varied from 0.001-2% (values of 0.001, 0.002, 0.01, 0.1, 1%, and 2%) based on UV/VIS slope analyses [20], resulting in 36 combinations. The microphase metal grain size was set to 50, 100, 200, 600, 1,000, 2,000, and 3,000 µm. The model with the lowest value for the goodness of fit parameter was identified as the best-fit model spectrum. Results: Figure 2 shows the model results for an “average” region of Gaspra [20] that provided ilmenite as the opaque and Fe as the macrophase and nanophase metals. Iterations of the model showed that the best fits were obtained when the Mg number of mafic silicates was set to 75. This model included 70% orthopyroxene, 20% ilmenite, 10% MacroFe, 0.1% microphase Fe, and 0.1% nanophase Fe.  These results demonstrates the absolute necessity of including the effects of space weathering when modeling Gaspra (Fig. 2). Indeed, the spectrum calculated without any space weathering (upper gray line that continues beyond the upper limits of the plot) does is far too bright to match the measured spectrum (black line with circles). However, spectra calculated with space weathering (rainbow-colored lines) provide much better fits to the overall albedo and shape of the observed spectrum. The size of the microphase Mie particles varies from 50 nm (dark red line) to 3000 nm (purple line). In this case, the best fit model spectrum is for 100 nm mp particle size (red).  Summary: Space weathering causes drastic changes in reflectance spectra of materials and these effects must be properly included in spectral modeling efforts. In addition, it is important to provide the appropriate opaque and metal species for a given planetary body. Therefore, our model allows for these species to be varied and a statistical/visual comparison of model results to the observed spectrum so that the best fit can be identified. These results can be used to identify variations in the mineralogy of a planetary surface and to constrain the amount of space weathering present.  We will present the broader Gaspra model results for three representative regions and identify the best fit models identified from models derived using different opaques (ilmenite, FeS) and mp-/np-metals (Fe, FeS) while varying the rock composition, the mp/np abundances, and the mp particle size.
