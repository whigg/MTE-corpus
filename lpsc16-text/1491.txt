Lunaserv: Serving the Planetary Science Community.  N. M. Estes, J. Leland, A. J. Johnson, C. E. Miconi, E.Cisneros, S. J. Lawrence, and M. S. Robinson, School of Earth and Space Exploration, Arizona State University,nme@ser.asu.edu.Introduction: The Lunar Reconnaissance OrbiterCamera  Science  Operations  Center  (LROC  SOC)created  the  Lunaserv  Web  Map  Service  (WMS)software to solve key issues with previously existingWMS  software  when  handling  planetary  data.Improvements  made  to  Lunaserv  in  2015  includesupport  for  additional  bodies,  the  addition  of  theMollweide  projection  in  the  IAU2000  SpatialReference  System  (SRS)  namespace  [2],  and  manyimprovements to Lunaserv Global Explorer (LGE) thatwere  done as  part  of  the ISS  Instrument  IntegrationImplementation (I4) [3].Additional Bodies: Three bodies have been addedto the Lunaserv demonstration website: Pluto, Charon,and Vesta [4] (Figs. 1, 2, & 3). While Pluto and Charonwere included in the original IAU2000 SRS definition[2], asteroids were not. Support for Vesta was added tothe  IAU2000  SRS  namespace  following  theestablished mechanism for defining SRS codes usingthe NAIF asteroid ID for Vesta [5].  This follows theIAU2000 SRS conventions as closely as possible whileestablishing the NAIF asteroid ID as a way to includeany  additional  asteroids  in  the  IAU  2000  SRSnamespace in the future. The Vesta SRS options havebeen included in the Lunaserv demonstration site [4].The coordinate system used for Vesta in Lunaserv is"Claudia Double-Prime" [5, 6].Mollweide Projection: The original IAU2000 SRSnamespace proposal left room for future expansion toinclude  additional  projections.  The  Lunaserv  teamproposes to add four projections to the namespace forthe  Mollweide  projection.  Both  static  (centered  atlongitude  0)  and  AUTO  (dynamic  longitude  in  theWMS request), with both planetocentric and planetographic coordinates, are included in the set (Table 1).I4:  The Lunaserv team has been working with theEarth  Science  and  Remote  Sensing  Unit  of  theExploration  Integration  and  Science  Directorate  atNASA Johnson  Space  Center  to  develop  a  way  tointegrate data from many ISS instruments into a singlemapping  and  query  interface  [4,  11].  This  tool,  I4,renders all of the map data using Lunaserv, while theFigure 2: Pluto in orthographic centered on TombaughRegio [7].Figure 1: Charon, 1000 km square in north pole stereographic [8].Figure 3: Vesta DTM [9], rendered using LGE 3D [12].1491.pdf

query and map interfaces are based on the LGE webfront-end.  Parts  of  this  work  have  been  contributedback to the Lunaserv open-source project, including anew mobile-friendly, responsive design, the ability toreference Ruby code in a layer definition to constructmore  advanced  queries,  a  fully-dynamic  text  searchinterface  integrated  with  the  map,  and  a  number  ofminor display  improvements.Usage:  Based  on  web  usage  statistics,  Lunaservcontinues  to  be  a  valuable  resource  for  the  LROCteam, outside researchers, institutions, and the generalpublic.  From  March  2015  through  December  2015,Lunaserv  rendered  4.99  million  map  requests:representing  1.9  trillion  pixels  of  map  data.  SinceLunaserv supports the LROC PDS data interface, theMoon  is  by  far  the  most  requested  body, but  otherbodies  have  seen  a  large  amount  of  interest  as  well(Table 2).Work in Progress:  A tile  cache system is beingdeveloped for Lunaserv that should greatly increase thespeed of common map requests. Once complete, toolsrequesting high bit-depth, numeric data, such as LGE3D  [12],  or  tools  that  frequently  request  the  sameareas,  such  as  desktop  GIS  software,  should  see  asignificant improvement in overall performance.WMS is based on the HTTP protocol; however, atypical  HTTP  cache  is  of  limited  use  for  WMSrequests.  Lunaserv  sets  appropriate  cache  expirationtimes in the HTTP headers; however, by inserting thecache layer at a lower level inside Lunaserv, additionalbenefits  can  be  achieved.  These  benefits  includeindividual  layer  caching,  parameter  limiting (to  onlythose HTTP parameters affecting a layer), data-sourcebased cache expiration, and faster cache access times.The Lunaserv team anticipates that this feature will becomplete by June 2016.References:  [1]  Estes,  N.M.;  et.  al.;  (2013),Lunaserv Web Map Service: History, ImplementationDetails,  Development,  and  Uses  http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2013/pdf
