Introduction: The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera  Science  Operations  Center  (LROC  SOC) created  the  Lunaserv  Web  Map  Service  (WMS) software to solve key issues with previously existing WMS  software  when  handling  planetary  data. Improvements  made  to  Lunaserv  in  2015  include support  for  additional  bodies,  the  addition  of  the Mollweide  projection  in  the  IAU2000  Spatial Reference  System  (SRS)  namespace  [2],  and  many improvements to Lunaserv Global Explorer (LGE) that were  done as  part  of  the ISS  Instrument  Integration Implementation (I4) [3]. Additional Bodies: Three bodies have been added to the Lunaserv demonstration website: Pluto, Charon, and Vesta [4] (Figs. 1, 2, & 3). While Pluto and Charon were included in the original IAU2000 SRS definition [2], asteroids were not. Support for Vesta was added to the  IAU2000  SRS  namespace  following  the established mechanism for defining SRS codes using the NAIF asteroid ID for Vesta [5].  This follows the IAU2000 SRS conventions as closely as possible while establishing the NAIF asteroid ID as a way to include any  additional  asteroids  in  the  IAU  2000  SRS namespace in the future. The Vesta SRS options have been included in the Lunaserv demonstration site [4]. The coordinate system used for Vesta in Lunaserv is "Claudia Double-Prime" [5, 6]. Mollweide Projection: The original IAU2000 SRS namespace proposal left room for future expansion to include  additional  projections.  The  Lunaserv  team proposes to add four projections to the namespace for the  Mollweide  projection.  Both  static  (centered  at longitude  0)  and  AUTO  (dynamic  longitude  in  the WMS request), with both planetocentric and planetographic coordinates, are included in the set (Table 1). I4:  The Lunaserv team has been working with the Earth  Science  and  Remote  Sensing  Unit  of  the Exploration  Integration  and  Science  Directorate  at NASA Johnson  Space  Center  to  develop  a  way  to integrate data from many ISS instruments into a single mapping  and  query  interface  [4,  11].  This  tool,  I4, renders all of the map data using Lunaserv, while the Figure 2: Pluto in orthographic centered on Tombaugh Regio [7]. Figure 1: Charon, 1000 km square in north pole stereographic [8]. Figure 3: Vesta DTM [9], rendered using LGE 3D [12].  query and map interfaces are based on the LGE web front-end.  Parts  of  this  work  have  been  contributed back to the Lunaserv open-source project, including a new mobile-friendly, responsive design, the ability to reference Ruby code in a layer definition to construct more  advanced  queries,  a  fully-dynamic  text  search interface  integrated  with  the  map,  and  a  number  of minor display  improvements. Usage:  Based  on  web  usage  statistics,  Lunaserv continues  to  be  a  valuable  resource  for  the  LROC team, outside researchers, institutions, and the general public.  From  March  2015  through  December  2015, Lunaserv  rendered  4.99  million  map  requests: representing  1.9  trillion  pixels  of  map  data.  Since Lunaserv supports the LROC PDS data interface, the Moon  is  by  far  the  most  requested  body, but  other bodies  have  seen  a  large  amount  of  interest  as  well (Table 2). Work in Progress:  A tile  cache system is being developed for Lunaserv that should greatly increase the speed of common map requests. Once complete, tools requesting high bit-depth, numeric data, such as LGE 3D  [12],  or  tools  that  frequently  request  the  same areas,  such  as  desktop  GIS  software,  should  see  a significant improvement in overall performance. WMS is based on the HTTP protocol; however, a typical  HTTP  cache  is  of  limited  use  for  WMS requests.  Lunaserv  sets  appropriate  cache  expiration times in the HTTP headers; however, by inserting the cache layer at a lower level inside Lunaserv, additional benefits  can  be  achieved.  These  benefits  include individual  layer  caching,  parameter  limiting (to  only those HTTP parameters affecting a layer), data-source based cache expiration, and faster cache access times. The Lunaserv team anticipates that this feature will be complete by June 2016.
