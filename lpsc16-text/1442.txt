GLOBALLY SMOOTH EXPRESSIONS FOR SHOCK PRESSURE DECAY IN IMPACTS Thomas Ruedas1,2,1Institute for Planetology, University of Münster, Germany; 2Institute of Planetary Research, German AerospaceCenter (DLR), Berlin, Germany (t.ruedas@uni-muenster.de)Introduction: Hypervelocity meteorite impacts onplanets subject the target to very high shock pressures.The isobars in the affected region are approximatelyspherical and centered on a point at a certain depth below the point of impact. The decay of the shock pressure with increasing distance from that center is usuallyrepresented in the form [1]lg p = a+ n lg( rR), (1)where p is the shock pressure, r is the distance from thecenter of the sphere, R is the radius of the impactor, anda and n are fitting constants; a similar relation is alsoused for the particle velocity. Although its simplicityseems to speak in its favor, this form has some problems: it is not bounded from above, thus necessitatingan imposed maximum value that depends on additionalassumptions; the slope of the decay is not accurately described by a single n for all r; the transition between domains with different decay parameters introduces kinksinto p(r) at poorly defined points.It is therefore proposed to replace the decay laweq. 1 with other functional forms that are bounded andsmooth and can be fully derived from data from numerical experiments. The proposed functions are applied todata of dunite-on-dunite impacts from the literature.Method: The model function for the pressure decayshould be positive everywhere and have a single maximum at r = 0, i.e., at the center of the shock pressuresphere. It is convenient to normalize the pressure p(r)with the pressure determined from the impedance matchsolution pIM, which can be calculated from the materialparameters. The following alternative two model functions are considered:ppIM=ab+(rR)n (2a)ppIM= a arccot[b( rR)n]; (2b)these functions will be referred to as the "inverse-r" andthe "arccotangent" model, respectively. In the inverser model, the fitting parameters a and b are coupled bythe condition p(0)/pIM = a/b. If one wishes to enforce the impedance-match solution as the solution atr = 0, the constraint p(0)/pIM = 1 results in a = b anda = 2/pi for the inverse-r and the arccotangent model,respectively.Results: Numerical experiments have been carriedout by various authors for different material combinations, but there are few materials with such a broadTable 1: Some fits of eqs. 2 to dunite (% = 3320 kg/m3, C =6.5 km/s, S = 0.9, [4, 2]) data.

[2] have modeled dunite-on-dunite impacts for impact velocities vbetween 10 and 60 km/s, and this dataset has recentlybeen extended to lower v down to 4 km/s by [3]. Bothdatasets are of good quality and match quite well in thecase v = 10 km/s, where they overlap. The fits presented here are based on the data from these experiments, which were taken from the figures in the respective publications.As can be seen in Figure 1, the fits for both modelfunctions to the data at 4 and 60 km/s are very good,whereas the fit is less tight at 10 km/s. The reason forthe less good performance in the latter case is probably that the fit includes two different datasets that haveslightly different trends in the crucial overlap region; theindividual fits to each dataset match better, but differvisibly from each another, because the data from [2] donot reach far into the far field. Also shown are the fitsfrom [3] for 4 and 10 km/s and the general fit from [2]with the parameters for dunite (with a value of 0.22 replacing the erroneous b value 0.022 from their Table II),both of which have the form of eq. 1; those formulaehave been capped with the impedance-match solution,following common practice.The parameters for the fit are velocity-dependent inthe formulae by [2, 3] as well as in the models presentedhere. The previous workers have therefore constructedfits with the fitting parameters as functions of v. Following their example, the following tentative functionshave been derived for the inverse-r model:a(v) = 0.08061.478 (3a)b(v) = 0.2658v1.161 (3b)n(v) = −0.2034 + 1.9535 lg v; (3c)1442.pdf

(4c)However, due to the inhomogeneity and the limitationsin sampling of the two available datasets, eqs. 3 and 4work only well at v substantially higher than 10 km/s.It is expected that a homogeneous dataset covering theentire v range of interest would improve the quality of ageneral, v-dependent fit substantially. The v-dependentfits by previous workers are apparently not suited foruse much beyond their v range of calibration; for instance, the v-dependent exponent n in the general formula from [2] even reverses sign at v less than approximately 5 km/s and probably ceases to be reliable even atv above that limit. Even at 10 km/s, the possibly insufficient coverage of the [2] data of the far field may maketheir p(r) curve unreliable at large r, as can be seen inFigure 1b, although the fact that the models from [3]included fluidization and damage effects may also playa role. It was also found that there is a significant offset between the data and the p curve of [2] at high v ifthe transition between the isobaric core region and thedecay regime is made at the isobaric core radius determined from their formula. Therefore, their data were refitted to yield the modified formula shown in Figure 1c.It is hoped that future numerical models of hypervelocity impacts will cover the whole range of v from afew to several tens of km/s for different material combinations with a sufficiently dense sampling of all decaydomains, enabling an improved general fit of the datawith one of the model functions proposed here with fitting parameters represented in v-dependent functionalform. The figure shows that predicted p decays canvary substantially between different parameterizations,and as a consequence, so will shock heating estimatesespecially for the far field. Inaccurate calculations ofp will thus translate into inaccurate thermal models foruse in applications of these functions in mantle convection models.References: [1] T. J. Ahrens, et al.
