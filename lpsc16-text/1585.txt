POTENTIAL FOR MICROBIAL TRACES IN NEAR-SURFACE BASALTIC GLASS ON MARS. M. P. C.Nikitczuk1, M. E. Schmidt1, and R.L. Flemming2. 1Dept.

Western Ontario London, ON N6A 5B7 CanadaIntroduction: Considering the evidence ofmicrobially mediated glass dissolution [1,2], subsurface microbes inhabiting ocean basalts [3,4], tubularand granular bioalteration textures in sub-marine volcanic glass [5,6] and the widespread occurrence ofbasalts on Mars [7-9], there is a high likelihood thatMars presently or in the past hosted endolithic microbes [10-12]. On Earth,  bioalteration textures(endolithic microborings) have mainly been identifiedin sub-marine basalts hundreds of meters into the crustand submerged beneath kilometers of water [5,13,14].Until recently, Martian endoliths (if present) werethought to be relegated to the deep subsurface wherethe products of aqueous olivine alteration (e.g., CH4,H2), that are likely useful to anaerobic microbes maybe concentrated in porous basalts [10]. Although theMartian surface is cold, dry, has a low organic carboncontent, and is subject to intense ultraviolet radiation, itis possible that microbes have adapted to such conditions [15,16]. Recently discovered putative endolithicmicroborings in continental hydrovolcanic tuffs (FortRock Volcanic Field FRVF, Oregon), that are analogous to several locations on Mars demonstrate thatsuch textures can be produced in near-surface depositson Earth and that subsurface microbes on Mars couldexist nearer to the surface than previously thought.We here encapsulate the geologic environmentalsimilarities between FRVF hydrovolcanics and deposits on Mars and the potential for finding a near surfacebiosphere hosted in Martian volcanic glass. We focuson the occurrence of volcanic glass in similar geologicand environmental contexts with associated palagoniticphases and on the occurrence of other features indicative of hydrothermal/aqueous basalt alteration.Bioalteration Textures in Hydrovolcanic Tuffs:We recently reported finding microbial alteration (tubular and granular) textures in hydrovolcanic basalt tuffsformed in a continental lacustrine setting (Fig.1.) [17].The FRVF includes >40 hydrovolcanoes (maars, tuffrings/cones) and is the site of a Pliocene-Pleistocenepluvial lake [18]. A secondary alteration mineral assemblage of calcite, zeolites and smectite clays andamorphous to protocrystalline palagonite accompanybioalteration textures formed at temperatures of ~25 to80°C. Bioalteration textures in these deposits formed inneutral to alkaline water and in the absence of marineof glacial melt water.Geologic Context: Hydrovolcanic deposits identified on the Mars surface include the Home Plate outcrFig.1.

Landformsof likely hydrovolcanic origin (tuff rings and tuffcones) have been identified from orbit in various regions such as Tharsis [19]. Such hydrovolcanic landforms on Earth contain abundant basaltic glass, whichis a high quality substrate for microbial etching andthese are commonly hydrothermally altered.Lacustrine Environments: Sedimentary depositsexamined by MSL in Gale Crater, including theSheepbed mudstone member and Murray Formationare interpreted to have formed in a fluvio-lacustrinesetting [20]. The Sheepbed mudstone contains basalticmaterial and may include an ashfall component[20,21]. Phyllosilicate minerals (smectites) were identified by X-ray diffraction in the Sheepbed, suggestingAB60 µm20 µm1585.pdf

relatively neutral pH waters [22]. Additionally, theSheepbed lake likely experienced periodic drying [20],similar to the evaporative waxing and waning of pluvial lakes in Western U.S. (e.g., Fort Rock lake) causedby Pleistocene glacial fluctuations [23].Amorphous Material, Aqueous Alteration Minerals: Widespread across the Martian surface and inMartian dust is a significant amorphous component[9,22,24,25]. The amorphous material may includebasaltic glass or its devitrification products. It also includes nano-phase Fe-oxides and an amorphouspalagonite similar to phases frequently found in terrestrial basalts containing aqueously altered glass [25-27].In the FRVF basalts, the main alteration productsinclude amorphous to protocrystalline palagonite, zeolites such as chabazite, and smectite clays (nontroniteand saponite) formed during low temperature aqueous/hydrothermal alteration. Zeolites and smectiteclays (including saponite) have also been identified onthe Martian surface [22,28]. Geological and mineralogical compositional variations across Home Plateare consistent with low temperature aqueous/hydrothermal alteration as well [29].Liquid Water: Several lines of evidence suggestMars had ancient aqueous environments [20,22,29-33].Aqueous environments may also presently exist justbelow the Martian surface. Recurring slope lineae(RSL) for example, are thought to be formed by theintermittent flow of shallow subsurface fresh or brinywater [34,35]. If RSL were formed by the flow of shallow subsurface water, then abundant liquid water mayexist in some near-surface regions on Mars [34,35].Alteration Conditions and Microbes: On Earth,hydrovolcanics contain liquid water and a source ofbiogenic elements and energy (basaltic glass) forendolithic microbes. In oceanic and continental basalts,alteration temperatures of 60-70°C [13] and 25-80°C[17] respectively, are conducive to the production ofmicrobial biosignatures in circum-neutral to alkalineenvironments. The Sheepbed mudstone and Cumberland sample in Gale Crater lack highly ordered illiteand chlorite minerals that typically require high alteration temperatures, suggesting temperatures below 6080°C [22]. Also, the absence of sulfate veins, the presence of phyllosilicates and lack of evidence indicatingAl-mobility in the Sheepbed suggest an environmentwith neutral pH [20]. Hydrovolcanics/basaltic glassbearing deposits that have altered in circum-neutral toalkaline conditions at temperatures within the rangethat microbial life is known to exist [36] may thus beassociated with evidence of microbial activity on Mars.Conclusion: A key objective in future Mars missions (e.g., Mars 2020 Project) is to search for potential biosignatures [37]. Hydrovolcanics not only represent deposits in which near-surface microbial activityor evidence thereof may be found, but they also fulfillother threshold and qualifying geological criteria forevaluating potential landing sites. Threshold criteriainclude sub-aqueous sediments/hydrothermally alteredor low-T fluid altered rocks, minerals indicative ofaqueous alteration (e.g., phyllosilicates) and unalteredigneous float rocks [38]. Potential qualifying geological criteria such as evidence of water, secondary mineral assemblages, igneous rocks (radiometrically datable) and probability of samples of opportunity (e.g.,accidental and cognate clasts) are also likely. Therefore, in view of the science/geologic criteria,hydrovolcanic deposits may provide suitable targets forfuture rover/sample-return missions.References: [1] Thorseth IH et al. (1995) CG, 126,137.
