Introduction:  Each maria surface is comprised by several lava flows that can by distinguished morphologically as well as compositionally by different orbital data sets (e.g. [1] and refs. therein). Acquiring chemical composition, mineralogic and chronologic data from different lava flows is essential for a better understanding of the evolution of the mantle under each of the basins. In this study, we present new soil samples obtained by the Apollo 17 crew and collected along three small impact craters ejecta : Shorty, Steno and Camelot. These ejecta could potentially have sampled material form underlying lava flows and intercalated regolith (vertical profile).  This regolith probably represents an accumulation of local and distant material allowing to sample diverse lava flows within each maria (horizontal profile). Therefore, converging petrologic, chemical composition and chronology data from several basaltic regolith fragments together with literature data will improve the knowledge on the change of the sources composition of the basaltic lavas over time under the Serenitatis Basin - a window to that part of the lunar mantle.  Apollo 17 basaltic fragments selection:  A total of 25 2-4 mm fragments were selected at NASAJohnson Space Center Curatorial facilities from three different Apollo 17 soils: 71063/71064, 74243/74244 and 75063/75064. The initial "bulk" chemical composition of each unprocessed fragment was estimated using the M4-Tornado µXRF at the Natural History Museum in Copenhagen. This non-invasive procedure allows to prioritize samples representing a wide chemical array. This was followed by splitting the selected samples in  about two halves: one half was mounted with superglue as a thick section for petrologic Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Electron Micro Probe (EMP) work and U-Pb age determination. The second half will be used for 40Ar-39Ar analyzes. Figure 1 shows the µXRF data compared with literature data for basalts compiled by [2], bulk soil chemical composition of each soil [3] from where the basaltic fragments were pbtained, and the orbital data from Clementine and Lunar Prospector missions of the lava flow where the Apollo 17 lunar module landed and the astronauts collected samples. The chemical data obtained for the basaltic fragments do not fully match those of the mare basalt literature data due to differences in data acquisition methods and volume of analyzed material between this  preliminary assessment, the  orbital data, and literature data of basalt fragments. Nonetheless, it is possible to identify compositional similarities and chemical trends among the new suite of samples. Hitherto in this suite of samples, fragment 74244,12 (collected in station 4 by Shorty crater) most closely resembles the lava flow at the Apollo 17 landing site (Fig. 1).   Preliminary SEM and EMPA results: Initial visualization and sample characterization were performed by acquisition with SEM of backscattered images of areas of interest for each of the 12 Apollo 17 fragments (Fig. 2). Additionally, hyper-spectral elemental composition data were acquired. The basaltic fragments exhibit a wide range of textures and mineral compositions suggesting that the Apollo 17 regolith offers samples from various different lavas. Here we will focus only on four fragments, 71063,6, 71064,12, 75063, 5, and 75063,13 for which electron microprobe chemical composition are currently available.  Sample 71063,6 is a porphyritic chromite basalt with large euhedral olivine crystals mantled by ferrosilite. The groundmass is composed of zoned pyroxene (En28-40Wo13-21Fs47-59) and plagioclase. Opaques are chromite and pure-Fe. The fragment is cross-cut by a few fractures, and the large olivine phenocrysts (Fo3551) show a higher concentration of fractures within. Preliminary bulk groundmass composition suggest this to by a low-Ti (TiO2=0.7wt%), low-K (K=200 ppm) basalt. Sample 71064,12 is a rapidly cooled, devitrified glass of basaltic composition with very fine dendritic crystals. Some of these dendrites radiate outwards from olivine phenocryts. Adjacent to the blocky olivine phenocrysts (Fo54-57) are chromite crystals. Preliminary bulk analyses of the groundmass suggest this to be a high-Ti (TiO2=11wt%), low-K (K=500 ppm) basalt similar to basalt 75055.  Sample 75063,5 is an olivine basalt showing two- domains of different crystal size but similar mineralogic composition. This micro-grabbro indicates slow cooling permitting the different phases to grow. The coarser domain is composed of subheadral plagioclase (An89-92), olivine (Fo33-52) and pyroxene (En32-45Wo935Fs33-53) ranging from 0.5 to >1 mm. The plagioclase is completely enclosed by pyroxene and the olivine is partially enclosed by either pyroxene or plagioclase or occurs interstitially. The oxides are mainly blocky ilmenite.  The domain with smaller sized phases is com posed of the same mineralogy, however the ilmenite developed as small laths. The investigated specimen shows a small portion of mesostasis containing glass and FeS and other phases not yet characterized. Sample 75063,13 is a sample of an Apollo 17 type 1A, high-Ti, low-K, olivine porphyritic ilmenite basalt. This is a fine grained (<1 mm) basalt with subvariolitic textures and contains olivine (Fo48-53) and ilmenite phenocrysts and subhedral plagioclase (An9193). Most ilmenites are equant anhedral grains and a few are elongated with portions exhibiting dentrictic habit perhaps of armalcolite suggesting rapid cooling. In areas where the samples show an acicular-like texture fine plagioclase, pyroxene and glass are present.       Future Work: Further SEM and EMP data will be acquired in these and other 8 Apollo 17 fragments including search for phases suitable for in-situ U-Pb analyses. Due to the small sample size, only bulk sample 40Ar-39Ar data will be acquired in the next months and reported in the due course. Chemical composition and chronologic data will be used in petrogenetic modelling for mantle source composition assessment and then integrated into a 3D lunar mantle evolution model.
