Due to its high temperature, the protolunar disk may act as a thermochemical reactor in which the material is processed before being incorporated into the Moon. Here, we numerically explore the long term viscous evolution of the protolunar disk using a one dimensional model where the different phases (vapor and condensed) are vertically stratified. Our major innovation that we compute at the same time the proto-moon growth along with the disk evolution, and calculate the thermodynamical equilibrium of the proto-lunar seed as it grows.  We will discuss the long term dynamics, thermodynamics,  cooling timescale and possibility for volatile depletion. We show that differences viscosities of the liquid and vapor phase of the disk lead to a natural separation of the two phases, and then is a able to strongly deplete the moon in volatile elements. Combining this result with a thermodynamical model of vaporization we can put new constrains on the different scenarios of moon formation (standard, sub-earths, fast spinning Earth) and discuss their different advantages and problems for explaining today’s moon material content, in particular its low abundance in volatile elements relative to Earth mantle.  2012.pdf
