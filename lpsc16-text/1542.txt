Introduction: Lunar chlorine is unusual in that it is isotopically more variable and generally heavier than chlorine measured to date in any other rocks in the solar system. Isotopically heavy chlorine was first noted in lunar samples by [1], and it was interpreted as resulting from anhydrous degassing during eruption of mare basalts. Further analyses have now established the total range of lunar values as varying from -4‰ [2] to +81‰ [3]. The lava degassing hypothesis leads to specific predictions regarding the relationships between Cl, H, and their isotopes. We describe here tests of this hypothesis, and an alternative explanation for heavy Cl in lunar basalts [2]. Testing predictions based on the lava outgassing hypothesis: Three predictions have been made by [2] based on the anhydrous lava outgassing hypothesis [1] and can serve as tests of the hypothesis. Relationship between δ37Cl and Cl abundance: If the fractionation of Cl is related to loss of Cl during eruption, then we would expect that δ37Cl and Cl abundances would be inversely related, with higher δ37Cl being associated with lower Cl abundances. In contrast, we observe increasing Cl with increasing δ37Cl (Fig. 1A). This positive correlation suggests that isotopically heavy Cl was generated first by fractionation and then concentrated rather than having been generated directly by degassing during eruption. Relationship between δ37Cl and H2O abundance: If elevated δ37Cl was caused by anhydrous degassing, then all the samples (and their apatites) should be anhydrous. While it is difficult to constrain quantitatively the H2O content of coexisting melt based on the H2O content of apatite alone [4], none of the apatites are anhydrous and indeed they are comparable in this respect to terrestrial apatites (Fig. 1B). We conclude that in contrast to the conclusion of [1], anhydrous degassing is not required to elevate δ37Cl [5].  Fig. 2. Hydrogen isotopes vs chlorine isotopes for apatite from lunar basalts [2]. In situ data from the same crystals as filled symbols, hollow symbols indicate bulk δD data. There is no statistically significant relationship between δ37Cl and δD.  Fig. 1. Chlorine (A) and H2O (B) abundances in apatite from lunar basalts as a function of δ37Cl [2]. Chlorine is positively correlated with δ37Cl, requiring a second step of concentration after the loss associated with fractionation. Apatite with δ37Cl elevated relative to terrestrial basalts (all of them) are not anhydrous. 1542.pdf

Relationship between δ37Cl and δD: If elevated δ37Cl is caused by degassing, then whatever H2O was present in the magma should also fractionate by degassing [6] either before or during Cl loss. The process of H-loss and fractionation may be complex, but it is widely believed [6-8] that degassing of lunar magmas will lead to elevated D/H in the residual magma, and thus rocks with elevated δ37Cl should have elevated δD. This is not observed (Fig. 2). Lunar magma ocean – δ37Cl hypothesis: An alternative hypothesis was proposed by [2], in which chlorine is fractionated during the lunar magma ocean (LMO) phase. This hypothesis is largely motivated by correlations between δ37Cl and levels of enrichment in KREEP components: e.g., Th and La/Lu vs. δ37Cl (Fig. 3). Boyce et al. [2] demonstrated these correlations for mare basalts; Fig. 3 shows that except for one sample (Dhofar 458), the correlation between δ37Cl and enrichment in KREEP also holds when plutonic samples are included (Fig 3). Boyce et al. [2] also predicted that eucrites would have elevated δ37Cl, which is demonstrated elsewhere in this volume [9]. Fractionation of chlorine during a magma ocean phase: One of the challenges of the urKREEP-δ37Cl model of [2] is that the extent of degassing could be limited if the formation of a plagioclase flotation crust slowed or inhibited degassing. However, the idea that pressure prevents volatile loss may not be universally valid. Indeed, on Earth there is evidence that intrusive rocks can be depleted in volatiles relative to their precursors magmas [10]: For example, melt inclusions in rhyolitic magmas on Earth record elevated water contents (~4 wt % H2O average [11]), whereas bulk water contents of intrusive rocks similar in composition are generally much lower. Likewise, it appears that degassing to near-surface (i.e., ~1 atm) pressure can occur within magma chambers 1-3 km deep within Kilauea [12]. If degassing at depth on the Moon could occur, perhaps by a mechanism such as proposed by [13], this might explain how the LMO can lose most of its chlorine: e.g., perhaps there was insufficient time for large amounts of Cl and H2O to have been lost from the liquid in the LMO before a thick crust formed, but it may still have been possible for volatiles in the underlying residual LMO to escape through the permeable crust as is true for igneous systems on Earth [12]. The loss of chlorine may thus have started prior to the formation of a thick crust, but it might have continued as the residual LMO fractionated into urKREEP. Precisely how the LMO and urKREEP could have lost chlorine is unconstrained by experiment. Regardless, LMO degassing could result in a residual reservoir of chlorine—enriched in 37Cl, and also other incompatible elements—that can contaminate basalts and yield the observed relationships. Observations of secondary enrichment of lunar crustal rocks by phosphate metasomatism with elevated δ37Cl could be interpreted as supporting this hypothesis [14]. This result has implications for not only the formation of the Earth and Moon, but also the fingerprinting the sources of volatiles in the terrestrial planets.

Positive correlations are observed for basalts (blue, gray, and magenta from [2] and references therein) for both Th and La/Lu ratio, consistent with mixing between two end members. Non-basalts (intrusive crustal rocks and impact breccias, in red and green, respectively) show generally increasing Th and La/Lu with increasing δ37Cl, but reflect more complicated systematics. 1542.pdf
