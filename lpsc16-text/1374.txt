Examining the Potential Contribution of the Hokusai Impact to Water Ice on Mercury. Carolyn M. Ernst1, Nancy L. Chabot1, and Olivier S. Barnouin1, 1Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Laurel, MD 20723, USA (carolyn.ernst@jhuapl.edu).  Introduction: Hokusai crater and its global ray system comprise one of the most prominent features on the surface of Mercury. Hokusai was first detected in Earth-based radar images [e.g., 1], from which it was identified as a fresh large impact crater and termed “Radar B.” The MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft obtained the first optical images of the crater during its second flyby. Its remarkable ray system and dearth of superposed craters [2] indicate that Hokusai is among the youngest complex craters on the planet. Earth-based radar and MESSENGER observations have both provided compelling evidence that Mercury’s polar deposits are dominantly composed of water ice [3, 4]. Moreover, Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS) images of polar deposits in Mercury’s northpolar region have revealed sharp boundaries, indicating that the volatiles must either be actively restored or were recently delivered to Mercury [5]. Because Hokusai is the largest rayed crater on the planet, it is natural to examine the potential contribution of water ice from the Hokusai impactor. To do so, we have characterized the rays, ejecta, and morphology of the crater to constrain the impact conditions and derive a range of possible projectile sizes, with implications for volatile delivery to Mercury. Rays: It is immediately obvious that Hokusai has remarkably long rays for its size. Nothing quite like it is observed elsewhere on Mercury or on the Moon. The combination of a new color calibration [6] and a campaign conducted late in MESSENGER’s orbital mission to image the north-polar region in color at low phase angles [7] has enabled global reflectance-based mapping of Hokusai’s rays (Fig. 1). Analysis reveals rays extending as far as 7000 km from the crater center, distributed about the cavity with the largest concentration of rays located toward the southwest. Ejecta: The new color calibration and low-phase color map also enable reflectance-based mapping of Hokusai’s distal ejecta (Fig. 2). An extensive zone of immature material is observed to extend across the geological boundary of the northern plains, emplaced as far as ~1220 km (nearly 13 crater radii) from the crater rim in some directions. The distal ejecta are asymmetrically distributed about the crater, with the least extensive deposits to the east. Neutron spectrometry indicates that Hokusai’s distal ejecta may have a distinctive composition [8]. Another notable aspect of Hokusai’s ejecta are distal ramparts as high as 500 m, separated from the near-rim ejecta by a moat [2]. Such  Figure 1. Global extent of Hokusai’s ray system overlain on an MDIS mosaic in equirectangular projection, centered at 0ºN, 0ºE. Hokusai’s rim is indicated by the dark blue circle.  ramparts are not observed around most other craters on Mercury and suggest the action of a fluidizing agent. Morphology: Hokusai is 97.3 km in diameter, and its central peak is horseshoe-shaped, with an opening in approximately the southwestern direction. Previous work has shown that its ratio of depth to diameter is lower than most similarly sized complex craters, and it features wall terraces (except along the northeast section of the wall), a relatively smooth floor with cracking suggestive of cooling impact melt, and melt ponds in the terraces and in patches throughout the proximal ejecta [2]. Only two craters larger than 300 m in diameter are superposed on the floor of Hokusai [2]. Derived Impact Conditions: The presence of rays indicates that Hokusai is a young crater, formed during the Kuiperian system. This system extends from the present day to 100–300 Myr [9], placing an upper limit on Hokusai’s age. The ratio of ray length to crater diameter for Hokusai’s ten longest rays is approximately 55 to 1, a value that is anomalously high compared even with the outliers in previous measurements [10]. If this ratio is indeed indicative of crater age [10], Hokusai must be one of the youngest rayed craters on Mercury. The dearth of superposed craters on the floor supports this conclusion. There are several clues as to the angle and direction of impact. The approximately circular crater cavity suggests an impact angle (measured from the horizontal) ≥30º [11]. The asymmetry of the rays and distal ejecta suggest a moderately oblique impact angle: asymmetric ejecta deposits begin to be observed below 45º [11], but the absence of a true uprange zone of avoidance indicates an impact angle that is higher than 20º [12]. The presence of a horseshoe-shaped central peak suggests an impact angle between 20º and 40º [13].

indicate a consistent downrange direction of impact approximately to the southwest. For this analysis, we adopt an impact angle of 35º. The impact velocity, v, is more difficult to constrain. The mean impact velocity at Mercury is 42.5 km/s, but there is a wide distribution of predicted impact velocities (~15–75 km/s) [14]. We use three velocity values to estimate projectile size: 15, 42.5, and 75 km/s. Projectile Size Estimates: From crater scaling rules [15-17], the diameter and mass of the projectile can be estimated. Table 1 shows a matrix of calculations for an impact angle of 35º, exploring the full velocity parameter space and using a projectile density, ρ, of 2700 kg/m3 for an asteroidal impactor and 1000 kg/m3 for a cometary impactor. These calculations indicate a cometary projectile diameter in the range of approximately 9–21 km, corresponding to a mass range of approximately 1018–1019 g.  Table 1.

Implications for Volatile Delivery: Mercury’s total water ice abundance is estimated at ~1016–1018 g [4, 19]. The translation into projectile diameter depends on the composition of the impactor and the assumed water retention rate. Individual asteroidal projectiles would contain relatively little water, and given estimates of the Hokusai projectile size (Table 1) would not be expected to contribute substantial water ice to Mercury’s polar deposits. Cometary projectiles will contain far more water (≥50% [19]) but are likely to impact at higher velocities (e.g., ~65 km/s for Halley-type comets, ~39 km/s for Jupiter-family comets [19]), which would act to decrease retention rates [18, 19]. However, the obliquity of the Hokusai impact will help retention; a 45º impact has been calculated to retain 3.4 times more water than a 90º impact [19]. A substantial unknown is the amount of water retained after impact. A lunar study [18] estimated a water retention factor of ~0.1%, but the higher surface gravitational acceleration of Mercury should allow for a higher retention factor. Higher vapor retention factors at Mercury of 7% for Jupiter-family comets and 1.5% for Halley-type comets have been estimated [19]. On the basis of this full range of published retention probabilities (Table 1), the Hokusai impact could have contributed an amount of water ice that is at the low end of estimates for polar deposit mass with the 0.1% retention factor. Higher retention rates bring the possible contributed water ice mass well in line with the estimated polar deposit inventory.   Figure 2.
