  1  The impact-rotational mechanism and origin of the grooves on Phobos and other small asteroids  B.P. Kondratyev Sternberg Astronomical Institute, M.V. Lomonosov Moscow State University, 13 Universitetskij prospect, 119992, Russia Central Astronomical Observatory of Russian Academy of Sciences at Pulkovo, 196140, St. Petersburg   We present a new impact-rotational mechanism that explains the origin of grooves on Phobos. Its essence is that the boulders can move through the regolith and create the grooves, while their kinetic energy is supplied from the impact rotation of Phobos.   The geometric shape of Phobos approximately described by a triaxial ellipsoid with semi-axes                      1 2 313.09 , 11.72 , 9.48a km a km a km                                                                                          (1) (the average radius 11.3R km ). On surface of Phobos there is a deep (reaching100 m ) layer of regolith. The regolith on Phobos is rougher than on the Moon. The grooves on Phobos relatively narrow of the width 100 200 m with slanting edges and have several kilometers in length. Their depth is relatively small 10 30 .m  The length of some grooves sometimes reaches 20 .km  On Phobos there are three systems of grooves. Each family of grooves is of a different age. Grooves in each family are strictly parallel each other. The first system, in the accepted classification is «A» system, is the oldest, the grooves belonging to it go from the Stikney crater and are located in the meridional planes passing through the greatest axis of Phobos.    With all the richness of bright ideas, the previous hypotheses of forming the grooves on Phobos didn't solve a problem of so-called energy paradox. Essence of this paradox consists in the following: to create the groove of middle length, a boulder must have such velocity that exceeds the escape velocity from Phobos. The impact-rotational mechanism solves this energy paradox.     1. The main question: is it possible to use the forces                  212 .2ddt      F = x xx                                                                                   (2) which arise from additional rotation of Phobos with the angular velocity      2.

Here 256.5 10K erg  is the energy of formation of the crater Stikney. An conclusion ensues from it, that the Phobos’s rotational energy rotE is inversely proportional kinetic energy of the impactor.     4. The probable reason of absence of grooves in the region Laputa.
