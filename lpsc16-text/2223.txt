Introduction:  Multiple X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses carried out by the CheMin instrument [1] onboard the Mars Science Laboratory rover Curiosity have shown the ubiquitous presence of a significant Xray amorphous component in rocks and soils at Gale crater [2-4]. Mass balance calculations using CheMin mineral assemblages and APXS bulk chemical compositions have shown that the amorphous component is Fe-rich [3-6]. Based on these results, it has been hypothesized that ferrihydrite could be one of the phases making up the amorphous component [4,6]. Ferrihydrite is a poorly-crystalline, disordered iron oxide species. Its most accepted chemical formula is 5Fe2O3·9H2O [e.g., 7], although other formulas have been proposed. Its XRD pattern displays only broad and shallow peaks, the number of which is used to distinguish three different varieties: 2-line, 3-line and 6line ferrihydrite [8]. Ferrihydrite is not stable on long timescales and tends to transform into more crystalline iron oxides [7,8]. Therefore, its possible presence in the amorphous component of Gale crater could be used to constrain the burial and/or alteration conditions encountered by the local sediments/rocks. Accordingly, we present here a series of experiments exploring the stability of 2-line ferrihydrite in various conditions relevant to Mars in general, and Gale crater in particular. Methods:  A 2-line ferrihydrite was synthesized using the method of [8]. Following [7], we used centrifuging and natural drying in a fume hood to avoid formation of more crystalline 3-line ferrihydrite. Several syntheses were necessary to obtain the amount of material required for the experiments, and each batch was confirmed to be X-ray amorphous. Ferrihydrite is known to spontaneously recrystallize even at room conditions, therefore we also checked the stability of our synthetic products over time. Initial and altered samples were stored in a vacuum chamber to mitigate such unwanted recrystallization. Low-temperature (LT) experiments were conducted in a jacketed reaction chamber held in a water bath. The internal temperature was maintained at 40 (±1) °C for 1 month. Samples consisted of pure ferrihydrite (FH) or mixtures of ferrihydrite with silica gel (SG) or olivine (OL). Several conditions were tested: dry samples (i.e., no addition of water), wet samples (addition of ultrapure water, liquid-to-solid mass ratio of 1:1), and low pH conditions. For the latter conditions, three acid mixtures (A1 to A3, Table 1) were prepared using ultrapure water and reagent grade acids. Mixtures A1, A2 and A3 are similar to acid mixtures E, C and A used by Tosca et al. [9], respectively. High-temperature (HT) experiments were conducted using an PTFE liner placed in an oven. The temperature was maintained at 150 (±5) °C for 8 days. Samples consisted of pure ferrihydrite or mixtures of ferrihydrite with silica gel or olivine. Only dry and wet conditions were tested at HT. XRD analyzes were carried out using a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer equipped with a Cu source. Mössbauer spectra were collected at Mount Holyoke College on a Web Research Co. (now See Co.) W100 spectrometer using a ~70 mCi 57Co source.  Acid mixture H2SO4 (mol/L) HCl (mol/L) A1 1.0 x 10-4 2.5 x 10-5 A2 1.0 x 10-2 2.5 x 10-3 A3 1.0 2.5 x 10-1 Table 1 - Acid mixtures used in LT experiments.  Preliminary results:  Below are described the preliminary results obtained for selected samples. LT experiments.  XRD patterns of pure ferrihydrite samples altered at LT show little to no changes for most conditions (Fig. 1). New diffraction peaks appeared only for the most acidic experiment (acid mixture A3, Table 1). They are located at roughly 21.2, 33.3, 34.6, 36.6, 40.2 and 53.2 degrees 2θ and can all be attributed to goethite [10; and references therein]. However, the breadth and low intensity of these peaks suggest the presence of a poorly-crystalline goethite or an incomplete transformation of the initial ferrihydrite. We note that no sulfate was formed despite the high concentration of sulfuric acid in this experiment. HT experiments.  XRD patterns of pure ferrihydrite samples altered at HT show evidence for major modifications (Fig. 2). Sharp diffraction peaks at roughly 24.2, 33.2, 35.7, 40.9, 49.5, 54.1, 57.6, 62.5 and 64.0 degrees 2θ reveal the transformation of ferrihydrite into hematite, as observed in [10] and references therein. The two humps typical of 2-line ferrihydrite are no longer present, suggesting complete transformation. Peaks are less intense for the "wet" sample (FH-150-W), suggesting that hematite formed under these conditions is not as well-crystalline as in dry conditions. 2223.pdf

 Figure 1 - XRD patterns (Cu-Kα) of ferrihydrite (FH) samples altered at low temperature. D = dry; W = wet (1:1 liquid-to-solid mass ratio); A1-A3 = acid mixtures.  Sample FH/SG-150-D (dry mixture of ferrihydrite and silica gel) displays hematite peaks superimposed on the silica hump from ~16 to 30° 2θ. Sample FH/SG150-W sample (mixture of ferrihydrite and silica gel with water) shows much broader hematite peaks (Fig. 2). This suggests that the presence of amorphous silica and water might slow down the transformation of ferrihydrite into hematite. Low temperature (7 K) Mössbauer analyses of several samples (Fig. 3) were performed to elucidate the phases that appeared superparamagnetic at 295 K. Spectra show that the starting material is pure ferrihydrite, as are all other samples, except for FH-40-A3, which is a fine-grained or poorly-crystalline goethite. Discussion and future work:  Our preliminary results suggest that ferrihydrite could have been exposed to low-temperature fluids at or near the surface of Gale crater without recrystallizing. Only very acidic conditions - for which there is no indication in the Yellowknife Bay area [3] - would cause its transformation into poorly-crystalline goethite at low water-to-rock ratio. On the other hand, if ferrihydrite was buried deep under Aeolis Mons [11] and/or exposed to hydrothermal fluids, it would have been readily transformed into hematite, although the coexistence of amorphous silica could have somewhat inhibited this process. Future work will include the completion of XRD and Mössbauer analyzes. In addition, we plan to characterize our samples using VNIR (visible/nearinfrared) and Raman spectroscopy.

Figure 3 - 7 K Mössbauer spectra of ferrihydrite samples altered at low temperature. The shift of the sextet is indicative of the mineralogy change from ferrihydrite to goethite.
