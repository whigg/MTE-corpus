(nico.schmedemann@fu-berlin.de)  Introduction:  The highly successful Dawn mission [1] finished data collection at Vesta in 2012, went into orbit about Ceres in March 2015 and began to acquire high resolution imaging data from its Low Altitude Mapping Orbit (LAMO) in December 2015. In our LPSC abstract last year [2] we proposed a preliminary lunar-derived chronology for Ceres on a theoretical basis. Analysis of the crater size-frequency distribution (CSFD) from higher resolution imaging data obtained during the Survey orbit, High Altitude Mapping Orbit (HAMO) as well as Low Altitude Mapping Orbit (LAMO) shows high consistency with that crater production function (PF) of [2] (Fig.1).   Fig. 1: Vertically normalized CSFD of six different measurement areas on Ceres in comparison with a theoretically derived PF [2].  The high content of volatile materials on Ceres [3] as well as the comparatively well known impact conditions (projectile source and impact velocity) make Ceres an important key to understanding the cratering records of icy satellites in the outer Solar System. Saturnian satellites are more similar in their target properties to Ceres than to basaltic bodies, such as the Moon or Vesta [2]. Ceres and Rhea were shown to be highly similar [4,5] in their target properties as well as their CSFDs, if only corrected for different exposure ages. In this work we derive the PF for the Jovian satellites Ganymede and Callisto based on scaling laws [6] and derivation techniques used for the Cerean PF [2]. The resulting PFs are compared with measured CSFDs in a complementary work presented by Wagner et al. at this conference.  Methodology: For scaling between crater sizes and projectile sizes on various bodies we use tentatively the Ivanov scaling laws for low friction low porocity materials (Eq 1) [6].     (1)  Dt is the diameter of the transient crater and DP is the diameter of the projectiles. For simple craters the transient crater diameter is nearly the same as the final crater diameter. [6] gives a second equation for computing the diameter of complex craters from the transient crater diameter. We plan more work to take into account more relevant scaling laws. Weak targets such as icy satellites show significantly smaller simple to complex crater transitions than stronger basaltic targets [6]. This can be accommodated within the scaling laws by using a modified surface gravity for the weak target bodies that corresponds to the surface gravity of strong target bodies at the same simple to complex transition crater diameter [2]. Table 1 gives the used parameters for Ceres, Ganymede and Callisto. With respect to [2] Ceres parameters in Table 1 are slightly changed based on observations during the Dawn at Ceres mission. The simple to complex transition diameters for Ganymede and Callisto are taken from [7], and impact velocities are taken from [8].

The planetocentric cases for Ganymede and Callisto are nearly identical but are distinct from the heliocentric cases. Hence, the observed crater distributions may allow us to determinate the predominant projectile dynamics. This is a preliminary work and several issues such as variable surface temperatures on the individual bodies have not yet been addressed.
