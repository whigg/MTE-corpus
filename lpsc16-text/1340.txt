Figure  1shows  a  normal  albedo  map  (mosaic)  including  thecrater Alphonsus that was calculated (see below) usingseveral  hundreds  of  individual  LROC  WAC imagesacquired  at  λ = 689  nm.  The  crater  is  opticallyheterogeneous.  In  particular,  dark  mantles  areprominent  features.  We  apply  LROC  WAC data  tocompare optical roughness [2, 8] of the dark spots withthe surrounding areas. Figure 1. The distribution of the normal albedo A0Geology of the crater: Eight material units makeup  Alphonsus  crater  (Fig.  2)  and  its  immediatesurroundings.  Highland  materials  (undifferentiated,unit h) represent the background terrain. To the west ofAlphonsus,  local  to regional lows are  filled by marematerials (unit m) that represent the eastern edge of theMare Nubium lava fill. The oldest units inside craterAlphonsus are materials on the wall (unit  wa) and thefloor (unit fla) of the crater. Materials on the walls arethose of the highlands re-exposed after the Alphonsusimpact.  Morphologically,  materials  on  the  floor  aresmooth  plains.  Ejecta  from  a  crater  outside  ofAlphonsus (unit  re) overlay the medial portion of theAlphonsus floor.  The most likely parent crater of theejecta  is  crater  Arzachel  (~100  km  in  diameter)immediately  to  the  south  of  Alphonsus.  CraterAlphonsus belongs to the class of the floor-fracturedcraters [3,4]. Graben within crater Alphonsus (unit  g)are concentrated in the eastern half of the floor wherethese structures form several N-S-oriented branches. Inthe southern portion of the floor, graben are oriented inESE-WMW direction. The graben in their medial partsare ~0.5-1.0 km wide and tens to a few hundred metersdeep.  Graben  cut  walls,  floor,  and  remote  ejectamaterials. Figure 2.  Geological map of the crater Alphonsus The  dark  mantling  deposits  (unit  dm)  withdiameters ranging from~3 to 12 km occur on the floorof Alphonsus. All of them are closely associated withthe systems of graben and postdate them. Most of thedark deposits are concentrated in the eastern part of thefloor  (Fig.  2).  Circular  or  slightly  elongateddepressions  usually  occur  in  the  center  of  the  darkmantles  and  likely  represent  the  deposit  vents.  Themantles  have  an  equidimensional  shape  that  isapproximately symmetric relative to the apparent vents.The dark mantling materials are usually interpreted aspyroclastic deposits [1,5,6]. Small (tens of meters to ~2 km in diameter) craterswith  visually  brighter  ejecta  represent  the  youngestmaterials  exposed  inside  and  outside  of  craterAlphonsus. Several tens of small fresher craters occurwithin the dark mantles. Ejecta from these craters mayrepresent either materials excavated from beneath themantles or simply less mature, hence brighter, regolith. Excluding  young  craters,  the  Alphonsus  floorsurface is rather old, since it does not show variationsof the parameter OMAT that characterizes the maturitydegree of the lunar regolith [7].

mantles mentioned above are not seen in the OMATmap shown in Fig. 3. Figure 3. The distribution of the parameter OMAT [7] Optical  roughness:  We  study Alphonsus  usingLRO optical  measurements to confirm the hypothesisthat  the  dark  mantles  can  be  related  to  pyroclasticdeposits. To characterize the optical roughness, we usethe following new approximation of lunar phase curves[8]: 0 exp( )Arha- , where α is the phase angle and theparameters  A0,  η,  and  ρ are,  respectively,  the normalalbedo,  total  slope  and  bend  of  phase  curve.  Theseparameters were calculated for each point of the lunarsurface in the scene using the mean-square method andtens of LROC WAC images acquired at different phaseangles from a range of ~9-80º; the average number ofpoints for the phase-curve approximation is about 140.A detailed description of the processing is presented in[2, 8]. Maps of the parameters are shown in Figs. 1, 4,and 5. The normal albedo map shows that the crater floormaterial and surrounding surface have almost the samebrightness,  which  implies  equal  abundance  ofchromophore elements such as Fe and Ti (Fig. 1). Ascan be seen, the map of  η demonstrates a very closecorrelation with  A0 (cf. Figs. 1 and 4). This indicatesthe total slope of the phase curve depends not only onthe surface roughness, but on the albedo as well [9].Moreover, we found that the parameter η depends alsoon the wavelength λ. In contrast, the parameter  doesnot depend on  λ and very slightly correlates with thealbedo  [8].  This  means  that  the  bend  relates  to  thesurface structure. Low values of ρ correspond to areaswith higher  bend of  phase curves.  The dark  mantlesshow bent  phase  curves  (Fig.  5).  Thus,  the  surfaceroughness responsible for the shadows at large phaseangles (rock fields), is lower for the dark mantles. Thisis consistent with the pyroclastic origin of the mantlesbecause the pyroclastic  deposits  may smooth out  thepreexisting surface. Unlike the dark mantles, the youngcraters (Fig.  5) show low bend in spite of the higheralbedo. This is because the ejecta of such craters aremuch rougher than the surrounding terrains. Figure 4.
