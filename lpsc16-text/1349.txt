SHOCK-DARKENING IN ORDINARY CHONDRITES: PRESSURE-TEMPERATURE p-T CONDITIONSSTUDY BY IMPACT MODELLING.  J. Moreau1, T. Kohout¹,² and K. Wünnemann3, 1Department of Physics, University of Helsinki, Finland (julien.moreau@helsinki.fi),  2Institute of Geology, The Czech Academy of Sciences,Prague, Czech Republic, ³Museum für Naturkunde, Berlin, Leibniz Institute for Evolution and Biodiversity Science,Berlin, Germany.Introduction:  Shock-darkening in ordinary chondrites is the partial melting of metals and iron sulphidein a network of melt into veins and the silicate cracks,remaining solid themselves. With the recent fall of theChelyabinsk  LL5  meteorite,  such  features  has  beenstudied in [1] and can be seen in Fig. 1. It is a cause forthe changes in the reflectance spectra  of these meteorites,  making their  classification more difficult  ([2],[3]). In such cases, S-type asteroids (chondritic silicatecomposition) spectra look like C-type asteroids (associated with carbonaceous chondrites).Methods:  Tostudy  the  pressure and temperatures p-T conditions  at  whichthis  process  occurs,  we use theshock  physicscode iSALE [4].In the parameterswe include materials  typical  ofordinary  chondrites:  olivine (Fa25 or Fa10) at ~96% iron grains and or/troilite (approximated in themodels with a pyrrhotite material)Olivine has a porosity of 6%. These settings are consistent with an LL5 ordinary chondrite with a compositiondominated by olivine Fa27, iron metal and troilite.Equations of state (EOS). An equation of state describes a material behavior under shock-pressure. It canbe compared to shock experiment Hugoniots data. Weused either a Tillotson EOS [5] or an analytical EOS(ANEOS). Both EOS require a number of material-specific input parameters such as: the density the bulk modulus the internal energy the compressionIn Fig. 2 and Fig. 3,the  Hugoniots  datafrom  the  TillotsonEOS,  ANEOS  andliterature  for  different  material  including  olivine  Fa25[adapted from 6] andFa10 (ANEOS)  canbe seen. One issue isthe  limitation  of  theTillotson  EOS  notaccounting for phasechanges  in  olivine.Low  pressuresphases  are  wellfitted  in  the  firstgraphic  (Fig. 2)but is an issue inthe  second  (Fig.3, important  forthe  post-shocktemperatures  calculation).  In  Fig.4  a  good  fit  forthe Tillotson EOSof  Troilite    topyrrhotite  ironsulphide  can  beseen. Porosity and strength. In iSALE, porosity is considered in two ways: finely dispersed in the material (asa material parameter, distension α = 1 / (1–Φ) where Φis the porosity fraction [4])  or in resolved individualpores. In the models we use the distension α. Concerning the strength model, the material is defined either ashydrodynamic or perfect plastic (Von Mies model, using the yield strength as the only parameter).Fig 1. Chelyabinsk meteorite samples and their electron microscope  snapshots.Fig  4.  Hugoniots  data  for  pyrrhotite  towhich a Tillotson EOS for troilite is fit tobe used in the modelling. The bulk modulus  was one  of  the  only parameters  thatneeded to be changed  from the  TillotsonEOS parameters to fit the data points.Fig 3.

Post-shocktemperatures(PST's).  Tostudy  the  meltfraction, we defined  the  postshock  temperatures relative tothe  peak-shockpressures.  Afterthe shock-wave,pressures  dropto  0,  residualenergy is  translated to post-shock temperatures (Fig.  5).  We used alinear relationship existing in the Hugoniots data (seeFig 3 and Fig. 4) giving U = C + S.up, with up – particle velocity and U – shock-wave velocity. [7,8,9] Results: Using  tracers,  we  can  study  the  peakshock pressures  in  a  material  to  compute the PST's.The melt fraction  of  thematerial  isthen  assessed.In  Fig.  6  canbe seen a theoretical example  of  postshock  resultsusing   amesoscalemodel  with  a50  cells  thickflyer  plate(over  the  0mm  mark  inthe first panel)hitting  a  450cells  thicksample  platemade  of  nonporous  andhydrodynamicolivine  Fa10(ANEOS) and sub-mm iron grains (ANEOS). Conclusion: The key result of our study is the behaviour of the material under shock pressures (EOS').Using PST's and material melting temperatures, we obtained  a  good  approximate  for  which material  meltsfirst. Furthermore, troilite seems to be the best candidate for a complete melt with an unmolten or partiallymolten silicate phase.  We also noticed the strong dependence of the material and the associated EOS' andHugoniots data. A propagating shock-wave will causereflections on  the iron  grain  boundaries  with olivinewhere the peak-shock pressures attained will depend onthe material and how well it reflects the shock-wave.Such shock-wave reflection will heat the surroundingmaterial  (olivine)  due  to  higher reflected  peak-shockpressures.Future  Work: From  constraining  the  materialEOS, the strength model and porosity, the next step isto implement a mesoscale model [10] with olivine, ironand  troilite  grains  included  (separately  or  together).Completing this study will help us to get the best p-Tconditions at which shock-darkening  occurs and therefore leading to experiments with real samples.Acknowledgments: Our thanks go to the team ofthe Museum für  Naturkunde in Berlin,  Germany, forsharing their knowledge and ideas with us.
