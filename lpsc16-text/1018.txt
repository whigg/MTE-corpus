EARTH-LIKE INTERIOR STRUCTURE MODELS FOR THE TRANSITING TERRESTRIAL EXOPLANETS:KEPLER-78B AND KEPLER-93B. P. Futó1 1 University of West Hungary, Szombathely, Károlyi Gáspár tér,H-9700, Hungary (dvision@citromail.hu)Introduction: Two  interesting  low-mass  rocky  exoplanets have been discovered  by the NASA's KeplerMission. The smaller-sized planet orbits very close inan 8.5-hour orbit to its late G-type star Kepler-78 [1].The stellar parameters of the host star are:Mstar  =0.81M⊙,Rstar =0.74 R⊙ and Teff = 5089 K [1]. The planet b isthought to be a terrestrial one slightly larger than Earthwith a radius of 1.173 R  [2] ,which can be classifiedinto the category of Earth-sized planets. It is more massive than of our planet with a mass of 1.86 M. The orbital period is much (by a factor of 36) smallerthan  the  stellar  rotation  period  (12.8  days)  [3].Themean density is,slightly higher than that of Earth,calculated to get:5.57 g cm-3  this value is consistent with aterrestrial-like composition. Kepler-78 b has an orbitaldistance of 0,01 AU thus it is an USP (ultra-short period ) planet. Its orbit is likely to be tidally-locked dueto it being only 100 times farther from the central starthan its diameter. The estimated surface temperature is2250 K, thereupon the top layer of the planet is completely melted, which is covered by lava ocean.Kepler-93b is a typical hot super-Earth orbiting with aperiod of 4.7267-day orbit in the proximity of its Gtype host star. The radius of this super-Earth-sized terrestrial world is 1.478 R  [4]. The planetary mass hasbeen  precisely  measured  by  the  HARPS-N  spectrograph in 2014 and found 4.02 M [5].  Its  computedmean density 6.867 g cm-3   refers to a terrestrial composition,too.The purpose of this study is to estimate the major physical properties of the interior structures of  Kepler-78band  Kepler-93b  that  have  been  proposed  to  haveEarth-like compositions.Modeling:  I have determined planetary properties using equation of states [6,7] for calculating the internalstructure. Basic physical parameters have also been investigated  focusing  on  central  pressure  (Pc),surfacegravity (g).Supposing  the  compositional  similarity  to  the  Earth,upper-mantle in both cases composed mostly of olivine[(Mg,Fe)2  SiO4],wadsleyite  and  ringwoodite.  Thelower region of the mantle consists of perovskite/postperovskite phase of MgSiO3 and the central structuralunit shows  Fe/Ni core. Taking into account the relevant material parameters,zero-pressure densities for themain compounds 8.3 g cm-3  (iron), 4,1 g cm-3 (silicateperovskite),4,26g  cm-3  (post-silicate-perovskite)  havebeen utilized for the calculations.A power law was applied to parameterize mass-radiusrelations for small-sized exoplanets ranging from 1 to10 Earth masses by using of the data of the NASA Exoplanet Archive. Based on the model of Valencia et al.(2006)[8],using the relationship of M=R0.269,I  utilizedthe one of the best fits in the category of super-Earthsto examine the core mass fraction/mantle mass fraction(CMF/MMF) ratios of massive terrestrial planets.Composition of  Kepler-78b:The  central  pressure  ofthe planet is larger than that of Earth with an obtainedvalue of  630 GPa  and the globally calculated surfacegravity is 13.263 m s-2. The core radius is found to be0.672  R   (Fig.1) which value (computing 57.29 percent of the total planetary radius) is slightly larger thanthe  core/planet  radius  ratio  of  the  Earth.  Hence  itsstructure is approximately analogous to that of Earth.Originally,Kepler-78 b might have had a larger mantlemass fraction (MMF) which had been lost in a smallfraction  by  a  mantle  stripping  process.  In  presenttime,the planet may have a slightly smaller MMF thanat formation.  Composition  of  Kepler-93b:The  globally  computedsurface gravity is  17.984 m s-2  and the obtained central pressure is 1158 GPa.  I found that the calculatedinterior structure slightly differs from Earth-like composition. Kepler-93b has  a slightly larger radius for itsmeasured  mass,thus the planet  must have a mediumsized  core  with  a  radius  of   0.774  R  (Fig.2).Thecore/planet radius is slightly smaller (52.37 percent theplanet radius) than in case of the Earth.Many terrestrial-like planets have been identified in thepopulation  of  close-in  planets.  I  found  that  roughlytwo-thirds of the confirmed terrestrial exoplanets up todate,have medium-and large sized metallic core. Consequently,rocky planets  with medium-mass and  massive metallic cores might be more frequent than rockyplanets with small core.1018.pdf
