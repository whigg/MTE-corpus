 EARTH-LIKE INTERIOR STRUCTURE MODELS FOR THE TRANSITING TERRESTRIAL EXOPLANETS:KEPLER-78B AND KEPLER-93B. P. Futó1 1 University of West Hungary, Szombathely, Károlyi Gáspár tér, H-9700, Hungary (dvision@citromail.hu) Introduction: Two  interesting  low-mass  rocky  exoplanets have been discovered  by the NASA's Kepler Mission. The smaller-sized planet orbits very close in an 8.5-hour orbit to its late G-type star Kepler-78 [1]. The stellar parameters of the host star are:Mstar  =0.81 M⊙,Rstar =0.74 R⊙ and Teff = 5089 K [1]. The planet b is thought to be a terrestrial one slightly larger than Earth with a radius of 1.173 R  [2] ,which can be classified into the category of Earth-sized planets. It is more massive than of our planet with a mass of 1.86 M. The orbital period is much (by a factor of 36) smaller than  the  stellar  rotation  period  (12.8  days)  [3].The mean density is,slightly higher than that of Earth,calculated to get:5.57 g cm-3  this value is consistent with a terrestrial-like composition. Kepler-78 b has an orbital distance of 0,01 AU thus it is an USP (ultra-short period ) planet. Its orbit is likely to be tidally-locked due to it being only 100 times farther from the central star than its diameter. The estimated surface temperature is 2250 K, thereupon the top layer of the planet is completely melted, which is covered by lava ocean. Kepler-93b is a typical hot super-Earth orbiting with a period of 4.7267-day orbit in the proximity of its Gtype host star. The radius of this super-Earth-sized terrestrial world is 1.478 R  [4]. The planetary mass has been  precisely  measured  by  the  HARPS-N  spectrograph in 2014 and found 4.02 M [5].  Its  computed mean density 6.867 g cm-3   refers to a terrestrial composition,too. The purpose of this study is to estimate the major physical properties of the interior structures of  Kepler-78b and  Kepler-93b  that  have  been  proposed  to  have Earth-like compositions. Modeling:  I have determined planetary properties using equation of states [6,7] for calculating the internal structure. Basic physical parameters have also been investigated  focusing  on  central  pressure  (Pc),surface gravity (g). Supposing  the  compositional  similarity  to  the  Earth, upper-mantle in both cases composed mostly of olivine [(Mg,Fe)2  SiO4],wadsleyite  and  ringwoodite.  The lower region of the mantle consists of perovskite/postperovskite phase of MgSiO3 and the central structural unit shows  Fe/Ni core. Taking into account the relevant material parameters,zero-pressure densities for the main compounds 8.3 g cm-3  (iron), 4,1 g cm-3 (silicateperovskite),4,26g  cm-3  (post-silicate-perovskite)  have been utilized for the calculations. A power law was applied to parameterize mass-radius relations for small-sized exoplanets ranging from 1 to 10 Earth masses by using of the data of the NASA Exoplanet Archive. Based on the model of Valencia et al. (2006)[8],using the relationship of M=R0.269,I  utilized the one of the best fits in the category of super-Earths to examine the core mass fraction/mantle mass fraction (CMF/MMF) ratios of massive terrestrial planets. Composition of  Kepler-78b:The  central  pressure  of the planet is larger than that of Earth with an obtained value of  630 GPa  and the globally calculated surface gravity is 13.263 m s-2. The core radius is found to be 0.672  R   (Fig.1) which value (computing 57.29 percent of the total planetary radius) is slightly larger than the  core/planet  radius  ratio  of  the  Earth.  Hence  its structure is approximately analogous to that of Earth. Originally,Kepler-78 b might have had a larger mantle mass fraction (MMF) which had been lost in a small fraction  by  a  mantle  stripping  process.  In  present time,the planet may have a slightly smaller MMF than at formation.  Composition  of  Kepler-93b:The  globally  computed surface gravity is  17.984 m s-2  and the obtained central pressure is 1158 GPa.  I found that the calculated interior structure slightly differs from Earth-like composition. Kepler-93b has  a slightly larger radius for its measured  mass,thus the planet  must have a mediumsized  core  with  a  radius  of   0.774  R  (Fig.2).The core/planet radius is slightly smaller (52.37 percent the planet radius) than in case of the Earth. Many terrestrial-like planets have been identified in the population  of  close-in  planets.  I  found  that  roughly two-thirds of the confirmed terrestrial exoplanets up to date,have medium-and large sized metallic core. Consequently,rocky planets  with medium-mass and  massive metallic cores might be more frequent than rocky planets with small core.  Figure  1. Internal  structure  model  for  Kepler-78 b,showing similar ratios in structural units than that of the Earth. Figure  2.  Two-component  compositional  model  for Kepler-93b with a medium-sized core. Summary:Kepler-78b and Kepler-93 b appear to have a similar internal structure and composition as of Earth. Based  on the survey statistics  and  the compositional modelings,terrestrial  exoplanets with Earth-like structures  and compositions are  might be  moderately frequent around G-dwarf and K-dwarf stars of the Galaxy.
