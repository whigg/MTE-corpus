LITHOSPHERIC WEAKENING EFFECTS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NARROW RIFTS ON VENUS. A. A. Martone1 and L. G. J. Montesi2, 1University of Maryland, College Park (amartone@umd.edu), 2University of Maryland, College Park (montesi@umd.edu).   Introduction:  Venus is an enigmatic planet.  It underwent a resurfacing event roughly 500 Myr ago [1], so much of its history is up for interpretation. Despite the similarities between Venus and Earth (size, density, bulk composition) they evolved into starkly different planets. An important difference is the current lack of plate tectonics on Venus, although some [2, 3] suggest it was likely present in the past. While Venus has the three main tectonics regimes we are familiar with on Earth (convergent, divergent, and shear), it lacks the globally interconnected network of plate boundaries that is necessary plate tectonics [4]. Morphologically, the divergent margins on Venus are relatively narrow, similar to what is seen on Earth, while the other tectonic styles differ. The objective of this study is to determine under what conditions a narrow rift can develop on Venus. Focusing on the formation mechanisms behind rifts can allow us to better understand Venus' lithosphere and its thermal evolution.  Rift Morphology:  Rifts on Earth are often described as narrow rifts, wide rifts, or core complexes [9]. Most rifts on Venus are morphologically similar to narrow rifts. In particular, Devana Chasma, a rift in the Beta Regio highland is often compared to the East African rift system [5, 6]. Ganis Chasma, in Atla Regio, has a similar morphology including a series of subparallel graben, a width of about 100 km, and major riftbounding normal faults. As Devana and Ganis Chasmata are not associated with coronae or other obvious magmatic features, a purely mechanical model of rift development as in [9] is appropriate to constrain under what conditions Devana and Ganis Chasmata are expected to be a narrow rift, as observed.  We adapt the rift stability model of [9] to Venus by taking into consideration the different rheology of Venus' crust and mantle compared to the Earth. A dry diabase rheology [7] is used for the crust and a dry olivine rheology [8] for the mantle. Our code allows for a systematic exploration of crustal thickness, surface heat flux, and strain rate, neither of which is constrained reasonably well for Venus. Furthermore, we expand on this model by incorporating lithospheric weakening and appropriate rheological parameters for Venus conditions. Rift Analysis:  The Buck (1991) model [9] links the evolution of lithospheric strength upon stretching with the style of rifting (wide, narrow, or core complex). The balance between the thinning lithosphere and the thinning crust is what determines if a wide or narrow rift forms. This is determined by calculating the change in three types of forces: yield strength, lithospheric buoyancy (due to density contrast), and thermal buoyancy (due to temperature anomalies) [9]. A positive change in the total force produces a wide rift. A negative change in the total force produces a narrow rift or a core complex. The latter case appears when lower crustal flow contributes significantly to the change in crustal thickness. Core complexes are not expected on Venus due to its lack of evidence for a weak lower crust [10]. Our rift analysis also did not result in a significant number of core complexes.   Lithospheric Weakening Processes:  Since Venus lacks water-bearing minerals, such as micas, that are present on Earth, melts are likely to play the role of the weak phase that allows for localization, due to its low viscosity relative to host rocks [11].  The presence of melt in rifts is expected due to decompression melting of the mantle in response to rifting and the presence of an anomalously hot mantle plume. Weakening due to grain size reduction is also possible if a dislocationaccommodated grain boundary sliding mechanism [11] is active on Venus.  Our model runs to date do not consider specific types of weakening mechanisms. Rather, an artificial weakening is imposed into the lithospheric yield strength calculations. The lithospheric strength decreases as a function of time to simulate the overall strength reduction caused by shear zones [12]. Rifting Results: Model runs are varied in the initial crustal thickness, surface heat flux, strain rate, and crustal heat production. Strain rates were varied between 10-16 and 10-17 s-1, corresponding to the strain rate in intraplate regions and diffuse plate boundaries on Earth [13]. The crustal heat production was varied between 6.4*10-7 and 6.4*10-8 W/m3, the former being the terrestrial value [9] and the latter a low-end value based on the lowest Earth values [14]. There are very few direct geochemical constraints on the crustal heat production on Venus.  First, we run the model without including lithospheric weakening under what conditions narrow rifts are expected to develop on Venus. However, the vast majority of runs resulted in wide rifts. Results for a strain rate of 10-16 s-1 and a crustal heat production of 6.4*10-8 W/m3 are shown in Figure 1. In this scenario narrow rifts form only for the lowest surface heat flux. The occurrence of narrow rifts decreases even more when strain rate is decreased from 10-16 s-1 to 10-17 s-1.  2104.pdf

No weakening is imposed. The vertical bars indicate possible conditions for Devana Chasma (pink) and Ganis Chasma (yellow). The thin crust estimate is from [15] while the thick crust estimate is from [16] — both references indicate similar crustal thicknesses for Ganis Chasma. The range of heat flux range is taken from [17] and [14].  The preponderance of wide rifts is in agreement with the small strength contrast between crust and mantle for dry rheologies. At small strain rates, the temperature of the lithosphere hardly changes over time and thinning the crust does not change the strength significantly when using rheologies appropriate for Venus. The change in buoyancy structure dominates the stress evolution and favors expanding the zone of deformation, producing a wide rift. As narrow rifts are commonly observed on Venus, there must be a mechanism that weakens the lithosphere as it deforms. When lithospheric weakening is imposed explicitly, narrow rifting becomes more common, as shown in Figure 2 for the same strain rate and crustal heat production as in Figure 1. Narrow rifts develop for thin initial crust and low heat flow. Discussion: It appears necessary to include rheological weakening mechanisms to produce narrow rifts for the range of conditions inferred on Venus. Several localization mechanisms, including grain size reduction and melts, may be responsible for this weakening.  In the absence of mechanical weakening processes, the lithosphere looses strength mainly due to thermal evolution, as the thermal gradient increases in the developing rift. To produce a narrow rift, this effect must dominate over the strengthening associated with increased strain rate and thinner crust in the rift, as well as the buoyancy contrast between the rift and the surrounding terrains. The relatively high temperatures at the Moho on Venus reduce the effect of temperature changes on mantle strength. Therefore, the strength of the lithosphere does not decrease significantly due to evolution,  Initial Crustal Thickness (km)Surface heat flux mW/m2Rift Results: weakeningNarrowWide10 20 30 40 50 60 7010203040506070 Figure 2: Same as Figure 1 but including and explicit weakening effect σ= σ0(exp(-ε/εc)), where εc is 0.5.  and processes that tend to widen the rift (crustal buoyancy and increased strain rate) dominate. When ignoring weakening, wide rifts are predicted for the surface heat flux and crustal thickness of Devana and Ganis Chasmata. However, once weakening is imposed a narrow rift is predicted for the lower crust thickness and surface heat flux values. Therefore, narrow rifts appear more consistent with a thinner crust determined in [15] for Devana Chasma. We can conclude that mechanical weakening mechanisms are necessary to localize deformation on Venus and produce narrow rifts such as Devana and Ganis Chasmata.  References: [1] Basilevsky A.
