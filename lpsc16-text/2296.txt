Most ground based spectra beforeabout 2000 relied on moments of excellent seeing in order to resolve Pluto from H2O-ice-rich Charon [1, 2],which are separated by no more than 0.9′′. Since then,adaptive optics and space based spectra have been helpful in obtaining separate spectra of Pluto and Charon[3, 4]. However, unlike in the case of Pluto’s analogTriton [5], no observational effort has been successfulin obtaining an unambiguous detection of H2O-ice onPluto [6]. Its non-detection suggests that H2O-ice mustbe a small fraction of Pluto’s observable surface.Observations: On July 14, 2015, NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft flew past Pluto at about 12,000 km fromthe surface. Using the Ralph [7] instrument, New Horizons successfully obtained images and spectra necessary to map the composition and distribution of Pluto’ssurface. Ralph is a dual channel instrument with MVIC(Multi-spectral Visible Imaging Camera), the visiblecolor imager, and LEISA (Linear Etalon Imaging Spectral Array), the near infrared spectrograph. LEISA covers the spectral range 1.25 to 2.50 µm at a resolvingpower (λ/∆λ) of 240, and 2.10 to 2.25 µm at a resolving power of 560. Some of the LEISA observations returned to Earth to date include two scans takenat approximately 100,000 km from Pluto and at a spatialscale of 6 to 7 km/pixel. [8] will discuss the mixing ratio of N2 and CH4 across Pluto. Our work will discussthe distribution of non-volatile ices such as H2O.Evidence for H2O-ice: Observations returned in July2015, shortly after closest approach, included imagesfrom LORRI, the LOng Range Reconnaissance Imager.It revealed mountain ranges several km high along thewestern perimeter of Sputnik Planum1. Based on thesize of the mountains and the strength of Pluto’s knowncomposition (mainly N2-ice), it is arguable that the iceis much too soft to form the observed mountains. Instead, H2O-ice is stronger, and therefore a more plausible material. If this is the case, then H2O-ice mightbe detected in small, isolated regions on Pluto. Spectroscopic evidence for H2O-ice, however, would have towait until at least September 2015, when LEISA scansof Pluto where scheduled to return.Methodolgy: In order to find H2O-ice, [9] used amodel spectrum of crystalline H2O-ice and calculated1all place names discussed here are informalFigure 1: The H2O correlation map produced by correlating every observed spectrum with a model crystalline H2O-ice spectrum. We use a linear stretch from–0.3 (black) to 0.9 (white). The seam between the twoLEISA scans is apparent running diagonally northwestto southeast. North is up, east is to the right. We indicate Sputnik Planum and regions a-h: (a) Virgil Fossa,(b) Viking Terra, (c) Pulfrich Crater, (d) Bare´ Montes,(e) Hillary Montes, (f) Norgay Montes, (g), al-IdrisiMontes and (h) central Cthulhu Regio.the Pearson correlation coefficient (ρ) for every spectrum on Pluto. The value of ρ is bound between –1 and1. A value of 1 indicates a perfect correlation, and –1 ananti-correlation. Values near zero indicate little correlation. We show in Fig. 1 the map produce from calculating the correlation function. This map is shown witha linear stretch covering the range −0.3 < ρ < 0.9.This stretch reveals the seam running diagonally fromthe northwest to southeast where the two LEISA scanswere merged. Regions off the limb of Pluto are set tozero and gives a sense of the zero-level.Figure 1 shows there is little correlation with H2Oice in Sputnik Planum. The correlation also decreasesas one moves from southern latitudes to northern latitudes. Cthulhu Regio appears to have varying amountsof H2O ice and this region contains some of the lowest correlation seen on Pluto. This figure also clearlyillustrates that there are isolated regions on Pluto where2296.pdf

Figure 2: Here we show the panchromatic map fromLORRI overlaid with the correlation map shown in blue.We use a cubic stretch on the H2O correlation map tohighlight regions that have a high correlation. North isup, east is to the right.H2O-ice is strongly correlated with the observations.We show the H2O correlation map overlaid with theLORRI basemap in Fig. 2. The correlation map has acubic stretch to highlight likely H2O-ice-rich regions.Analysis: We show in Fig. 3 the spectra (black dots)from 8 selected regions. We select regions that arehighly correlated with H2O-ice (spectra a-d), the mountain ranges (spectra e-g) and where H2O-ice and CH4ice are absent (spectrum h).Examination of spectra a-d shows a strong asymmetry in the 2.0 µm band of H2O-ice. [10] noted a similarasymmetry in spectra of Iapetus and several other Saturnian satellites. They compared lab spectra of sub-µmgrain H2O-ice and found good agreement with modelswhen Rayleigh scattering in included. We modify ourHapke code to account for Rayleigh scattering to obtainthe results (red curves) in Fig. 3.Spectra a to d have a sub-µm H2O-ice fractions between 15 and 45% with most of the grains diametersat about 0.1 µm. Spectra e to g have a sub-µm H2Oice fraction between 10 and 25% with similar grain diameters. Spectrum h has a 25% sub-µm content, butwith 10 nm grain sizes, significantly smaller than theother spectral regions. We find the region longward of∼2.3 µm in h best matches C3H8-ice. Since we lackoptical constants for many candidate hydrocarbons, wedo not take this as a definitive detection of C3H8-ice.Discussion & Conclusion: We show that there are regions on Pluto with fine grained H2O-ice with a diameter∼0.1 µm. In regions where the 1.5 and 2.0 µm bandsFigure 3: The spectrum of eights regions of interest. Informal names for regions a-h are listed in Fig. 1are the strongest, the fine grained H2O-ice may be up to45% of the observed signal. H2O-ice appears to be inthe crystalline state, at about 55 K. There is no evidencefor amorphous ice. We also show that heavy hydrocarbons such as C3H8 are likely present in Cthulhu Regio.The presence of fine grain H2O-ice on Pluto is in contrast to preliminary work on Charon, where the grainsappear much larger [11]. In the Saturnian system, finegrained ice is thought to be evidence for ring materialsettling on icy satellites, or the cryovolcanic activityseen on Enceladus. The reason for fine grain H2O-iceon Pluto, but not Charon, is unknown.References: [1] Brown, M. E., et al. (2000) Science287:107. [2] Dumas, C., et al. (2001) Astron. J.121:1163. [3] Buie, M.
