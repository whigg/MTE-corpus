Introduction: Solar wind protons potentially are a source of hydration for the lunar regolith. This occurs because the solar wind impinges uninhibited on the lunar surface when the Moon is in the solar wind. The protons implant themselves ~10 nm into the surface of the  regolith  grain  encountered.  The  subsequent  processes are more poorly quantified,  but  might include diffusion out of the grain, formation of OH bonds, or the release of H2O molecules. Owing to the porosity of regolith on the Moon, the ions have access through pore space to grains that are partially or fully buried.  This work quantifies the relationship between regolith particle size distribution and solar wind access. The Approach:  In the previous work [1] we developed  a  method  of  using  a  discrete  element  method (DEM)  model  COUPi [2]  to  study  the  penetration depth of solar wind protons into the upper level of lunar regolith. We created regolith particle beds of different porosity by gravitational deposition of polyhedrons representing  grains.  We achieved  the  porosities  in  a range from 0.43 to as high as 0.61. The previous work dealt with mono-disperse particle size distributions. In this work we study how particle size distribution (PSD) affects the proton penetration depth. To study the influence of regolith PSD we used an actual PSD of JSC1a lunar simulant [3]. Fig. 1 shows the  log-normal  approximation  of  the  distribution  by mass in logarithmic scale.  We generate particles with sizes distributed within a cut  window shown in gray. The window is a symmetrical window in logarithmic scale around the mean value. The cut window can be described by the ratio between the maximum grain size and minimum grain size. We used 1.5x, 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, and 6x wide windows to study how particle size distribution affects the access of the solar wind. Using a wider window is computationally too demanding for the DEM model as a difference of six in window size leads to 216 difference in volume between the largest and the smallest possible grain. There are two issues that emerged during the simulations.  First,  to  make  a  reasonable  comparison  between different grain ensembles, one needs to control porosity. Second, the regolith bed created during settlement of DEM particles is uneven and one needs to define the surface topography to determine the distance that a proton travels into the regolith. Figure 1 JSC1a Particle size distribution by mass (red) in log scale. Gray area shows a window cut that is used to generate grains particles (gray, semi-transparent) and protons (red) before and after the simulation. We generated  regolith  particle  beds  for  different PSDs using different cut window sizes with porosities between 0.52 and 0.53. The zero level for the depth is calculated  from  an  enveloping  surface  around  the grains as shown in Fig. 2. Figure 2 Zero level surface. After  the  regolith  grains  are  settled,  the  protons, represented by point particles of infinitely small size, are generated randomly above the regolith bed.   The protons  are  fired  with  constant  velocity  into  the  regolith. The angle of incidence  ÔÅ° is varied to find the dependence of the penetration depth with incidence angle. As soon as a proton hits a regolith particle, it stops. After all protons stop, they are counted and the distribution function of  protons is  built  depending on the depth  measured  in  mean  size  of  the  particles.   The maximum of the distribution function is assigned to the surface level. Results:  We run a series of cases using solar wind incidence  angles  (calculated  from the  normal  to  the  surface) of 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 degrees. An example of the results is shown in Fig. 3. Figure 3 Proton implantation rate depending on incidence angle for 0.52-0.53 porosity and 6x cut window. The depth is measured by mean particle size D. The implantation rate curve shows how many protons  can  go  at  the  certain  depth  measured  by mean grain size D. First solar wind particles hit the top of the upper grains and the maximum number of particles hit at about 1D distance from the surface. To compare the results we use the depth that 1% of the solar wind protons pass e.g. 1% of all implanted protons go deeper than this depth. The results are summarized in Fig. 4. Figure 4 The level passed by 1% of protons during the implantation for different incidence angles and different  PSD  cut  window. The  depth  is  measured  by mean particle size D. Increasing the grain size variation also increases the access of solar wind into the regolith if the porosity of the  regolith  is  the  same.  Most  of  the  protons  travel longer distances around large particles and thus reach larger depth in spite of using a wider PSD cut window, which allows smaller particles into the regolith. The results show that  the protons can travel  long distances  into the regolith and provide  the source  of volatiles in its upper layer.
