LOUTH CRATER WATER ICE AS A MARTIAN CLIMATE PROXY. J. Bapst1,2,* and S. Byrne1, 1Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, 85721, 2Dept. of Earth and Space Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, 98195, *jnbapst@gmail.com  Introduction:  Louth Crater (Figure 1) is a ~36 km diameter crater in the northern plains of Mars and hosts a large ~10 km diameter, quasi-circular water ice mound, which lies off-center on the crater floor [1]. This ice mound, although a common feature in northern plains' polar craters, represents the mostequatorward (70°N) example (i.e., on average, it is the warmest perennial surface ice on the planet). Thus, its position makes it potentially sensitive to ongoing climate change.  Figure 1. Louth crater and its central water ice mound, which is approximately 10 km in diameter; North is up; HRSC 234192.  Previous work, analyzing repeat high-resolution images, documented removal and replacement of ice near the mound boundary [2]. Although the observed activity shows no clear trend, it demonstrates that nonnegligible amounts of water can be exchanged between the surface and the atmosphere over the span a single martian year.  Here, we wish to assess the stability of the ice mound under the current climate. We use orbital infrared datasets to constrain a thermal model of the ice mound, which provides the annual temperature cycle. A water ice sublimation model is coupled to the thermal model, which is used to quantify the exchange of water between the surface and the atmosphere; i.e., an estimate of the mass balance. Understanding the stability of the ice mound in Louth crater constrains the current near surface conditions (e.g., surface water vapor concentration), and so aids in understanding the stability and mass balance of water ice elsewhere on Mars. Methods:  We employ a 1-D thermal model, which can be modified to simulate the martian regolith in addition to the water ice mound. Constraints from observed surface temperatures, via Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) and Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS), are used to determine best fit parameters such as ice table depth and surface thermal inertia. We use a reduced chi-squared statistic to compare multiple model runs with the dataset of interest. TES, due to its greater temporal coverage and higher absolute accuracy, would be ideal for ice mound temperatures. But, due to its larger foot print (~6x3 km), and suseptability to smearing in the downtrack direction [3], we cannot be confident in identifying temperatures of the ~10 km ice mound without mixing of the surrounding, lower thermal inertia, regolith. THEMIS (~100 m/pixel) presents a better opportunity to estimate temperatures of just the ice mound. The absolute accuracy of temperatures from THEMIS is not sufficient for our needs, however relative accuracy within a single image is <1 K [4]. This allows us to "correct" the temperatures, but only if we can accurately estimate temperatures of a particular surface in the scene. To begin correcting THEMIS temperatures we model a patch of regolith just north of the crater, which is referred to as the control region. Constrained by TES, our model can produce estimates of temperatures at all times of day. Note, this region requires a twolayer thermal model as prevalent ground ice is expected at this latitude [5]. We then difference the THEMIS temperature and the model temperatures over the control region for the same local time. This difference can be applied to the entire THEMIS image, thus correcting for temperatures of the ice mound. Corrected THEMIS temperatures are then similarly fit by our model so that we can confidently estimate mound temperatures for all times of year. Once the thermal model for the ice mound is so constrained, we will use a free and forced convection scheme after [6,7] to calculate the transfer of water to and from the ice mound over the entire year. We expect these results to be sensitive to the atmospheric water content, which we vary in the model and compare to observed abundances [8]. Results:  Control Region: The best model fit (Figure 2) for the control region and TES 2 AM data results in an ice table depth of 0.08 m and an upper layer thermal inertia of ~350 J m-2 K-1 s-1/2. Ground ice is prescribed a thermal inertia of ~2300 J m-2 K-1 s-1/2. The best model fit with 2 PM data yielded similar results to AM fitting. 3027.pdf

 Figure 2. Contour plot of reduced chi-squared statistic of the thermal model versus 2 AM TES data for the control surface (fitted over LS 70-150°).   Model temperatures agree well with observations at the warmest times of year (Figure 3), which are most important when considering ice stability. However, the model fits worsen when seasonal water frosts are expected in this region, particularly late summer/early autumn, beginning LS~160° [9]. We are currently implementing a water frost/albedo scheme into the model to improve matches at these times (Figure 4). Note that the observed temperature drop at LS~160° suggests a high water frost albedo (~0.50) which is not consistent with TES data. A significant decrease in emissivity, in addition to a modest increase in albedo, could explain the temperature discrepancy between the model and observations.  Figure 3. Best-fit model and TES 2 AM/PM temperatures for the control region. Note the disagreement in late summer/early autumn.  Ice Mound:  Preliminary fits for the mound, with corrected THEMIS data, suggest a thermal inertia of ~750 J m-2 K-1 s-1/2, and agree generally well with observations (Figure 5). This value is considerably lower than pure water ice, which is closer to ~2000 J m-2 K-1 s-1/2. Possible explanations for the relatively low thermal inertia include porous ice (although an unrealistic porosity of ~85% would be required here), or mixing with lower thermal inertia materials (at or below the surface).  Thus far we have only considered PM data and are investigating AM THEMIS data for additional constraints. Because THEMIS coverage is relatively sparse, including AM temperatures may improve the validity of our model of the ice mound.  Figure 4. Example treatment of water frost albedo to help improve fitting of 2 PM data for the control region. Water frost albedo replaces the surface albedo (of 0.22) from LS 160-220°. Figure 5.  Preliminary modeled temperatures and corrected THEMIS temperatures for the Louth crater ice mound. Thermal inertia is in units J m-2 K-1 s-1/2.  Future Work:  We are currently improving our model of the control region to better correct THEMIS data, particularly during the late summer season when seasonal frosts are present. We are also coupling the aforementioned water frost transport scheme to the thermal model. This will allow us to calculate the mass balance of the Louth crater ice mound for a wide range of atmospheric water abundances. Beyond the present climate, since we have confidence in the derived thermal properties of the ice mound, we can model the behavior of Louth in the geologic past [10]. This may provide insight into the response of water ice on the surface of Mars to orbitallyforced climate change. References:  [1] Brown, A. et al. (2008) Icarus, 196(2), 433-445.
