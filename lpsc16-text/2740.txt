QUANTIFYING THE EFFECT OF SLOPE ON AGE ESTIMATES: A PRELIMINARY OVERVIEW.  H. M. Meyer1, P. Mahanti1, M. S. Robinson1, and A. Boyd1. 1School of Earth and Space Exploration, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA   Introduction: The rate of degradation of impact craters on the Moon is significantly effected by the local slope upon which the crater formed [1-4]. As a result the density of craters is less on steeper slopes for terrains of the same age [1, 5]. Thus, when age-dating a planetary surface, an area encompassing one geologic unit of constant slope is chosen, usually a relatively flat and level area. However, many key geologic units, such as ejecta blankets, lack sufficient area of constant slope to derive robust age estimates. Barring returned (or insitu analysis) samples from these units, accurate agedating of such units requires an accurate and global understanding of the effects of slope on age-dating.  Previous work assessing the effect of slope on crater degradation focused on craters from a few meters to ~1-2 km in diameter [1], but the contribution of secondary impacts, which would skew age estimates, to the population of craters <1 km is unclear [6]. Further, the morphology of small craters <500 m is controlled by target properities [3, 7], making it difficult to predict the effect of slope alone for use at larger diameters. The effect of slope on crater density for craters >1 km, where gravity rather than target properties controls degradation, and the resulting variation in crater density has not been quantified. This preliminary work seeks to determine if the observed trend of decreasing crater density with increasing slopes holds true for craters >1 km and to quantify the effect of slope for craters in this size range, focusing on the effect of slopes over the kilometer scale to capture the effect of target slope rather than the slopes of the craters themselves. Study Area: To assess the affect of slope on age estimates, we began our study with the areally expansive and well studied Hevelius formation [e.g. 8, 9]. The Hevelius formation is composed of the continuous ejecta of the Orientale basin and encompasses four facies: inner, outer, transverse, and secondary [8]. The inner facies is characterized by ridges and troughs radial to the basin, numerous lobes and tongues, and many buried primary and secondary craters [8]. The transverse facies displays closely spaced arcuate ridges and troughs typically found in low, elongate areas [8]. The outer facies is variable in morphology, including swirly, lineated, hummocky, and smooth areas that are laterally continuous with the inner facies [8]. The secondary facies consists of overlapping crater chains and clusters buried by the inner facies, superposed on the outer facies, and extending beyond the outer facies [8]. Because the Hevelius formation is collectively interpreted as originating from a single event (Orientale basin-forming impact [8, 9]), age estimates should be consistent across the entire unit despite the range of morphologies observed within each of the Hevelius formation facies. Previous work employing crater density [10-13] has set the age of Orientale anywhere from 3.65 Ga to 3.8 Ga.  Data and Methods: A 3 km baseline slope map was created from the Wide Angle Camera (WAC) Digital Terrain Model (DTM), the GLD 100 [14], downsampled to 1 km. Using an LRO WAC [15] monochrome basemap and the slope map, six regions of varying mean slope (~2° increments) were defined on the inner, outer, and transverse facies of the Hevelius Formation (Fig. 1), including one region with the secondary facies buried by the inner facies. Craters >~800 m in diameter within each area were measured on the LRO WAC monochrome mosaic using the CraterTools extension for ArcGIS [16]. Secondary craters, defined as irregularly shaped or occurring in chains or clusters [17], were excluded. The measured craters were then exported for use with the Craterstats2 software [18], and the crater densities were determined using a fitted production function (PF) [19]. Because the average slopes for regions 1 (2.1°) and 2 (2.4°) as well as 5 (8.4°) and 6 (9.1°) were within 1° of each other, the four count areas were merged into two areas (1-2 and 5-6) to improve statistics. In order to make a direct comparison to previous work [1], the N(1) values were then normalized by the corresponding equilibrium densities of mare plains as defined by [20]. The resulting normalized crater density was then plotted against slope (Fig. 2). Preliminary Results and Conclusions: The normalized N(1) values decrease with increasing slope (Table 1, Fig. 2) indicating that slope does effect the density of craters >1 km as shown by [1] for smaller diameter craters, albeit at a 7-50% lower rate compared to Basilevsky’s normalized density values for similar slopes [1]. This implies that absolute model ages derived from the density of craters >1 km in regions with higher slopes are artificially young. This error is then introduced when a chronology is applied to determine the absolute model age. A 10% variation in the N(1) value can yield a model age differing by up to 70 My for absolute model ages ~1-3 Ga.  2740.pdf

Because the model ages are derived from crater density by way of a chronology equation [e.g. 19], the error in model age incurred by variations in crater density due to slope is systematic and may be correctable for craters >1 km. However, prior to application of such a correction a robust modeling of slope dependency on N(1) is required at various targets. Further, at higher slopes (near the angle of repose), the relationship between slope and degradation becomes less predictable due to the onset of advective mechanisms, making the relationship between slope and crater density ambiguous [22]. The slope range outside of which the slope vs. N(1) relationship is ambiguous also needs to be characterized at different targets. This will be accomplished in the next phase of this work.
