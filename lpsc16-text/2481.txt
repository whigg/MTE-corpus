Introduction: Oxygen is the most abundant element in the silicate portions of meteorites and asteroids. The Genesis mission determined the solar wind oxygen iso­ topic composition is δ18O = -58, δ17O = -59 [1] and this is assumed to be the starting composition of the solar nebula. However, meteorites (as well as asteroids and planets)  have  substantially heavier  isotopic  composi­ tions. This implies that the oxygen isotopic composi­ tions of planetary materials got progressively heavier during the evolution of the solar nebula.    There are essentially only two oxygen-bearing gas species  in  the  hot,  but  cooling  (~1600°C  down  to 1000°C), early solar nebula that could have exchanged with the earliest solids: carbon monoxide and water va­ por  [2].  Carbon  monoxide  constitutes  approximately 40-45% of the volume of the oxygen-bearing species over this temperature range, while water constitutes ap­ proximately 55% (at 1600°C) to 43% (at 1000°C)[2]. Yu et al. [3] shows that 50% exchange of the oxygen isotopic  composition occurs  between a  small  silicate sphere and an H2/H2O gas mixture at 1400°C after 5 minutes of melting at one atmosphere. They argue that at nebular pressures (~10-2 to 10-5 torr) 50% exchange would take ~10 hours,  depending on surface kinetics and exchange probability. This would extend the dura­ tion of possible chondrule formation and may be con­ sistent with the textural and Fe-Mg zoning experiments of [4] and [5]. Boesenberg et al. [6] did similar oxygen isotopic exchange experiments using CO gas (instead of water vapor) and a IIAB chondrule analog at nebular pressures (10-3 torr) using a vacuum furnace. However, they [6] did not see exchange between gas and melt, only evaporation, giving the indication that CO might not exchange with silicate melt.    Upon further investigation, we concluded that the above results [6] were ambiguous and needed to be rerun using higher gas/rock ratios which would better re­ cord exchange. We have therefore conducted new ex­ change experiments at 1 atm, rather than under vacu­ um. We are testing exchange between carbon monoxide and a partially melted sample of Allende (CV3) to de­ termine if a liquid/solid sphere does indeed exchange its oxygen isotopic composition with CO gas. Experimental  Technique  and  Oxygen  Isotopic Analysis:  A series of oxygen isotope exchange experi­ ments were performed in a 1 atm, gas mixing furnace at Brown University,  using unlabelled carbon monoxide gas and a fine-grained (<45 microns) powdered sample of Allende. The experimental run details are listed in Table 1. The experimental Allende powders were com­ pressed  into  4mm  pellets,  weighed  (~35-40  mg), placed on  Re wire loops and inserted into the hotspot of the furnace. A flow of carbon monoxide gas through the furnace was established 30 minutes prior to each experiment and was regulated using a high precision flowmeter. The charges were drop quenched into water at the end of each run. To determine the starting oxy­ gen isotopic composition of the CO gas,  one experi­ ment involved inserting a small Zr metal sample into the furnace and oxidizing it with the flowing CO gas.     After the experimental runs, the charges were split. Half was utilized for oxygen isotopic analysis and half for microprobe analysis (only partially reported here). Oxygen isotopic analysis was performed at UCLA on a  ThermoFinnigan Delta gas-source mass spectro­ meter using the laser fluorination technique of [7]. Results:  The results of the experiments are plotted in Figure 1. The starting material for all of the experi­ ments (except Zr metal) was average bulk Allende and plots at δ18O = 1.342, δ17O = -2.778. Based on observa­ tion of the pre-ground chips, there were no large CAIs in the starting materials which might dramatically alter the oxygen isotopic composition. Run 1014 was simply powdered Allende in vacuum for 6 hours with no CO gas. This experiment showed evidence of evaporation and plots on the heavy side of the starting material in a three oxygen isotope plot. Run 1009,  1011 and 1008 are true exchange run products. These experiments were run at high temper­ ature and 1 atm with a high carbon monoxide flow rate present.  Experiment 1008 failed (fell  off the holding Re wire) at some point during its run. It is suspected this experiment only ran a few hours in the hotspot, though it was only noticed at the bottom of the furnace after nearly 66 hours. Our interpretation is that this ex­ periment  only  partially  exchanged.  Runs  1009  and 1011 plot above the terrestrial fractionation line at ap­  proximately Δ17O = 1.5.  Terrestrial  carbon monoxide plots at approximately Δ17O = 1.5 and at δ18O values of ~5 to 25, because of atmospheric processing [8]. In or­ der to determine the Δ17O of the CO gas in the furnace, a piece of Zr wire was inserted into the hotspot and ox­ idized by the CO gas (Fig. 1). While having more 16O rich  δ-values,  due  to  mineralogical  equilibrium frac­ tionation, the Δ17O of the Zr oxide is within error of runs  1009  and  1011.  This  suggests  that  experiments 1009 and 1011 have completely (or  very nearly)  ex­ changed with the CO gas. Mineralogically, runs 1009, 1011 and 1008 consist of  glass,  olivine  and  metal/sulfide.  Nearly all  of  the FeO in the experiments was reduced to Fe-metal be­ cause of the low oxygen fugacity imposed by the pure CO gas environment. Discussion: These  experiments  demonstrate  that exchange between CO and a silicate melt does occur. It is suspected that either longer durations or higher par­ tial pressures of CO were needed in the experiments of [6], explaining why no exchange was observed.      The purpose of these experiments is both to confirm that  exchange  does  occur  and  determine  the  oxygen isotopic exchange rates  between CO gas and silicate melt. However, the 24 and 48 hour experiments (1009 and  1011)  showed  complete  or  nearly complete  ex­ change with the CO gas, so exchange rates cannot be determined  for  these  experiments.  Experiments  with lower  CO  flowrates  will  be  run  in  the  near  future. Ideally, between 50 and 90% exchange is preferred for measuring exchange rates.  In  addition,  the  durations need to exceed the time necessary for the gas to diffuse through the melt  (otherwise something other  than an exchange rate is being measured). Diffusion rates for chondrule and CAI melts are in the range of 10-6 to 10-7 cm2/sec  [9]  (i.e,  experimental  durations  need  to  be hours to days depending on the run temperatures). In the near future, exchange rates between chondrule and CAI melts and CO gas will be determined.  Obtaining  the  oxygen  isotopic  exchange  rates between CO and silicate  melt  are  important  because models utilizing  mixing, photodissociation, or chemic­ al isotope effects of the mass independent oxygen iso­ topic evolution of the nebula [10,11,12] rely on both the rates and pathways taken to transfer the heavy oxy­ gen from gas to solid. If one assumes direct exchange using  CO gas  rather  than  an  intermediary  exchange path using water vapor, both the pathway and exchange rate will be altered. This is a critical measurement for the development and progress of these models.     References: [1] McKeegan K. et al (2011) Science, 332,  1528-1532.  [2]  Ebel  D.  S.  and  Grossman  L.
