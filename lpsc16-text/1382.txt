Introduction:  This is a summary of Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) observations of geologic materials encountered by the Curiosity rover from May 2015 to early January 2016. Informal place, target, and unit names are in italics. The rover’s traverse during this period is illustrated in Fig 1. The rocks studied included (1) a section of the Murray formation stratigraphically above the Murray rocks examined earlier at Pahrump Hills (Fig 2 and [1, 2]) and (2) sandstones of the Stimson formation. The team also began to study (3) the Bagnold dune field.  Murray formation:  The lower ~300 m of north Aeolis Mons strata are dominated by the recessive, slope-forming Murray formation [1]. Where examined, these rocks are finely-laminated, fine-grained (generally < 62.5 µm) clastic rocks interpreted to be mudstones, with occasional concretion-bearing intervals, inhomogeneities accentuated by differential wind erosion, and interbedded sandstones [1]. Murray outcrops examined by MAHLI during this period are along the portions of the traverse colored yellow in Fig 1. In some areas, fine laminae of ~500–800 µm thickness are well preserved (Fig 3), particularly in the vicinity of mudstones just east of Marias Pass with elevated Si contents relative to other Murray mudstones [3]. Higher in the section (Fig 2), Murray rocks exhibit a purplish hue which contrasts with the lighter grays of mudstones lower in the section (Fig 4). Stimson formation:  The Murray formation is unconformably overlain by the Stimson formation [2, 4]. The erosional paleosurface sloped down toward the north, cutting across Murray strata [2]. The majority of the Stimson rocks encountered along the traverse (in blue in Fig 1) are interpreted as eolian cross-bedded sandstones [6]; MAHLI images in some cases show well-rounded sand grains, including some which are interpreted as basalt lithics containing small, light gray phenocrysts (Fig 5). Details at the unconformity were examined by MAHLI at the Marias Pass site (Fig 6); the outcrop includes weathered clasts interpreted to be pieces of Murray formation mudstone incorporated into Stimson sands; pieces of vein-filling material from the Murray might also be present (Figs 6, 7); other white and light gray materials in the outcrop include well-rounded siliciclastic grains (mineral or lithic fragments) and pore-filling cement (Fig 7) [5]. Diagenetic halos: Stimson sandstones are cut by fractures that have associated “halos” wherein the rock was lightened from dark to lighter gray, usually parallel to the fractures [3]; MAHLI examined examples of these (Fig 8). The Murray mudstones in Bridger Basin (Fig 1) also exhibit diagenetic halos (which MAHLI examined at Cody [7]). These diagenetic halos might be related to the same fluid flow event(s), post-dating Stimson sand burial and lithification [3, 7]. Eolian dunes:  Superimposed on the Murray and Stimson bedrock in the field area (Fig 1) are the active [8] Bagnold eolian dunes [9]. The first MAHLI imaging of these sediments, on (Sol 1184) and adjacent to (Sol 1182) the east stoss margin of High Dune, occurred in December 2015. The bedforms examined on Sol 1182 had a surface lag of medium to coarse mafic sand overlying a body of very fine to fine sand (Fig 9). The coarser sands include dark gray basalt lithics and brown, yellow, and green translucent crystal fragments interpreted as possible olivine sand; other grains vary from dark gray to brown to red to white to colorless translucent; some white grains might be pieces of locally-derived (from Murray rocks) vein fill material; others are likely feldspars.
