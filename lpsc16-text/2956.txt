Hiesinger1, 1Institut für Planetologie, Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität, WilhelmKlemm-Str. 10, 49149 Münster, Germany (j.clark@uni-muenster.de).    Introduction:  Scattered globally on the Moon are compressional features called lobate scarps, which are the surface expression of low-angle thrust faults [1-4].  With over 3,200 scarps, they are predominantly formed from late-stage contraction of the lunar surface, however, tidally-induced stresses have also contributed to the Moon’s stress state [5].  Although they share similar morphologic features, lunar scarps are relatively small compared to those of other terrestrial planets (e.g., Mars, Mercury, and Earth), typically only <10 km in length and tens of meters in relief [5-10].  Located in the back limb of some scarps are smallscale graben (with depths as shallow as 1 m), likely caused by flexural bending [12, 13].   Based on their generally crisp appearance and cross-cutting relationships with small-diameter craters, lobate scarps are amoung one of the youngest landforms on the Moon (<1 Ga) [5,14-16].  Scarps often consist of a series of several connected subscarps or contain a series of closely spaced, yet disconnected subscarps [14].  On a larger scale, scarps themselves typically occur in a series of up to 10 scarps, called scarp complexes [14].   Our present study asks: Does the fault activity within the complex occur simultaneously or as a series of events? If the latter, how long are the scarps active? Are there trends with their size and/or length or location? We investigate the Mandel’shtam scarp complex (6.2N, 161.2E) as a case study, because it is one of the longest scarp complexes on the Moon..   Mandel’shtam Scarp: Located in the farside highlands, the Mandel’shtam lobate scarp complex (Fig.1) is comprised of 8 distinct scarps with a total length of ~80km. The complex’s name derives from the close-by large Mandel’shtam craters, which range from ~ 25 – 60 km in diameter.   Age determinations by [15] place the craters at Imbrian to pre-Nectarian in age (~3.5 to 4.2 Ga).  Using crater degradation rates, [14] derived ages for the scarps within the Mandel’shtam complex (Table 1).  Individual scarp ages range from 100 ± 70 to 190 ± 70 Ma, with a calculated complex age of 180 ± 50 Ma [14]. However, with the more recent scarp dating technique of [15] and the abundance of high resolution images from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LROC), we are reexamining the scarp ages [17].

Data and Methods:  Lobate scarps are investigated using high resolution Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) images from LROC [17].  Using the technique described by [15], we measure crater-size frequency distributions (CSFDs) for areas both proximal and distal to the fault traces. NAC stereo-derived digital terrain models (DTMs) are used to measure relief and displacement across the scarp [17].   Results:  Preliminary CSFDs on Mandel’shtam scarp 3 reveal that absolute model ages (AMAs) proximal of the scarp can vary (upwards of 300 Ma difference).  The southern location has proximal AMAs ranging from 60.7 to 118 Ma while the northern location AMAs range from 366 to 550 Ma.  Moreover, [15] derived AMAs for the southern location and Site A (indicated with yellow boxes in Fig. 2).  Proximal AMAs for the southern location were 91-128 Ma and Site A AMAs were 99-107 Ma [15]. Distal ages for Site A are younger (73-82 Ma) than their respective proximal AMAs and appear to be affected by fresh craters within the count areas.  These preliminary results suggest that the northern part of segment 3 was active earlier than the sourthern part, which points to scarp activity over several hundred Ma. Summary and Outlook: We will systematically investigate all Mandel’shtam scarp segments to determine their relationship in time. Where there is NAC DTM coverage, we will measure multiple profiles perpendicular to the trend of the scarp. Topographic profiles help illustrate the changes of vertical slip along the strike of the fault. We can confirm whether slip reaches a maximum near the center of the faults or is constant across the entire fault.  Also with the AMAs, we can investigate if there is a correlation between the ages and extent of slip.   References: [1] Hartmann W.K. and Davis D. (1975) Icarus, 24, 504-515.
