Introduction:  A prominent feature of the 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko comet nucleus, where consolidated material is outcropped, is Hathor cliff. It is very steep, locally almost vertical and in some places shows overhangs [1]. The cliff geometry measured from the SHAP4s shape model [2] allows to estimate different kinds of strength of the cliff material.  Tensile strength: For estimating the tensile strength we follow the work [1], who used the approach of [3-5], shown in Figure 1.  Figure 1. Scheme of overhang: L is the overhang depth, H and X are its height and width; modified from [1]. The overhang is stable until the bending stress on its top does not exceed the tensile strength of material σT, i.e. the following condition holds:  σT < 3ρg L2/H, where L is the overhang depth, H is its height, X - its width (σT is not dependent on X),  ρ = 470 kg/m3 is the material density [6], and g = 2x10-4 m/s2 is the local gravity [1]. Figure 2 shows the overhang on the Hathor slope measured from the SHAP4s shape model.  Figure 2. Schematic presentation of the Hathor overhanging slopes. Red segments show the overhangs. It is seen in Figure 2 that the overhangs vary in their geometry and size. To determine σT, we estimated the area of the overhanging section (~4000 m2), the overhang depth (L = ~20 m) and height (H = ~200 m) as averages inferred from the measured profiles. The resulting tensile strength of the Hathor material is σT ~0.6 Pa. Because the considered overhang is not collapsed, the determined value represents a lower bound for σT. Using this approach, a tensile strength of the consolidated nucleus material was estimated by [1] in two collapsed structures at the northern border of the Imhotep region and in several overhangs in the Maftet region, where L is from 10 to100 m and H from 5 to 100 m. They found that σT is most likely in the range 3-15 Pa and lower than 150 Pa.. Summarizing our and their estimates, we can say that for consolidated nucleus material having L = 10 to 100 m and H = 5 to 200 m, the tensile strength is ~1 Pa <σT <100 Pa. Shear strength: The shear strength of the Hathor material was estimated based on geometry of the landslide body [7], from the landslide volume and, thus, mass, and the sliding plane area (Figure 3). The steepness of the sliding plane was estimated from the profile 2  (the cliff slope above the landslide) as ~75o.    Figure 3. Synthetic image of the landslide with positions of three profiles, the profiles and the model landslide.  The average from areas of the profiles vertical sections (red parts of the profiles) was estimated to be ~2.2 x 104 m2, whereas the average width of the landslide body was estimated as 400 m. The resulting landslide volume is ~107 m3 and its mass is ~4.7 x 109 kg. For simplicity, we assumed that the model landslide is rectangular parallelepiped with area of the lower surface ~1.6 x 105 m2 and height = 65 m. Following the approach of [1] (their formula 3) we have: σS > mg sin ϴ/A,  where m is the landslide mass (4.7 x 109 kg), g is surface gravity acceleration (2x10-4 m/s2), ϴ is the slope of the sliding plane (75o) and A is area of the lower (contacting with slope) surface (1.5 x 105 m2). This leads to σS = 6 Pa. A lower limit of the shear strength of the Hathor cliff was estimated by [1] (their formula 5) as the lateral pressure at the cliff bottom), where h is the height of the cliff: σS ≥ ρgh (1- sin ϴrepose) 1215.pdf

For a maximum height h = 900m of the Hathor cliff, this gives σS ≥30 Pa. These authors write that this value is an approximation since the cliff is not vertical  from top to bottom and the gravity changes from top to bottom. Their estimate (≥30 Pa) is larger than ours (6 Pa), suggesting both approximate character of the estimates and possible variations in the material strength. Compressive strength: The compressive strength (σC) was estimated by the gravity-induced pressure at the cliff foot, which withstands the load of the ~1 km column of the material. Because we do not see any signs of destruction of material at the cliff foot, we can assume that its σC exceeds the pressure of the overlying material. The latter is calculated based on the bulk density of the nucleus material (ρ = 470 kg/m3, [6]), the surface gravity (g = 2 x 10-4 m/s2, [1]) and the height of the cliff material column (h = 1000 m), which gives a lower limit for the compressive strength σC >94 Pa (or rounding, σC ≥100 Pa). Work [1] estimated σC of the consolidated nucleus material by assuming that it is typically larger by one order of magnitude than its tensile strength. Therefore, referring to their estimates of σT (3-15 Pa to 150 Pa), they derived the compressive strength most likely to be in the range 30-150 Pa, with an upper limit of 1.5 kPa. One can see that our estimate of the compressive strength of the Hathor consolidated material (σC ≥100 Pa) is in agreement with their estimates.   Summarizing our and Groussin et al. [1] estimates of strength of the 67P nucleus consolidated material we may conclude that the tensile strength ranges between 1 Pa and 100 Pa, the shear strength ranges from ~6 Pa to 30 Pa, and the compressive strength typically is between 30 and 150 Pa and, possibly up to 1.5 kPa (Figure 4). These values show that the consolidated material of the nucleus is mechanically very weak.  To get a better feeling of the nucleus surface environment, we compare these estimates with the strength of fresh snow [8-12]. The latter seems to be rather close to the nucleus consolidated material in composition (H2O ice) and bulk density (60 to 500 kg/m3). In such comparisons one should keep in mind that the mentioned strength estimates of the nucleus material were made for the features whose sizes are tens of meters to 1 km, while the measurements of snow strength were made on samples and parts of snow deposits of centimeter to decimeter size. This difference in scale is important because the tensile strength values are dependent on the scale of the phenomenon under consideration [13]. This work showed that the scale dependence of the tensile strength for water ice follows a typical d-q power law, where d is the scale and q is the power exponent, with q~0.5 for icy fractal aggregates. In private communication (15.08.2015) Dr. Yongfu Xu informed us that the same dependence is also valid for compressive strength.  Figure 4. Strengths of the 67P consolidated nucleus material in comparisons with those of fresh fallen snow. The asterisk shows the tensile strength of the Shoemaker-Levy comet [14]. The Inlet displays a portion of Rosetta Osiris image showing fractures in the consolidated nucleus material (http://blogs.esa.int/rosetta/ 2015/ 0818). Summary: From the above consideration it follows that (keeping in mind the scale effect and the wide range of the estimated values) the 67P consolidated material is very fragile - as fragile as fresh snow at about -10oC and may be even more fragile. But despite this fragility, the available images show that the nucleus material behaves as consolidated material, able to sustain high cliffs and form boulders [e.g., 6] and showng brittle behavior: having fractures with the the meter(s) spacing (inset in Figure 4).
