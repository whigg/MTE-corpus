They exhibit distinctive flow patterns including flow-parallel lineationsand compressional ridges. These morphologies recordinformation about flow patterns [5] which may potentially be used to constrain rheological models [6].Terrestrial rock glaciers have often been invoked asanalogs to Martian debris-covered glaciers [3,7], as theyexhibit similar morphology. Rock glaciers range in composition from pure glacier ice under a debris mantle [8]to heterogeneous mixtures of ice and debris [7]. There isno comprehensive understanding of rock glacier dynamics, but some studies suggest that climate as well as flowhistory may be recorded in transverse ridge morphology[9,10].The goal of this ongoing study is to investigate therelationships between rock glacier flow, internal structure, and surface morphology by utilizing ground-basedand airborne geophysics on Sourdough Rock Glacier inAlaska, as well as assess its viability as a Martian analog.Study Site: Sourdough Rock Glacier flows down thesouth slope of Sourdough Peak in the St. Elias Mountains, Alaska. It exhibits numerous transverse compressional ridges in its lower lobe. The middle trunk exhibitshighly regular bumps and swales with an average wavelength of 175 m and detrended heights of up to 12 m.In the middle trunk lineations (boulder trains, furrows)diverge around a point roughly 200 m from the easternedge of the glacier; this may be a bedrock obstacle.Methods: Airborne Photogrammetry: Airbornecolor photographs was acquired in August 2013, August2014, May 2015, and August 2015. These are used tocreate orthophotos and DTMs at sub-meter resolution.Differencing and feature-tracking allows us to extracthorizontal and vertical velocities for the surface of Sourdough Rock Glacier.GPR: Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data was collected in 6 reflection surveys at 50 and 100 MHz. Theseinclude two near the head of the glacier (one of whichcovers the border between mountain meadow and activerock glacier), two over a bump and swale (one flowtransverse, one flow-parallel), and one which samplesthe flow-transverse compressional ridges on the lowerglacier.TEM: Transient electromagnetic (TEM) sounding isa method by which the conductivity structure of the subsurface is inferred through electromagnetic induction.

(D) Horizontal velocities derivedfrom photogrammetry acquired in August 2013 andAugust 2014.20 x 20 m wire loop is used to both generate a magneticfield in the subsurface and to record decaying eddy currents induced in the subsurface when the field is shut off.We invert the data to produce a 3-layer subsurface conductivity model.Forty-seven TEM soundings were performed, mostof which are arranged in a long flow-parallel transect (26observations) and two flow-transverse transects (6 observations across the low lobe and 11 observations acrossthe middle trunk).Results: Airborne Photogrammetry: Feature tracking produced velocities from August 2013-2014 of up to2 m/yr. There is a strong correlation between higher surface velocity and steeper slope. There is stagnation at the2535.pdf

2Figure 2: 100 and 50 MHz GPR acquired in the middletrunk of the glacier (Fig. 1B). A shallow reflectorobserved at a depth of roughly 2.8 m (green arrows) isinterpreted to be the interface between surface debrisand underlying glacier ice. A strong reflector at a depthof roughly 40 m (red arrow), which is not observed inany of the other GPR surveys, may be base of theglacier.point in the middle trunk around which flow lineationsbend.GPR: All GPR reflection surveys revealed a shallowreflector (roughly 50 ns two-way-travel time) that separates an upper layer with high scattering/clutter from acleaner subsurface. Diffraction hyperbola measured under the shallow reflector yielded a subsurface dielectricconstant of 3.6, consistent with relatively pure ice. Inone transect a strong reflector was observed at a depthof roughly 40 m (Fig. 2). Little internal structure is observed in association with transverse ridges, in contrastto previous studies [9].TEM: Most TEM soundings were fit reasonably wellwith a 3-layer model consisting of a moderately conductive top layer 2-3 m thick over a highly resistive layer 4050 m thick (i.e. Fig. 3). These are interpreted as the drysurface debris layer and the interior glacier sitting overFigure 3: TEM sounding acquired in the middle trunk ofthe glacier (Fig. 1B). Best-fit 3-layer model to themeasured voltage decay produced layer interface depthsof 2.5 m and 40 m, which are coincident with the depthsof observed reflectors in GPR acquired for the samelocation (Fig. 2). The middle layer is highly resistive,consistent with high ice content.basement rock. Total glacial thickness as estimated fromTEM correlates with the bump and swale topography andthins out directly upstream of the proposed bedrock obstacle in the middle trunk.Conclusions: We conclude from GPR and TEM datathat Sourdough Rock Glacier is 40-50 m thick, consisting of a a core of relatively pure glacier ice preservedunder a 2.5-3 m thick debris mantle. It is compositionally as well as morphologically similar to Martian debriscovered glaciers [1,2] and thus a viable analog.Sourdough Rock Glacier is currently actively flowing, with surface velocities that correlate with surfaceslope and overall thickness. A bedrock restriction isinferred from bending flowlines, low surface velocities,and local thinning of the deposit.This work has produced a dataset sufficient tofully constrain rheological models of Sourdough RockGlacier's flow in future studies. Linking SRG's rheology to its flow morphology will give us insights we mayapply to Martian debris-covered glaciers.References: [1] Holt, J., et al. (2008), Science, 322,1235-1238.
