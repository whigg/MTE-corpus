EARTH'S MODERATELY VOLATILE ELEMENT COMPOSITION MAY NOT BE CHONDRITIC: EVIDENCE FROM IN, CD AND ZN.

Introduction:  Current models assume that siderophile volatile elements (SVE) in bulk Earth are depleted to the same extent as lithophile elements of similar volatility, in a way like carbonaceous chondrites [1-2]. The observed additional depletion of many SVE relative to lithophile elements in the bulk silicate Earth (BSE) is ascribed to partitioning of SVE into Earth's core [2-3].  However, the assumption of similar volatility of moderately volatile elements during Earth formation processes as in solar gas is quite uncertain. The very different depletion of lithophile and some siderophile elements of similar volatility (e.g., Na-Cl, Cu-Ag-GaGe, Zn-Pb-Sn-S-Cd, In-Tl) poses a major problem for compositional models of volatile elements in the bulk Earth (Figure 1). Because of compositional complexities and limited data sets of metal-sulphide-silicate partition coefficients of the SVE [e.g., 4-7], it is at present unclear if abundances of some SVE in the BSE reflect either solely core formation at high-P-T conditions, or impact-induced element loss during accretion or different SVE compositions of Earth's building materials due to different volatilities compared to solar gas composition [e.g., 8].   Figure 1. Abundances of some volatile and refractory elements in the BSE normalized to CI chondrites and Mg and displayed as a function of 50% condensation temperature in average solar gas [1, 9]. Bulk Earth's presumed volatile depletion trend is based on moderately volatile lithophile elements [2]. Addition of a volatile rich late veneer with 0.5±0.2% of Earth's mass [10] or 2-4 wt.% CI chondritic materials [6,11-12] is indicated.  Here, abundances of In and Cd in the BSE will be refined using new data on mantle rocks and new high pressure-temperature metal-silicate partitioning data on Zn, Cd and In also will be presented. These results will be combined with literature metal-silicate partitioning data to evaluate if some SVE in the bulk Earth (i.e., the relative depletion of Zn, Cd and In) follow the assumed volatile depletion trend or not. Abundances of In and Cd in the BSE: In and Cd abundance data in bulk rocks of many post-Archean mantle peridotites tectonites and xenoliths from different geological settings were measured by isotope dilution ICP-MS after HF-HNO3 digestion in Parr PFA bombs [13-14] to more firmly constrain In and Cd abundances in the BSE and their partitioning during igneous processes in the mantle.   Both peridotite massifs and xenoliths, show a linear decrease of In abundances with decreasing Al2O3 content. This behaviour is independent of the specific history of the peridotites, which were affected by different extent of melting and melt-peridotite reaction. The correlation of In with Al2O3 yields a In content of the BSE of 12-14 ng/g at the Al2O3 content of the BSE of 3.5-4.5 wt.% [1]. Cadmium in peridotites also displays a positive trend with Al2O3, although with larger scatter. The Cd content of the BSE estimated from the CdAl2O3 trend is 31-35 ng/g. The updated estimates confirm that the CI chondrite normalized abundance of In in the BSE is similar to Zn and 3-4 times higher than Cd [1,15]. Indium and Cd abundances in peridotites and basalts, their correlations with Al2O3 and the presence of a small fraction of In and Cd in olivine indicate that In and Cd are slightly more compatible than Al2O3, and that Cd should be more compatible than In. These results and correlations of In with Y and heavy REE [1516] in peridotites and basalts indicate that relative peridotite/silicate melt partition coefficients are DAl ≤ DY and DHREE ≤ DIn < DCd < DZn ≤ 1. High P-T metal-silicate partitioning experiments for Zn, Cd and In: The metal-silicate partitioning of Cd, In and Zn was investigated at high P-T conditions (15-20 GPa, 2000-2300 °C, fO2 of IW -3.0 to -1.2, 014.7 wt.% S and 0.2-3.9 wt. % O in the metal) using a multianvil apparatus and MgO-capsules [14]. Our new high P-T experimental data, as well as literature low and high P-T results [5-7,17], show that Zn is lithophile or weakly siderophile and always less siderophile than In and Cd at the same experimental conditions (Figure 2). Cadmium is also always less siderophile than In, except in iron sulphide-silicate systems (> 28 wt. % S) [7]. Changing P-T, fO2 and light 1219.pdf

elements in the metal affect their partition coefficients between metal and silicate melt, but not the relative behaviour of these elements (Figure 2). We note that Dmetal/silicateIn/ Dmetal/silicateZn and Dmetal/silicateIn/ Dmetal/silicateCd are ≥ 1 at all experimental conditions, with the exception mentioned for Cd and In in sulphide-silicate systems.  Figrue 2. Summary of metal-silicate melt partition coefficients and ratios of partition coefficients (relative siderophile behaviour) of Zn, Cd and In at a range of core formation conditions. a-c) Zn, In and Cd show lithophile to moderately siderophile behaviour. d-e) In and Cd are more siderophile than Zn at all experimental conditions. f) In is more siderophile than Cd at all conditions, except in sulphidesilicate systems.  Discussion:  The relative depletion of Zn, Cd and In in the bulk Earth is calculated starting from the wellconstrained composition of the BSE and applying metal-silicate partitioning data at a range of core formation conditions. Because of the limited variation in ratios of metal-silicate partition coefficients of In, Cd and Zn at a range of core formation conditions, the ratios of their abundances in the core should show limited variations for different core formation models. Adding the element fraction of SVE in Earth's core to the BSE leads to In/Zn of bulk Earth similar to or higher than in CI chondrites and further increases In/Cd, which is suprachondritric in the BSE. This strongly argues that the abundances of these elements in the bulk Earth are inconsistent with the assumed terrestrial volatility trend with elements arranged according to the T50% in average solar gas (Figure 1). Thus the volatile depletion model to estimate abundances of SVE in the Earth's core and in the bulk Earth [2-3] is invalid for Zn, Cd, In and presumably some other SVE (e.g., Cu and Ag) as well. Mildly incompatible elements such as Zn, Cd and In in the BSE are more compatible than Al and the HREE, and thus their abundances would be barely affected by preferential removal of proto-crust during planetary accretion and impact [18]. Isotopic compositions of different volatile elements such as K [19], Rb [20], Zn [21] and Cd [22] further suggest negligible volatility-controlled isotopic fractionation by planetary impact or vaporization of Earth's main building materials. These data suggest that net volatile loss of moderately volatile elements during the Earth' growth must have been limited. Thus the bulk of moderately volatile elements likely were retained during the main accretion stage, and abundances of Zn, Cd and In in the BSE should only reflect their depletion by core formation and the bulk composition of planetary building materials. The normalized abundance of Zn in the BSE is likely not affected by collisional erosion, volatilization and high P-T core formation, but is still lower than in any known chondrites [14]. Thus, the abundances of moderately volatile elements in Earth's building materials most likely reflect pre-accretionary volatile element depletion. Combined with evidence from nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies [e.g., 23], the data suggest that Earth's main building materials originated from the inner solar system where volatile element abundances evolved differently from the formation area of known chondrites [e.g., 24]. Their nonchondritic volatile element compositions may reflect varying volatilities of the same element with changing solar nebular conditions [e.g., 8-9].
