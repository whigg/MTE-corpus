Introduction:  Both NASA and ESA are sendingRaman instruments with green excitation wavelengthson their next Mars rover missions. NASA is also sending a UV Raman instrument (SHERLOC) on the Mars2020 rover.  As Raman instensity is theoretically proportional to the fourth power of the excitation frequency, it is believed that UV excitation would be ideal forthe detection of small concentrations of biosignatures.Though this assumption has proved true in the lab using a simple quartz  matrix [1][2],  the same may notnecessarily  be  true  when considering  a  matrix  morerepresentative of the surface of Mars. Whether one performs UV Raman spectroscopy onindividual  iron-bearing  Mars  analogue  minerals  (e.g.jarosite,  nontrontite,  montmorillonite,  magnetite)  or  acomplex mixture matrix, many common planetary surface minerals show nearly complete absorption over awide range  of  UV wavelengths.  The  combination ofstrong UV absorption and this weak inelastic scatteringphenomenon result in few minerals that can be identified by UV Raman spectroscopy. Changing the excitation wavelength within the UV region may not be ofsignificant benefit due to the broadness of the UV absortion. Minerals that contain transition metals exhibitthis deep UV absorption.We  compare  the  Raman  signal  obtained  at  bothgreen  (532nm)  and  UV  (266nm)  excitation  wavelengths  for  both  an  iron  bearing  sulphate(natrojarosite),  and a non-iron bearing sulphate (synthetic gypsum). The result is that the gypsum exhibitsRaman peaks for both green and UV excitation, whilethe natrojarosite only exhibits Raman peaks for greenexcitation.  The  suggested  mechanism  is  that  ligand-metal  charge  transfers  cause  intense  electronictransitions  in  the  UV,  while  crystal  field  splittingbreaks the degeneracy of iron 3d orbitals, broadeningthe peaks by providing more transition possibilities.Sulphate minerals:  Natrojarosite  NaFe3(SO4)2(OH)6 was selected  forthe iron bearing sulphate as the jarosite group is predicted to be the dominant iron sulphate on the surfaceof Mars. Natrojarosite forms in highly acidic aqueoussolutions,  downstream  from  sulphides  and  primarybasaltic materials [3]. Jarosite (K cation instead of Nacation) has been found using Mossbauer sepctroscopy[4] on the surface of Mars by the Opportunity MERrover,  and  within  patches  of  iron  smectites  by  theCRISM instrument on the MRO orbiter  [3].  Thoughmajor jarosite deposits are assumed to be very localized on the surface of Mars, it is suggested [5] that it isan integral component in the globally mobilized dust,thereby spreading small amounts of the mineral aroundthe planet. This work used natrojarosite with grain size< 45 microns. Gypsum CaSO4-2H2O was selected for the non-ironbearing sulphate as it is suggested to be the dominantcalcium sulphate on Mars [6]. It has been found in vastareas by the OMEGA instrument on the Mars Expressorbiter [6]. It forms as an evaporite of saline lakes. Toensure  no  trace  iron  impurities  were  in  the  sampleused, a batch of synthetic gypsum (< 45 microns) wasselected for examination. This sample is highly hydroscopic, thus O-H stretching intensities could not be expected to be consistent from one trial to the next. Thisfactor does not affect the overall  goals of this study.Also  differing  amounts  and  locations  of  hydrogenbonding could cause slight shifts in the sulphate ion vibrational frequencies.     Method:     Green (532nm)-  The instrument used for the greenexcitation was a Horiba LabRAM. This was providedby the Royal Ontario Museum (Toronto, Canada). Calibration was done using the single stretching peak ofsilicon.Ultraviolet  (266nm)- Our experimental  set  up forUV excitation was the same as that used in Eshelman etal.[2], except for two minor changes. Firstly,  the diffraction grating was changed from a 2400 lines/mm toa 3600 lines/mm for additional resolution. As well, adichroic mirror was added so that a 180 degree collection geometry could be used. Calibration was done using multiple peaks of the amino acid L-alanine. Results: Gypsum (532nm) - The most intense peak occurs at1011 cm-1 and corresponds to the symmetric stretch ofthe sulphate ion. The less intense band at  the higherwavenumber 1138 cm-1 corresponds to the antisymmetric stretch of that ion. Bands at 418 and 496 cm -1 and622 and 673 cm-1 correspond to bending modes. Thefirst two, out-of-plane bends, and the last two, in-planebending  modes.  These  values  correspond  with  published data [1] for natural gypsum samples. The differences are within the uncertainty of the measurements.2138.pdf

The  water  symmetric  and  asymmetric  stretches  werefound at 3407 and 3495 cm-1, respectively.Gypsum (266nm) - As expected, the same numberof peaks were detected. The sulphate stretching peakswere shifted to slightly higher frequencies at 1018 and1146  cm-1.  The  two  out-of-plane  bending  remainedwhile the in-plane bending modes were similar at 622and  675  cm-1.  The  water  symmetric  and  asymmetricstretches were found at  3422 and 3507 cm-1,  respectively.  These  shifts  are  attributed  to  the  hygroscopicnature of the sample. The final result is a superpositionof both water types (adsorbed and structural).Natrojarosite (532nm) - An intense peak occurs at1009 cm-1 and corresponds to the symmetric stretch ofthe sulphate ion. The more intense band at the higherwavenumber of 1112 cm-1 corresponds to the antisymmetric  stretch  of  that  ion.  A  second  antisymmetricstretch is located at 1152 cm-1 and is caused by a degeneracy of that stretch in the presence of the sodiumcation. Published data (Liu and Wang) places the symmetric stretch at 1010 cm-1 and the two antisymettricstretches at 1109 and 1151 cm-1, in agreement with ourdata.  A band at 622 cm-1 corresponds to an in planebending mode and a band at 445 cm-1 corresponds toan  out  of  plane  bending  mode  of  the  sulphate  ion.These agree well with published values [8] of 625 and451  cm-1,  respectively.  Bands  observed  at  227,  292,and 364 cm-1 correspond to O-Fe stretching modes thatagree well with the data of Sasaki. There is one peakobserved at  536  cm-1.  It  is  unclear  if  this is  an O-Hbending mode or another O-Fe mode as it falls in between published data. Natrojarosite (266nm) - No discernible informationis available from this spectra  other  than a weak sulphate stretch around 1022 cm-1. The intensity is threeorders of magnitude lower than that of gypsum and ison the same order as the noise. Figure 1. Raman spectra using green laser.

Conclusion:   Crystal  field splitting in the Fe(III)atoms in octahedral coordination causes a splitting inthe degeneracy of the 3d orbitals. The transition of anelectron from an oxygen 2p orbital to an iron 3d orbital(ligand-metal  charge  transfer)  falls  within  the  UVrange. These transitions are both Laporte allowed andspin  allowed,  thus,  they are  very intense.  There  aremany further splittings in the 3d degeneracy due to spinorbit coupling, the Jahn-Teller effect [9], and asymmetric  ligand site  filling (the  iron  in  natrojarosite  is  attached to four hydroxyls and two oxygens). The multiple decrease of degeneracy causes a broad absorption.The  combination  of  the  intensity  of  the  transitions,their broadness, and the weakness of ineleastic scattering produces poor spectra in the UV in iron-containingsulphate  and  natrojarosite.  The  non-iron-bearing  sulphate, gypsum, produces usable spectra at both excitation wavelengths because it does not experience ligandmetal  charge  transfer.  Cloutis  et  al  [10]  performedspectral reflectance measurements on a natrojarosite +goethite combination that exhibited a reflectance minima  at  262  nm,  which  is  attributed  to  oxygen-ironcharge  transfer,  thereby  supporting  our  results.  Thespectra found in the same study of many iron oxidesshow similar reflectance minima between 240 and 250nm. References: [1]  Skulinova et  al.  (2014)  Planetary  and  SpaceSci., 92, 88-100.
