Introduction:  Both NASA and ESA are sending Raman instruments with green excitation wavelengths on their next Mars rover missions. NASA is also sending a UV Raman instrument (SHERLOC) on the Mars 2020 rover.  As Raman instensity is theoretically proportional to the fourth power of the excitation frequency, it is believed that UV excitation would be ideal for the detection of small concentrations of biosignatures. Though this assumption has proved true in the lab using a simple quartz  matrix [1][2],  the same may not necessarily  be  true  when considering  a  matrix  more representative of the surface of Mars. Whether one performs UV Raman spectroscopy on individual  iron-bearing  Mars  analogue  minerals  (e.g. jarosite,  nontrontite,  montmorillonite,  magnetite)  or  a complex mixture matrix, many common planetary surface minerals show nearly complete absorption over a wide range  of  UV wavelengths.  The  combination of strong UV absorption and this weak inelastic scattering phenomenon result in few minerals that can be identified by UV Raman spectroscopy. Changing the excitation wavelength within the UV region may not be of significant benefit due to the broadness of the UV absortion. Minerals that contain transition metals exhibit this deep UV absorption. We  compare  the  Raman  signal  obtained  at  both green  (532nm)  and  UV  (266nm)  excitation  wavelengths  for  both  an  iron  bearing  sulphate (natrojarosite),  and a non-iron bearing sulphate (synthetic gypsum). The result is that the gypsum exhibits Raman peaks for both green and UV excitation, while the natrojarosite only exhibits Raman peaks for green excitation.  The  suggested  mechanism  is  that  ligand-metal  charge  transfers  cause  intense  electronic transitions  in  the  UV,  while  crystal  field  splitting breaks the degeneracy of iron 3d orbitals, broadening the peaks by providing more transition possibilities. Sulphate minerals:  Natrojarosite  NaFe3(SO4)2(OH)6 was selected  for the iron bearing sulphate as the jarosite group is predicted to be the dominant iron sulphate on the surface of Mars. Natrojarosite forms in highly acidic aqueous solutions,  downstream  from  sulphides  and  primary basaltic materials [3]. Jarosite (K cation instead of Na cation) has been found using Mossbauer sepctroscopy [4] on the surface of Mars by the Opportunity MER rover,  and  within  patches  of  iron  smectites  by  the CRISM instrument on the MRO orbiter  [3].  Though major jarosite deposits are assumed to be very localized on the surface of Mars, it is suggested [5] that it is an integral component in the globally mobilized dust, thereby spreading small amounts of the mineral around the planet. This work used natrojarosite with grain size < 45 microns. Gypsum CaSO4-2H2O was selected for the non-iron bearing sulphate as it is suggested to be the dominant calcium sulphate on Mars [6]. It has been found in vast areas by the OMEGA instrument on the Mars Express orbiter [6]. It forms as an evaporite of saline lakes. To ensure  no  trace  iron  impurities  were  in  the  sample used, a batch of synthetic gypsum (< 45 microns) was selected for examination. This sample is highly hydroscopic, thus O-H stretching intensities could not be expected to be consistent from one trial to the next. This factor does not affect the overall  goals of this study. Also  differing  amounts  and  locations  of  hydrogen bonding could cause slight shifts in the sulphate ion vibrational frequencies.     Method:     Green (532nm)-  The instrument used for the green excitation was a Horiba LabRAM. This was provided by the Royal Ontario Museum (Toronto, Canada). Calibration was done using the single stretching peak of silicon. Ultraviolet  (266nm)- Our experimental  set  up for UV excitation was the same as that used in Eshelman et al.[2], except for two minor changes. Firstly,  the diffraction grating was changed from a 2400 lines/mm to a 3600 lines/mm for additional resolution. As well, a dichroic mirror was added so that a 180 degree collection geometry could be used. Calibration was done using multiple peaks of the amino acid L-alanine. Results: Gypsum (532nm) - The most intense peak occurs at 1011 cm-1 and corresponds to the symmetric stretch of the sulphate ion. The less intense band at  the higher wavenumber 1138 cm-1 corresponds to the antisymmetric stretch of that ion. Bands at 418 and 496 cm -1 and 622 and 673 cm-1 correspond to bending modes. The first two, out-of-plane bends, and the last two, in-plane bending  modes.  These  values  correspond  with  published data [1] for natural gypsum samples. The differences are within the uncertainty of the measurements.  The  water  symmetric  and  asymmetric  stretches  were found at 3407 and 3495 cm-1, respectively. Gypsum (266nm) - As expected, the same number of peaks were detected. The sulphate stretching peaks were shifted to slightly higher frequencies at 1018 and 1146  cm-1.  The  two  out-of-plane  bending  remained while the in-plane bending modes were similar at 622 and  675  cm-1.  The  water  symmetric  and  asymmetric stretches were found at  3422 and 3507 cm-1,  respectively.  These  shifts  are  attributed  to  the  hygroscopic nature of the sample. The final result is a superposition of both water types (adsorbed and structural). Natrojarosite (532nm) - An intense peak occurs at 1009 cm-1 and corresponds to the symmetric stretch of the sulphate ion. The more intense band at the higher wavenumber of 1112 cm-1 corresponds to the antisymmetric  stretch  of  that  ion.  A  second  antisymmetric stretch is located at 1152 cm-1 and is caused by a degeneracy of that stretch in the presence of the sodium cation. Published data (Liu and Wang) places the symmetric stretch at 1010 cm-1 and the two antisymettric stretches at 1109 and 1151 cm-1, in agreement with our data.  A band at 622 cm-1 corresponds to an in plane bending mode and a band at 445 cm-1 corresponds to an  out  of  plane  bending  mode  of  the  sulphate  ion. These agree well with published values [8] of 625 and 451  cm-1,  respectively.  Bands  observed  at  227,  292, and 364 cm-1 correspond to O-Fe stretching modes that agree well with the data of Sasaki. There is one peak observed at  536  cm-1.  It  is  unclear  if  this is  an O-H bending mode or another O-Fe mode as it falls in between published data. Natrojarosite (266nm) - No discernible information is available from this spectra  other  than a weak sulphate stretch around 1022 cm-1. The intensity is three orders of magnitude lower than that of gypsum and is on the same order as the noise. Figure 1. Raman spectra using green laser.

Conclusion:   Crystal  field splitting in the Fe(III) atoms in octahedral coordination causes a splitting in the degeneracy of the 3d orbitals. The transition of an electron from an oxygen 2p orbital to an iron 3d orbital (ligand-metal  charge  transfer)  falls  within  the  UV range. These transitions are both Laporte allowed and spin  allowed,  thus,  they are  very intense.  There  are many further splittings in the 3d degeneracy due to spin orbit coupling, the Jahn-Teller effect [9], and asymmetric  ligand site  filling (the  iron  in  natrojarosite  is  attached to four hydroxyls and two oxygens). The multiple decrease of degeneracy causes a broad absorption. The  combination  of  the  intensity  of  the  transitions, their broadness, and the weakness of ineleastic scattering produces poor spectra in the UV in iron-containing sulphate  and  natrojarosite.  The  non-iron-bearing  sulphate, gypsum, produces usable spectra at both excitation wavelengths because it does not experience ligandmetal  charge  transfer.  Cloutis  et  al  [10]  performed spectral reflectance measurements on a natrojarosite + goethite combination that exhibited a reflectance minima  at  262  nm,  which  is  attributed  to  oxygen-iron charge  transfer,  thereby  supporting  our  results.  The spectra found in the same study of many iron oxides show similar reflectance minima between 240 and 250 nm. References: [1]  Skulinova et  al.  (2014)  Planetary  and  Space Sci., 92, 88-100.
