Introduction: Observations made by the Osiris camera system on July 29, 2015 revealed a presence of a massive outburst of activity which was unexpectedly short-lived (Figure 1). Its source was in the Anuket region at the boundary between the Neck and Head parts of the nucleus.  Figure 1. The Osiris images taken at 13:06, 13:24 and 13:42 GMT from the distance of 186 km from the comet showing outburst of activity. Image source: http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2015/08/Outburst_in_action. The main features of the outburst, as detected by the different instruments onboard the Rosetta orbiter are as follows: 1) a short duration, less than half an hour, unambiguously inferred from Osiris, 2) significant increase in gas production of highly volatile species (CH4,CO) has been reported by the Rosina instrument and 3) water vapor production has not changed that significantly (http://www.esa.int/Our_ Ativties/Space_Science/Rosetta/Comet_s_firework_display_ahead_of_perihelion), and 4) strong collimation of the jet. Another important thing to note is that the outburst occurred at the time the area in question has not experience prolonged illumination. Hereafter we propose a novel mechanism for the transitional outburst activity. We propose that a deepening of a pre-existing crack (fracture) leads to sudden opening of a deep interior reservoir of highly volatile ices. The sudden disequilibration of this steady-state reservoir of high volatiles ices results in violent release of the gas and dust. Since the sublimation is an endothermic process, the temperature of an active region rapidly decreases, which at some point effectively shuts down this activity, in accordance with the observations, the model is schematically depicted in Figure 3.  Geological context of the outburst source: The approximate position of the outburst source is shown in Fig. 2. This location is at the continuation of system of lineaments trending generally along the Neck-Head boundary. [1] and [2] firstly described them as probable tension fractions. The lineaments are dark-looking features of a few meters wide and up to hundred meters long. They have slightly sinuous outlines and variable width suggesting that they are probably surface expressions of tension fractures.  Figure 2. The Osiris narrow-angle camera image of 67P nucleus taken by April 12, 2015 with shown locality of the outburst (white circle). Image source: http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2015/08/29_July_outburst_context. Inlet shows a blow-up of the outburst locality with lineaments being probably tension fractures.  The lineaments' sinuous outlines and variable width indeed suggest that they are tension fractures known in many localities of Earth and other bodies of the Solar system (e.g., [3], [4]). We estimate a potential maximum depth of tension fractures in the consolidated material of the 67P nucleus using the Griffith failure criterion, which describes the maximum depth of tensile fracture as=σT /ρg, where σT is tensile strength, ρ is the density of the host material, and g is surface gravity acceleration ([5], page 212). According [6] σT≤15 Pa, the density ρ≈470 kg/m3 and g=2x10-4 m/s-2, then the maximum fracture depth is dmax ≈100 m. So, the depth of the fractures present in the Anuket region may be as deep as 100m. Such depths are significantly greater than the penetration depth of thermal heat waves, both diurnal and seasonal. Therefore, these fractures provide a likely connection between the deeper interior and the nucleus surface. [2] argues that the fractures' position close to the neck may be "indicative of stresses at the head-body interface". [7] suggested that formation of these fractures could be attributed to rotational- or orbitalinduced stresses in that specific part of the comet. The jet analyzed here happened on July 29, 2015 close to comet perihelion (August 13, 2015) when orbitalinduced stresses should increase. There are known examples when increase of tidal stresses leads to increase of seismic activity: e.g., the deep-moonquake activity detected by the Apollo seismic network which displays 1901.pdf

tidal periodicities caused by the motion of the Moon around Earth (e.g., [8]). Transitional Gas-dust jet formed by deepening fracture: The extremely low average thermal inertia of nucleus material measured by the MIRO instrument [9] and a significant loss of material due to sublimation estimated in [10] provide for strong arguments that a pristine low temperature is preserved at a depth of several tens of meters. The presence of highly volatile substances in the coma is directly proven from the observations of CO, CO2, CH4 from multiple instruments and particularly N2 from Rosina [11]. The authors of the last article concluded that "cometary grains formed at low-temperature conditions below ~30 Kelvin". A heterogeneous two-layer model of nucleus is considered (i.e. the "dust crust" is distinguished explicitly) and used to estimate the depth at which such ices may persist for a long time, while the comet is in the inner Solar System. The thickness of the crust is fixed and it is a free model parameter. The sublimation of water ice is included in the model. The effective sublimation rate is determined by the surface ice-free layer resistance (layer permeability). The corresponding nucleus erosion is also included into the model. We use values of thermal inertia, porosity and material density reported in  [6],[9],[10]. As was noted [12], comet 67P has significantly changed its orbit in the recent past. Because of this reason, we performed simulations for the ten orbital periods. Our calculations show that the mean thermal inertia consistent with the MIRO data implies heat wave penetration depth of about 30m. The model with material ablation (removal of ice and dust from the surface) causes the orbital heat wave to penetrate only to a shallower depth, of about ten meters. This would mean that high volatiles can be preserved for a long time even at these depths. The CO ice at 30K has a saturation pressure of about 0.01Pa, and at 35K it is close to the saturation pressure of water ice at 200K. Therefore, one can expect that even at the temperatures about 30K the pores are filled by the saturated CO vapor. A gas starts to diffuse immediately as the kinetic equilibrium of ice, dust and gas is destroyed as the deepening crack reaches such layer. Because the diffusive resistance of a porous layer is proportional to the ratio of a boundary layer thickness to a pore size outgassing drops down very quickly when gas filling the pores release and saturated front goes down. For example, the effective evacuation depth is smaller than a decimeter for the millimeter size particle. Then the "open" (disequilibration) area should be about thousand square meters to produce 1kg CO. However, if the pore sizes are larger (for example, OSIRIS observed decimeter grains released from the nucleus) then  the locking depth increase and only about ten square meters is needed to produce few kilograms of CO gas. This variant could be realistic since the  length of a fracture can reach tens meters (see above). A vapor release is not a single source of the outgassing. The deepening cracks create also conditions for effective mass loss due to ice sublimation. At so low temperature only small part of CO mass is in a gas phase (≤10g/m3), whereas the ice mass may be in hundred times higher. It means that only ten to hundred square meters are required if there are millimeter size grains and only a few square meters for decimeter size grains. Sublimation is a strongly endothermic process, therefore, without external sources of energy (we consider depths where even thermal flux due to the solar illumination goes to zero) the medium is quickly cooled by the sublimation. For all considered cases in our numerical experiments (30-38K), the temperature goes down and after about 20 minutes the mass production goes down by a factor ten for T0 =32K and by a factor hundred for T0=38K. The duration of the activity is mainly determined by the sublimation energy loss and the effective conductivity of medium: the first determines an energy sink; the second determines an energy influx from interior. Therefore, the active release of gas and dust in the proposed model naturally explains the short duration of the strong outburst that was observed.  Figure 3.
