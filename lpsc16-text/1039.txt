Among the eight different classes of carbonaceous chondrites, the CR2 and CM2 subtypes may contain the most rich and diverse suite of organic compounds [2,3]. The organic composition of CR2 and CM2 carbonaceous chondrites may have been shaped by the extent of their interactions with minerals, aqueous fluids, and thermal metamorphism inside the asteroid parent body [4]. Conversely, CR2 and CM2 meteorites may have originated from distinct asteroid parent bodies having different matrix constitutions [5,6], and their organic inventory may be a signature of different compound distributions that initially accreted into their parent bodies.  We have quantified the abundance and analyzed the molecular distribution of aliphatic amines in the Antarctic carbonaceous chondrites LAP 02342 (CR2), GRA 95229 (CR2), LON 94101 (CM2), LEW 90500 (CM2), and ALH 83100 (CM1/2) (Table 1). Our work may provide insights about the synthetic origins of extraterrestrial aliphatic organic compounds and the potential chemical processes that occurred during and after the accretion of the asteroid parent body. Methodology:  Samples (LAP 02342, 411 mg; GRA 95229, 675 mg; LON 94101, 8 g; LEW 90500, 9 g; ALH 83100, 15 g) were provided from the Antarctic meteorite collection at the NASA Johnson Space Center. The samples, which did not show any visual evidence of fusion crust, were analyzed by gas chromatography mass-spectrometry (GC-MS), after extraction, acid hydrolysis, and derivatization for chiral analysis using previously published methods [7]. Results and Discussion:  We investigated a range of aliphatic amines in CR2 and CM2 chondrites, finding greater total amounts of amines in CR2 than in CM2 chondrites (Table 1). In addition, we observed that isopropyl amine was the most abundant amine in CR2 chondrites; in contrast, methylamine was the most abundant amine in CM2 chondrites. The difference in amine abundances may be in part explained by the lower levels of water observed in CR2 chondrites and thus, the lower levels of aqueous alteration experienced by these types of chondrites. Aqueous alteration has been linked to the depletion of organics in carbonaceous chondrites [8]. However, it is also possible that CR2 and CM2 chondrites exhibit different amine compositions as a result of the discrete formation processes of their parent bodies and the molecules that originally accreted, which may have served as building blocks for the synthesis of amines through asteroidal processing.  We observed that the total concentration of branched amines was higher than that of linear C3-C5 amines in CR2 and CM2 chondrites. We also observed a decrease in the amine concentration with increasing carbon number in CR2 and CM2 chondrites. Additionally, C4 primary amines having the amino group (-NH2) on a secondary carbon (compounds 8 and 10) were found in higher abundances than their isomeric compounds having the amino group on the primary carbon (compounds 14 and 19) or the tertiary carbon (compound 1) in all the chondrites studied here. The greater abundance of branched aliphatic compounds, the inverse relationship between amine concentration and carbon number, and the higher abundance of compounds carrying the amino group on the secondary carbon relative to its other structural isomers, are features that amines share with meteoritic aliphatic amino acids [9,10]. These results may suggest that aliphatic amines and amino acids were synthesized through processes that: (a) enhanced the formation of branched over straight chains, (b) yielded a full suite of structural isomers, and (c) favored the synthesis of secondarybranched aliphatic chains over straight chains and more extensively branched isomers. These molecular similarities between amines and amino acids may represent important constraints for future synthetic experiments and computational models towards the understanding of the abiotic origins of meteoritic organic compounds.  We also noted variability in total amine concentration across samples from the same petrologic type. In the CR2 chondrites, the concentration of amines in LAP 02342 was 1.7 times lower than that of GRA 95229. Similarly, in the CM2 meteorites, LON 94101 contained 4.5 times lower total concentrations of amines than LEW 90500; while ALH 83100  contained 1.6 and 7.4 times less amines than LON 94101 and LEW 90500 respectively. These variabilities may suggest that asteroid parent bodies had heterogeneous accretions, and that processes other than aqueous alteration (i.e., impact and shock-heating) may have affected the abundances of amines.

provide more information about the relationship between organic compounds and asteroidal processing within different parent bodies. Finally, we found racemic compositions of the chiral amines sec-butylamine, sec-pentylamine, and 2methylbutylamine across these CR2 and CM2 chondrites. These results may suggest that amines originated from racemic precursors, or through processes which lead to the amplification of very small enantiomeric excess below our detection limits during their residence inside the parent body. Future analyses of amines and their potential precursor molecules (i.e.; carbonyl compounds, nitriles, alcohols) may provide further insights on the synthesis and the racemic nature of meteoritic aliphatic amines.
