Introduction:  Utopia Planitia, Mars, has been shown to harbor a substantial amount of water ice in the shallow subsurface [1,2]. The ice is contained within layered mesas up to 110 m thick. The mesas appear to be in a state of degradation and have a high concentration of scalloped depressions on their surface (Figure 1). The mechanisms of degradation are still debated, with some authors arguing that the depressions are formed by freeze-thaw cycling [3] while others argue they can form by sublimation alone [4]. In addition to morphologies consistent with removal of material in Utopia Planitia, SHARAD (SHAllow RADar) observations show spatial outliers in the distribution of subsurface reflective interfaces (Figure 2). When the radar outliers are examined in CTX and HiRISE images, they exhibit similar morphologies as the layered mesas located where the bulk of the subsurface reflectors are found. The subsurface interface has been interpreted as the contact between the base of the mesas and the underlying terrain [1,2]. Combining the observations of apparent mesa degradation and the outliers found in the SHARAD-reflective interface suggests that the layered mesas may once been far more extensive than they are now [1,2] The degradation of the mesas in southwestern Utopia Planitia offers a unique opportunity to relate regional ice loss from the shallow subsurface to recent contributions to the global ice cycle on Mars. In this study we attempt to quantify ice loss in Utopia Planitia by mapping the "missing" volume of ice and sediment from between outlier mesas that exhibit reflectors in SHARAD interpreted to indicate the presence of subsurface ice. Methods:  We mapped the locations of mesas, scalloped pits, and inter-mesa plains in Utopia Planitia. A combination of elevation (MOLA) data, thermal inertia data (THEMIS), SHARAD results, and imagery datasets (CTX, HiRISE) were examined when determining which areas were a part of the layered mesa deposits and which areas were degraded. The layered mesas were characterized by: relatively high thermal inertia (range); the presence of polygons and scalloped depressions; an association with SHARAD reflectors; relief 80-110 m higher than surrounding terrain; a low number of craters; and internal layering. These criteria were used to map the gaps in the layered mesa deposits. The volume of "missing" material from intra-mesa depressions was determined by fitting a plane to the elevation of the pit rim and then calculating the volume between the plane and the underlying depression topography. Results:  Mapping of the ice loss is ongoing, but an early, conservative estimate of the volume of removed material is ~1900 km3. See Figure 2 for a map of the volume loss measured thus far. When assuming a     volume ice proportion of 70-95% (from the SHARAD results), that amounts to a water ice loss volume of ~1300 - 1800 km3 or a global equivalent layer (GEL) 9 - 13 mm thick. 90% of the volume of the layered mesas remains intact. Discussion: Recent SHARAD results show that the northern polar layered deposits (NPLD) have grown, on average, 0.24 km3/year over the past 400,000 years (GEL=1.7 Âµm/year) [5]. The inferred source of this ice is ground ice deposits in the mid-latitudes, where nearsurface ice is unstable and undergoing degradation and retreat [6]. The amount of ice loss observed in this study, while substantial, would represent only 1-2% of the total volume gained at the NPLD over the past 400 kyr. Further analysis of midlatitude ice loss outside of Utopia Planitia will be needed if we want to relate loss of ice in the midlatitudes to ice gain at the NPLD.  As ~90% of the volume is intact, there are two possibilities for the degradational mechanis: either the rate of ice loss is very small, or there was a period of more rapid degradation in the past and the mesas are now relatively stable. More work to constrain the age of the deposit is needed to obtain a degradation rate. Fig 1: HiRISE [NASA/JPL/UoA] image  of the layered mesas in western Utopia Planitia.

Reflective regions were found outside of the proposed geologic unit  ABp (circled). When examined closely (2.ii), these regions matched the morphology of  ABp (layered deposits 80-110 m thick with scalloped depressions and polygons).  The radar outliers combined with morphological evidence that the unit has undergone degradation suggest that the layered mesas may have been larger in the past than they are now.
