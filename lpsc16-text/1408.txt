This saves significant time in planetary explorations using rovers and provides a large number of targets accessible to a lander near its landing site. The University of Hawaii (UH), in collaboration with Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and NASA Langley Research Center, has successfully developed a Compact Remote Raman + LIBS + Fluorescence System (CRRLFS), which is capable of measuring Raman, LIBS and fluorescence spectra of minerals under daytime conditions from standoff distances (shown in Fig.1).  For the Mars 2020 mission, UH is collaborating with LANL and French partners (IRAP and CNES), for developing the SuperCam instrument which will be able to perform remote chemical analysis of minerals on Mars using Raman, LIBS and timeresolved fluorescence spectroscopy [1].  With CRRFLS, high quality Raman spectra of various minerals, water, water-ice, CO2-ice, and organic and inorganic chemicals were easily obtained from remote distances up to 50 meters with a 10 s integration time in daylight [2]. We have demonstrated that a large number of minerals including dark minerals such as augite, actinolite, antigorite, dravite, clinochlore, olivine, mica, and other mineral inclusions in Hawaiian basaltic rocks can be easily detected using the system [2-5]. Feldspars are the most common rock forming aluminosilicate minerals occurring in igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks [6]. Raman spectroscopy has been successfully used to distinguish various types of feldspars [6-8].  Here, we demonstrate the remote Raman capability to detect various types of feldspars, e.g., microcline, orthoclase and plagioclase from a distance of 5 m with all room lights turned on.  Our group has previously reported remote Raman spectra of albite and microcline feldspars from 1.5 m distance under simulated Venus conditions [9].  Experimental Set-up and Samples:  The CRRFLS (Fig. 1) uses a 2.5-inch telescope for collecting optical signals.  A 532 nm notch filter is used in the back of the telescope to separate out the Rayleigh scattered light.  A frequency-doubled Nd:YAG pulsed 532 nm mini laser source (20 mJ/pulse, 20 Hz) is used to excite the target located at a remote distance.  The scattered light generated by the target is collected and focused onto the slit of a compact spectrograph of size 10 cm (length) x 8.2 cm (width) x 5.2 cm (height). The spectrograph uses a custom HoloPlex grating and is equipped with a custom-built gated thermo-electrically cooled mini-ICCD detector.  All spectra were measured using a 50 micron slit with the intensified CCD in the gated mode under daylight conditions. The rockforming mineral samples were purchased from Ward's Natural Science Establishment, Inc., Rochester, New York.  Fig. 2 shows the feldspars samples used in this study. Results: Fig. 3 shows remote Raman spectra of orthoclase (KAlSi3O8, Monoclinic space group, C2/m) feldspar from 5 m distance with various integration times.  It is evident from Fig. 3 that all characteristic  Fig. 2:  Feldspar samples used for remote analysis  A: Microcline, Teller, Colorado, USA;  B: Microcline, Madawaska, Ontario, Canada;  C: Microcline (variety Amazonite), Murmansk, Russia;  D: Orthoclase, Gothic, Colorado, USA;  E: Plagioclase (variety Andesine), Essex County, NY; F: Plagioclase (variety Bytownite), Crystal Bay, MN.

Raman lines of orthoclase feldspar could be detected with 2 s of integration time equivalent to 40 laser shots for target excitation. The presence of four-membered rings of TO4 tetrahedra in the feldspar group of mineral results in two or three Raman peaks lying between 450 and 515 cm-1, the strongest of which falls within the narrow region of 505 to 515 cm-1 [6-8].   Fig. 4 shows remote Raman spectra of various microcline (polymorph of KAlSi3O8, Triclinic space group: C-ī ) minerals.  It is shown that the microcline sample from Teller, Colorado has very high level of fast organic/bio-fluorescence background.  The remote Raman system discussed in Fig. 1 is able to detect successfully weak Raman bands of feldspar in presence of the fluorescence and daylight.  Fig. 5 shows the remote Raman spectra of plagioclase (CaAl2Si2O8-NaAlSi3O8) minerals with 30 s of integration time. Due to their dark appearance, this group of feldspars containing Fe2+ substituting for Ca2+ has been challenging for remote Raman detection.  The Si/Al ratio is reflected in the position of high frequency (950-1200 cm-1) antisymmetric stretching of bridging oxygens (υas(T-O-T)).  The presence of υas band at lower frequency of 981 cm-1 in the plagioclase spectra indicates higher amount of Al/Si ratio in these feldspars, and a shoulder at the lower frequency  (~ 930 cm-1) indicate Al/Si disorder.  It is shown here that good quality Raman spectra of these plagioclases can be obtained from 5 m distance.  The CRRLFS also measures the atmospheric gases between the system and the target. The spectra shown in Fig. 3 to 5 demonstrate detection of oxygen (1556 cm-1) and nitrogen (2331 cm-1). Since the length of atmosphere is fixed in these experiments, the Raman intensity of nitrogen could be used to estimate Raman cross-section of various minerals.  It is observed that iron containing plagioclase minerals have the weakest Raman crosssection in comparison to orthoclase and microclines.  Summary: The data presented show the ability of a portable compact remote Raman+LIBS+Fluorescence system to detect feldspar minerals from a distance of 5 meters in a well illuminated background.
