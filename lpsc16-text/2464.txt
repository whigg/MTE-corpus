Introduction: Moni is a ~5 km diameter crater in the southern mid-latitude highlands of Noachis Terra  (-47.01˚N, 18.77˚E). Located on the inner ring of the larger (~200 km diameter) Kaiser Crater, Moni's rim reaches a maximum elevation of 1457 m. Moni crater has interior and exterior walls dissected by gullies and its floor exhibits arcuate ridges interpreted as remnant degraded glacial features [e.g. 1,2,3,4], such as glacial terminal moraines. These arcuate ridges are located below debris aprons that extend from the gullies.  The gullies of Moni Crater are particularly interesting because they dissect into, and beyond, the crater's rim. Here we document morphologic and morphometric evidence in Moni Crater that water ice deposits, associated with glacial and peri/paraglacial processes, have significantly altered gully headwalls. Therefore, it is likely that meltwater was a key mechanism involved in the development of gullies, consistent with the shallow runoff-like drainage patterns observed in gully alcove heads.  Including Moni, only three craters on the floor of Kaiser Crater have gullies; others have diameters <5km, and are either degraded or filled.  In the Kaiser region, only ~9% of craters with diameters ≥1km have gullies, in contrast to the ~25% for the region around Palikir Crater, which has one of the highest gully densities on Mars [5].  Despite low regional gully density, Moni Crater has a high concentration of interior and exterior gullies on its slopes relative to its diameter.  Previous research in Kaiser has mainly focused on the large, morphologically similar crater (-46.17˚N, 18.8˚E), just north of Moni [8]. The unnamed crater likely has greater quantities of debris-covered icy crater fill, evident by viscous pressure flow lines and a relatively lower interior cavity volume.  The gullies in this larger crater also likely formed dominantly by a fluvial erosional mechanism [8,9]. Using MGS TES data from 1999-2006, and Mars Odyssey THEMIS data from 2005-2015, we record surface pressures in Kaiser Crater that reach 5.7 mbar, and surface temperatures that approach 32˚C during Ls 285˚, near the peak of the southern summer (Ls 270˚).  Temperatures in Moni Crater  exceed 0˚C between ~Ls 228˚ and 303˚.  Data and Software Utilized: We used data from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE [10]) and Context Camera (CTX [11]) on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO).  We used a HiRISE Digital Terrain Model (DTM) DTEEC_PSP_007110_1325_PSP_006820_1325 to extract profiles of gullies and features in the study area. To measure and run calculations, we used the ENvironment for Visualizing Images (ENVI; Exelis Visual Information Solutions, Boulder, CO), JMARS [12], and MATLAB (MATLAB and Statistics Toolbox; The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA). Temperature and Pressure data were from the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES [6]) and from the Mars Odyssey Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS [15]).  Morphologic Analysis:   (1) Arcuate Ridges in Moni rise an average of ~30 m above surrounding floors, and a maximum of ~50 m.  The north ridge is ~1675 m long. On the north ridge we find a bench or laterally continuous terrace between 1160 and 1170 m elevation (Fig. 1). (2) Boulder mapping on the floor of Moni, based on shadows and contrast to a 25cm/pixel resolution, reveals a clustering preference where over 80% of exposed boulders are located in the center of the crater or in the ridges, while the fewest boulders/m2 are located between ridges and cratered walls (Fig. 1).   Figure 1: Boulder map of north floor arcuate ridge showing a preference for boulders (red) on the southfacing slope, and grayscale arcuate ridge below. On the floor of Moni, there are up to 12m diameter boulders, boulder clusters, piles of debris over a hummocky likely ice-rich subsurface, and exposed boulders on the south-facing side of such piles.   (3) Moni Crater floor is highest in the southeast, characterized by patterned ground encircled by a partially hidden arcuate ridge.  Light-toned dunes, superposed by gully aprons, also cover the floor. Large boulders appear perched atop these dunes, observed to be immobile from 2007-2014 (aside from a boulder slip), suggesting induration.  Elevation profiles reveal significant symmetry, similar slope aspects, and similar 2464.pdf

height/width ratios as previous research measuring Transverse Aeolian Ridges (TARs) on Mars [16,17].   (4) Gullies in and around Moni are preferentially pole-facing. North wall interior gullies have the greatest degrees of incision and branching development, and incise up to 4-6m into the fractured headwall, forming shallow channels on the crater rim (Fig. 2) Figure 2: Moni Crater north wall, showing gully channels incising beyond the rocky crater rim. 3D perspective view at 3x, angled to face northwest.  Interpretation & Morphometric Synthesis: Headwall incision morphologies suggest a gully formation by liquid water flows. Broadly concave and large degraded older channels suggest greater discharge volumes in the past.  If liquid water persisted in Moni for any significant time, it is likely to have ponded within the north arcuate ridge enclosure. Alternatively, the enclosure's drop-off may have formed as the result of snow/ice erosion, a resistant layer, or sublimational slumping of the ridge.  The ridge ends stretch up the crater walls, which may be an ablational feature indicating an originally higher level of icy fill slunk away from the wall. Additionally, the arcuate ridge appears twisted at one peak, perhaps in a sublimational contraction. Most curious about this ridge, is the boulder size dichotomy among its slopes.  Mophometric results suggest a significant volatile loss from Moni gully systems. An average of 64% of the material eroded from 8 of these gully headwalls may be unaccounted for [18]. After considering computational error, aeolian transport of finer-grained material, and long-term compaction of the deposits, there remains a volume discrepancy, likely the evaporation and sublimation of water and ice [18].  Proposed Formational Timeline: 1) Cold conditions promote icy crater floor fill and snow/ice accumulation above the rim and along interior crater walls, and an ice-rich subsurface. 2) Debris from the ice-fractured headwall is deposited downslope to accumulate above an icy crater floor at the foot of the wall, sliding down a semi-permanent snow/ice bank, similar to a supraglacial flow till moraine, or protalus rampart. 3) Climate changes result in the excavation of exposed surface ice to form an ablation hollow between the debris pile and wall. Floor ice likewise ablates, and the compaction of debris cover prevents further ablation. 4) Gully channels develop from meltwater flows. Melt channels, the ponding of meltwater, and additional accumulation of snow and ice could occur seasonally. 5) The formation of new deposits and larger gully flows taper off, and snow/ice, particularly in protected, shaded headwall regions, melts seasonally to form the more recent, smaller channels.  Volatile loss from debris aprons is likely due to either infiltration of meltwater back into the subsurface or the subsequent sublimation of ice and liquid water. 6) In present-day conditions, crater floor sublimation till has fully depressed. Ice likely persists within the ice-cored moraine and as debris-covered ice in the southeast crater floor.  Conclusions: The proposed formational timeline in Moni Crater explains arcuate ridge formation, the gullies' deep headwall incision and rim erosion, the older, larger episodes of channel formation, the volume discrepancy, the boulders perched atop the arcuate ridge, and the lack of boulders interior to the ridge. The source of most boulders within Moni is likely from rim erosion, and although we consider a nearby impact as a possible contributor to original boulder emplacement, it is evident that glacial, post-glacial, and fluvial mechanisms are independently able to explain the patterns and morphologies observed in Moni Crater.  Considering the great amount of ice we interpret has been removed from Moni Crater in the recent past, and the temperature variance recorded today, it is likely that Moni has seen recurring periods of deposition, freezing, melting, and sublimation. These warmer periods in particular likely released the melt water to form the gullies. More recent channel modifications could be from remnant interstitial ground ice melt and sublimation, and CO2 frost actions. The measured volume discrepancies interpreted as resulting from volatile loss are consistent with gully deposits consisting of a mixture of lithic sediments and water-ice. Thus, the deposits comprise prime astrobiological and resource exploration targets.  References: [1] Berman et al., 2005, Icarus, 178, 465-486. [2] Hartman et al., 2014, Icarus, 228, 96-120.
