Introduction:  Orbital spectrometers have revealed that  minerals  associated  with  aqueous  alteration  are globally distributed on Mars  [1,  2].  The diversity of these mineral detections implies a wide variety of formation  mechanisms  but  a  substantial  fraction  are Fe/Mg smectites. Many occurrences of these clays suggest formation in the subsurface as part of hydrothermal systems [3, 4]. Such systems on Earth are generally considered to be isochemical in nature [5, 6], and this mode of crystal alteration should also be considered for Mars. To date there have been no confirmed detections of Fe(II) bearing smectites on the surface of Mars, which has  been  interpreted  to  indicate  that  many smectites formed  in  the  near-surface  under  oxidizing conditions[7].  However,  thermodynamic  models  suggest  that,  removed from atmospherically-derived oxidants[8, 9], hydrothermal systems in early Mars would have produced Fe(II) bearing clay [10, 11, 12]. Further evidence  comes from capping clay units which have been leached of Fe but not Al, which can only occur in anoxic conditions[13]. The Sheepbed mudstone is currently the only clay-bearing unit with published XRD patterns, and so is a key point of comparison. It  was previously  shown that  this  clay  is  consistent  with  a mostly oxidized trioctahedral clay, Griffithite, which is thought to have been emplaced as a ferrous clay which was later oxidized [14]. Later it was shown that it is also consistent with some compositions of trioctahedral synthetic  clays  which  are  Fe(II)  rather  than  Fe(III) bearing  [15].  Here  we  compare  smectites  formed through hydrothermal alteration in a whole-rock system to those found in Gale Crater and discuss the implications this has to Mars. Methods:  Martian clay formation pathways were studied  by  experimentally  altering  terrestrial  wholerock  assemblages.  Two  USGS mafic  rock  standards most  similar  to  basalt  studied  at  Gusev  Crater  [16] (BIR-1a, Icelandic basalt and DNC-1a, North Carolina dolerite)  were  selected.  All  sample  preparation  and storage took place in an oxygen-free glove box. Both  rock standards were received  as  a  homogenized powder and were further ground to a uniform 1-5 μm size distribution in a micronizing mill. 8 g of the ground powder was added with approximately 20 mL of deionized water into PTFE-lined hydrothermal reaction vessels. The vessels were left sealed in an oxygenfree nitrogen atmosphere at 200°C for 21 days. After reaction any excess fluid was decanted and the samples were dried. Major  mineralogy  was  investigated  with  powder XRD on a Bruker D8 Advance Diffractometer and spot analysis performed on unground replicate samples using a  JEOL JXA-8200  electron  microprobe.  Mineral abundances  were  quantified  from  XRD  by  Rietveld analysis  using TOPAS.  Imaging was done to  understand the spatial relationship between primary minerals and any secondary minerals that formed. This was performed on a JEOL 7001LVF SEM. Fe partitioning was studied using X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy. Fe K-edge spectra were collected in transmission mode at Advanced Photon Source beamline 12-BM. XAFS spectra can provide information about oxidation state as well as local coordination  environment  (within ~5Å)  of  the  target atom, e.g.  Fe.  Additionally,  since XAFS spectra  mix linearly it is possible to use linear combination fitting (LCF) to determine Fe partitioning between minerals in multi-phase samples such as our basalts. LCF can be performed  on  both  the  X-ray  absorption  near  edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure  (EXAFS)  regions.  End-member  standards were gathered from the Washington University mineral collection for  primary minerals.  Clay standards  were synthesized according to previously developed and described methods [15]. Results:  While both basalts are chemically similar, they differ in relative mineral abundances, with DNC having more feldspar and less pyroxene than BIR; they each have roughly equal amounts of olivine. Over the course of the experiment DNC underwent much more alteration.  This  can be  seen from the formation of a substantial  smectite  (001)  peak  in  the  altered  DNC XRD pattern (Figure 1) as well as in the large change in the relative abundances of minerals, characterized by substantial decrease in abundance of olivine and relative enrichment of  feldspar, pyroxene, and magnetite . A much lesser degree of clay formation occurred for BIR. The minerals that showed enrichment likely also experienced dissolution, though at a substantially slower  rate  than  olivine,  which  increased  their  relative abundances.  The d-spacing of the (060) reflection corresponds to the unit cell dimension b and can determine occupancy of the octahedral sheet in a clay [17]. It is thus an important feature for identifying smectites. Both altered materials show a 1.54  Å reflection indicating a trioctahedral smectite structure. CheMin lacks the angular range to measure (060) spacing but can detect the (02l) reflection, although this is only useful for comparison  of  relative  lattice  parameters  because  of  it's asymmetric  shape.  The  (02l)  reflections  measured  in both the John Klein and Cumberland targets are consistent with the purely ferrous smectites produced in this study (Figure 2). Linear  combination  fitting  of  both  EXAFS  and XANES  reveal  substantial  Fe  repartitioning  occurs even for BIR, which underwent limited alteration overall (Table 1). These results mirror those from XRD and show substantial decrease in Fe in olivine with an enrichment of Fe in pyroxene and magnetite. Conclusions: Clays produced in this study are similar to those found in the Sheepbed mudstone, suggesting a detrital rather than authigenic origin. However, it is not a unique match and Curiosity does not have the instrumentation necessary to study Fe oxidation state so it is not possible to determine the true composition or origin with certainty. If clays with similar structural properties are found in the clay-bearing units higher on Mount Sharp or in future landed missions it could indicate widespread clay formation occurring under anoxic conditions. If true, this could affect potential past habitability. Water-rock interaction occurring in conditions lacking oxidants  for  Fe  constrains  a  possible  energy source even if conditions are otherwise habitable. % BIR un BIR alt DNC un DNC alt Olivine 66.7 25.4 67.0 0.0 Pyroxene 32.6 45.2 27.2 31.7 Magnetite 0.0 0.0 5.5 11.3 Clay 0.0 29.0 0.0 57.8 Table 1: Results of linear combination fitting the XANES region of each sample.
