CLAY FORMATION AND IRON PARTITIONING DURING ANOXIC ISOCHEMICAL HYDROTHERMAL BASALT ALTERATION: IMPLICATIONS FOR FORMATION OF FE SMECTITES ON EARLYMARS.  R. D. Nickerson1, S. M. Chemtob2, and J. G. Catalano1, 1Washington University in St. Louis, Dept. of Earthand Planetary Sciences (rnickerson@levee.wustl.edu), 2Temple University, Dept. of Earth & Environmental Science.Introduction:  Orbital spectrometers have revealedthat  minerals  associated  with  aqueous  alteration  areglobally distributed on Mars  [1,  2].  The diversity ofthese mineral detections implies a wide variety of formation  mechanisms  but  a  substantial  fraction  areFe/Mg smectites. Many occurrences of these clays suggest formation in the subsurface as part of hydrothermal systems [3, 4]. Such systems on Earth are generallyconsidered to be isochemical in nature [5, 6], and thismode of crystal alteration should also be considered forMars.To date there have been no confirmed detections ofFe(II) bearing smectites on the surface of Mars, whichhas  been  interpreted  to  indicate  that  many smectitesformed  in  the  near-surface  under  oxidizingconditions[7].  However,  thermodynamic  models  suggest  that,  removed from atmospherically-derived oxidants[8, 9], hydrothermal systems in early Mars wouldhave produced Fe(II) bearing clay [10, 11, 12]. Furtherevidence  comes from capping clay units which havebeen leached of Fe but not Al, which can only occur inanoxic conditions[13]. The Sheepbed mudstone is currently the only clay-bearing unit with published XRDpatterns, and so is a key point of comparison. It  waspreviously  shown that  this  clay  is  consistent  with  amostly oxidized trioctahedral clay, Griffithite, which isthought to have been emplaced as a ferrous clay whichwas later oxidized [14]. Later it was shown that it isalso consistent with some compositions of trioctahedralsynthetic  clays  which  are  Fe(II)  rather  than  Fe(III)bearing  [15].  Here  we  compare  smectites  formedthrough hydrothermal alteration in a whole-rock systemto those found in Gale Crater and discuss the implications this has to Mars.Methods:  Martian clay formation pathways werestudied  by  experimentally  altering  terrestrial  wholerock  assemblages.  Two  USGS mafic  rock  standardsmost  similar  to  basalt  studied  at  Gusev  Crater  [16](BIR-1a, Icelandic basalt and DNC-1a, North Carolinadolerite)  were  selected.  All  sample  preparation  andstorage took place in an oxygen-free glove box.Both  rock standards were received  as  a  homogenized powder and were further ground to a uniform 1-5μm size distribution in a micronizing mill. 8 g of theground powder was added with approximately 20 mLof deionized water into PTFE-lined hydrothermal reaction vessels. The vessels were left sealed in an oxygenfree nitrogen atmosphere at 200°C for 21 days. Afterreaction any excess fluid was decanted and the sampleswere dried.Major  mineralogy  was  investigated  with  powderXRD on a Bruker D8 Advance Diffractometer and spotanalysis performed on unground replicate samples using a  JEOL JXA-8200  electron  microprobe.  Mineralabundances  were  quantified  from  XRD  by  Rietveldanalysis  using TOPAS.  Imaging was done to  understand the spatial relationship between primary mineralsand any secondary minerals that formed. This was performed on a JEOL 7001LVF SEM.Fe partitioning was studied using X-ray absorptionfine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy. Fe K-edge spectrawere collected in transmission mode at Advanced Photon Source beamline 12-BM. XAFS spectra can provide information about oxidation state as well as localcoordination  environment  (within ~5Å)  of  the  targetatom, e.g.  Fe.  Additionally,  since XAFS spectra  mixlinearly it is possible to use linear combination fitting(LCF) to determine Fe partitioning between minerals inmulti-phase samples such as our basalts. LCF can beperformed  on  both  the  X-ray  absorption  near  edgestructure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption finestructure  (EXAFS)  regions.  End-member  standardswere gathered from the Washington University mineralcollection for  primary minerals.  Clay standards  weresynthesized according to previously developed and described methods [15].Results:  While both basalts are chemically similar,they differ in relative mineral abundances, with DNChaving more feldspar and less pyroxene than BIR; theyeach have roughly equal amounts of olivine. Over thecourse of the experiment DNC underwent much morealteration.  This  can be  seen from the formation of asubstantial  smectite  (001)  peak  in  the  altered  DNCXRD pattern (Figure 1) as well as in the large changein the relative abundances of minerals, characterized bysubstantial decrease in abundance of olivine and relative enrichment of  feldspar, pyroxene, and magnetite .A much lesser degree of clay formation occurred forBIR. The minerals that showed enrichment likely alsoexperienced dissolution, though at a substantially slower  rate  than  olivine,  which  increased  their  relativeabundances.2458.pdf

The d-spacing of the (060) reflection correspondsto the unit cell dimension b and can determine occupancy of the octahedral sheet in a clay [17]. It is thusan important feature for identifying smectites. Both altered materials show a 1.54  Å reflection indicating atrioctahedral smectite structure. CheMin lacks the angular range to measure (060) spacing but can detect the(02l) reflection, although this is only useful for comparison  of  relative  lattice  parameters  because  of  it'sasymmetric  shape.  The  (02l)  reflections  measured  inboth the John Klein and Cumberland targets are consistent with the purely ferrous smectites produced in thisstudy (Figure 2).Linear  combination  fitting  of  both  EXAFS  andXANES  reveal  substantial  Fe  repartitioning  occurseven for BIR, which underwent limited alteration overall (Table 1). These results mirror those from XRD andshow substantial decrease in Fe in olivine with an enrichment of Fe in pyroxene and magnetite. Conclusions: Clays produced in this study are similar to those found in the Sheepbed mudstone, suggesting a detrital rather than authigenic origin. However, itis not a unique match and Curiosity does not have theinstrumentation necessary to study Fe oxidation stateso it is not possible to determine the true compositionor origin with certainty. If clays with similar structuralproperties are found in the clay-bearing units higher onMount Sharp or in future landed missions it could indicate widespread clay formation occurring under anoxicconditions. If true, this could affect potential past habitability. Water-rock interaction occurring in conditionslacking oxidants  for  Fe  constrains  a  possible  energysource even if conditions are otherwise habitable.% BIR un BIR alt DNC un DNC altOlivine 66.7 25.4 67.0 0.0Pyroxene 32.6 45.2 27.2 31.7Magnetite 0.0 0.0 5.5 11.3Clay 0.0 29.0 0.0 57.8Table 1: Results of linear combination fitting the XANES region of each sample.References: [1] Murchie et al., (2009)  JGR, 114,E00D06.
