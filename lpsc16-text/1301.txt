MAGNETIC ANOMALIES CONCENTRATED NEAR AND WITHIN MERCURY'S IMPACT BASINS: EARLY MAPPING AND INTERPRETATION.  Lon L. Hood, Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona 85721 (lon@lpl.arizona.edu).  Introduction:  The NASA MESSENGER Discovery mission has obtained a very valuable dataset for investigating crustal magnetism on Mercury [1].  Lowaltitude magnetometer data from August and September of 2014 have previously been applied to construct a preliminary map of the crustal field at 80 km altitude covering latitudes of 50o-80oN and longitudes of 160o330oE [2].  It was found that the strongest anomalies within the mapped region were located just north and northeast of the Caloris impact basin.  Strong anomalies occurred over smooth plains that are part of a circumferential belt of plains around Caloris [3] and over the Odin Formation (interpreted as primary Caloris basin ejecta).  It was therefore proposed that many of the Mercurian anomaly sources consist of impact basin ejecta materials.  As reviewed briefly in [2], such an interpretation would be consistent with lunar results showing that impact basin ejecta materials such as the Cayley smooth plains are relatively magnetic and are likely sources of crustal anomalies detected from lunar orbit [4,5,6].  Magnetic anomalies were weak over the northern polar plains on Mercury, which have a probable volcanic origin [3].  This is also consistent with orbital measurements of weak fields over the lunar maria. In this paper, initial mapping is reported of MESSENGER magnetometer data from the last 2 months of the mission (March and April, 2015) during which the periapsis altitude remained relatively low and external field interference was minimal.  A preliminary altitude-normalized map is constructed at 40 km altitude covering latitudes of 35oN to 75oN and longitudes of 90oE to 270oE. Mapping Methods:  As discussed in [2], the eccentricity of MESSENGER's orbit combined with the need for periodic correction burns resulted in a very variable spacecraft altitude during those periods when crustal fields could be measured.  An equivalent source dipole (ESD) technique [e.g., 7,8] is therefore necessary to construct approximate maps at a constant altitude.  The data are first edited to select only measurements at < 100 km altitude and are then filtered to accept only field variations with wavelengths less than some chosen upper limit (here 215 km) to minimize non-crustal field contributions.  Any time intervals characterized by random field variations that do not repeat on successive orbits are eliminated.   Careful editing was especially necessary near the southern mapping boundary (35oN) where the spacecraft altitude was rapidly increasing because small spurious variations at high altitudes can be amplified by the ESD technique when continued to a lower altitude.  A mapping altitude of 40 km is chosen because it is within the range of measurement altitudes and it is comparable to the orbit track separation at northern midlatitudes.  As in [2], an array of vertically oriented dipoles separated by 1o in latitude and 2o  in longitude (3640 dipoles) on a spherical surface at a chosen depth was adopted.  To improve computational efficiency, the array was divided into a series of six overlapping 40o longitude sectors.  Also, the number of data points along a given orbit track was reduced by calculating 0.1o latitude averages. As shown in [2], the resulting map is not strongly sensitive to the choice of an exactly radial orientation for the dipole array.  Results are more sensitive to the chosen dipole array depth.  Trial calculations showed that a depth of about 20 km yields a minimum total RMS deviation of the model radial field component from the observed field component along the original orbit trajectories.                                  Figure 1 Results:  Figure 1 superposes a map of the magnetic field magnitude at 40 km altitude onto a MESSENGER Laser Altimeter color shaded map, which is in turn superposed onto a monochrome Dual Imaging System mosaic at 4000 m/pixel (messenger.jhuapl.edu) for the region around Caloris. Figure 2 shows a similar superposition for the radial magnetic field component.  In both figures, the contour interval is 2 nT.  In Figure 2, the zero contour is black while positive contours are red and negative contours are 1301.pdf

blue and dashed. The main differences between the current maps and those of [2] are that the mapped area is increased and the altitude is lower.  Most importantly, the southern boundary has been extended southward from 50oN to 35oN, providing some coverage over Caloris itself.  As seen in both figures, a large group of strong anomalies surrounds Caloris and some strong anomalies are present within the northern third of the basin interior where measurements are available.  Figure 3 shows a smaller concentration of radial field component anomalies in the vicinity of the Sobkou basin centered near 35oN, 230oE. Examinations of available orbital data suggest associations of  anomalies with other impact basins in the unmapped hemisphere  (90oW to 90oE) as well.  Future mapping may confirm this.                               Figure 2 Interpretation:  First, as discussed also in [2], the occurrence of strong anomalies in the near vicinities of impact basins over smooth (Cayley-like) plains and primary ejecta is consistent with the hypothesis that at least some anomaly sources at Mercury consist of impact basin ejecta. The stronger Mercurian surface gravity field (2.2 times that of the Moon) may have led to more concentrated ejecta and associated magnetic anomalies near the basins than is the case for the Moon. A direct interpretation of the circum-Caloris anomalies in terms of a former core dynamo is not possible without a full knowledge of the thermal and shock histories of the ejecta materials.  Specifically, transient magnetizing fields in the absence of a core dynamo may not be completely ruled out if impact shock was the primary magnetization mechanism [2].  However, anomalies within impact basins that are not a consequence of superposed ejecta represent strong evidence for a core dynamo at the time when the impact basin formed. This is because the post-impact material within the basins was heated to high temperatures and remained above the Curie temperature for long time periods (up to 1 Myr), requiring a long-lived, steady magnetizing field. As best seen in the radial field component of Figure 2, the anomalies within Caloris are arranged in a semi-circular pattern that is roughly concentric with the basin rim.  This is similar to that observed for lunar basins [e.g., 9], strongly suggesting sources in the form of impact melt beneath the visible surface.  It is unlikely that later volcanic intrusions or fill within the basin could be the anomaly sources because of (a) the weakness of anomalies over volcanic plains elsewhere on Mercury (e.g., Borealis Planitia); and (b) the symmetry of the anomalies about the basin center.  It may therefore be inferred that a core dynamo existed at the time of the Caloris impact.  The same inference may be true for the older Sobkou basin.
