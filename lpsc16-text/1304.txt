Introduction: The satellite mission Formosat3/COSMIC (Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate) consists of six micro-satellites, and each of them has four GPSantennas. It was launched in April 2006, orbiting around the Earth at approximately 800 km. The primary scientific goal of the mission is to demonstrate the value of near-real-time radio occultation (RO) observations in improving operational numerical weather predictions (NWP). The goal is readily shown by assimilating the measurements of atmospheric parameters into used NWP-models. These parameters include density, temperature, pressure and relative humidity fields in the atmosphere. An analysis of their geographic and seasonal distributions is necessary to the understanding of the energy and momentum transfer and the reaction of the polar atmosphere in response to global warming. This task is especially important as the Polar Regions are very sensitive to the change in global temperature and it may be a major cause of global sea level rising. In this work, a statistical analysis of the internal gravity wave (IGW) activity in polar atmospheric regions (latitudes > 60º) using Formosat3/COSMIC RO temperature data collected from July 2006 to March 2009 has been performed. Geographic and seasonal distributions of the IGW potential energy (wave activity indicator) in the altitude interval from 15 to 35 km have been determined and analyzed. The obtained results show that the wave activity in the polar atmosphere is strong in winter and spring. The potential energy of IGWs in spring is largest in Antarctic atmospheric region, while it is largest in winter in Arctic region. The wave potential energy increases with altitude up to 35 km in the atmosphere of both Earth's hemispheres. In Antarctic region, internal waves with high potential energy occur in the atmosphere over the Antarctic Peninsula. In Arctic region, a high wave activity is mainly observed over North Atlantic Ocean (Iceland) and Scandinavian Peninsula.The aim of this work is: 1. Statistical analysis of the IGW activity in Polar Regions (latitudes > 60º) of the Earth's atmosphere using Formosat-3/COSMIC RO temperature data collected from July 2006 to March 2009. 2. Determination and analysis of geographic and seasonal distributions of the IGW potential energy per unit mass (wave activity indicator) in the altitude interval from 15 to 35 km. Calculations of IGW potential energy Ep in Polar Regions from COSMIC RO temperature data collected in 2006-2009: The Level 2 products of Formosat-3/COSMIC RO data from TACC (http://tacc.cwb.gov.tw) are used in this study. These COSMIC RO data having a very good altitude resolution provide a unique opportunity to study a global morphology of IGWs in the Earth's polar stratosphere. The precision of COSMIC refractivity is < 0.2% between 10 and 20 km, degrading to 0.7% at 30 km, and the accuracy of the COSMIC derived temperature is better than 0.5 K [1]. In this study, the altitude range between 15 and 35 km is considered. Temperature profiles from DOY 194 in 2006 to DOY 90 in 2009 with latitudes greater than 60° are collected and split into the background part and temperature residuals. Then, band-pass filtering with cutoffs at 2 and 10 km is applied to this temperature residuals to separate the fluctuations with vertical wavelengths λz ranging from 2 to 10 km. We obtained Ep data in the cells with 2.5°x 2.5° in longitude and latitude, and the monthly mean Ep are calculated at 1520 km, 20-25 km, 25-30 km and 30-35 km from the following expression [2]: 2 2 22 2 2 2 2 2 222 2 2 4 2 21 12 4 4 4 4b b bp eb b b b b bg T g T N g m T N NE aN T N T m N T m m ′ ′ ′= = = ⋅ ⋅ = ⋅ <  The value Nb2/(4m2) is the threshold magnitude of potential energy for saturated IGWs (ae < 1) with any intrinsic frequency. Thus, we concluded that the observed temperature fluctuations in the stratosphere are generally related to IGWs when the value Ep obeys the inequality Ep< Nb2/(4m2). Figures 1 and 2 show geographical distributions of the monthly mean Ep for different seasons in 20062009 averaged at 20-25 km in the Arctic and Antarctic regions correspondingly (COSMIC RO data). An analysis of COSMIC data shows that the wave activity in the stratosphere of Polar Regions is strong in winter and spring. In the Arctic region, the wave potential energy Ep shows clear annual variation with a maximum in winter (Figure 1). In the Antarctic region, Ep gradually increases from July and reaches maximum in spring before decreasing rapidly (Figure 2). Conclusion: We studied the behavior of the atmospheric IGWs in the stratosphere at 15-35 km in both the Arctic and Antarctic regions (latitudes > 60°) 1304.pdf

Vaisala frequency squared and the temperature fluctuations with vertical wavelengths from 2 to 10 km. Then we determined the wave potential energy Ep at 15-20 km, 20-25 km, 25-30 km and 30-35 km. The Ep values were averaged every one month and season in a cell 2.5°x2.5° in longitude and latitude. The wave potential energy increases with altitude up to 35 km in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. A significant localized enhancement of Ep in winter and spring is recognized over a few specific mountainous areas such as Scandinavia, Iceland, Greenland, Antarctic Peninsula and Trans-Antarctic Mountains (Figures 1 and 2). Therefore orographic effects seem to be one of the main mechanisms for generating IGWs in the Polar Regions. However, the line of sight of the COSMIC observations in all regions are preferentially oriented close to the north-south axis, making mountain waves more likely to be observed [1]. This suggests an overestimate of orographic activity of IGWs when compared to isotropic wave sources.  Acknowledgments: This work was partially supported by the Program no. 7 of the RAS Presidium.
