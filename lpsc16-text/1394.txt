Introduction: The high radar albedo (0.42, [1]) and density (6.98±0.58 g/cm3, [2]; 6.49±2.94 g/cm3, [3] 7.6±3.0 g/cm3, [4]) of the M-class asteroid 16 Psyche is taken as evidence that it is a metal-rich world, similar to (and perhaps a parent body to some) Fe meteorites. Iron meteorites contain appreciable bulk Ni content (>5 wt%, ~8.4 wt% on average) [5], suggestive of the range of Ni concentrations that might be present on 16 Psyche. Reflectance spectroscopy of 16 Psyche reveals an absorption feature at 0.9 µm which is interpreted to originate from silicates, specifically high-Mg orthopyroxene, covering ~10% of the surface [6]. Taken together, these observations suggest that 16 Psyche is the exposed core of a melted and differentiated protoplanet, perhaps the end result of silicatestripping hit-and-run collisions (e.g. [7]). Under this scenario, exploration of 16 Psyche offers the first and possibly only opportunity to directly investigate a planetary core. Core formation is a critical but poorly understood stage of planetary formation, so an investigation of 16 Psyche will have profound implications for our understanding of the formation and evolution of Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and asteroid 4 Vesta.  Key questions regarding 16 Psyche's formation and evolution include determining if 16 Psyche is indeed an exposed planetary core, constraining its thermal evolution, and characterizing its elemental composition. The Psyche mission - one of five Discovery mission concepts selected by NASA for Phase A study - seeks to answer these questions via a focused orbital investigation of 16 Psyche.  Nuclear Spectroscopy of 16 Psyche: The key questions for the Psyche mission lead to a clear need to characterize the surface composition of the asteroid. Particularly important are: 1. Characterizing the bulk Ni content, which is diagnostic of the thermal evolution of the core, 2. Characterizing the composition of the silicates, which may be remnants of 16 Psyche's original mantle, and 3. Measuring the light element (H, C, O) content of the metals to understand light-element partitioning into cores during differentiation. With an orbital mission, these objectives can only be achieved using nuclear spectroscopy. Nuclear spectroscopy uses measurements of neutron and gammaray emissions from planetary surfaces to derive the elemental composition of near-surface (depths of 10s cm) materials. The Psyche spacecraft payload includes a GammaRay and Neutron Spectrometer (GRNS) to provide global, and in some instances spatially resolved, measurements of Fe, Ni, Si, K, S, Al, Ca, Th, and U concentrations on 16 Psyche. Measurements of H and C are also possible, depending on their total concentrations. GRNS has two subsystems - a MESSENGERheritage Gamma-Ray Spectrometer (GRS) and a Lunar Prospector-heritage Neutron Spectrometer (NS). The NS subsystem, and all neutron science returned by GRNS, are presented in a companion abstract [8]. Here we present details on the GRS subsystem and its expected performance. Our analysis is restricted to the 1.3-body-radius (low altitude) orbit planned for the primary mission. The higher-altitude orbits are not optimized for GRNS science and are therefore not discussed here.  Gamma-Ray Spectrometer: The GRS consists of a high-purity germanium (HPGe) sensor surrounded by a borated plastic anti-coincidence shield (ACS). The HPGe sensor will provide superior energy resolution (4.0 keV @ 1332 keV) measurements of gamma-ray emissions from 16 Psyche. The ACS will characterize GRS-incident charged particles, primarily galactic cosmic ray (GCR) protons, for the purpose of removing GCR-induced backgrounds in the gamma-ray spectra via a veto rejection. At 1.3 body-radius orbital altitude, the ACS veto reduces the background continuum of the gamma-ray measurements by a factor of ~6 at 7 MeV and ~2.5 @ 3 MeV. Note that the ACS is also a sensitive neutron detector, and provides a measure of both low-energy and fast neutrons [8]. Expected Performance: The in-flight performance of the MESSENGER GRS serves as the basis for understanding the sensitivity of the Psyche GRS subsystem. MESSENGER GRS measured gamma rays from Mercury at orbital altitudes ranging from 0.1 to 6.8 body radii, which includes 1.3 body radii - the mean orbital altitude for the prime Psyche GRNS science orbits. The MESSENGER GRS 1.3 body radii data serve as the basis for characterizing the Psyche GRS signal and backgrounds. Unlike MESSENGER GRS, which was mounted directly on the spacecraft bus, the Psyche GRS will be located at the end of a 2-meter1394.pdf

long boom. The boom will provide a significant reduction in the spacecraft-originating backgrounds seen by GRS and facilitates making measurements from altitudes >1 body radius. Our models include the MESSENGER-derived spacecraft background, reduced as appropriate to estimate the improvements resulting from placement on a boom. Gamma-ray emissions from 16 Psyche are modeled using the radiation transport code MCNPX. MCNPX has a long history of application for planetary nuclear spectroscopy applications (e.g. [9-12]). MCNPX was used to model gamma-ray emission from 16 Psyche for a range of metal compositions (2-30 wt.% Ni) and pyroxene abundances with the metal (0-90 vol.% pyroxene). The MCNPX outputs were convolved with the energy response and detection efficiency of the GRS system, following which the expected background signals, derived from MESSENGER data, were added to produce a simulated spectrum. Note that our models were first benchmarked to flight data, as we produced an MCNPX model of Mercury gamma-ray emissions for comparison MESSENGER GRS measurements. Results: Figure 1 shows the modeled gamma-ray spectrum for our nominal 16 Psyche composition (90 vol.% metal + 10 vol.% pyroxene; IVA iron meteorite metal (8.4 wt.% Ni) and pyroxene (bronzite) were used). The spectrum reports the total measurement as expected from the 1.3 body-radius orbital phase (70 days). Comparison of the 1.3-body radius signal to the background highlights which spectral features can be attributed to 16 Psyche. The spectrum is dominated by gamma-ray peaks originating from Fe, as expected for a body composed of >87 wt.% Fe.  Ni gamma-ray peaks are also observed in the spectrum, and our simulations indicate that Ni concentrations >4 wt.% can be characterized by GRS. A survey of the Ni content of hundreds of iron meteorites reveals a mean of 8.4 wt% and, more importantly, no samples with <5 wt% Ni [5], indicating that our sensitivity is appropriate for the mission. For concentrations of 8 wt.% or greater, mapping of Ni variability will be achieved in the 1.3-body radius orbit. Gamma-ray emissions from non-metallic phases are also apparent in the simulated spectra. This includes Si, K, S, Al, and Ca. For pyroxene concentrations of 20 vol.% or higher, O gamma rays are also seen at robust detection levels. The light elements H, C, and S can be characterized when their bulk concentrations exceed ~1 wt.% [10, 11, 13], and modeling to determine our exact sensitivity to these elements is ongoing.
