(jboyce@higp.hawaii.edu).  Introduction: Recently, Barlow [1] suggested that two types of double layer ejecta (DLE) crater exist on Mars: those described by [1-4] (here referred to as DLE type-1), and those that morphologically resemble single layer ejecta (SLE) and multi-layer ejecta (MLE) craters (here referred to as DLE type-2), but include just two ejecta layers (Table 1).  Here, we provide morphologic and morphometric evidence to support the contention of [1] that two types of DLE craters exist, and how these two types fit in to the overall morphologic scheme of layered ejecta craters on Mars.    Table 1: Updated list from [5] of characteristics of flow features on layered ejecta. SLE, DLE type-2 and MLE ejecta share similar flow features, while DLE type-1 ejecta exhibits some unique characteristics. Ejecta topographic profile:  The profiles of ejecta deposits are different with crater type [2].  Fig. 1 compares the typical profile of DLE type-2 craters with the profiles from [2] for the other types of craters.  This shows that DLE type-2 crater ejecta, like that of MLE craters, thin rapidly from the rim and quickly become nearly uniform in thickness outward with each layer terminating in a narrow rampart.    Figure 1:  Cross sections of examples of the types of layered ejecta craters based on MOLA 1/Â°128 DEM data.  R indicates rampart location, and M moat location.  Gray is ejecta.  Horizontal line is approximate location of pre-impact surface. Vertical exaggeration is ~10. Radial Groove Widths: The average width (Wa) of radial grooves on layered ejecta on 31 fresh test craters of different types has been measured.  Fig. 2 shows that Wa on SLE, MLE and DLE-type 2 craters of similar size are similar, but different than those on DLE-type 1 craters.  In addition, Fig. 3 shows that while the average groove width increases with crater diameter on all craters, the normalized width (WD) declines when compared with crater size, but at rates that are dependent on crater type.  Furthermore, grooves tend to widen markedly outward from 0.5 crater radii (R) on DLE type1, but little on other types of craters (similar to grooves on long run-out landslides [6-9]).    Ramparts Widths. Rampart ridges typically are found at the outer edge of each ejecta layer [10- 1327.pdf

Figure 3: Radial groove average width normalized to crater diameter (in increments of 0.5 R). 12].   Boyce et al. [2] found that the ramparts of the inner ejecta layer of DLE type-1 craters are systematically wider than those on SLE and MLE crater ejecta.  Extending their findings, we have measured the average width of ramparts in a sample of fresh DLE-type 2 craters and compared them with previous data [2].  These are plotted in Fig. 3, and shows that the average rampart widths of both ejecta layers of DLEtype 2 craters are similar to those of SLE and MLE ramparts.  But their ramparts widths are different than DLE-type 1 craters, as well as different than the relatively narrow ramparts of the outer ejecta layer of DLE-type-1 craters (which are systematically slightly wider than ramparts on similar size SLE and MLE craters).  Figure 4:  Width of rampart ridges at the terminations of ejecta layers.  Red lines are regression lines for ejecta layers of DLE type-2 craters. Error bars indication horizontal measurement errors of ~10% in crater dia. and ~+/- 15% width of rampart. Conclusions: Morphometric parameters presented here are consistent with the contention of [1] that there are two types of DLE craters on Mars and that the ejecta deposits of one type (DLE type-2) morphometrically resemble SLE and MLE ejecta deposits.  Based on the characteristics of DLE type-2 ejecta layers, we suggest that they are merely a natural part of the progression from SLE to MLE type craters. In addition, we suggest that to account for the two types of DLE craters the commonly used simple nomenclature recommended by the Mars Crater Consortium [4] requires an additional descriptor in their designation.
