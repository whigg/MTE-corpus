Introduction:  The identification of NaCl minerals     in the SNC meteorite Nakhla, is usually taken as mineralogical evidence of the presence of halites on Mars due to its pre-terrestrial origin. One of the hypotheses is that they could have been formed through the evaporation of brine pockets on this planetary body [1,2]. Moreover, the existence of evaporitic enviroments on this planet is supported by different measurements perfomed on the surface of this planet [3-9]. Several evaporitic environments on Earth can be considered analogs of hypersaline environments in other planetary bodies. Microorganisms known as halophilic archaea are inhabitants of these environments, requiring the presence of high salt concentrations (2-5 M NaCl), Moreover they have been found entrapped inside halites [11,12] including those found in ancient evaporitic deposits from Permic and Triassic (250 Mya old). This fact raises the possibility to consider these kind of microorganisms as possible inhabitants of Mars [13] and possible candidates for the interplanetary transfer of life by natural processes (e.g. lithopanspermia). Fluid inclusions are commonly found inside halites as it tends to entrap the original brines when they solidify [14]. Halophilic archaea (haloarchaea) were found surviving inside these fluid inclusions and they seem to be fundamental for the survival of the microorganisms [15]. Therefore the crystalline structure of the halite could be relevant in order to study the possibility of survival of microorganisms in other planetary context. In this study we analyze the structure of halites formed under Terrestrial and Martian conditions in simulated experiments and we discuss the possibility of survival of microorganisms. Material and Methods: A solution containing NaCl 4M (pH=7) was deposited in drops (1uL) over glass slides. These drops were subjected to different treatments in order to obtain halite crystals: A) Evaporation under present Martian-like conditions: drops were frozen at -80ºC for 60 min and then placed inside a Mars simulation chamber (8 mbar, dry mixture 95%CO2:5%N2) during 60 min. B) Evaporation under early Martian-like conditions: drops were frozen at 80ºC for 60 min and then placed inside a Mars simulation chamber (1 mbar, dry mixture 95%CO2:5%N2) during 60 min. C) Evaporation under terrestrial conditions conditions: at room temperature (22ºC) in a laminar flow during 60 min. Samples were analyzed employing scanning electron microscopy to determine the morphology of the crystals (SEM-FEG FEI Nova NanoSEM 230). Additionally, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed by using a Panalytical Empyrean difractometer fitted with a 3D PIXcel detector and a Si low background sample holder in order to determine the microcrystalline structure of the halites. The difractograms were refined by the Rietveld method by using the FullProf suite tools [16]. All difractograms were refined in the cubic unit cell (space group Fm-3m). Results and Discussion: SEM images of the experimentally treated halites obtained under present and early Martian-like conditions (A,B, respectively) and Terrestrial conditions (C) are shown in Figure 1. Pronounced differences can be seen when comparing morphologies, for all the samples analyzed. Using a magnification of 1mm (related approximately to the size of one drop of 4M NaCl solution), different morphologies can be appreciated according to the conditions employed to obtain the halites. In particular, for halites obtained under present Martian-like conditions the halites did not show a morphology where crystals can be appreciated, as compared to those halites obtained under early Martian-like conditions and terrestrial conditions. However, if higher magnification is applied, halite crystals can be appreciated even in those halites obtained under present Martian-like conditions. In this case the size of the halite crystals is around 5µm (ranging from 1-3 µm, approximately). In the case of the halites obtained under early martianlike conditions the size range from 5µm to < 500 µm. Finally, for halites obtained under Terrestrial conditions the size of the crystals is higher as compared to those obtained for the samples under Martian-like conditions, being around 500 µm. At this point, it is important to take into account that the size of microorganisms (as far as we know) is from 0.2 to 15 µm, and that the mean size for haloarchaeal cells is around 1-4 µm. Therefore and if microorganisms will have similar sizes as those present today on Earth, it could be rather 2134.pdf

difficult that they could have been entrapped by fluid inclusions hosted by halite crystals (1-3 µm in size) formed under present Martian-like conditions. However, preliminar results of entrapment of two haloarchaeal strains into halites in present Martian-like conditions, showed survival of these microorganisms although it seems to be depending on the strain/domain (Abrevaya et al. 2016, in progress). This raises the question of the role of brine inclusions on the survival of microorganisms. Certainly, it would be necessary to consider how could future experiments be affected by using longer time scales. The possibility of entrapment in the case of halites formed under early Martian-like conditions seems to be higher than that for early Martian-like halites according to the size of the crystals. However in further studies will be necessary to analyze brine inclusions inside all kind of halites obtained in these experiments considering the possibility that fluid inclusions could be present or abstent in different cases.

Magnification of halite crystals: A_B_C (right photos): scale bar: 1 mm. A_B_C (left photos): 5µm, 500 µm and 400 µm, respectively.  The X-ray diffraction analysis corresponding to halites obtained in the conditions previously mentioned are shown in Fig. 2. All difractograms showed the presence of well developed crystallites with similar lattice paramentes of around 5.643 Å. Halites formed under Terrestrial conditions showed the presence of strongly oriented crystallites along the [110] direction.   Fig. 2.
