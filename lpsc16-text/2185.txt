3D MORPHOLOGY OF FINE-GRAINED RIMS IN CM MURCHISON. R.D. Hanna1 and R.A. Ketcham1, 1Jackson School of Geological Sciences, University of Texas, Austin, TX, 78712 (romy@jsg.utexas.edu)  Introduction:  The origin of fine-grained rims (FGRs) in CM chondrites is actively debated with three proposed formation scenarios: 1) accretion of dust around the chondrule during its residence in the nebula [1], 2) accumulation and compaction of finegrained material around the chondrule during impact and/or movement in the regolith of a parent asteroid body [2,3], and 3) growth of the rim through aqueous alteration of the chondrule while on the parent body [3].  One line of evidence in support of a nebular formation is a correlation between the size of the FGR and the enclosed chondrule [1,4] that [5] has shown to be a natural consequence of chondrulesized particles accumulating surface dust in a weakly turbulent nebula.  However others have argued that there is no correlation between the size of the FGR and enclosed object and that this suggests the formation of the rim occurred on the parent body [2].   One issue with previous studies that have tested for a correlation between chondrule and rim size is that the chondrule diameters and rim thicknesses were measured in 2D thin section.These measurements are only apparent diameter or thickness unless they have been properly corrected to account for a random 2D section through a 3D object [4].  Another complication is that many CM chondrites show evidence for strain resulting in significant chondrule deformation [6,7] that could further obfuscate the interpretation of rim thickness or geometry.   Our previous work with CM Murchison documented a pervasive foliation fabric within a 44 g sample (USNM 5487) defined by deformed and partially altered chondrules [8].  The XCT scan resolution (29-58 µm per voxel) did not allow for the discrimination of FGRs around the chondrules but BSE images suggested that the rim thickness around chondrules is irregular [8].  In the present study we use higher resolution XCT data to measure the FGRs around chondrules in 3D. Data and Methods: We scanned a 0.143 g chip of USNM 5487 at low energy (70 kV) and 5.5 µm/voxel resolution to discriminate FGRs.  Using the AvizoTM program we manually segment each chondrule twice: both with and without the FGR (Fig. 1).  The segmented data are then imported into the Blob3D program that measures the chondrule (with rim and without rim) size and orientation [9,10].  To measure the thickness of the rim around the chondrule in 3D, we created a 3D rim measurement algorithm implemented in the Blob3D program.  For each rimmed chondrule, the algorithm "looks outward" from the chondrule center along a set of 3D traverses evenly covering a unit sphere and measures the thickness of the rim in each direction.  The average rim thickness among all chondrules in each orientation is then calculated and plotted on a stereonet to determine if there is any spatial coherence to the varying rim thickness around the chondrules. Results: To date we have segmented 40 chondrules with FGRs in the XCT data.  Our results indicate that there is a spatial coherence to the thickness of the rims. Specifically, the thickest portions of the rims are consistently located within the foliation plane defined by the deformed chondrules (Fig. 2-3).  Figure 1. 	Example of a segmented chondrule and FGR.  Image on far left shows whole segmented chondrule including rim in blue and interior chondrule in yellow.  Middle image shows different orientation of the same segmented chondrule bisected by XCT slice, and the image on the right shows the XCT slice only. Scale bar is the same for all images. The rim is primarily distinguished in XCT by the absence of brighter grains (clumps of tochilinite, Fe-bearing serpentine, and Fe sulfides) that are common in the surrounding matrix. The interior chondrule shows a highly irregular shape that is not reflected in the outer rim morphology. 200 μm2185.pdf

This texture strongly suggests that the current 3D geometry of the rims has been influenced by the impact(s) that produced the foliation in the chondrules [8]. This implies that the rims were in place prior to the impact as well as prior to the aqueous alteration that accompanied it [8].   When we analyze the sizes of the chondrules and rims, we find that the there is a strong correlation (R2=0.98) between the rim volume and the size of the interior chondrule using a power law relationship as suggested by [4] (Fig. 4).  This is strong support for formation of the Murchison FGRs in the nebula. Conclusions and Future Work: We find that the size relationship between the FGRs and interior chondrules in CM Murchison are consistent with FGR formation in the nebula.  After accretion to the CM parent body, the rims were deformed along with the interior chondrule to produce thicker rims in the plane of foliation.  For our ongoing work we are measuring more chondrules in XCT scans of Murchison with higher and lower spatial resolutions (3.0 and 7.15 microns) to get a wider range of chondrule sizes and a more statistically significant population size.  We are also investigating the cause of the highly irregular shapes of some of the interior chondrules compared to the smooth outer FGRs (Fig. 1).
