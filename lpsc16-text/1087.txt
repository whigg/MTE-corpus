Introduction: The Taurids contain very large (meter-sized) meteoroids [1]. Given that the Taurid complex is thought to have originated through the cascade disintegration of a large comet, the presence of these large fragments is not surprising.  This stream is also known for producing very bright fireballs [2]. In addition, it has been found that some of these meteoroids exhibit very large strength values [3]. This, together with a not too high entry velocity for particles from this stream (around 28 km s-1), led some authors to propose that the Taurids could be regarded as potential meteorite-producers [2]. In fact, this hypothesis was recently considered in [4] on the basis of the analysis of a deep-penetrating Taurid bolide observed over Canada in 2010, for which a small (below 10 grams) terminal mass was predicted. To detect such potential meteorite-producers, which are rare events, a continuous monitoring of fireball activity during the activity period of the Taurids is very convenient, but also the chance of having a fall in a favourable location is a handicap. In this context, we present here the preliminary analysis of a potential meteorite-dropping Southern Taurid event recorded over the Mediterranean Sea on 28 October 2015.   Instrumentation and methods: To record the fireball analyzed here we have employed an array of low-lux CCD video cameras manufactured by Watec Co. (models 902H and 902H2 Ultimate). These monitor the night sky and operate in a fully autonomous way by means of software developed by the first author [5]. The atmospheric trajectory and orbital data of the event were obtained with the Amalthea software [6].  Preliminary results: The fireball discussed here (Figure 1) was recorded on 28 Oct. 2015 at 2h5m38s UT from three meteor-observing stations located in Spain (Calar Alto, Sevilla and La Hita) The analysis of the atmospheric trajectory reveals that the luminous phase started at an altitude Hb=96.5±0.5 km above the Mediterranean Sea (Figure 2). The meteoroid stroke the atmosphere with a velocity V∞ of about 29.2 km/s. The apparent radiant was located at the equatorial coordinates α=44.9º, δ=10.2º. The bolide penetrated the atmosphere till a final height He=26.5±0.5 km. The projection on the ground of the atmospheric trajectory is shown in Figure 2. The parameters of the heliocentric orbit followed by the meteoroid before its encounter with our planet are shown in Table 1. These data confirm the association of the event with the Southern Taurid meteoroid stream, with a value of the Southworth and Hawkins dissimilarity function [7] DSH=0.13.     Figure 1. Selected video frames images taken at Calar Alto showing the initial phase (up) and maximum brightness stage (down) of the fireball discussed in this work.   The photometric analysis of the images shows that the maximum brightness of the fireball corresponded to an absolute magnitude of -13±1. This peak luminosity was reached during a bright flare exhibited by the event at a height of 39±1 km above the sea level. The  tensile strength of the meteoroid obtained by estimating the aerodynamic pressure at this stage [8] yields (2.5±0.5)·107 dyn/cm2.   Figure 2. Projection on the ground of the atmospheric trajectory of the fireball analyzed in this work.   Our calculations also reveal that the meteoroid was not completely ablated in the atmosphere, since at the final point of the luminous trajectory a mass of about 25 g survived the ablation process.  The precise circumstances of the dark flight are currently under analysis, although from Figure 2 it is obvious that the resulting meteorite fell into the Mediterranean Sea.   a (AU) 2.2±0.1 ω (º) 107.8±0.2 e 0.82±0.01 Ω (º) 34.10886±10-5 q (AU) 0.407±0.004 i (º) 7.5±0.1 Table 1. Orbital data (J2000) of the progenitor meteoroid.   Conclusions: A mag. -13±1 fireball observed over the Mediterranean Sea on 28 Oct. 2015 has been analyzed. The radiant and orbital parameters reveal that the progenitor meteoroid belonged to the Southern Taurid stream. The bolide penetrated the atmosphere till a final height of 26.5±0.5 km. The conditions determined at the ending point of the luminous trajectory show that the meteoroid was not completely destroyed in the atmosphere, and that a terminal mass of about 15 g survived the ablation process and fell into the Mediterranean Sea. This event exemplifies the ability of large and tough Taurid meteoroids to produce meteorites. References: [1] Wetherill G.W. (1974). Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences, 2, 303.
