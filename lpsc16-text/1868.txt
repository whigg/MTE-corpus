(b00204017@ntu.edu.tw)   Introduction:  Sand dunes are good indicators for the  aeolian processes on Earth and Mars. Wind activities shaped many surface features on Mars, the shapes of which are related to atmospheric circulation, as well as possibly to paleo-climate behavior. This research classified 15 different types of sand dunes using CTX image mapping at 30 sites widely distributed around the planet [1], generating statistical information of different types to provide a recent view of global wind patterns on Mars. The results fill a gap between local ripple mapping and global wind models.  Background:  Mars preserves a large number of sand dune fields that reflect both past and present wind patterns [2]. The mobility of sand dunes is vividly illustrated by variability in the dust opacity ratio [3] and wind history can be inferred from both the dune shape and crest line orientation [4]. Sand dunes on Mars have been studied previously at regional to global scales. Some dunes are  complex in shape and thus may have a complex aeolian history resulting from temporally varying winds. Global wind patterns depend largely on solar heating and Hadley circulation [5]. Regional patterns are more constrained by local topography such as within a crater or valley, which in turn can influence the dune shape. Recent study showed that the thin current Martian atmospheric density is still sufficient to cause movement of both sand dunes and ripples [6].  Consequently, the winds inferred from widely distributed study sites are valuable for constraining the global wind circulation.  Data and Methology: Sand dune identification and mapping was carried out at 30 sites [1] using CTX images in the JMARS (Java Mission-planning and Analysis for Remote Sensing) software package. In contrast to HiRISE (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment), CTX iamges cover a broad area of Mars, thus enabling us to infer information about broad scale dune patterns. JMARS also displays THEMIS (THermal EMission Imaging System) images obtained during both day and night, which together provide insight into the thermal inertia properties of the dune deposits [7]. MOLA (Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter) elevation data also help to constrain the topography around each study location. A precise measure of the area enclosed by the dune region (in km2) and the azimuth of all drawn lines are calculated automatically using JMARS.    Dune Mapping: The large dune patterns provide documentation of recent transport-capable winds through mapping of the CTX images. Some of the dune types documented include:  Barchan: The well-defined crescent-shape dunes indicate limited sand supply as well as the dominant wind direction. Depending on dune shape, elongated barchans and barchans with ‘tails’ were also defined, the later providing evidence for a bi-modal wind regime, perhaps reflecting seasonally varying winds with respective angles as defined by [8]. The total mapped area for barchan dunes from all sites is 1489.0 km2. Barchanoid: Generally arc-shaped dunes which are connected but do not form a single continuous crest line. Some dunes with large wavelength are classified as wavy barchoids. The total mapped area for barchaoid dunes is 3053.7 km2.  Transverse: A linear dune structure is apparent, with slightly sinuous crests, and sand does fill in most regions between the main crests. The wind flows perpendicular to the transverse crest line. It is not possible to identify individual dunes when the sand supply is abundant. Grid, ridge, sinuous, and wavy transverse were mapped according to their varying crest forms. The total mapped area for transverse dunes is 3046.6 km2. Linear: A straight crest line lacking sand accumulation in between the crests.  Wind is inferred to be predominantly parallel to the straight crests. The total mapped area for linear dunes is 119.3 km2.  Star: Dunes with typically three prominent arms, indicating at least three directions for sand-moving wind. The total mapped area for star dunes is 1.2 km2. Sand patch: Dunes lacking a clear shape or slip face, and a widely scattered distribution. Area larger than 250 km2 is called a sand sheet, such as one with 272 km2 at South of Promethei Terra (Site11); smaller areas are termed sand patch. The total mapped sand patch/sheet area is 2287.0 km2. Gale Crater: Gale crater is an important site for Mars exploration, with a central mound surrounded by sand deposits. Where the Curiosity rover is currently exploring, along the northwest portion of the sand deposits in Fig.1, diverse dune types are present. Sand dunes in Gale Crater studied in previous research utilized both ripple orientation [10] and sand dune morphology [11], but without a statistical assessment of the contribution from different types of dunes. Here the mapping criteria and classification applied to the Gale Crater determined the area percentage for the follow1868.pdf

ing dune types: barchan, 25.5%; barchoid, 22.4%; transverse, 24.3%; and sand patch, 27.9%. This distribution is very unusual as compared to the other 29  study sites; each of the four types of dunes in Gale Crater are almost equally distributed in total area even though they are not evenly distributed spatially. The northeast dunes may be relatively young because of the low amount of dust deposits coupled with a large abundance of barchans. The wind pattern accordingly revealed from barchans varies significantly around the crater (Fig.1) but the result is consist with the observations described in [11].  The complex interaction between winds inside of Gale crater remain unclear.  Results: This study mapped 10,038 km2 of sand and dunes among 30 sites around Mars [1]. Barchan (14.8%), barchanoid (30.4%), transverse (30.4%), and sand patch (22.8%) make up the majority of the dune patterns we observed on Mars. The most common type is barchoid, which occurred at 25 different sites; the next most common type is barchan, which appearred at 22 sites. The dunes in the 30 study areas are scattered within crater, valley, ridge, plains, polar and cadera settings. 18 sites consist of dunes trapped inside of craters (10 sites in south hemisphere), with a cumulative area of 6755 km2. The respective percentages of dominant dune types in craters documented at 18 sites are barchan (19.2%), barchnoid (38.3%), transverse (17.9%), sand patch (24.2%), and linear (0.4%). This is indicative of the perplexing dune types which are strongly affected by variable local winds. Some dunes show concentric rings sane distribution in craters are indentified to be Bullseye dune field, which may due to radical winds [2]. Wirtz Crater (site 19) is dominated by dark barchans as compared to their surroundings that appear to be relatively fresh dunes. Additionally, Wirtz Crater also contributed more than half (53.7%) of all of the mapped barchans among the 18 sites within craters, nevertheless, other sites which lack of barchans were either eroded or evolved into the next stage with abundant sand supply, of dune development, which may be either barchoid or transverse dunes. The winds direction in craters vary widely due to topography influence but in North Pole and Equatorial region are well depicted. The dominant winds derived from dunes in North Pole (80N-90N) and between 30N-30S are quite consistent with slipface orientation prediction. Our wind result overall are in good agreement with previous research [2].This study provides an overview of the types of sand dunes common on Mars, and it is the start of a growing database for Martian wind patterns to be used as a reference for future aeolian research. Future work should combine both global wind modeling and ripple orientations to construct a more complete picture of the Martian wind pattern.
