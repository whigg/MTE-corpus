At present, Dawn orbits Ceres inthe Low Altitude Mapping Orbit (LAMO), mapping itssurface at a resolution of up to ~35 mpx-1. This highresolution image data finally allows us to identify andmeasure, as precise as possible, the diameters of sub-kmimpact craters and thus to investigate the stratigraphicposition even of relatively small geomorphologic units.Background: Ceres exhibits a variety of exceptionally fresh appearing surface features such as impactrelated fossilized lobate flows, crater interior smoothplains or fresh ejecta blankets, often only about a fewthousand km2 in size. Many of these features show noor only few superposed craters in ~130 mpx-1 FramingCamera (FC) High Altitude Mapping Orbit (HAMO)data, suggesting relatively young formation ages.One of the most prominent of these features is a cluster of bright spots, which is also the brightest surface on Ceres [3], located within the 83.8 km Occatorcrater at 19.8◦N/239.6◦E (Fig. 1). The crater interiorFigure 1: FC HAMO image mosaic superimposed by presently available FC LAMO data (framed in solid black lines) from cycle 0 and1 covering the interior and proximal ejecta of Occator Crater. Superposed craters > 398 m (red) and > 77 m (orange) identified withinthe count areas (blue lines). The black dashed circle represents theidealized crater ellipse prior to Occator’s rim collapse.smooth plains exhibit subtle multiple flow lobes whichseem to emanate from the bright spots. In many areas, flows form a sharp boundary and superpose collapsed crater wall material indicating some form ofpost-Occator-formation activity. Initial visual inspection of FC LAMO data already shows that crater densities appear to be much higher on Occator’s proximalejecta than on its interior smooth plains. This, however,can be interpreted in different ways.Provided that the area is only marginally contaminatedby secondary craters and that local variation of surfacematerial properties are negligible, differences in craterfrequency can be considered temporally distinct. Thiswould indicate some form of resurfacing possibly longafter the crater has formed (though the term "long" stillneeds to be quantified by further investigations). An alternative mechanism which might explain crater densityvariation between a crater’s interior and its ejecta blanket, in the absence of obvious resurfacing, was recentlyinvestigated for young lunar craters [4-7]. The idea isthat on planetary bodies with moderate to high gravity,secondary projectiles ejected at very steep angles willre-impact close to their ejection point forming so-calledself-secondary craters. The problem hereby is that theprojectiles ejected at high angles are at the same timethe ones ejected close to the primary crater center atthe highest velocities [8-9]. These projectiles thereforeprobably escape Ceres with its low gravity of about 0.28ms-2. A certain fraction of slower eastbound ejectedfragments, however, has the potential to re-impact closeto the ejection point due to Ceres’ quick rotation. Onthe other hand, these fragments would probably hit Occator’s interior and proximal ejecta to the same degree.Nevertheless, there is a considerable spatial variabilityin crater frequency on Occator’s ejecta which will definitely challenge prospects of model age estimates.In order to put these and other fresh, conspicuous geomorphologic units into a time-stratigraphic frameworkwe depend on the analyses of size-frequency distributions of craters below a few km in diameter as it isonly these that occur in statistically significant numbers.The benefit of increasing "statistical" robustness due tolarge numbers of small craters, however, can be misleading because small craters are also the first ones tobe affected by subsequent modification [10-12]. Thisincludes (among other processes) an admixture of sec2936.pdf

Figure 2: Differential crater size-frequency distributions measured on Occator’s interior smooth plains and its proximal ejecta.ondary craters which, due to the specific shape of theSFD of secondary projectiles ejected during larger impacts and the inverse relation between the spall size andejection velocity [13-18], can considerably increase thenumbers of small craters.Methodology: For the investigation of local surface units and identification of impact craters we usedindividual FC LAMO images (no mosaics) with a native resolution of ~35 mpx-1. Crater counts were performed within ESRI’s ArcGIS by using the CraterTools[19] extension which allows comfortable and most accurate measuring of areas and crater diameters by automatically solving the problem of map-projection related distortions. Though the 940 km in diameter reference sphere used for the map projection is alreadyvery close to Ceres’ actual shape, we have nevertheless corrected topography-related area and crater distortions [20]. In order to investigate the spatial variability of craters within the mapped units we performtwo individual randomness tests, Standard Deviation ofAdjacent Area (SDAA) and Mean 2nd-Closest Neighbor Distance (M2CND) both implemented in the widelyused Craterstats software [21-22]. Results are plotted inFig. 2Prelimenary results: In Fig. 2 we plotted theCSFDs measured on parts of Occator’s interior smoothplains and its proximal ejecta. Additionally, we compared the distributions with the two chronology modelsprepared for Ceres, namely the Lunar Derived Modelscaled to Ceres (LDM) as well as the Asteroid Derived Model (ADM) [23]. Randomness analyses basically plot within one standard deviation above or below the Monte Carlo-derived mean. Thus, craters are, atleast in the measured size interval, interpreted to be randomly distributed. Of course, we can never be sure thatcounts are not contaminated by randomly distributedbackground secondaries which is still an open issue.Future work: As becomes obvious in Fig. 1, coverage of high-resolution LAMO data which is a basicrequirement for our study is still low. With subsequentdata acquisition we will continue to investigate the SFDof small craters on very fresh and therefore probablyless altered surfaces which we assume to deliver a closerimage of the corresponding asteroid SFD.References: [1] Russell et al.
