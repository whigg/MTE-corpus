Introduction:  Primitive solar system materials like chondritic meteorites, interplanetary dust particles (IDPs), and cometary dust host small amounts of isotopically anomalous stardust grains that have formed in the outflows of evolved stars [e.g., 1]. Presolar silicates are the most abundant type of circumstellar dust available for single grain analysis. In the most pristine chondrites, abundances of >200 ppm are observed [2,3]. Presolar oxide abundances are typically by an order of magnitude lower. Silicon carbide (SiC), the best-studied presolar grain type to date, occurs in concentrations of up to a few tens ppm in chondrites [4]. The CR chondrites are one of the most primitive meteorite groups studied to date, with petrologic types ranging from 1 to 3 [5-7]. Since the different types of presolar dust have differing susceptibilities to secondary alteration (hydrous/thermal metamorphism in the early solar nebula and/or on the respective parent bodies), their abundances can be used as tracers to investigate these processes.  Fine-grained chondrule rims (FGR) in a set of CR2 chondrites contain higher O-rich presolar dust concentrations than the interchondrule matrix (ICM) in the respective meteorites, giving evidence for a nebular origin of the rim material and different alteration pathways for FGR and ICM [8]. In a follow-up study presented here we focused on the CR2 chondrite Elephant Moraine (EET) 92161 to improve the statistics and significance level for the presolar grain abundances in ICM and FGRs. We report 17 new O-rich grains, together with 14 grains already characterized in [8], as well as a difference between presolar silicate concentrations in ICM and FGRs with 2σ significance, and first data on the SiC inventory in EET 92161. Samples & Experimental:  Suitable areas of finegrained material were identified by backscatter electron (BSE) microscopy in a thin section of the CR chondrite EET 92161. A ~100 nm primary Cs + beam was rastered over 10×10 μm²-sized sample areas (256×256 px) with an integration time of ~44-55 minutes in the NanoSIMS 50. 16,17,18 O, 28 Si , and 27 Al 16 O ion images were acquired in multi-collection mode. O-anomalous grains are considered as presolar if the anomaly is more than 5.3σ away from the average value of the surrounding matrix [9] and visible in at least two subsequent image planes. The elemental composition of the fine-grained material hosting the circumstellar dust was determined by SEM-EDS with a LEO 1530 FESEM equipped with an Oxford X-max 80 SDD detector. Figure 1.

Red and blue symbols represent FGR and ICM grains, respectively. Results & Discussion:  We investigated 42,600 µm² of fine-grained material (31,100 µm² of ICM and 11,100 µm² of FGRs). Presolar grain inventory.  A total of 31 presolar Orich grains were found (28 silicates and 3 oxides; Fig. 1). Twenty-four grains (77%) belong to the O-isotopic Group 1 and show enrichments in 17 O, originating from 1.2-2.2 M  AGB stars [10,11]. Five grains (16%) are enriched in 18 O and fall into Group 4, originating from Type II supernovae. Finally, two grains (~7%) show extremely high 17 O/ 16 O-ratios of (7-39) ×10 -3 , and might come from binary stars or a nova outburst. We also identified 23 SiC candidate grains in the 28 Si  and 16 O ion images. Isotopic confirmation of these grains is still in progress; 5 grains have been positively identified so far (4 of type MS, 1 of type AB). Presolar grain abundances.  For the total amount of fine-grained material studied, we calculate a presolar O-rich grain abundance of 57±10 ppm (52±10 ppm for silicates, 5(+5/-3) ppm for oxides). This is lower by a factor of ~3 than the abundances in the most pristine CR chondrites [2,12], indicating that EET 92161 experienced some aqueous alteration that resulted in the destruction of presolar silicates. We estimate a presolar  SiC abundance of ~56 ppm, which corresponds within error limits with the average value for CRs from [4] of 32±9 ppm.  For the FGR material, we observe abundances of 113±33 ppm and 1(+2/-1) ppm for presolar silicate and oxide grains, respectively. The presolar SiC abundance is estimated to be ~44 ppm. In the ICM, the silicate and oxide abundances are 31±8 ppm and 6(+8/-4) ppm, respectively, and the SiC abundance is ~60 ppm. The abundance of presolar silicates is higher by a factor of 3.6 in the FGRs than in the ICM, with 2σ significance. The estimated SiC abundances of FGR and ICM are, in contrast, identical within error limits. Silicates are more prone to alteration and destruction by aqueous alteration than more refractory phases like SiC. Thus, the ICM experienced more extensive aqueous processing than the FGRs, which destroyed a fraction of the silicate stardust, but did not affect the SiC.  Composition of the host material.  Investigation by SEM-EDS showed that the FGRs contain more Fe and S on average than the ICM, although individual regions show some scattering (Fig. 2.). Sub-micrometer-sized Fe-sulfides in FGRs from CM [13] and CR [8,14] chondrites have been described in recent studies. The good correlation between the average values of the Fe- and S-abundances of ICM and FGR with the data from a Fe-sulfide rich rim (Fig. 2) suggests that the higher abundances in the FGRs are due to higher concentrations of nanosulfides. Aqueous alteration has been suggested as the cause for a decrease of the S content in fine-grained chondritic materials by formation of larger Fe-sulfides [e.g., 15]. This would well explain the observed differences between FGRs and ICM in EET 92161, since the FGR material, as well as the FGRs in the CR2s studied by [8], also contain more presolar O-rich dust than the respective ICM (with the exception of the minimally altered CRs MET 00426 and QUE 99177, where the opposite is observed), which indicates lower levels of alteration in these areas. However, [16] found that there is no simple correlation between the sulfide content of the matrix and aqueous alteration. The formation of nanophase tochilinite instead of larger Fe-sulfides was suggested as an explanation. Conclusions:  The presolar silicate grain abundances in FGRs and ICM of EET 92161 differ by more than a factor of 3 with 2σ significance, demonstrating that the general trend observed for the FGR and ICM presolar grain abundances in CR2 chondrites is also valid for this individual specimen. The SiC concentrations are identical within error limits, which indicates destruction of presolar silicates by more extensive aqueous alteration in the ICM, which did not affect the SiC grains. Good agreement of our SiC abundance estimate with the average value for CRs from [4] seems to indicate no significant inherent heterogeneity in the presolar dust distribution in the CR formation region. Significantly higher S- and Fe-concentrations in the FGRs are due to more abundant Fe-nanosulfides, indicating a lower degree of alteration for the chondrule rims.  Figure 2.
