Introduction:  There  are  several  objects  in  our Solar  system  that  resemble  the  shape  of  a  binarycontact  ranging  from  porous,  low-density  cometary nuclei  (e.g.,  67P/Churyumov-  Gerasimenko,  mean density ≈ 0.47 g/cm3,  [16]) to higher-density asteroids exhibiting  macro-porosity  from their  composition  of loosely  bound  rocks  and  metal  chunks  (e.g.,  (216) Kleopatra, bulk density ≈ 3.6 g/cm3 [3]). Recent results indicate that binary-contact cometary nuclei can result from  low-velocity  collisions  of  porous  objects  at speeds comparable to their mutual escape velocity, vesc [9]. We plan to extend this to different materials and present first results of numerical collision experiments involving porous and  non-porous bodies  of  different material  strength  (dust,  ice,  tuff,  and  basaltic  rock). From  this  we  will  identify  an  upper  limit  for  the collision  velocity  that  results  in  a  bilobed  surviving formation rather than a complete merger or a hit-andrun  scenario.  These  results  are  key  in  dynamically investigating possible origins of binary-contact bodies beyond cometary nuclei. We present first results from different  possible  collisionary-scenarios  with  SPH (smooth  particle  hydrodynamics)  and  then  from  the cutoff  velocity  which  give  an  anelastic  impact,  we investigate the possible origin and dynamics of the 2 parent  bodies  which  create  the  present  comet.  The dynamical numerical investigation conceirns about the origin of the impact scenario: which region of the solar system is most  plausible for  the contact  of  2  bodies giving this present kind of orbit for comet 67P/C-G. Background:   Comet  67P/C-G,  a  short  period comets,  has  an  orbital  period,  P<20 yrs   (6.44  yrs), high eccentric  orbit and a low orbital  inclination: its osculating element (Epoch 2457331.5) are a=3.46 au, e=0.64  and  i=7°.  Its  orbit  is  controlled  by  Jupiter's gravity, it is a Jupiter Family comet. The comets of this family are believed to originate from the Kuiper Belt (KB), a large reservoir of small icy bodies located just beyond  Neptune.  As  a  result  of  collisions  or gravitational  perturbations,  some of these icy objects are ejected from the KB and fall towards the Sun. Its diameter  was  found  to  be  large  4  km  by  [10],  but exactly  it  has  2  major  lobes  and  a  neck  of  these dimentions:  large  lobe,  sphere radius  1.5 km,  small lobe  sphere  radius  1.0  km  and  neck  region  sphere radius 1.0 km [13]. It  has a high porosity [13] and a rotational period of 12.4h [12]. Details of the shape are in  [1,12].  Its  morphology  was  studied  recently  via models of cometary nucleus formation due to gravitational collapse, like [6,17]. The hierarchical agglomeration model [18] leads to an extremely porous mixture of large ice and dust agglomerates of distinct sizes. The surface is covered by a dark thin ice-free layer which forms when the ice starts to sublimate, similart to the ice-dust mixture. Below this refractory layer the pristine ice-dust medium exists. The inert layer is removed by the increasing gas pressure of the subliming ice [8]. The shape raises the question of whether (a) the two lobes  represent  a  contact  binary  formed  4.5  billion years  ago,  or  (b)  a  single  body  where  a  gap  has evolved via mass loss [13]. Our work aim to simulate case (a), considering different collisioary-ages. We also try  to  understand  the  possible  origins  of  the  2  impactors in case the unified body was formed after the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB). Methods: (1) Binary collision: In order to identify a limit for the collision velocities  we investigate  collisions of  solid and  porous  objects  at  different  velocities  aiming  at defining a maximum collision velocity that results in a bilobed  surviving  formation  rather  than  a  complete merger  or  a  hit-and-run  outcome.  We  performed simulations  with  our  3D  smooth  particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code ([14], [11]) including full elasto-plastic  continuum  mechanics  as  well  as  the Grady-Kipp  fragmentation  model  for  fracture  and brittle failure ([4], [2]). The simulations presented here also include self-gravity. First-order consistency of the SPH code achieved via atensorial correction [15]. (2) Numerical orbital simulations: (a)  location of the collisionary-region: backward integration via Lie-Integrator [5], using a simplified solar  system, all  the planets  without Mercury (its mass added to the Sun), plus the perturbation of the 2 major  asteroids  (1 Ceres  and 4 Vesta)  and 500 clones  of  the  comet.  Then  with  a  statistical approach (~ to [7]) we search for the most probable regions where the impact might have happened.   (b) origin(s) of the impators: once we know the cutoff  velocity  for  the  impact,  we  integrate backward from the possible assumed origins in a radial  spheric  random  way  the  particles (impactors),  ejecting  out  from  the  central  body references. Then with a statistical approach similar    to  (2a)  we  look for  the  possible  original  orbital regions. Preliminary results: First results for porous object collisions show sticking with some deformation in case the collision velocity is lower than about 4vesc. In case of a velocity exceeding ~5vesc the projectile escapes and is more or less eroded, depending on the impact speed (hit-and-run, see Fig. 1). Velocities in between cause the projectile to shatter, bounce off, and subsequently it is re-accreted forming in some instances a bilobed structure, consistent with [9]. We also present first results on solid body collisions  with  materials  of  different  strength  which  are presently still in process. Instead from the orbital point of view the comet has a very chaotic orbit and it seems to be in the current orbit due to close encounters first with Ceres and then with Jupiter  (Fig.  2),  indicating that  this comet was generated by 2 TNOs and much probably  in  the  Scattering  Disk  (SD,  Fig.  3),  if  the collision happened after the LHB.
