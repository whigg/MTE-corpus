Recent resultsindicate that binary-contact cometary nuclei can resultfrom  low-velocity  collisions  of  porous  objects  atspeeds comparable to their mutual escape velocity, vesc[9]. We plan to extend this to different materials andpresent first results of numerical collision experimentsinvolving porous and  non-porous bodies  of  differentmaterial  strength  (dust,  ice,  tuff,  and  basaltic  rock).From  this  we  will  identify  an  upper  limit  for  thecollision  velocity  that  results  in  a  bilobed  survivingformation rather than a complete merger or a hit-andrun  scenario.  These  results  are  key  in  dynamicallyinvestigating possible origins of binary-contact bodiesbeyond cometary nuclei. We present first results fromdifferent  possible  collisionary-scenarios  with  SPH(smooth  particle  hydrodynamics)  and  then  from  thecutoff  velocity  which  give  an  anelastic  impact,  weinvestigate the possible origin and dynamics of the 2parent  bodies  which  create  the  present  comet.  Thedynamical numerical investigation conceirns about theorigin of the impact scenario: which region of the solarsystem is most  plausible for  the contact  of  2  bodiesgiving this present kind of orbit for comet 67P/C-G.Background:   Comet  67P/C-G,  a  short  periodcomets,  has  an  orbital  period,  P<20 yrs   (6.44  yrs),high eccentric  orbit and a low orbital  inclination: itsosculating element (Epoch 2457331.5) are a=3.46 au,e=0.64  and  i=7°.  Its  orbit  is  controlled  by  Jupiter'sgravity, it is a Jupiter Family comet. The comets of thisfamily are believed to originate from the Kuiper Belt(KB), a large reservoir of small icy bodies located justbeyond  Neptune.  As  a  result  of  collisions  orgravitational  perturbations,  some of these icy objectsare ejected from the KB and fall towards the Sun. Itsdiameter  was  found  to  be  large  4  km  by  [10],  butexactly  it  has  2  major  lobes  and  a  neck  of  thesedimentions:  large  lobe,  sphere radius  1.5 km,  smalllobe  sphere  radius  1.0  km  and  neck  region  sphereradius 1.0 km [13]. It  has a high porosity [13] and arotational period of 12.4h [12]. Details of the shape arein  [1,12].  Its  morphology  was  studied  recently  viamodels of cometary nucleus formation due to gravitational collapse, like [6,17]. The hierarchical agglomeration model [18] leads to an extremely porous mixtureof large ice and dust agglomerates of distinct sizes. Thesurface is covered by a dark thin ice-free layer whichforms when the ice starts to sublimate, similart to theice-dust mixture. Below this refractory layer the pristine ice-dust medium exists. The inert layer is removedby the increasing gas pressure of the subliming ice [8].The shape raises the question of whether (a) the twolobes  represent  a  contact  binary  formed  4.5  billionyears  ago,  or  (b)  a  single  body  where  a  gap  hasevolved via mass loss [13]. Our work aim to simulatecase (a), considering different collisioary-ages. We alsotry  to  understand  the  possible  origins  of  the  2  impactors in case the unified body was formed after theLate Heavy Bombardment (LHB).Methods:(1) Binary collision: In order to identify a limit for thecollision velocities  we investigate  collisions of  solidand  porous  objects  at  different  velocities  aiming  atdefining a maximum collision velocity that results in abilobed  surviving  formation  rather  than  a  completemerger  or  a  hit-and-run  outcome.  We  performedsimulations  with  our  3D  smooth  particlehydrodynamics (SPH) code ([14], [11]) including fullelasto-plastic  continuum  mechanics  as  well  as  theGrady-Kipp  fragmentation  model  for  fracture  andbrittle failure ([4], [2]). The simulations presented herealso include self-gravity. First-order consistency of theSPH code achieved via atensorial correction [15]. (2) Numerical orbital simulations: (a)  location of the collisionary-region: backwardintegration via Lie-Integrator [5], using a simplifiedsolar  system, all  the planets  without Mercury (itsmass added to the Sun), plus the perturbation of the2 major  asteroids  (1 Ceres  and 4 Vesta)  and 500clones  of  the  comet.  Then  with  a  statisticalapproach (~ to [7]) we search for the most probableregions where the impact might have happened.   (b) origin(s) of the impators: once we know thecutoff  velocity  for  the  impact,  we  integratebackward from the possible assumed origins in aradial  spheric  random  way  the  particles(impactors),  ejecting  out  from  the  central  bodyreferences. Then with a statistical approach similar1021.pdf

to  (2a)  we  look for  the  possible  original  orbitalregions.Preliminary results:First results for porous object collisions show stickingwith some deformation in case the collision velocity islower than about 4vesc. In case of a velocity exceeding~5vesc the projectile escapes and is more or less eroded,depending on the impact speed (hit-and-run, see Fig.1). Velocities in between cause the projectile to shatter,bounce off, and subsequently it is re-accreted formingin some instances a bilobed structure, consistent with[9]. We also present first results on solid body collisions  with  materials  of  different  strength  which  arepresently still in process. Instead from the orbital pointof view the comet has a very chaotic orbit and it seemsto be in the current orbit due to close encounters firstwith Ceres and then with Jupiter  (Fig.  2),  indicatingthat  this comet was generated by 2 TNOs and muchprobably  in  the  Scattering  Disk  (SD,  Fig.  3),  if  thecollision happened after the LHB.Acknowledgements: Support from the FWF AustrianScience Fund projects P23810-N16 (MG) and S11603N16 (TM, CB) is acknowledged.References: [1] Auger et al.
