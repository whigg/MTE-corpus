Introduction: The use of siderophile element depletions in planetary mantles in conjunction with their experimentally derived metal-silicate partitioning behavior has proven to be a valuable tool to constrain the pressure (P), temperature (T) and redox (fO2) conditions during core formation in planetary bodies [1,2]. These models require adequate knowledge of the intrinsic variables that affect their metal-silicate partition coefficients (D’s). At present, the metal-silicate partitioning of a number of volatile siderophile elements (VSE) is poorly quantified, which  is unfortunate because VSE abundances have the potential to provide valuable insights into the devolatilization history of planetary bodies [5]. Here we present new D’s for a number of VSE which can be applied to core formation in the Moon, Vesta and the Angrite Parent Body (APB) [6]. New D’s for P, V, Co, Mo, Ge, and W are discussed in a companion abstract [6].   Methods: We used a Bristol-type end-loaded piston cylinder press to equilibrate metal-silicate mixtures within MgO capsules at 1-2.5 GPa and 1783-1883 K. As the silicate we used synthetic equivalents of the Apollo green glass [7] and a lunar granite [8] obtained by mixing appropriate amounts of high-purity oxides. The metal consisted of Fe powder doped with 1 wt.% of each siderophile element, 5 wt.% Ni and <15 wt.% S. After subjecting the samples to high P and T for >15 min [9], samples were imbedded in epoxy resin, polished for analysis and analyzed for major elements with an EMP at Utrecht University. Trace elements were measured with LA-ICPMS at Münster University. D can be parameterized using either multilinear regression, that corrects for metal composition using parameters of the form LN(1-Xi) that mimic Margules parameters [1,5]. Others prefer the epsilon approach, which corrects for the effect of solutes on the activity of trace elements in the metallic liquid by using activity and interaction coefficients from the steelmaking industry [10,11]. In this approach, the apparent equilibrium constant (KApp) is derived, which is corrected for solute interaction  in the metal. Using this approach, we assume 2+ for Pb, Ni, Mn, Cr, 3+ for In, Sb and 5+ As. For Cd, Se, Te, and S, the interaction and activity coefficients are largely unknown and the multilinear regression approach is used.   Results: Run products show well segregated               metallic blebs within a quenched silicate melt (Fig. 1). Silicate compositon varied (nbo/t = 1-3.3) due to various degrees of forsterite crystallization or interaction with the capsule walls. The fO2 varied between ∆IW 1.2±0.4, which was calculated assuming non-ideal mixing behavior for  Fe and FeO = 1.5.    Fig. 1: BSE images showing a typical run product with quenched metal and silicate (1783 K, 1 GPa)   P and T: Results from this study suggests that D(S, Te, Se, In) increase strongly with pressure between 12.5 GPa. Using data from this study only, we do not observe P effects for the other elements. Within the limited T range of 100 K, we do not observe effects of T, except for  KApp Ni, which decreases with T, and KApp Mn, which increases with T  [14]. However, extrapolation of D(Se, Te) with the T term of [12] to the experimental T of this study, results in D’s that are much higher then observed. This suggests that [12] overestimated the effect of T on D(Se, Te).  Silicate melt composition: The silicate melt composition in our experiments shows a wider range of SiO2, MgO, CaO, FeO and S in the silicate melt (Ssil). In this abstract, we discuss only nbo/t, FeO (for S, Se, Te) and Ssil, as these have the largest effect on the D’s of the elements considered here.   NBO/t: We observe that the nbo/t term is not statistically significant for KApp Cr, Ni, As, Cd, Sb, and Pb. However, we observe an increase of KApp In and a decrease of Kapp Mn and D(Te, Se, S) with increasing nbo/t.  FeO: At constant P-T and similar S contents of the metal, we observe with increasingly oxidizing conditions (from XFeO ~0.10) a decrease of D(Se, Te, S). For S, this is consistent with [13]. However, [12] found that D(Se, Te) increased at very reducing fO2 and at more oxidizing conditions remained constant up to ∆IW -1.5. Our results suggest a decrease from > ∆IW -1.5, similar to the behavior observed for S [13] (Fig. 3).  1851.pdf

 Fig. 2: Kapp In and log D(Se, Te, S) vs P  Ssil: S behaves moderately siderophile and significant amounts can be dissolved in silicate melts. With constant P and T and correction for S dissolved in metal, we observe a distinct decrease in D(Cr, Cd, Pb) with Ssil. This is not an artifact of the positive correlation between Ssil and S in the metal, because D would then be expected to increase given their chalcophile behavior [12]. The decrease in D can be explained by the formation of complexes of e.g., the form PbS. Metal composition: S dissolved in the metal strongly increases the siderophile behavior of Pb, Se, Te, in agreement with [9,10,12]. For the Log D of other elements, XS is not statistically significant, which is likely due to a combination of the effect of SSil at lower S contents of the metal and the overal limited S content of the metals in this study.     Fig. 3: (a) log D(S) vs xFeO (b-c) Kapp Pb, D(Cd) vs Ssil   Conclusions: Work is ongoing to better constrain the metal-silicate partitioning behavior of Cd, As, Sb at intermediate S contents of the metal. In addition, the effect of C will be explored in more detail, as it may bean important light element in the lunar core [16].
