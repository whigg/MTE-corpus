The Planetary Spectrophotometer Facility (PSF) at the University of Winnipeg is examining the stability of potential reflectance standards and calibration targets that can be used by both the Mastcam-Z and SuperCam spectrometers.  Mastcam-Z acquires visible color (RGB), stereo panoramas of the Martian surface; it is also equipped with a series of bandpass filters covering 400 - 1000 nm [2]. SuperCam is a multifunction science instrument. In addition to hosting a Laser Induced Breakdown Spectrometer (LIBS) and a color Remote Micro-Imager (RMI), SuperCam also performs Raman spectroscopy with 532 nm excitation, TimeResolved Fluorescence (TRF) spectroscopy, and Visible and InfraRed (VISIR) reflectance spectroscopy from 400 – 900 nm, and 1300 – 2600 nm [3].      Standards for reflectance and Raman spectroscopy should ideally be chemically inert, and thermally and environmentally stable, LabSphere Inc. offers a  polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) known as Spectralon that provides extremely optical stability, reproducible spectral reflectance close to 99% for wavelengths ranging from the visible through the near-infrared [4]. Spectralon can be utilized as a calibration target with the Raman system as well, as it has a variety of well pronounced Raman peaks [5] within the range of SuperCam.  This material has been extensively used as a calibration standard for various Earth-orbiting satellites [6]. The intent of our study was to determine its optical and mechanical stability under deep space and Mars surface conditions.      [7] found that the only optical degradation of Spectralon was caused by volatile contamination on its surface and that Spectralon can be UV stabilized by a relatively simple vacuum bake-out procedure to remove adsorbed volatile organic compounds.      Labsphere’s space-grade Spectralon has undergone extensive testing for UV exposure, proton bombardment, atomic oxygen exposure, α-Lyman radiation, outgassing and static charge testing by national laboratories, such as Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Goddard Space Flight Center, TRW, and CSEM. This testing has led to the development of a stringent manufacturing process that eliminates potential contaminants which can lead to UV degradation [8].       Methodology: To better understand the stability of Spectralon for Mars rover applications, PSF received five sets of various gray scales of Spectralon (99%, 50%, 20%, and 2% reflectance) as well as two separate 99% Space-Grade Spectralon pucks (SGS) from Labsphere.      Upon receipt, they were all cleaned and vacuum baked following the procedure outlined in [9]. After cleaning, reflectance spectra from 350 – 2500 nm were measured for all the standards as a baseline with an Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD) FieldSpec Pro HR spectrometer with a spectral resolution of between 2 and 7 nm.  Spectra were measured at a viewing geometry of i = 30° and e = 0° with incident light being provided by an in-house 150 W quartz-tungsten-halogen collimated light source. Sample spectra were measured relative to the original 99% NIST-traceable Spectralon PSF that has been using for 11 years as a calibration standard.     Raman spectra were also collected in the 175 – 4000 cm-1 range at a resolution of ~4 cm-1 at 614 nm with a B&WTek i-Raman. Excitation was provided by a 532 nm 50 mW solid state diode laser.  Ramanscattered light was detected by a Glacier T, a high spectral resolution (0.08 nm) thermoelectrically cooled (14°C) CCD detector.       Three sets of standards were placed into three different vacuum environments.  The first system consisted of a HiPace 300 turbo pump evacuating a 100 ml vessel housing SGS, 99%, 50%, 20%, and 2% standards.  The system ran for 34 days at pressures between 10-8 - 10-9 Torr and possibly lower, with no gas purge.  The second set was held under a CO2 environment at Mars-like pressures in a VWR 1410 vacuum oven for 27 days ranging from 1 – 6 Torr. The third set was subjected to the same conditions, but with the samples contained in a 62 mm wide aluminum housing that was exposed to a 30 W deuterium bulb for the first eight days.     Results: Following the three environmental exposures, reflectance and Raman spectra were again collected.      Raman pre exposure - All the 99% standards had sharp Raman features between 170 – 1400 cm-1 associated with a variety of C-F and C-C modes [5] superimposed upon a large broad fluorescence emission feature.  As the reflectance values of the standards decreased, the Raman features associated with the PTFE became less apparent and a new C=C peak at 1600  cm-1 emerged from the increased carbon-rich material used to darken the PTFE. 2362.pdf

     Raman post exposure - All the standards that were in the ultra-high vacuum system (Set #1) showed no shift in Raman peak positions and did not exhibit as intense fluorescence.  The standards that were exposed only to Mars-like pressures and CO2 (Set #2) showed no distinctive change among any of the standards.  The standards that were irradiated for the first eight days by intense UV (Set #3) showed visible signs of surface degradation (browning or yellowing – Fig. 1) and showed no apparent Raman peaks, likely due to greatly enhanced fluorescence.  Only the 2% target showed any of the original Raman features.       ASD pre exposure - All of the newly acquired 99% and 2% standards were comparable to the original 99% and 2% targets used by PSF.  However, while the 50% and 20% targets exhibited albedo values at 560 nm of ~50% and ~20% respectively, their spectra exhibited a more reddened slope.  Nonetheless, all the spectra were relatively featureless with only slight, but expected, <2% irregularities in reflectance in the 21002400 nm region.      ASD post exposure - All of the standards that were not exposed to the UV, regardless of atmospheric pressure, showed no change in their reflectance spectra.  However, the UV exposed standards, including SGS, show visible and spectral signs of alteration, including a major downturn in reflectance below 1400 nm that was less evident as reflectance values decrease but is still noticeable with the 2% standard (Fig. 2). Figure 1: PTFE standards following the environmental exposures. Set #1 top, Set #2 bottom left, Set #3 bottom right       Discussion: It is clear that the UV-exposed targets had been contaminated to some degree before and/or during their exposure.  The optical changes are consistent with contamination and subsequent UV-induced aromatization of hydrocarbons, in agreement with previous studies concerning this issue [7]. The SGS pucks were almost certainly properly manufactured originally but would have been exposed to hydrocarbons within the chamber.  To eliminate all hydrocarbons from the system requires much finer clean room settings and  Figure 2: Reflectance spectra of the PTFE standards following the environmental exposures.  Downturns in spectra are a result of optical degradation caused by UV exposure. regulations than PSF currently employs. There are many possibilities as to the source of contamination such as: not using ultra-high purity CO2, silicone seals and plastic/rubber chamber components or chamber cleaning fluids off gassing, off gassing of the wiring of the UV irradiation system, or something as simple as using non space-grade Spectralon and not reaching low enough vacuum pressures during the bake-out procedure. There will likely be differences in cleaning efficiency for bake-out pressure between the stated 10-6 Torr [7] and 1 Torr [8] that we employed.  This is consistent with examination at the Raman spectra of the ultra-high vacuum system samples which showed little to no fluorescence, as most of the hydrocarbons would have been removed during this low pressure exposure.       Conclusion:  Spectralon proves to be stable even to ultra-high vacuum pressures.  Degradation does occur with exposure to UV in the presence of volatile contaminants.   Assuming that Spectralon targets are properly manufactured, stored, and cleaned prior to launch, Spectralon is a good choice for reflectance standards and calibration targets for the upcoming Mars 2020 rover.
