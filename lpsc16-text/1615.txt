Otherobserved bilobate nuclei have volume ratios betweentheir components consistent with being trapped in asimilar cycle. Thus, this rotational fission and reconfiguration process is likely a dominant structural evolutionprocess for short-period comet nuclei.Introduction: The spin period of 67P was observedto decrease by 0.36 hours across its 2009 perihelion passage, down to 12.4 hours [1], indicating that significantchanges in a spin rate can occur over short time periods.On the brittle surface of the nucleus [1, 2], two straightcracks are aligned along the neck, separated by 750 m,and appear to be inactive [1]. El-Maarry et al. [3] hypothesized that they might result from orbital-inducedor tidal-line forces although this hypothesis has not beenquantitatively tested.We propose that they were formed during a periodof past rapid rotation. To investigate this hypothesiswe employed elastic and plastic Finite Element Models (FEMs). An OSIRIS shape model publicly available[4] was used, and the total mass was fixed at 1.0× 1013kg [1]. Also, we assume the material to be uniformlydistributed and the bulk density to be 535 kg/m3 [5].Dynamical and structural evolution of the nucleus of 67P: To investigate the structure of the nucleus of 67P, we employed FEMs on ANSYS AcademicAPDL 15.03. We used the elastic model by Hirabayashiand Scheeres [6] to consider the formation of cracks onthe neck. The plastic FEM by Hirabayashi and Scheeres[7] was also performed to obtain the final failure types.Our elastic analysis confirmed that tensile stress peaksappear at the locations of the observed cracks at shorterspin periods (Figure 1). At a spin period shorter than9 hours, the locations of the peak stresses are the sameas those of the observed cracks. The direction of themaximum principal stress is perpendicular to the crackplanes, implying that the cracks are of open-type.We also identified three failure types of the nucleus(Figure 2). Type I occurs at a spin period longer than∼ 9 hours. Compression may cause failure around theneck surface while the interior does not reach the yield.Type II represents tensional failure appearing on thenorthern side of the neck at spin periods between ∼ 7and ∼ 9 hours. However, since gravity is still predominant, the southern side can support the neck structure.In Type III, since centrifugal force exceeds gravitationalforce at spin periods shorter than ∼ 7 hours, the failureregion spreads over the majority of the neck.Our model shows that a Type I failure does not occurunless the cohesive strength is much smaller than thereported compressive strength, which is on the order ofkPa [2]. In Type III, because of the existing cracks onthe neck surface, stress concentration at their tips causespropagation of failure across the entire neck.Based on these considerations, we conclude that aType II failure resulted in the formation of the observedcracks. Figure 2 describes the upper and lower boundscohesive strength for the nucleus to keep the originalshape. Because of the existing craters, we also foundthat the bulk cohesive strength is between ∼ 10 and∼ 200 Pa (Figure 2), consistent with earlier studies [8].Once the spin period reaches the 7-hour limit, thebody should fission. Computing the system energy ofsuch a fissioned system, we found that at the 7-hoursplit limit, the system has a negative total energy andis, therefore, Hill Stable, which prevents the two lobesfrom escaping one another [9]. This would lead themto enter a period of orbiting and re-impacting at speedsless than escape speed (∼ 1 m/s), which would preservethe nature of the lobes [10].The above discussion raises a question of how the spinperiod could have exceeded 9 hours in the past withouttransitioning beyond the 7-hour limit during its currentconfiguration. To analyze this problem, we used the recent observation that shows the nucleus spin acceleration to be correlated to normal emission from its surface, appropriately scaled by the incident sunlight [11].This allows the application of computational techniquesfrom the YORP effect [12] to a prediction of the spinacceleration of the nucleus as a function of the subsolarlatitude at perihelion.Since sublimation pressure strongly varies with heliocentric distance, the spin acceleration of the 67P nucleusprimarily occurs near perihelion [11]. To assess pastevolution of the spin period, we integrated 1000 clonesfor 5000-years by using uncertainties proportional tocurrent orbital uncertainties. This adopted time scaleis compatible with the activity lifetime of typical JFCs,∼ 103 years, which is much shorter than their∼ 4×105year dynamical lifetime [13].1615.pdf

Our model showed that the sub-solar latitude at perihelion is uniformly distributed between −40 and +40degrees at heliocentric distances between 2 and 5 AUover a 1000-year activity lifetime (Figure 3). Therefore,this randomization allows the nucleus to pass into andout of the interval between 7 and 9 hours, forestallingspin fission. For a longer timespan, this randomizationalso allows the nucleus to have experienced previous cycles of the nucleus reconfiguration. Since the orbit of67P is typical among short-period comets, it is reasonable for them to experience a similar evolution cycle.Volume ratios of observed bilobate nuclei: Weconsider a volume ratio of the small lobe to the largelobe of observed bilobate nuclei. For a volume ratiohigher than∼ 0.2, the total energy of these systems willbe negative after fission, leading them to be subject toa period of bound evolution similar to rubble pile asteroids [14], during which additional sublimation effectscould further erode or spin up the individual lobes priorto re-impact. We computed the volume ratios of bilobatecometary nuclei 1P/Halley, 8P/Tuttle, 19P/Borrelly, 67Pand 100P/Hartley 2 and found that all of these nuclei hada volume ratio higher than 0.2. Observed nuclei with asingle component structure may either be primordial ormay have been part of a multi-component nucleus, fromwhich smaller components are more easily shed.Figure 1: Elastic stress solution at a spin period of 9 hours.The plot shows the maximum component of the principalstress.
