Introduction: Lithium and its isotopes has proved to be a powerful tracer for high and low temperature processes, also with respect to the early solar nebular or chondrite parent body processes. Several studies [e.g. 1,2,3] focused on the Li compositions of ordinary and carbonaceous chondrites and their components (chondrules, CAIs and matrix). Distinct compositional differences are apparent between, but also within chondrites [1] with variable Li abundances and highly fractionated Li-isotopes of up to 40‰ [1,3].  In order to better understand the effect and the extend of secondary processes, such as chondrite parent body alteration, and the re-distribution of elements as a consequnce, we investigated several ordinary and carbonaceous chondrites with increasing degree thermal metamorphism (from petrologic type 3 to 6). We determined Li concentrations in chondrule- and matrix olivine, low Ca pyroxene and bulk chondrites. Samples and analytical technique: The investigated samples included unequilibrated chondrites Allende (CV3), Semarkona (LL3), Bishunpur (LL3.15) and Bremervörde (L3.9) and equilibrated chondrites Northwest Africa 5515 (CK4), Saratov (L4), Bjurböle (L4), Daule (L5) and Dar al Gani 381 (L6). Major elements were analyzed by electron probe microbeam analysis (EPMA) and trace elements (Li) by in-situ laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Along with Li-isotopes, Li concentrations of chondrules, matrix and the bulk chondrite were analyzed from solution, using multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) following the procedure of Seitz et al. (2004) [4].  Results: With increasing metamorphic grade, elemental equilibrium is generally achieved. At temperatures of about 600 to 700 °C, corresponding to type 4 (Clayton 1993), Fe-Mg is completely re-equilibrated, showing virtually no compositional differences between chondrules and matrix. However, unlike Fe and Mg we observe the lack or incomplete re-distribution of Li. Lithium remains un-equilibrated in L4 and L5 chondrites, generally depicting low Li abundances in chondrules and higher concentrations in the matrix. Only at high metamorphic conditions, corresponding to type 6, near equilibrium partitioning is achieved (Fig. 1). Average Li abundaces for chondrules, matrix or bulk chondrites are listed in Table 1. Note: Bulk concentrations listed here - as a proxy of matrix composition - systematically underestimate the Li budget of the respective matrix.   Tab. 1.

Discussion: All chondrites investigated so far exhibit a similar Li distribution between matrix (bulk) and chondrules with a predominant Li-deficiency in chondrules relative to the matrix. These discrepancies, typical for unequilibrated chondrites, remain evident in chondrites of high petrologic type, suggesting that even at higher thermal metamorphic conditions (type 4 and 5) Li re-distribution is significantly hampered, due to insufficiently high and long T-t-conditions. We calculated Li-diffusion rates using the implicit finite difference method after Crank-Nicolson [6]. The results are 1459.pdf

shown in Fig. 3, where matrix/chondrule Li ratios are plotted according to their metamorphic peak temperatures.The model calculations indicate that Li diffusion rates in olivine are an order of magnitude slower than that of Fe and Mg. Our findings are in accordance with previously determined diffusion rates [5].     Fig. 1. Li concentration [ppm] in olivine of individual chondrules and coexisting matrix from chondrites of different petrologic type (3-5).  The slopes in Fig. 3 represent theoretical diffusion paths for temperatures in the range of 400 to 1000 oC, and timescales from 10 years up to 10 Ma.   Fig. 2. Ratio of Li concentrations between matrix and chondrule olivines as a function of petrologic type. With increasing temperature diffrences in Li concentration diminish and near equilibrium is reached for petrologic type 6 chondrites. The grey area illustrates chondrule/matrix ratios of Fe.  The grey-shaded area outlines the range of measured Li ratios.   Fig. 3. Calculated ratio of Li concentrations between matrix- and chondrule olivines as a function of temperature and time. Grey area indicates measured Li data of chondrites with regard to the metamorphic peak temperature.   We conclude that low Li concentrations in chondrules and high abundances in the matrix are primary features, and most likely are the product of nebular processes such as evaporation/condensation during chondrule formation (also see [7]). Even up to moderately high temperatures (typical for type 4 and 5 chondrites) these characteristics are partly preserved. However, because of the differences in diffusivity of Li relative to Fe and Mg (an order of magnitude), and because Li has not been equilibrated in petrologic type 4 and 5 chondrites, Li can be used as a speedometer to estimate the duration of metamorphic peak conditions. Based on our diffusion model, employing data from various chondrites, we suggest that metamorphic peak temperatures on the L/LL chondrite parent body, for example, prolonged over a timescales of 0.5 Ma to 5 Ma years.
