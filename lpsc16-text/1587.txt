Introduction: The evolution of subsurface tropicalice  on  Mars  is  vital  to  understanding  the  history  ofvolatiles and implications for climate and geology. Iceis presently not stable below the mid-latitudes [e.g., 1],but the actual, time-integrated loss is uncertain  [2, 3].Layered-ejecta craters have long been thought to tapburied ice [e.g., 4]. They are present at all latitudes andsample to greater depths (kms) than possible with neutron  spectroscopy  or  even  surface-penetrating  radar.With the advent of near-global 10-m imaging of Mars,individual craters can be dated from smaller craters superposed  on  their  ejecta  blankets  [e.g.,  5].  This  approach promises a 4D reconstruction of buried ice onMars.We have begun estimating formation ages of single-layered ejecta (SLE) craters throughout Mars' tropical region. We focus on SLE craters because of theirprevalence  at  these  latitudes.  We have  selected  206SLE craters from the Robbins [6] database, with diameter (D) ≥5 km to assure a large enough ejecta blanketfor good crater count statistics.  Ages of these craterscan  provide new constraints  on when subsurface iceexisted for locations where it is presently unstable atthe surface.Methods: Fundamental to this work is estimatingthe formation ages of SLE craters in Mars' tropical latitudes (within ±30ºN). We use small, superposed craters(SSCs) measured on the SLE crater ejecta blankets andboth Neukum  [7] and  Hartmann  [8] chronologies  tocompute ages. However, several issues introduce errorin the age calculations:  removal  of SSCs by erosionand/or dust  deposition, inclusion of craters only partially buried by the ejecta blanket that are not superposed,  inclusion  of  secondaries,  and  errors  in  thechronologies. While there is little we can do about thelast issue, we have developed some strategies to mitigate the first three. The first  strategy  is  measuring  craters  of  similarsizes to the SSCs within a nearby reference area that ison the same geological unit. Comparison of crater sizefrequency distributions (SFDs) for the two areas maythen reveal if any of these issues need to be addressed.For example, similarities in density and shape of thecrater SFDs at larger diameters when densities at otherdiameters  are  not  similar  may indicate  that  partiallyburied craters are included in the SSC SFD. Therefore,we avoid using this portion of SSC SFD to determinethe SLE crater formation age. Furthermore, differencesin the SFDs can also help indicate diameter ranges toavoid, in this case due to crater removal or secondarycrater  contamination.  For  instance,  if  the  SSC  SFDslope  is  shallower  than  the  reference  area,  this  maysuggest  SSCs on the  SLE crater  ejecta  have  experienced local removal or that the reference area is contaminated by secondaries. We use the other strategiesdiscussed  next  to  ascertain  which  cause  is  the  mostplausible, and thus, which diameter ranges are unsuitable for computing ages. Our second strategy is to compare the SSC and reference area SFDs to a subset of the SSC SFDs only including degraded craters and SFDs of obvious secondaries (those that form in chains and clusters). If thedensity and shape of the degraded subset SFD is similar to the total SSC SFDs, then this might imply thatthose  diameter  ranges  have  experienced  more  cratererasure.  Likewise,  correlation  between  the  obvioussecondary SFD and SSC and/or reference area SFDsmay suggest that these distributions contain a significant number of unrecognized secondaries for some diameters. In either case, we do not use data to computeages for which these issues are indicated. Finally, the third strategy is to analyze isochron fitsto the SSC SFDs. Diameter ranges that do not matchare not used to estimate model SLE formation ages.Results and Discussion: Table 1 shows the calculated  model  formation  ages  of  our  first  set  of  SLEcraters. These craters are mostly chosen from low dustregions (as indicated by Thermal Emission Spectrometer  [9]) to minimize effects on the crater SFDs due todust  deposition. Otherwise no (conscious) preferencewas given for location or preservation state of the SLEduring selection.The  chief  result  from  the  ages  of  these  first  20craters  is  that  SLE  craters  appear  to  have  formedthroughout the Amazonian. Moreover, we have potentially found SLE craters that have formed within thelast 500 Myr. These results imply that tropical subsurface ice is preserved well into the very recent geological history of Mars.The existence  of  young SLE craters  implies  thatice-depth estimates can be interpreted as contemporaryvalues, and thus places limits on Mars total H2O losssince the cryosphere stabilized. The median diameterof the youngest 5 craters examined to date is ~10 km,which implies an excavation depth [10] to ice of ~600m. If young SLE craters exist down to the previouslymapped ~5 km onset diameter  [11], the depth to icecould be as little as ~300 m today. The ice table depthdecreases  smoothly  with  increasing  latitude  to  nearzero at 50º latitude and higher [12]; summing this volume for representative porosity structures yields H2Osublimation loss of 10-20 m Global Equivalent Layer(GEL),  in  agreement  with  recent  multireservoir  D/Hmodels  [13].

controls on Mars' remarkable ability to retain subsurface H2O over eons.Future Work: The ultimate goal of this work is todetermine the temporal evolution of equatorial subsurface  ice  throughout  the  Amazonian.  If  SLE  cratersform by tapping subsurface H2O, our preliminary results have already shown that tropical buried ice is stillpresent into the recent history of Mars. However, wedo not yet know how common young SLE craters are.If our first set presented here is biased and young SLEcraters are rare, then that would imply the amount ofsubsurface volatiles  has  receded to some degree andmay only be currently present in small pockets. In contrast,  if  our  preliminary  set  is  representative  of  thewhole and  young SLE craters  are frequent,  then  theburied  ice  could  exist  in  large  amounts  and  occurthroughout the equatorial region. In order to constrainwhich of  these scenarios  is  correct,  once we have  alarge enough sample of estimated SLE crater formationages,  we will  compare the formation frequency withtime of  tropical  SLE craters  to  that  expected for  allcraters.  We will also analyze trends of crater depths,ejecta mobility, and location with respect to age to determine  how  the  ice  depth  and  concentration  haschanged with time and place [e.g., 14].
