One possible explanation [3] for this asymmetry is differential nucleation rates (or even freezing andmelting) on opposite sides of the inner-core. Any density asymmetry in the inner-core will cause it to movewith respect to the outer-core adiabat, causing differential growth that serves to amplify itself. This differential growth has the potential [4] to create a corresponding East-West asymmetry in the Earth's magnetic field.One of the many surprising findings of the MESSENGER mission is the strong North-South asymmetryin Mercury's axial dipolar magnetic field [5,6]. Herewe explore the possibility of a translating inner-core inside Mercury and its impact on the symmetry properties of Mercury's magnetic field.Moments of Inertia for a Translating InnerCore: Because inner-core nucleation preferentially removes dense material from the outer-core, younger inner-core material tends to be less dense. Thus, a unidirectional translating inner core will have a layered density structure in the direction of the translation. Such adensity structure causes the inner-core's maximum moment of inertia to align normal to the direction of translation. This means that once unidirectional translationbegins, the inner-core will tend to realign itself so thatthe translation is in the equatorial plane to maximizethe moment of inertia about the spin-axis. This is aclassical example of True Polar Wander (TPW), andprovides a natural explanation of the Earth's inner coreasymmetry being oriented East-West.We then considered the scenario in which the innercore translation undergoes a reversal, which could be caused by melting induced stable stratification on the top of the inner core. In this scenario, the densest material is formed into a prolate shape and then is shifted toward the center of figure of the inner-core. This changes the relative magnitudes of the moments of inertia: the maximum moment of inertia can now be aligned with the direction of translation. The equatorially translating inner-core will undergo TPW and align its translation direction with the spin-axis.The Possibility of a North-South Translating Inner Core: We explored the scenario in which the inner-core changes the translation direction once to evaluate the possibility of a North-Soth translating innercore due to TPW. In our experiments, we choose a ranFigure 2: Moment of inertia difference as a function of Center of Massshift from the Center of Figure for translating inner-cores. Shown hereare scenarios in which the inner core has reversed its translation direction, and the two translating velocities are randomly chosen between 1and 10 times the growth velocity during each regime, and the reversaltime is randomly chosen as well. It can be seen that translating innercores which tend to align their translation to be polar are possible butuncommon. Similar (~7%) frequencies for true polar wander to alignthe translation direction to be polar were found in our experiments withlarger numbers of randomly chosen velocity regimes, indicating thatless regularly translating inner cores will probably display a similarphenomenon.Figure 1: Examples of age distributions of translating inner cores.Color represents normalized age of material. The top two panelsshow unidirectional inner-core translation initiated at the same timeas the inner-core growth. In the top left panel, the inner core istranslating at the same speed as it is growing. In the top right panel,the inner-core is translating at triple its growth speed. The bottomtwo panels show scenarios in which the inner-core translation reversed its direction. In the bottom left panel, the inner core translated East and then West. In the bottom right panel, the inner coretranslated West, East, and then West again. Both cases shown on thebottom have translation velocities significantly larger than the corresponding growth velocities.

dom reversal time and two random velocities distributed between 1 and 10 times the growth velocity. Figure 2 shows the moment of inertia differences as afunction of the distance of the center of mass (CoM) isshifted from the center of figure (CoF) of the innercore. It can be seen that there is a non-zero chance forthe inner core translation to be directed North-South inthis scenario. In these data, about 7% of the random velocity pairs gave rise to inner-cores with a maximummoment of inertia in the translation direction.Figure 3 presents a proxy for the time-evolution ofthe moment of inertia difference for a translating innercore. It can be seen from Figure 3 that an inner corewhich has changed translation direction spends relatively little time with a density distribution that favorsNorth-South translation following TPW. Notably, thissame shape of curve was found for a wide range of velocity pairs. This indicates that although an inner-coreunder these conditions spends a fairly small amount oftime aligning its translation with the planet's spin axis,essentially all inner-cores which reverse their translation direction once will pass through a regime in whichthis occurs.Implications for Earth and Mercury: First, ouranalysis provides a very fundamental physical reasonfor the Earth's inner-core asymmetry to be equatorial,in particular if the asymmetry is caused by a translatinginner-core. Moreover, we identified a plausible causefor Mercury's North-South asymmetric magnetic field:a growing inner core translating in the North-South direction. If this is indeed the case, the North-Southasymmetric nature of Mercury's magnetic field is a recent phenomenon on geological time-scales, becausethe inner core will tend to only translate in the NorthSouth direction for a relatively short portion of its existence.References: [1] Alboussiere, T. et al.
