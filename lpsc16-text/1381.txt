Zahnle , Planetary Systems Branch, NASA Ames Research Center.Figure 1: Sample timestep of a local-scale impact modeledwith the CTH hydrocode. The figure shows density on a logarithmic scale (10−6 < ρ < 1 gm cm−3) at t = 60 s after theimpact of a d = 36.8 km object at 20 km s−1 (4×vesc) into the“Mars” target.Hydrodynamic modelingWe present results from numerical modeling of impact erosion of planetary atmospheres using the CTH hydrocode. Thecalculations discussed here are “local”: the curvature of theplanet and the radial dependence of the gravitational field areneglected. The computational domain is a cartesian box: thecalculations are three-dimensional.Physical parameters of the simulations include the targetplanet properties: three planetary environments are used. Parameters include the gravitational field (vertical gravity g) andthe escape velocity that characterize the target. Additionallythe surface pressure of the atmosphere and its scale height areset, the latter determined by the atmospheric composition andtemperature. This in turn sets the altitude of the exobase, abovewhich material is assumed to move ballistically. The parameters of the impactor are its diameter and velocity; the impactorangle is set to θ = 45◦ from the vertical.We are carrying out the local-scale simulations using theCTH hydrocode from Sandia National Laboratory [1]. CTH isa highly advanced code widely used in the planetary sciencecommunity. It utilizes adaptive mesh refinement to concentratecomputational resources at locations of physical interest in thesimulation, such as shock fronts and material interfaces. Inaddition, it makes use of material strength models and advancedtabular equations of tabular such as ANEOS and the SESAMElibrary from Los Alamos National Laboratory.We consider impacts into three targets: Mars-like (g = 370cm s−2, vesc = 5.0 km s−1), Earth-like (g = 980 cm s−2,log Shuvalov parameter ξlog scaled escaping atmosphere mass χ a−10−8−6−4−2di=36.8 kmMars targetsEarth targetsSuper−Earth targets0 2 4 6 8−10−8−6−4−2di=17.0 kmMars targetsEarth targetsSuper−Earth targetsFigure 2: Scaled escaping mass χa vs. Shuvalov number ξ forour simulations. Top: Simulations carried out with impactordiameter 36.8 km. Bottom: simulations with impactor diameter 17.0 km.vesc = 11.0 km s−1), and a “Super-Earth” (g = 2411 cm s−2,vesc = 23.5 km s−1) that matches conditions for an exoplanet of8M⊕. The surface pressures are Psur f = 1, 10, and 100 bar. Forthese first set of calculations we also assume an isothermal CO2atmosphere at 300K, leading to exobase altitudes Hx ∼ 400,150, and 60 km for the “Mars”, “Earth”, and “Super-Earth”cases, respectively. Impactor diameters are di = 4.6, 17, and36.8 km, and impact velocities are parameterized in terms ofthe escape velocity: vi/vesc = 2, 4, 6, and 8. Computationdomain sizes are based on the maximum of either the transientcrater diameter from the impact or the exobase altitude. Likewise the simulation runtimes are based on the maximum craterformation time or the time for impact ejecta moving at vescto reach the exobase altitude. Both the impact and the targethave made of basalt; a simple material model (“geo”) in CTHis applied, with a nominal yield strength of 109 cm2 s−2.Post-impact analysis yields fluxes of material moving atescape speed or faster through the boundaries (chiefly the upperboundary at z = Hx); we integrate the flux to get the total amountof escaping material. Although we track three kinds of material(impactor, target surface, atmosphere), here we report only onthe last (escaping atmosphere).1381.pdf

Shown is the amount of escapingmass mesc as a function of impactor diameter di.Simulation ResultsWe have carried out and analyzed ∼ 70 3D calculations so far.A sample timestep from one of the calculations is shown inFig. 1. The figure shows the density on a logarithmic scale(10−6<ρ<1 gm cm−3) at t=60 s after the impact of a di=36.8km object at 20 km s−1 (4×vesc) into the “Mars” target.Shuvalov scalingShuvalov[2] has carried out an extensive set of impact simulations for objects into Mars- and Earth-like targets. Heplotted his results in terms of parameters ξ and χa, definedin terms of simulation parameters and escaping atmospheremass: ξ = (d3i ρi/H3ρ0)[ρi/(ρi + ρt)][(v2i − v2esc)/v2esc], χa =(mesc/mi)[v2esc/(v2i − vesc)2] The impactor diameter is di, velocity vi, density ρi and mass is mi; the atmosphere is characterized by surface density ρ0 and scale height H; the planetescape velocity is vesc and ground (“target”) density ρt .Shuvalov found that his results (χa vs ξ ) could be well-fitby an empirical fifth-order polynomial in ξ . In Fig. 2 we plotour results in terms of the same variables. For comparison theShuvalov fit is shown as a dashed curve.The Shuvalov curve forms an upper envelope to our results.This suggests that our simulations support the use of Shuvalov’sformulation, but that various possible potential problems in ourcalculations may cause the amount of escaping mass we find tofall short of the Shuvalov curve. For instance, numerical resolution of the calculations may be an issue. It will be noticed thatour “Super-Earth” calculations fall farthest below the Shuvalovcurve. For these simulations the assumed surface temperatureof 300 K generates an atmospheric profile with a scale heightof ∼ 2 km, which is comparable to the 2–3 km resolution ofour calculations. In turn this may reduce the reliability of ourresults. An easy test of this question will be to carry out calculations with hotter (and thus taller) atmospheres, which will bebetter resolved in the simulations. Calculations with T =1500K surface temperature are presently underway.Monte Carlo simulations of impact erosionAssuming that the Shuvalov scaling and parameterization isa good description of impact erosion, we can then use theseresults to model the effects on planetary atmospheres of a population of impactors. The survival of atmospheres for widevariety of planetary environments can thus be tested. We haveconstructed a Monte Carlo simulation algorithm in which aplanet (characterized by mass, radius, and orbital velocity) witha planetary atmosphere (characterized by surface temperature,molecular weight, and surface pressure), is subjected to bombardment from an impactor population (characterized by differential diameter number distribution and velocity at infinity).An impactor with diameter di and velocoty vi is selected fromsuitable distributions (which include the effects of planetary orbital and escape velocity). Given the atmospheric characteristics (following from the parameters listed above), the Shuvalovparameter ξ is calculated, with χa following from Shuvalov’sempirical fit. This results in the mass of escaping atmospheremesc = miχa. The escaping ejected mass is subtracted (andρ0 accordingly adjusted) until the remaining atmospheric massfalls below a set value such as 0.001× the initial mass. Quantities of interest include the distribution of mesc as a functionof impactor diameter di (indicating the sizes of the “most effective” impactors) and the total amount Mi of the impactormass needed to effectively erode a given atmosphere. Thelatter quantity is heavily dependent, however, on the assumedform of the size distribution N(di). To keep the total massin the impactor distribution finite, we adopt a two-power-lawdistribution: dN/dx ∝ x−2.5 for x < 10 km, dN/dx ∝ x−3.5 forx > 10 km. An example of a Mars-type calculation is shownin Fig 3. In this case, the ratio Mi/matm ∼ 3.5. Preliminaryresults from out simulations suggest that the “most effective”impactors lie in the range 1 < di < 10 km and that Mi variesby factors of order unity from trial to trial, thus requiring anumber of trials for statistical determination as a function ofthe parameter set.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by NASA Planetary AtmospheresProgram award NNX14AJ45G.
