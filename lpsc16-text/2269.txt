Although meteorites quickly weather away after arrival on Earth, chromite grains can survive for millions of years in terrestrial sediments. Extraterrestrial chromite grains in sediments could have arrived as part of large meteorites or as part of the micrometeorite flux. The grains can be assigned to parent meteorite types using their characteristic elemental and oxygen-isotope compositions. The overall objective of research on extraterrestrial chromites in the sedimentary record is to characterize meteorite populations from different time periods to see how populations have changed over time. Ordovician samples from the Lynna River section in Russia were chosen for this work because they represent the same time period as the quarries in Sweden where ~100 fossil L chondrites have been found, apparently representing a 100x higher flux of L chondrites at that time [1, 2]. The Lynna River section consists of highly condensed limestones where a few centimeters of sediment represent many thousands of years. Such sediments are expected to have detectable amounts of extraterrestrial chromite, based on current infall rates of meteorites and micrometeorites. If the higher flux was a worldwide event, the Lynna River samples should reveal a very large excess of L chondrites relative to other meteorite types. The Lynna River samples were collected from the exposed river walls. Chromite grains have been measured by [3], and we measured grains from the same sedimentary sequence to both improve the statistics for this sample and to perfect our measurement techniques.  Experimental: Lynna River samples were processed at Lund University and extraterrestrial chromite grains were separated and characterized.  The grains were prepared at the University of Hawai'i (UH). Grains were mounted in epoxy inside quarter-inchdiameter steel cylinders. The cylinders were ground flat and polished using a series of diamond lapping papers. Stillwater chromite was used as the standard.  Oxygen isotopes were measured using the UH Cameca ims 1280 ion microprobe. We used a ~1 nA Cs+ primary beam with a small raster of ~ 3 µm. Secondary ions were counted in multi-collection mode, with 16O- and 18O- on Faraday cups, and 17O- on the monocollector electron multiplier. Each run consisted of 30 cycles of 4 seconds with 17O- on the electron multiplier followed by 10 seconds with 17O on the FC2 Faraday cup. The 17O/16O ratio was calculated from the 4-second measurement and the 18O/16O ratio from the 10-second measurement. The mass-resolving resolving power was ~5000, nominally high enough to resolve 16OH- from 17O-, but a low mass tail of 16OH- affected 17O-. A tail correction corresponding to 6 ppm of the 16OH- peak (measured at the end of each measurement) was applied, and was typically ~0.05-0.1‰ (up to 0.75‰).   Element abundances for the Lynna chromite grains were also determined using the University of Hawai'i JEOL JXA-8500F field emission electron microprobe. An accelerating voltage of 20 keV, a beam current of 20 nA, and varying beam diameters (1-5 µm) were used for data collection.  Results and Discussion: Twenty-three chromite grains ranging from 60 to 220 µm were selected for SIMS analysis. We obtained one to three spots per grain for both SIMS and electron probe analyses (Fig. 1). Measurements for each grain typically showed good reproducibility. The data were evaluated for instrumental errors and the pits were examined in detail to look for cracks using the SEM (Fig. 1). Data from pits that hit cracks or areas of apparent secondary alteration we excluded from further consideration.  The δ17O and δ18O values are plotted in Figure 2, along with fields showing bulk oxygen compositions for H, L, and LL chondrites from [4]. The Lynna values are averages for each grain, whereas the standard values are individual measurements. The Δ17O values for the Lynna grains are consistent with L or LL type, in agreement with previous studies of Swedish and Lynna grains [1-3]. The data plot at slightly higher Δ17O values than bulk L chondrites. This shift may be  Figure 1: Secondary Electron image of ion microprobe analysis pits in a representative Lynna chromite grain.   due to the deadtime correction for 17O. The plotted data used 30 ns for the deadtime correction, but a deadtime of 29 ns shifts the data downwards ~0.2‰, putting it within the L or LL range. High Δ17O values may also reflect an inadequate correction for the 16OH tail, which was only monitored at the end of each measurement. The Lynna chromites have lower δ18O values than bulk ordinary chondrites, ~8‰ lower than the published L chondrite data from [4]. To check for artifacts, we analyzed chromite and surrounding olivine and pyroxene in a polished section of the Hessle H5 chondrite fall. The average δ18O for chromite was ~7.7‰ lower than the average for olivine and pyroxene, which plot in the field of bulk H chondrites. This is consistent with our δ18O for Lynna chromites, which is ~8‰ below bulk L-chondrite silicates. A matrix effect in our standardization is also a possibility, but the Fe and Cr contents of Stillwater chromite are 21.2 and 28.8 wt%, respectively, similar to those of Lynna chromite (19.4 and 39.3 wt%). These observations suggest that the ~8‰ offset is real. A similar amount of δ18O offset was also observed by [3].  TiO2, Al2O3, and FeO concentrations for Lynna chromite grains from this study are shown in Figure 3. The variation in composition is minimal and demonstrates homogeneity within a grain as well as the entire sample set. The TiO2 and Al2O3 results for the Lynna grains are within the nominal ranges for L type chondrites [e.g., 3]. The FeO data does not fall within the ranges of [5], but the Lynna data in this study agrees with data for the Swedish and Russian grains [3].  Conclusions: We prepared and carefully documented a group of sediment dispersed fossil chromite grains from the Lynna River in Russia and measured their oxygen isotopes and elemental abundances. Our   results are in good agreement with those for samples from Sweden and for other Lynna River grains [1-3]. Combining all data from Lynna River, 60 chromite grains have now been measured, and all of them are apparently from L or LL chondrites. These data confirm the conclusion [1-3,6] that L chondrites dominated the Ordovician meteorite and micrometeorite flux world-wide starting ~470 Myr ago. References: [1] Schmitz B.
