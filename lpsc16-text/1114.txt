Rajashekhar Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India (nirmala@sac.isro.gov.in/ Fax: +91-07926915823).   Introduction:  The flow channels are believed to have formed through discharge of subsurface of water from aquifers, suggesting the presence of past liquid water on planet Mars. It is believed that the watery environments existed during Noachian period and it indicates the possibility of presence of life in martian past [1, 2]. To understand the aqueous environments it is important to study the mineralogy and geomorphology of the flow channels on Mars. In the present study the results of geomorphology, spectroscopy and topography are shown for Ladon Valles of Margaritifer Terra region on Mars with the help of orbiter datasets such as Mars Orbiter MissionMars Colour Camera (MOM-MCC), High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (MRO-HiRISE), Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter-Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (MRO-CRISM) and Mars Express-High Resolution Stereo Camera (MExHRSC). Phyllosilicates have been identified in northern part of Ladon Valles area from MROCRISM. These minerals are hypothesized to have formed in early martian history under alkaline and wet environmental conditions.  Study area:  Ladon Valles is located below the eastern part of Valles Marineris. It is form by flow of river channel which is lying within the Margaritifer Terra region on Mars. It is Located near 22.6° South and 28.7° West.  Ladon Valles is around 278 km long. It is believed that is flowed towards north from the Argyre impact crater to Chryse Planitia [3, 4].  The layer deposits of Ladon Valles on Mars hosts the deposits of phyllosilicates (saponites). It is suggested that the deposits of phyllosilicates were formed in Noachian period of Mars [5]. Therefore the phyllosilicates bearing layer deposits in the Ladon Valles indicate that this valley may have been formed during early history of Mars. Therefore it may be one of the important valley, which has preserved early aqueous deposits.  Datasets and methodology: MOM-MCC, launched in India's first MOM missions in 2013 [6] has played an important role to identify the geomorphological features in association with MROHiRISE datasets. Two MCC images were used to analyse the geomorphology of the study area. CRISM image, FRT00008076 at spatial resolution 18m was studied for the extraction of aqueous minerals from the layer deposition of Ladon Valles. We have also used HRSC DTM to study the topography of the aqueous minerals found in layers deposits of London Valles of the study region at a spatial resolution of 125 m. Photometric correction was done for MCC images.  Results: The Morphological, mineralogical and topographic analyses were done at northern part of Ladon Valles as it contains the deposits of layer deposits, mud cracks and clay minerals which are representative of past fluvial events of the study area. Phyllosilicates and the important geologic units such as layered deposits have analyzed in detail using above datasets. In the present study exposures of phyllosilicate have been identified within the layer deposits of Ladon Valles (figure 1a, b and c) using data of MRO-CRISM (spectral range between 1.0 to 2.6 µm).The spectroscopic analysis confirmed the presence of saponite in the Ladon Valles region. In particular, bands at 1.4 μm, 1.9 μm, 2.31 μm, 2.54 μm are characteristic of saponite clays. 2.31 μm indicates the presence of saponite [7, 8] in the study area.  Phyllosilicates have been identified with respect to their local geomorphology and topographic analysis by high resolution datasets such as MCC, HiRISE and HRSC. Figure 2 shows the location of Ladon Valles is on mosaic of MOM-MCC images.  The layer deposits have been identified from the locations of phyllosilicates and identified by HiRISE data (figure 3). The elevation of profiles of phyllosilicates bearing layer deposits measured by HRSC data are from 5m to18m above the floor of the Valles. Spectral signature of saponites shown in coral, cyan, orange and green colors are located at 5m, 8m, 18m and 14m, respectively. These profiles are taken for the study of aqueous minerals shown in red box on profile.   MCC datasets have been played an important role to identify the drainage pattern. The study area mainly shows geomorphological features such as sand dune, impact craters and layer deposits along the flow of the Ladon Valles. Conclusions: In the present study we report the detection of phyllosilicates such as saponites, their associate geomorphology and topographic analysis. The phyllosilicates are associated with mud crakes, fractured terrain and layer deposits exposed in the wall of the Ladon Valles. Phyllosilicates may have formed by local or regional aqueous alteration processes which play as an evidence of presence of past watery environment in the study area. Flow channel in the study area also indicates that the deposits of phyllosilicates in the study area may have been 1114.pdf

transported from other regions on Mars away from the Ladon Valles. Study of phyllosilicates in the study areas will help to understand the early rock deposits. This study gives the information of the geological conditions of the study area under which phyllosilicate minerals have been formed. Phyllosilicates could have been by aqueous alteration processes due to fluvial activity in the Ladon Valles region.
