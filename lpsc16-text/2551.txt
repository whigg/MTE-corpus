Jolliff1, 1Dept. of Earth & Planetary Sciences, Washington University, St. Louis, MO 63130 (mcbouchard@wustl.edu).  Introduction: The Mars Exploration Rover (MER) Opportunity has examined over 400 sites with its Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer (APXS) since leaving Eagle crater [1] and arriving at Endeavour crater [2] [3]. Opportunity has investigated a diverse suite of rocks around the rim of Endeavour crater including; the sulfate sandstones of the Burns formation in Meridiani Planum [4], the breccias of the Shoemaker formation, which make up the Endeavour crater impact lithology [5], the post-impact Grasberg formation first identified at Cape York [5], the pre-impact Matijevic formation identified at Matijevic Hill on Cape York [5], as well as float, erratics, and non-martian meteorites [6]. Erratics of interest include the basaltic Bounce Rock, which has been compared to shergottite basalts [7], as well as the basaltic Marquette Island [8], and float rocks such as Tickbush at Solander Point. Here we present two complementary statistical tools used to find patterns and test relationships between specific rocks. Our objective is to provide a method of rapid, quantitative assessment for relating rocks investigated in-situ on Mars and specifically around Endeavour crater to each other and to a representative set of martian meteorites. Key questions of this investigation include: How do the geologic formations relate to each other? How are potential rock precursors related? Are there relationships between erratics and martian meteorites?  The statistical tools use the elemental composition data collected in-situ, with the APXS data expressed in oxide weight percent [9]. For most targets, we restrict analysis to sites that were either brushed clean of dust or ground into using the Rock Abrasion Tool. Our approach is to begin with a notional grouping of targets based on geological relationships as assigned by the MER team during on-going operations and analysis. We use the statistical tools to test the inferred relationships and to seek indications of relationships that may not be obvious from geologic context. Martian meteorites included in this study are; Shergotty, Zagami, and EETA 79001 lithology B (basaltic shergottites), EETA 79001 lithology A (olivine-phyric shergottite), ALH 77005 and LEW 88516 (lherzolitic shergottites), Lafayette and Nakhla (clinopyroxenites), Chassigny (dunite) [10], NWA 7475/7034 (regolith breccia) [11], and ALH 84001 (orthopyroxenite) [10]. Hierarchical Clustering (HC): Compositions are sorted into a dendrogram (Fig. 1) with an iterative group-average technique of a HC program. The clustering software creates Euclidian distance matrices from the sum of the squared differences of the attributes of each case, and then merges the most similar cases (individual rock targets). The oxide weight percentages (SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, Cr2O3, FeO, MnO, MgO, CaO, Na2O, K2O, P2O5, SO3 and Cl) are the quantitative attributes. Clusters were also created after normalizing out SO3 and Cl to evaluate prealteration protoliths [e.g., 12].  The clusters reveal insights into the relationships between the Endeavour rim rocks: the pre-impact Matijevic Hill formation rocks form a distinct supergroup from the Shoemaker breccias, the Grasberg formation forms a sub-group within the Shoemaker super-group, the Burns formation forms two distinct super-groups, broadly related by geographic location, from the rest of the Endeavour rim rocks. The Burns formation super-group composed of rocks located closer to Endeavour crater becomes a sub-group within the Shoemaker super-group after SO3 is removed and compositions normalized to 100%. The basaltic and olivine-phyric shergottites, and the clinopyroxenites (nakhlites) cluster near, but separately from, the Endeavour rim rocks. When SO3 is included in the cluster analysis these six martian meteorites cluster closer to the rest of the Endeavour rim rocks than both of the Burns formation super-groups. Bounce Rock, found outside of Eagle crater, does not cluster with other Mars surface rocks but does pair with shergottite EETA 79001 B. The lherzolitic shergottites, orthopyroxenite, and dunite are the most dissimilar rocks included in the study and form a loose cluster away from the other groups.

Values highlighted yellow are highly similar and low enough to be in the same sub-group; values highlighted in green are moderately similar, and values highlighted in orange are weakly similar and permit classification within the same super-group.  lherzolitic and basaltic shergottites is driven by differences in SiO2. NWA 7475/7034 and its pairs have been interpreted as the first surface samples identified in the martian meteorite collection [11]. NWA 7475/7034 is the only martian meteorite in this study that clusters within the Endeavour rim rocks. With SO3 included in the cluster analysis NWA 7475/7034 groups with Marquette, a basaltic erratic [8], and both of these cluster within a super-group of several Matijevic Hill formation rocks. Tickbush, an Endeavour rim float rock, is an outlier of this super-group cluster. When SO3 is removed, the Marquette and Matijevic relationships remain, but Tickbush is further removed from the super-group. Similarity Index (SI): The HC analysis provides a rapid way to sort large quantities of data but does not allow us to manipulate how each attribute affects the similarity, and groupings do not necessarily represent compositional relationships. In order to quantify the compositional similarity between any two cases we calculate the χ2 value, an error-weighted sum of the squares of differences in oxide concentrations between two compositions:                                          Where Ai represents the oxide weight percent of oxide i in composition A, Bi represents the oxide weight percent of oxide of i in composition B, and the second parenthetical term represents the weighting factor assigned to oxide i based on analytical (statistical, mainly precision) uncertainty (un). We use this χ2 value as an index of similarity.   Lower SI values indicate greater similarity, and two identical compositions would have a χ2 value of zero; multiple measurements on the same target typically result in an SI value of 2-7. Targets within the same sub-group have a typical SI of <250, whereas targets within a super-group tend to have SI values <900. The index can be used as follows: scores between 0-300 are considered to be highly related, scores of 300-600 are moderately related, and scores 600-900, weakly related.  The similarity between rocks analyzed by Opportunity is expressed by the SI values between their average compositions (Fig. 2). The highly similar value of the Burns average to the rest of the Endeavour rim rocks results from removal of SO3, which accounts for up to 29 wt% of Burns formation RAT-grind rock compositions. The average soil is highly similar to all of the Endeavour rim rocks. Bounce Rock has a highly similar value with EETA 79001 B, which indicates a connection to this specific shergottite basalt. NWA 7475/7034 is highly similar to Matijevic Hill and Shoemaker average rocks (SI = 63 & 150), which is significant in that NWA is a brecciated martian surface rock (regolith breccia) [11]. NWA 7475/7034 is also weakly similar to the basaltic shergottites. The other martian meteorites become increasingly dissimilar in the same pattern as observed in the cluster analysis.  In summary, we find that HC analysis provides a first cut at broad relationships, but the SI is key to evaluating the error-weighted similarity between rock compositions and is a rapid means for finding highsimilarity matches and quantitative comparisons. We use these methods on full compositions as well as SO3- and Cl-free compositions to test for possible prealteration protolith relationships.
