These bodies of liquids seem to be limited to the polar regions (colder and supposedly more humid) [2]. While the existence of liquid methane oceans in the surface of Titan was presumed a long time before the Cassini-Huygens mission, the chemical composition of Titan's lakes is still not well known. The VIMS instrument aboard Cassini orbiter detected ethane signatures in correlation with Ontario Lacus lake [3]. The detection of methane in Titan's liquid surfaces is very difficult due to the strong absorption bands of gaseous CH4 existing in the atmosphere of Titan and the similarity between infrared spectra of liquid and gaseous methane. Most studies aiming to determine the composition of Titan's lakes used theoretical modelling to determine this composition. Different theoretical approaches result in important discrepancies in the predicted CH4-C2H6 proportions in the equilibrium between Titan's atmosphere and surface [4] [5]. Moreover, Titan's lakes are recipients of organic products of the atmospheric photochemistry. Here also, models predicted different dissolution percentages. The need for more constraining studies of the chemical composition of Titan's lakes led to the development of a new cryogenic test bed at JPL. This experimental setup will also provide a 10 Liter volume of liquid hydrocarbons to test the operation of hardware in Titan's lakes conditions.    Experimental setup:  In order to simulate Titan's surface liquids, we have developed a new experimental platform named Titan Lakes Simulation System (TiLSS) that is designed to study the composition of Titan's lakes in equilibrium with the atmosphere. In this setup a variety of hydrocarbon mixtures (primarily methane, ethane, and propane) can be prepared in the gas phase, and condensed under Titan-simulated conditions (1.5 bar nitrogen pressure, 90-92 K). This experimental setup will also provide a 10 Liter volume of liquid hydrocarbons to test the operation of hardware under Titan lake conditions.   Figure 1 presents a schematic drawing of the Titan chamber facility. It consists of a large "bell jar" high vacuum chamber that contains a stainless steel Pressure Vessel. This Pressure Vessel plays the role of the condenser for hydrocarbons. The bell jar is pumped out using a Varian turbomolecular pump to a pressure as low as 10-6 torr. Temperatures relevant to Titan's surface are reproduced using a closed-cycle helium cryostat (Cryomech AL63) and liquid nitrogen flowing through a cooling plate affixed in the bottom flange of the vessel. Feedthroughs in the top flange of the pressure vessel allow the injection of gaseous N2 to pressurize the chamber to 1.5 bar pressure relevant to Titan's surface and to introduce hydrocarbons into the condenser. To analyze the chemical composition of liquid hydrocarbons, a solenoid valve allows for sampling the liquid and sending it to a SRI Gas Chromatograph (GC). A separate line allows to measure the composition of the gas in the headspace with the SRI GC as well. Figure 2 shows a photograph of TiLSS system.

The gas chromatograph has also been tested with pure nitrogen. Figure 3 shows the GC spectra of N2 directly from the cylinder and through the Pressure Vessel. This test demonstrate that no discernible contamination occured when the gas passed through TiLSS system.

Applications:  In addition to the experimental measurement of the chemical composition of the liquidvapor equilibrium of a hydrocarbon mixture under Titan lake conditions, the experimental setup described here allows many other science applications. As example, the system can be used to measure the infrared spectra of mixtures of hydrocarbons and study the influence of the presence of several compounds on the infrared signatures of methane, ethane and propane. These results may prove useful for quantitative interpretation of VIMS spectra of lakes. Another key application of this chamber regards instruments and component development, and technology maturation. Indeed, no facility to date is available for reproducing the environment of Titan's lakes with large enough volume to allow testing entire instruments and large components. This chamber is available to the community, and can be used to this end, in preparation of future instruments and missions to Titan.  Conclusion: An experimental setup has been designed and developed at JPL to synthesis Titan lake analogues. The main goal of this experimental platform is to better constrain theoretical modelling of chemical composition of Titan lakes. The facilty will provide an unique large volume of liquid hydrocarbons that can be used as a test bed for instruments functioning in such environement.
