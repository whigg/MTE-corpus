UNDERSTANDING THE SPACE WEATHERING OF THE NONICE MATERIAL ON EUROPA.  C.A. Hibbitts1, C. Paranicas1, 1JHU-APL, 11100 Johns Hopkins Rd., Laurel, Md., 20723.; karl.hibbitts@jhuapl.edu; chris.paranicas@jhuapl.edu;   Introduction:  The surface of Europa is covered by amorphous water ice and a hydrated nonice material [1,2] that are both constantly bombarded by plasma in the Jovian magnetosphere.  The nonice material is either primordial or may be a product of chemical processing of implanted Ionian sulfur ions from the Jovian magnetosphere [e.g. 3].  Understanding the relative abundance and origins of the acids or hydrates in the nonice material is arguably one of the central themes in the debate about endo and exogenic origins of the material, with a salt composition favoring an endogenic origin and an acid-dominated composition favoring an exogenic origin resulting from the irradiation of ices [1,3]. The nonice material even if of an endogenic origin will have been subsequently weathered by bombarding particles that were trapped in the Jovian magnetosphere.  Discussion: While much is known about the environment of Europa and there is a basic understanding of the composition and distribution of the nonice material over its surface (Figure 1), the understanding of how the Europan environment alters and weathers the nonice material on its surface is less mature. The infrared spectral characteristics of analogous nonice hydrated materials at these temperatures informs us that the material on Europa is likely a sulfate or sulfuric acid with chemically bound waters of hydration containing cations of  Mg, Ca, and/or Na [e.g. 1, 4]. At Europa's surface temperature of 80K to 130K, the hydrated nonice material will likely be thermally stable over the lifetime of the solar system, thus, unlike more volatile water ice, irradiation effects such as amorphization may be 'locked in' the nonice material if maintained at ambient Europa temperatures and can provide a history of exposure. Europa is tidally locked rotating once for every revolution around Jupiter so plasma always dominantly strikes the trailing hemisphere.  The plasma distribution is also affected by factors such as Europa's position in the Jovian magnetosphere that, for instance, modifies the strength of the magnetic induction, Alfven wing currents, and other sources of flux variability (e.g., injections) [5,6] and (Figure 2). This spatial distribution in the intensity, energy, and composition of the charged particles bombarding Europa's surface will be important factors in the rate of space weathering of the nonice material on the surface.   In addition, micrometeroid gardening mixes the upper centimeters of the surface burying weathered and altered material while exposing both fresh material and previous altered material [e.g. 7].  Other processes, such as energetic ion sputtering, can also redistribute molecules on the surface but in a more gradual way.   In a simple picture, Iogenic grains that reach Europa's orbit would impact Europa's leading hemisphere, to primarily garden it, whereas the electrons and plasma are primarily bombarding the trailing hemisphere.  Charged nanograins from Io probably impact the trailing and grains from other sources further complicate the picture.  In this environment, the space weathering of the hydrated nonice material on Europa will likely be varied and complex. For instance, bombardment of the trailing hemisphere is considered the source of the UV S=O stain on the trailing hemisphere [8] and as the source for the sulfuric acid hydrate [e.g. 3].  Plasma bombardment will also likely result in chemical reactions to cause various crystal defects in and sputtering of the nonice material. The relative rate of sputtering at different locations on the surface has been studied [9] and may be correlated with the exposure of deeper layers and their related constituents.  Ion bombardment is more effective than electrons in momentum transfer processes, such as sputtering, and thus may cause  Figure 1. A possible signature of space weathering.

weakly bound components of the nonice minerals to be liberated thus explaining the non-oxygen components, such as Na, that have been detected in the exosphere [10].  If the nonice material is depleted in Na due to this weathering process, the reflectance spectrum of the material could change accordingly [11].  Additionally, while ion bombardment will sputter and destroy mineral crystallographic structure, reducing the strength of molecular and lattice vibrational bands and the intensity of crystal field bands, the bombardment by primary and secondary electron bombardment will induce chemical reactions. If present, the irradiation of organics in the presence of water molecules, such as associated with the hydrated nonice material itself, has been shown to potentially enable a plethora of reaction pathways producing a large number of simple to complex organic compounds [e.g. 12] and will have spectral signatures distinct from the nonice hydrated material [13].  Recent experiments bombarding NaCl with electrons also demonstrate the formation of color centers at visible wavelengths [14]. Implications for Europa: Space weathering of the nonice material on Europa can be expected to 'age' the surface through physical damage and chemical reactions that can form new compounds, with unique spectral signatures, or simply alter the visible color of the nonice material in the NUV through IR. For instance, the production of nanophase iron hypothesized by R. Clark to increase the visible/near UV reflectance of the surfaces of the icy Saturn satellites due to Rayleigh scattering may occur on Europa as well. The position of the water-related absorption features near 1.5 and 2 Âµm may vary based upon local radiation environment and exposure age of the surface as the composition of the nonice material ages, due to hydration effects, preferential atomic sputtering, as well as to the amorphization of the nonice material.  The irradiation of organics in the nonice materials on Europa's surface can produce CO2 and other products through a variety of pathways.  For instance, irradiation by O ions could produce CO2 and other volatiles, and be responsible for the CO2 detected there [e.g. 9,10], or the irradiation of the surface by electrons could produce chemical reaction between organics present and the water molecules in the hydrated nonice materials resulting in CO2 and other products.  Additionally, irradiation of any carbonate in the nonice material can be another pathway for producing CO2.  One may expect as a result of the irradiation of the nonice material on Europa, that a large variety of products will be formed with a great number of spectral signatures.
