The first recognition of natural compounds exhibiting deviations from the TFL were made in the analysis of Calcium Aluminum rich Inclusions (CAIs) within the Allende meteorite whose oxygen isotopic composition was found to define a line of approximately slope 1 in a δ17O vs. δ18O plot (4).  It is now believed, based on the recent measurements and analysis of the isotopic composition of solar wind O, that the distribution of oxygen isotopes in the solar system define a massindependent pattern of slope ~ 1.  The origins of this distribution remains largely unexplained [2].  The exception to the rule that physical-chemical processes produce mass-dependent isotopic fractionations was discovered by Thiemens and Heidenreich, who showed that the non-equilibrium process of ozone formation in the laboratory ( O2 + O + M → O3 + M) produces mass-independent isotopic fractionations with a slope ≃ 1 [3].  Since then, only a handful of other non-equilibrium chemical processes such as the photoreduction of Hg, the formation of the peroxy radical , the photolysis of SO2, and photodissociation of CO have been shown to produce MIF, leading to the widespread assumption that MIF isotopic signals are strongly conserved in natural mass-dependent processes.  MIF in multi-isotopic systems are now widely used to understand atmospheric photochemical reaction networks, the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere, and the history of  oxygen  and sulfur in terrestrial atmospheres including Mars, and the cycling of Hg in the environment [1]. Large oxygen isotopic fractionations with non-terrestrial triple-isotope trend-lines observed in the VUV photolysis of CO [4] and the gasphase formation of SiO2 [5] have also been reported as having potential implications for understanding the mass-independent distribution of oxygen isotopes in the solar system [5].   Here we report experimental observations of very large, seemingly mass-independent oxygen isotopic fractionations produced from the gas-phase diffusion of H2O. We find, surprisingly, that the large MIFs observed are readily explained by the mass-dependent diffusion of water vapor.  Experimental:  Our observations of large isotopic fractionations with mass-independent character were made using a stainless steel vacuum line apparatus consisting of both 1/2 inch diameter stainless steel tube connected via valves and 1/4 inch tubing to a Picarro L2120-i cavity ring-down (CRD) isotopic spectrometer capable of simultaneous quantification of the δ17O, δ18O, and δD compositions of water vapor samples (16). The vacuum line also comes equipped with a turbomolecular pumping station and is connected to a source of ultra-high purity (UHP) N2 that acts as a carrier gas and source of pressure (See Figure 1).  Figure 1.  Stainless Steel experimental apparatus used for diffusion experiments with H2O vapor.  Figure from ref. [6].  Water vapor samples of known isotopic composition were introduced into the vacuum line apparatus using a procedure we describe in [6].  This procedure allowed us to collect H2O vapor with reproducible and known isotopic compositions and allowed us to perform the 1D diffusion experiments described below.  Diffusion Experiments.  First, a section of our stainless steel line, between valves V1 and V2 was used to store the H2O vapor mixed with ambient air.  The volume separating this reservoir volume from the inlet of the H2O isotopic CRD instrument was pumped out to a pressure of < 1×10−5 Torr and was then filled with UHP N2 to  pressure 760 Torr.  Once this occurs, a valve (V2) separating the vacuum line section with H2O vapor and the Picarro L2120-i CRD instrument is opened. In general we observed a time lag of about 5  minutes before the water vapor concentrations begin to increase above background and display the massindependent  "anomalous" isotopic fractionations we report here. 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 02 4x 104 time(s)[H 2O (p pm v) ]0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 −1000 01000 time(s) δ1 8 O 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 −2000 02000 time(s) δ1 7 O 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 −500 0500 time(s) δD Figure 2.  Isotopic composition of water wapor pulses vs. time.  Note the large fractionations associated with the front end of the pulses.   The leading edge of the pulses are color coded (blue,green, red).   We used a Picarro L2120-i CRD spectrometer to quantify the concentrations of H216O , H217O, and H218O vs. time [7].  We quantified the multi-isotopic content (δ17O, δ18O, δD) of water vapor using the standard δ notation.       Results:   We observed significant isotopic fractionations in δ17O, δ18O, δD associated with the leading edge of water vapor plumes arriving at the CRD water vapor isotopic spectrometer.   When we first observed these plumes and associated isotopic fractionations as part of our work  measuring the isotopic composition of astrophysical water samples, we were quite surprised at the magnitude of the isotopic fractionations (See Figure 2).  This pattern appears to be consistent across several different experimental conditions.  What was even more surprising was our observation that, when plotted on a triple-oxygen isotope plot, the isotopic composition of the leading edge of these plumes was distinctly mass-independent. Diffusion Modeling: We developed 1,2, and 3-D diffusion models of the diffusion of water vapor within the experimental apparatus.  We considered possible mass-independent wall-water molecule interactions but found the potential well-depths to be insufficient to account for the magnitudes of the mass-independent fractionations.  Instead, we modeled the diffusion of water vapor as a random walk with effective massdependent diffusion constants for each of the isotopomers.  The relationship between the diffusion constant of one isotopomer (D1) to another (D2) was given by:  D1/D2= (m2/m1)β.  This basic relationship, together with solutions to the diffusion equation was sufficient to account for the major features of our isotopic data.  The model data plotted in Figure 3 is for a 1-D diffusion model, but we emphasize that 2-D and 3-D solutions give similar results.  More details on this modeling are given in ref[6].  −1000 −800 −600 −400 −200 0 200 −1200 −1000 −800 −600 −400 −200 0200 18O 17 O  Pulse 1 Pulse 2 Pulse 3 TFL (m=1/2) m=1 Diffusion Model Figure 3 Triple-isotope plot of the isotopic composition of water pulses shown in Figure 2.  In addition, the results of a mass-dependent plume diffusion model (cyan)of the experiments is also shown.  Discussion:     Much effort has been placed on understanding the origins of mass-independently fractionated reservoirs in the early-solar system in a variety of elements (O, S, Hg, etc.).  To our knowledge, this is the first experimental and theoretical evidence that mass-dependent diffusive processes can produce substantial mass independent fractionations.  While it is not clear whether plume diffusion processes like the one we describe here could have produced the CCAM line that characterizes the distribution of oxygen isotopes in the solar system, our results and explanation do suggest that the photochemical origins for modest and small MIF signatures in sulfur, for example, need to be carefully re-examined and assessed for the potential influence of plume induced MIF [8].   Careful attention needs to be placed to overall mass-balance to rule out the influence of plume diffusion induced MIF.  References: [1] M. H. Thiemens et. al, Ann. Rev. of P.
