INITIAL 87Sr/86Sr CHRONOLOGY IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM.  D. A. Papanastassiou1,2 and J. H. Chen2, 1Science Div., Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Caltech, M/S 183-335, 4800 Oak Grove Dr., Pasadena, CA 91109 (dap@jpl.nasa.gov), 2GPS Div., Caltech, MC 170-25, Pasadena, CA 91125 (jchen@gps.caltech.edu).  With the introduction of high precision mass spectrometry through the introduction of programmable magnetic field control and digital data acquisition and processing [1], it was recognized that small variations in initial 87Sr/86Sr, could define a high resolution relative chronology for the chemical fractionation and separation of low Rb/Sr materials from parent reservoirs with high Rb/Sr, such as the solar nebula and chondrites [2,3]. For the determination of a primitive 87Sr/86Sr chronology, it is important to search for samples with extremely low Rb/Sr for which the correction for in situ 87Rb decay is extremely small and essentially independent of the age of the sample or the age of its disturbance. For primitive initial 87Sr/86Sr, the ultimate goal is extremely low measured values of 87Sr/86Sr, below the reference value BABI [2]. The purpose of this work is to determine with current state-of-the-art precision, the 87Sr/86Sr and 84Sr/88Sr ratios in the Allende D7 CAI (USNM 3898) and in Angra dos Reis. This CAI yielded the most primitive measured value of 87Sr/86Sr and was defined as ALL = -3.0 ± 0.3 εu [4], below the BABI value [2]. It is important to recognize that all isotope ratio mass spectrometers, under the best conditions (e. g., in the absence of mass interferences) can determine high precision isotope ratios but not absolute ratios. An illuminating anecdote (until now): when we were to receive the Finnigan 262, at Caltech, we received a call from Dr. Habfast: this is a very well behaved, high precision instrument but it yields, for the NIST 987 SRM (Standard Reference Material) 0.71028, not 0.71025; do you want us to fix? The “fix” would have consisted of taking apart the collectors (and electron repellers), reassembling, and testing. Dismanlting and reassembling, in the hope of obtaining the “correct” ratio did not appear useful. We accepted the instrument and it operated extremely well, for the express purpose of obtaining very precise data. We note that the Lunatic I had a Faraday cup which was completely shielded from stray secondary electrons. The improved precision was due to a fast electrometer (Applied Physics, Cary 36), larger duty cycle by fast B-field switching and digitization of the electrometer output. Multiple cup mass spectrometers permit a much higher duty cycle and eliminate the uncertainties from any instabilities in the ion beams. Still, the only way to compare data between different laboratories and instruments is through the use of standard solutions such as the NIST 987 SRM.   Hans et al. [5] obtained high precision measurements for 84Sr in Allende inclusions. They found essentially a uniform excess in CAI of the p-process 84Sr, at the level of 1.2 εu, based on normalization for mass dependent fractionation to 86Sr/88Sr = 0.1194. These workers also considered the case that the effects in 84Sr/88Sr might be due to the process of normalization for isotope fractionation, whereby, samples with an excess of 88Sr, would appear to have an excess in 84Sr. Such an excess in 88Sr would have the same magnitude and sign as the 84Sr effects. A sample with an excess in 88Sr of 1.2 εu, normalized to 86Sr/88Sr = 0.1194, would also result in an apparent deficit in 87Sr/86Sr of 0.6 εu. It was hypothesized [5] that the primitive measured 87Sr/86Sr in CAI USNM 3898 (labelled ALL [4]) may not have been an indicator of primitive 87Sr, but an artifact from an 88Sr excess. To “erase” the difference between the 87Sr/86Sr BABI and ALL values of 3.0±0.3 εu, one would need a heretofore unseen 84Sr excess, even in FUN inclusions [6] (translatable to an 88Sr excess) of 6 εu. Hans et al. [5] allowed for such a high 84Sr excess in USNM 3898, by claiming that “no precise 84Sr data are available for this CAI”. For this claim, they missed a publication [6] on FUN 84Sr, which provided a measurement of 84Sr/88Sr in USNM 3898 of -4 ± 2 εu. The hypothesized value for an excess in 84Sr of +6.0 εu is not supported, by the data in [6]. The interlaboratory calibration for 87Sr/86Sr was discussed in detail in last year’s abstract [7]. We have initiated measurements of 87Sr/86Sr and 84Sr/86Sr, using the Triton, at JPL. We report data on NIST 987, on Moore Co. plagioclase, and on Angra dos Reis. Moore Co. plag was used as a standard (cf [8]. For Angra dos Reis cf [9]. An analysis of seawater Sr was obtained, because in the earlier work, in the Lunatic Asylum, seawater was used as the reproducibility standard. We have delayed measurements on USNM 3898, because of the very small amount of available material. We expect data on that CAI to be presented at the conference.  Sr measurements on the Lunatic I, on single, oxidized Ta filaments were routine. For well understood reasons (by us), the use of Ta single filaments is not optimal for the Triton, because the filaments are significantly shorter and they are heated by a DC currentregulated power supply, which would result in hot spots on Ta oxidized filaments as the Ta2O5 slowly decomposes at Sr-running, filament temperatures. The use of fine Ta2O5 powder, as we used for Ti measurements [10] has not been investigated carefully, for this work. The sample filaments in the Lunatic I were heated by a square-wave, voltage-regulated power supply, through an isolation transformer. 2650.pdf

For the Triton, we used a dual configuration data collection scheme (Main Configuration: cups L1:86Sr, C:87Sr, H1:88Sr; and Configuration 1: L1:84Sr, C:85Rb, H1:86Sr. Instrumental fractionation was determined from the Main Configuration steps, using 86Sr/88Sr = 0.1194, and applied to 87Sr/86Sr and to 84Sr/86Sr (from Configuration 1). The data are presented in the Table. The data show excellent reproducibility for 87Sr/86Sr for NIST 987 and good precision for 84Sr/86Sr, in part because not all data were obtained at high ion beam currents (for 84Sr). The 87Sr/86Sr for seawater, using the Triton, is 199 ppm higher than for the Lunatic I. This difference is not unexpected, based on the NIST 987. The measured value for 87Sr/86Sr for Angra dos Reis is lower by 1.65 εu than the measured value for Moore County plag and for Angra dos Reis pyroxene. Given the very similar and very low values for 87Rb/86Sr, for these samples, we confirm the more primitive 87Sr/86Sr of Angra dos Reis, relative to Moore Co. and BABI. The extrapolation to initial 87Sr/86Sr values is uncertain depending on potential disturbed systematics, as discussed earlier [11, 12]. However, we do not concur with the conclusion [5] that the difference between BABI and ADOR is close to zero.  The key measurement will be on CAI USNM 3898 (D7), which is in progress, very carefully, given the very small amount of material tracing its heritage to the samples analyzed in 1973, by Gray et al.
