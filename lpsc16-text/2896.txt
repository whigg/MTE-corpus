Introduction:  The "Comanche" outcrops investigated by the Spirit rover in the Columbia Hills of Gusev crater (Fig. 1) were shown to be rich in a Mg-Fe carbonate (16-34 wt%) inferred to result from volcanic hydrothermal activity [1]. Subsequent work demonstrated that a mixture of Mg- and Fe-rich carbonates provide a better fit to spectra from the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES) than a single solid solution Mg-Fe carbonate [2]. This is consistent with evaporative precipitation of lowtemperature, near-surface solutions derived from limited water-rock interaction with rocks equivalent to nearby outcrops called Algonquin Class. It was suggested that multiple carbonate phases arose through evaporative precipitation of brines from an ephemeral lake in Gusev that infiltrated Algonquin-like outcrops, perhaps episodically [2]. Cryogenic precipitation is an alternative mechanism [3]. We now find supporting evidence for a distribution of carbonate phases based on laboratory thermal infrared (TIR) spectra of samples from Spitsbergen, Norway. The spectral characteristics of the Mg- and Fe-carbonate coatings on these basalt samples strongly resemble those of Comanche carbonates.  Figure 1. Pancam approximate true color image of the largest Comanche outcrop (~10 m across). Spitsbergen Samples:  Carbonate-cemented and coated basalt breccia samples were collected from breccia pipes or vents on Sverrefjell and Siggurdfjell volcanos on the island of Spitsbergen in the Svalbard archipelago (Norway) as a part of the AMASE project [4]. The carbonates occur as varying amounts of magnesite (MgCO3), siderite (FeCO3), and minor dolomite (CaMg(CO3)2) [5]. We measured the unprepared surfaces of two such samples using a laboratory thermal emission spectrometer at ASU. These samples have a botryoidal coating with rusty red, tan, and white layers (outer to inner surface) totaling ~1 mm in thickness over black vesicular basalt (Fig. 2). !" #" Figure 2. Two samples of basaltic breccia from Spitsbergen, Norway displaying multi-colored, botryoidal carbonate coating. Results:  One of the two samples is dominated by a tan-colored layer that spectrally is most consistent with magnesite, although with a convex shape in the region between ~7-10 µm that is unusual (Fig. 3). The other sample is dominated by a red layer, which spectrally does not match a single carbonate phase. The !2 feature is notably broader than that of typical carbonates, which display a very sharp feature in this position (Fig. 3). A third spectrum was acquired on a portion of the redder sample that includes all three colors of coating plus some of the basalt substrate. It resembles a hybrid of the other two spectra except in the region of the lattice vibrational mode at long wavelengths (Fig. 3). Figure 4 presents a comparison between a Comanche Mini-TES spectrum (target "Saupitty") and a simple 50:50 mixture of the Spitsbergen mixed-area spectrum and an average of six Mini-TES spectra of Algonquin Class outcrops. The latter are the olivine-rich tephra deposits immediately adjacent to the Comanche outcrops shown to be the likely host rock of the carbonate alteration [2]. The Comanche spectrum has a broadened !2 feature and convex shape in the region between ~7-10 µm that resemble those attributes of the Spitsbergen spectrum. When combined with the Al gonquin spectrum, much of the Comanche spectrum is relatively well fit with just these two components.  !"#$%&'(#")*%+,"'-.*+ /*%$%&'(#")*%+,"'-.*+ 0(1*%+"2*"+&3+,"'-.*+ 45+46+ 78+ Figure 3.

Comanche Mini-TES spectrum (red) is relatively well modeled (black) with the two components shown in green and blue. Note that the green spectrum is the same as the green one in Fig. 3 but has been resampled to Mini-TES resolution; also the X-axis is truncated compared to Fig. 3.  Discussion: Although the Mg- and Fe-rich carbonates from the Spitsbergen breccia contribute to an impressive spectral fit to the Comanche carbonates, this does not necessarily imply a common origin. The origin of the Spitsbergen carbonate coatings is enigmatic, but probably is related to sub-glacial volcanism [5]. These coatings do not have an obvious counterpart within the Comanche outcrops, where Spirit's Microscopic Imager (MI) showed angular tephra clasts surrounded by lighter-toned matrix that presumably hosts the carbonates (Fig. 5) [2]. However, in both cases the the basaltic host materials appear essentially unaltered by the carbonate-bearing solutions. So the concept of these solutions infiltrating a permeable host rock and undergoing chemical changes as different carbonate phases precipitate is probably common to both. Previous spectral modeling of Comanche required an amorphous component of basaltic composition to produce the best fit [1; 2]. We need to revisit this result based on our new measurements of Spitsbergen carbonates, which display distinctive spectral characteristics that could impact the modeled components in a more comprehensive spectral deconvolution analysis.  !"##" Figure 5.

Conclusions: The TIR spectral features of Mg- and Fe-rich carbonate coatings on basaltic breccia from Spitsbergen, Norway are in some cases distinct from those of carbonate spectra used previously to model the Mg-Fe carbonate-rich Comanche outcrops. These distinctive features are in family with features of the Comanche spectra and help support the idea that the Comanche outcrops host a mixture Mg- and Fe-rich carbonate phases rather than a single solid solution phase. Evaporative precipitation of mixed cation carbonate-bearing solutions is one way of producing discrete carbonate phases, as has been suggested for the Comanche carbonates [2].
