Osmundsen1, 1NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA 23681, m.n.abedin@nasa.gov, arthur.t.bradley@nasa.gov, 2University of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI 96822, anupam@hawaii.edu, shiv@hawaii.edu.  Raman spectroscopy is a powerful technic that can easily identify water, water containing minerals, minerals, biominerals, organic molecules, and biomarkers, which are important to find evidence for past life on Mars and other planets [1,2]. Micro-Raman systems are capable of performing fine-scale mineralogy; but these are used for in situ analysis. Most of the micro-Raman systems are designed and implemented for dark room operation [3,4]. These Raman systems have the following characteristics (1) they require sample collection and (2) require shielding of daylight background radiation. The use of continuous wave (CW) lasers and non-time gating detection approach, it is also difficult to distinguish the biofluorescence from the mineral fluorescence. These limitations will significantly lower the science return from these micro-Raman systems in terms of variety of samples that can be analyzed on Mars. NASA Langley Research Center in collaboration with the University of Hawaii is developing an innovative “Standoff UltraCompact Raman” (SUCR) instrument which uses pulsed time gated Raman technology capable of operating in daylight. This provides a superior micro-Raman instrument for future NASA missions. With a short working distance of several centimeters, a high power laser and a large collection optics/lens are not needed that reduce the size and weight of the SUCR instrument. A preliminary block diagram design of SUCR instrument is shown in Figure 1. This consists of a transmitter and a spectrograph. The key components of this transmitter and spectrograph are an Nd: YAG laser from Big Sky Laser to transmit at 532nm with a total laser energy of 23 mJ with a repetition rate of 20 Hz. Laser beam transmits through 532-nm dichroic to the target surface. The backscatter signals are received by the collection optics and pass to the spectrograph through 532-nm notch filter and a slit. A super notch filter (532 nm) is used to reflect or block the 532 nm laser line from the wave trains. The Raman signals pass through focusing optics and a Langley-built compact grating spectrograph to an Intensified ChargeCoupled Device (ICCD) camera. This ICCD camera detects signal in the 534 nm to 700 nm spectral range through spectrograph, which provides the fingerprint of the molecules.   To evaluate the performance of the system, the Raman spectra of naphthalene, sulfur, marble, and fluorescence spectra of ruby were measured. In this abstract, we report standoff spectra of Ruby and naphthalene using the above-mentioned spectrometer at a distance of 20 centimeter as shown in Figs. 2 and 3. The high frequency (600 – 700 nm or, 2000 - 4500 cm-1) spectra are shown in Figs. 2 and 3b; and low frequency (0 - 2500 cm-1) spectra are shown in Figures 3a, respectively. Fig. 2 shows the fluorescence spectra of Ruby using CW mode and the strongest fluorescence bands are produced by the Cr3+ fluorescence R1 and R2 doublet. The doublet has a very strong and sharp lines at 692.8 nm and 694 nm [6]. A broad band in the 653 – 676 nm of the ruby is easily distinguishable. The Raman spectra of naphthalene in Figs. 3a and 3b are measured and the characteristic features are due to the vibrational modes of naphthalene sample. Again, the sharp and narrow Raman fingerprints are detected at 760.7, 1018, 1382, 1085.pdf

1465, and 1575 cm-1 for low frequency and 3057 cm-1 for high frequency regions [7]. In conclusion, we have discussed the limitations of the traditional micro-Raman systems. We have presented results of fluorescence spectra of Ruby and Raman spectra of naphthalene samples within a 20-cm distance using newly developed standoff ultra-compact Raman system. It becomes obvious that there is a need for the development of a greater sensitivity and faster equipment for NASA exploration programs. We acknowledge two graduate students, Jonathan Baker from Virginia Tech and Julia DeMarines from Hampton University, for their assistances in developing the spectrometer.
