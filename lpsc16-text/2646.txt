A diurnally modulating pattern has been detected in the Moon's neutron leakage flux that is occurring at global scales [1-3]. Two leading explanations suggest the source is attributable to diurnally varying surface hydration [1,3] or regolith temperature [2]. In this study we investigate diurnally varying neutron flux measurements from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter's (LRO) Lunar Exploration Neutron Detector's Collimated Sensor for Epithermal Neutrons (LEND CSETN) and surface temperature observations from the Diviner radiometer poleward of >±45° [4-6]. Our presentation shows that the modulating neutron flux is not consistent with a regolith temperature control for latitudes >70°. The anticorrelation may be evidence for transported lunar hydrogen volatiles or highly non-uniform regolith compositional dynamics. Results show regolith temperature may be the source of the neutron flux modulation in the northern mare (45° to 60°) and may be related to its mafic composition and fast neutron contributions. Predictions for hypothesized regolith temperature effects are evaluated using insolation inferred from the Lunar Observing Laser Altimeter (LOLA) topography [7]. Background: Several observational studies have concluded that surface hydration is enhanced near the Moon's dawn terminator. Initial evidence from Chandraayan-1's Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3), Deep Impact and Cassini's Visual Infrared Mapping Spectrometer suggested that loosely bound hydrogenbearing volatiles, including water (H2O) and/or hydroxyl (OH-), shifted during the lunar day to less illuminated, sloped surfaces and towards higher latitudes [8-10]. An enhanced absorbtion was detected in early morning hours in the 3µm band associated with concentrations H2O and OH- was detected [6]. Subsequent M3 studies found hydrogen volatile concentrations to be increasing with latitude and diurnally persistent above ±60°. Ultra-violet measurements from the Lyman-Alpha Mapping Project (LAMP) also show micron-depth detections of hydrogen volatiles [11]. Both the IR and UV hydrogen detections remain quantitatively inconclusive as they may be degraded by photometric and temperature effects, do not explore the depth of hydrated materials, are less reliable at polar latitudes and not measured at night [10]. More recently an enhancement in hydrogen volatiles in the exosphere over the equatorial dawn was observed by the Neutral Mass Spectrometer (NMS) aboard the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) [12].  In this study we use neutron evidence that is sensitive to depths up to a meter and is not degraded by photometric effects but may have a small correlation to temperature [13]. We show that neutron and surface temperature measured in the upper-latitudes is inconsistent with causing the observed neutron flux modulation, which may indicate the possibility of hydrogen volatile transport.  Methods:  Hypothesis: If regolith temperature is the sole cause of the diurnally modulating neutron flux then the amplitude of diurnal modulation should be greatest towards equator-facing sloped surfaces where diurnal temperature variation is the highest. To test this possibility we correlate mapped observations from the LEND CSETN and Diviner instruments as a function of solar local time and insolation. Insolation is characterized by the range of topographic slope and slope aspect between poleward and equator facing sloped conditions (PFS and EFS, respectively). Twenty four maps are produced, each containing observations made within i±3 hours of SLT, where i is an hour of the lunar day. Each LEND count rate and temperature map >75° latitude is completely averaged into an insolation grid, defined as a two dimensional data structure. Grid bins sequence the range of insolation conditions present in topographic slope θ and slope aspect ϕ. Grids are twenty degrees of slope θ in 1° increments and eighteen bins of slope aspect ϕ in 10° increments.  Figure 1 illustrates the results in the diurnal series of grids for the north and south latitude Diviner and LEND CSETN data. Figure 2 shows the correlation of the slope aspect diurnal amplitudes with the neutron flux and temperature profiles. Amplitudes are derived by fitting the slope aspect profiles using the Fourier transform and taking the Fourier inverse of each profiles' 24-hour wavelength. The power p in the slope aspect profile modulation is proportional to its amplitude squaried, p ∝ A2.     Results:  Figure 1 (top two rows) shows the clear correlation of the Diviner north (N) and south (S) results to insolation in the grid series.  Low surface 2646.pdf

temperatures at midnight SLT: 0 are illustrated as dark increases in morning hours. The maximum thermal contrast is observed at local noon SLT: 11 between EFS (maximum temps) and PFS conditions. Temperatures decrease through afternoon hours to complete the diurnal cycle. LEND CSETN grids (bottom two rows) show little flux contrast at midnight but do show an enhanced suppression in the flux on pole-facing slopes in post dawn hours SLT: 7-9. A six-hour SLT lag in the peak of the neutron flux is observed as compared to the noon SLT temperature peak. In particular there is no buildup of flux levels towards EFS as observed for Diviner. Figure 2 shows the statistically significant anti-correlation of diurnal amplitudes for Diviner temperature profiles vs. LEND CSETN profiles.      Conclusions:   LEND CSETN epithermal neutron data are anti-correlated with surface temperature amplitudes for the Moon's upper-latitudes, >70°. The anti-correlation and maximum neutron suppression at dawn may be a sign of either hydrogen-bearing volatile transport towards PFS or a sign of complex regolith subsurface compositional effects that may vary with insolation. A positive correlation between the diurnally modulating neutron flux and regolith temperature is found solely in the northern mare region, 45° to 60°N and is consistent with conclusions in [2]. For lower latitude highlands terrain there is no consistent insolation dependence observed in the topography to explain the diurnally modulating neutron flux.    References: [1] Livengood et al.

Diviner shows the buildup of temperature towards EFS at local noon (red). LEND CSETN shows no corresponding EFS flux increase.  Flux minima in blue at dawn SLT: 7-9 towards PFS may be consistent with diurnally transient accumulations of volatiles. Diurnal slope aspect profiles are a function of ϕ only.  Figure 2: A statistically significant anti-correlation between the slope aspect diurnal amplitudes of surface temperature and neutron count-rate profiles demonstrates that the effect is not consistent with the regolith temperature hypothesis. Temperature amplitude is along the x-axis).  Temperature amplitudes increase systematically by insolation from PFS (left) to EFS at right. The 24-hour wavelength is used to fit the slope-aspect profiles (nonsinusoidal) and derive amplitudes.  If regolith temperature is modulating the neutron flux, the correlation should be positive. Error bars are in units of ±1σ of the residual error distribution. 2646.pdf
