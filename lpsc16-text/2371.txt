Recently, the Mars ScienceLaboratory’s (MSL) Rover Environmental MonitoringStation’s (REMS) measurements of the near-surface environmental conditions were found to suggest that deliquescence of Ca(ClO4)2 is possible on the surface andshallow subsurface [3], which was a surprise as this process was thought to only be possible polewards of 60◦[4]. Brines produced in this manner have been observednot to effloresce until much lower relative humidities ofERH ∼ 3% [2], allowing for transitions into hydratedphases such as Ca(ClO4)2·8H2O and Ca(ClO4)2·4H2Owhile a liquid is present. Re-transitioning to the anhydrous phase is difficult since it requires relative humidities approaching zero.MSL’s Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons (DAN) instrument has detected a subsurface layer∼ 17 cm deep withan increase in water equivalent hydrogen, indicative ofa hydrated region [3]. The temperature (T ) and relativehumidity (RH) inferred at this depth from REMS wouldallow for hydrated phases of Ca(ClO4)2. Because of thedampening of T and RH at this depth, which is belowthe diurnal skin-depth (∼5 cm), transitions to the anhydrous phase are not expected. A permanently hydratedlayer may then be produced. However, hydrated phasesare kinetically easier to produce if the system passesthrough a liquid phase first. Here we use experimentalconstraints [2] and thermal modeling [5] to simulate thebehavior of Ca(ClO4)2 in the subsurface of Gale craterto test if the system deliquesces and transitions into ahydrated phase before it dehydrates into the anhydrous.Methods: Atmosphere-regolith water vapor transport is simulated by coupling a heat and mass transfermodel [5] with REMS in-situ humidity measurementsas a boundary condition for the surface. We assumean albedo of 0.2, and a thermal inertia of ∼300 J m−2K−1 s−1/2, which are parameters relevant to sandy terrains of Gale crater [6]. The surface boundary condition is radiative and includes direct illumination, alongwith scattering and thermal emission atmospheric components [7, 8, 9]. Water vapor diffusion through the regolith, which has been shown to be approximately Fickian [10] and undergo diffusion advection [11], followsJDA =ϕτµ(DH2O/CO2PRTdγdz+ JDA), (1)where ϕ=0.5 [12] and τ=2 [13, 14], are porosity and tortuosity respectively, µ is the ratio between the molecularweights of H2O and CO2, and DH2O/CO2 is the diffusivity of water vapor through CO2 gas, which is modeled as temperature dependent with nominal values onthe order of 10−4 m2 s−1 [15, 16], P is air pressure, Ris the ideal gas constant, and γ is the water vapor mixingratio. The instantaneous γ at a given depth z and time tis found by,dγdt= DH2O/CO2d2γdz2+(µRTP)ξ, (2)where ξ is a reaction term that includes phase changes.Results: We simulate thermal diffusion to a depthof 4 m with an element thickness of 0.01 m and timestep of 370 s. Several martian years are simulated untilthe temperature profile at the vernal equinox from theprevious year is nearly identical to that of the currentsimulation, at which point convergence is reached.Figure 1: Phase diagram for calcium perchlorate includingthe simulated diurnal cycle (green) for Ls 141◦ at 15 cm. Theblack line is the solidus, blue is DRH, and red is ERH. Thearrows indicate the progression for morning to evening.In Fig. 1, the diurnal profile at 15 cm deep is plotted against the phase diagram of Ca(ClO4)2 at Ls 141◦.On this sol, deliquescence occurs near 1400 LST. Thisis in contrast to the expected morning and late eveninghours from [3], which is due to the thermal diffusion2371.pdf

An aqueous solution remains until 1900LST when the ambient conditions induce efflorescence.For the next few sols, the minimumRH ∼2%, thereforethe hydrate is not expected to transition to anhydrous.In general, we find that deliquescence of calcium perchlorate is possible to depths of 40 cm, assuming the saltis present (Fig. 2). Our results suggest thatRH near 0%may occur for depths above∼ 10 cm and so formed hydrates could revert to anhydrous. The minimum annualRH at depths near 15 cm, though, does not permit dehydration; therefore, a permanently hydrated layer mayform. Of note, these results are best suited for sandy terrains traversed by the rover with thermal inertias closeto ∼300 J m−2 K−1 s−1/2 such as Rocknest and DingoGap [6].Conclusions: We address the DAN inferred subsurface “wet” layer at Gale crater, Mars [3] by simulatingthe behavior of calcium perchlorate, a likely componentof the regolith [1], using a coupled heat and mass transfer model [5] along with experimental constraints [2].Our results suggest that deliquescence of Ca(ClO4)2may be possible to depths of 40 cm, assuming the saltis present. At depth, the formed brine remains stablefor much longer periods and experiences water activities ranging from 0.3 . aw . 0.6, while at shallowdepths (< 5 cm) more constrained activities are onlypossible, typically 0.4 . aw . 0.6.The environmental conditions while the brine ispresent may permit for the transition into hydratedphases at depths below 5 cm; however, RH fordepths above ∼15 cm permits the re-formation of theanhydrous phase. Therefore at depths near the DANinferred hydration region (∼ 17 cm), our results suggestRH does not reach 0%, inhibiting dehydration of thehydrated salt phases.Our results combined with DAN and REMS observations imply that a subsurface “wet” layer at Gale cratermay be formed ∼15 cm deep by hydrated salts, whichare produced during deliquescence. Additionally, wepropose that deliquescence-induced hydration of subsurface minerals on Mars may act as an active sink foratmospheric water vapor.Acknowledgements: This material is based uponwork supported by the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration under Grant No. NNX15AM42G issuedthrough the Mars Data Analysis Program.References: [1] D.
