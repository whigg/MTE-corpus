Young1, 1UCLA EP&SS Dept. 595 Charles E young Dr. East, Los Angeles, 90095 (ikohl@epss.ucla.edu, eyoung@epss.ucla.edu)  Introduction:  High-precision triple-oxygen isotope analysis of O2 (Δ′17O) acquired by laserfluorination are among the best diagnostic tools applied to extraterrestrial rock samples. Using oxygen isotopes and differences among whole rock and mineral separate samples has enriched our understanding of the processes leading to planet formation in the early solar system. Shortcomings of Laser Flourination:  We have identified two principle sources of systematic errors when collecting high-precision fluorination data for Δ′17O. One is the difficulty in removing adsorbed water and the other is the presence of trace amounts of NF3. Here we compare our procedures and tests for the effects of these two sources of error with those of previous studies. In brief, we demonstrate the efficacy of our procedures for eliminating adsorbed H2O and residual NF3 at the ppm level using experiments and a novel mass spectrometer.  Mass Interference Due to NF3: All of the highprecision fluorination studies of triple-oxygen isotopes are done by reacting samples with F2 or BrF5 in a vacuum system. Because N2 is always present at some level in vacuum lines, trace quantities of NF3 form as a byproduct during the fluorination process. In the electron impact sources of the mass spectrometers used to measure the oxygen isotope ratios NF3+ fragments to NF2+ and NF+, with NF2+ being the dominant species. NF+ is a mass spectrometric isobar for 33O2+ (i.e., 17O16O+ + 16O17O+) and if present in ppm or greater quantities can artificially increase the Δ′17O of the sample O2.  No previously published studies comparing extraterrestrial rocks with terrestrial rocks have presented clear evidence that their analyses were free of ppm levels of NF+ interfering with 33O2+. Until recently it has been commonplace to report that NF2+ at m/z = 52 was not “detected”. However, we would like to emphasize that lack of detectable NF2+ is not a priori evidence for lack of interference by NF+ at the ppm level. As an example, Rumble et al. [1] showed that in their laboratory the ratio of Δ′17O effect to NF2+ ion current  on a 3x1011 Ω resistor on the Faraday-cup amplifier is 16.5 ‰/V. Similar values are reported by Pack et al. [2]. We infer that the search for NF2+ in the earlier study by Weichert et al. was made under the same conditions as it was done in the same laboratory [3]. Scaling these results for a 10 ppm effect on Δʹ17O, the NF2+ ion current required for detection of a 10 ppm contribution to a measured Δʹ17O would be 0.01/4.95×1012 = 2×10−15 amps (or 0.6 mV).  Such small ion currents are not detectable with Faraday collectors used on normal gas-source isotope ratio mass spectrometers.  Experiments Demonstrating Removal of NF3: We use three experiments to demonstrate that NF+ due to fragmentation from NF3+ is not affecting our results: (1) double distillation of O2 liberated from SC olivine in which we applied our cleanup procedure twice to search for a difference in measured Δ′17O values; (2) analysis of O2 liberated by fluorination of SC olivine without our usual purification procedure in order to demonstrate the efficacy of the Panorama mass spectrometer for resolving NF+ from O2+; and (3) additional analyses of a lunar sample with the highmassresolution Panorama instrument.  We found no difference between results using our usual analytical procedure and those from the doubledistillation experiment, suggesting that NF3 is eliminated during our normal purification procedures (Figure 1).   Figure 1: Summary of results for experiments outlined above. The hashed line indicates Δ′17O=0 with a slope of 0.528 realtive to SC Ol.  We analyzed a sample known to have significant NF+ interference with the Panorama gas-source mass spectrometer.  This instrument has more than sufficient mass resolution to reliably resolve NF+ (33.001473 amu) from 33O2+ (32.994050 amu). The latter two species define an m/Δm of 4,450 where m is molecular mass, implying that an instrumental m/Δm (mass resolving power) of at least ~12,000 is required for clear separation. The Panorama routinely runs with an m/Δm NF+ effect H2O effect Panorama and Delta give same ∆'17O   2775.pdf

of 60,000. An example of the separation achievable between these species is shown in Figure 2. We fluorinated SC olivine and collected the O2 without the usual purification by distillation on two molecular sieves. Results for analyses of this gas using the conventional Delta instrument where NF+ and 33O2+ are not resolved, and with the Panorama, where they are resolved, are clearly different (Figure 1).   Figure 2: Panorama mass scan over the 33O2+ peaks for sample and reference gases showing the position of NF+ (dashed line) if it were detectable. The scan shows that 33O2+ and NF+ are resolved when measurements are made at the center of the 33O2+ ion beams. Inset shows the full width of the beams at larger scale.  The anomalously high Δ′17O value of 37 +/− 5 ppm for the conventional mass spectrometric analysis suggests that NF+ was present in the sample. The lack of this anomalously high Δ′17O value for the Panorama analysis of the same gas, with a Δ′17O value of 2 +/− 5 ppm, indicates that the source of the high value was indeed NF+ interference on 33O2+.  We used the instrument to demonstrate further that NF3 is not an explanation for our finding that Δ′17O for Earth and Moon are indistinguishable (see abstract, this volume). For this purpose we performed replicate analyses of a single sample of Apollo 17 high-Ti basalt (70215) both on the Panorama mass spectrometer at high mass resolution and at low mass resolution using the conventional Delta instrument.  Results show no difference between the data obtained using the two instruments. Adsorbed Water: Because SC olivine has lower Δ′17O values than terrestrial waters by ~ 80 to 100 ppm [4, 5], spuriously high Δ′17O values can result if adsorbed water remains in fluorination samples. Most laboratories remove water and other contaminants using “pre-fluorination” in which the sample is exposed to F2 or BrF5 gas prior to heating with the infrared laser. Our experience is that oven drying and prefluorination alone are not adequate for very high precision Δ′17O determinations. Instead, we have found that an infrared-lamp heating step is necessary for complete removal of the effects of water.  Experiments on the Effects of Water: In order to demonstrate the effects of lingering adsorbed water on Δ′17O measurements, we analyzed a sample of Mauna Loa basalt powder without our infrared heating step and compared the Δ′17O values with those obtained with the infrared heating step.  For this experiment we powdered a fragment of Mauna Loa basalt. A fraction of the powder of Mauna Loa basalt was set out on the lab bench in an unsealed plastic container for two months. Two aliquots of the “wet” powder were loaded directly into the fluorination chamber under N2 purge gas and pumped over night. After pre-fluorination, the samples were analyzed by CO2 laser heating in the usual way. As a control experiment, five fractions of the same Mauna Loa basalt powder were subjected to oven drying prior to loading followed by infrared-lamp heating until the baseline pressure was < 10-6 mbar following our usual procedures. The wet basalt powders subjected to prefluorination but not infrared-lamp heating have an average Δ′17O value of + 9 +/− 2 ppm while the dry samples subjected to prefluorination following infraredlamp heating have an average Δ′17O value of -2 +/− 1 ppm (Figure 1).  Oven-drying of three aliquots of lunar sample 70215.380 resulted in 10% weight loss, corresponding to a fraction of oxygen present as water of 0.166.  The effect of this water on measured Δ′17O values if not removed is 0.166 (+80 ppm) + (1.000−0.166)(0 ppm) = 13.3 ppm based on a water Δ′17O value of ~ +80 ppm (which could be conservative) relative to SC olivine. From this we conclude that if sufficient steps are not taken to remove adsorbed water, especially for powders, Δ′17O values can be too high by 10 ppm or more. This is similar to the recently measured difference between Earth and Moon reported by Herwartz et al. [6].   References:[1] Rumble, D. et al., (1997) Geochimica Et Cosmochimica Acta 61, 4229-4234.
