The Dawn ScienceTeam is conducting a geologic mapping campaign forCeres similar to that done for Vesta [1,2], including production of a Survey- and High Altitude Mapping Orbit(HAMO)-based global map, and a series of 15 Low Altitude Mapping Orbit (LAMO)-based quadrangle maps.In this abstract we discuss the geologic evolution of theAc-H-08 Nawish Quadrangle, located between -22◦ and22◦ North and from 144 to 216◦ East. The quadrangle’sname comes from the crater Nawish which is located inthe northern sector of the quadrangle. The currently approved IAU nomenclature includes four features whichare described in table 1.Mapping Data At the time of this writing LAMO images (35 m/pixel) are just becoming available. Thus,our geologic maps are based on HAMO images (140m/pixel) and Survey (400 m/pixel) digital terrain models (for topographic information). Dawn Framing Camera (FC) color images are also used to provide contextfor map unit identification.

The cratered materials have been divided incratered plains (cp) and cratered highlands (ch) on thebasis of their topography. The north-western sector ofthe quadrangle shows units related to the 125 km diameter Dantu crater of the Ac-H-3 quadrangle [3], with darkand brigth albedo crater rays system. The craters showa very diverse morphology across the study area. Thelargest crater of the quadrangle is Kumitoga of 95 km diameter, highly degraded and without ejecta blanket, located at 178.6◦E and 10.1◦S. The 75 km diameter Nawish crater gives the name to the quadrangle and shows aflat bottom and a central pit of 8 km in diameter, whichis consistent with other craters of Ceres with a diameterhigher than 75 km [4]. Heneb crater (Figure 1a) showsbrigth spots on the floor and terraced walls in its SW andNE sector. In the western part of the quadrangle there is adark-albedo unnamed crater (Figure 1b) with very steepand fresh walls showing a very high horizontal albedovariation in the southern part.Future Work The upcoming Low Altitude MappingOrbit (LAMO) data represent the higher spatial resolution data we will receive from the Dawn mission thusthey will be used to put constraints in the current mapping work. Color filter data analysis of FC will be used toextract the main compositional variation across the quadrangle, and to address VIR mineralogic analyses [5] overspecific targets.References [1] Williams D.A. et al.
