These deposits are mainly composed of a thick and translucent layer of CO2 polycristalline ice (or 'slab') with a small contamination of water ice and dust. The major mechanism involved to form this layer is expected to be the direct condensation of CO2 gas at the surface. CO2 snowfalls have been detected [1, 2, 3], but they are expected to contribute only marginally: 10% of the total seasonal deposits. Furthermore, fast metamorphism of CO2 snow has been demonstrated [4] and within 100 days, a snow layer composed of small grains (10 µm) would be completely metamorphosed into a slab.  However, it is hard to detect direct condensation of CO2 ice at the surface, since this phenomenon mainly occurs during the polar night, when visible and NIR remote sensing techniques are no more relevant. Still, here we show that it is possible to observe this phenomenum ahead of the polar night, during autumn, within a few degres of longitude. For that purpose we used OMEGA data, revealing that CO2 ice condenses as far as 8° of latitude ahead of the polar night during autumn.   Search procedure: The following criteria were used to select OMEGA (Observatoire pour la Minéralogie, l'Eau, les Glaces et l'Activité) cubes that potentially recorded that early condensation stage:   - cubes that are located either in the north or in the south hemisphere between 55° of latitude and the poles (the polar night limit is ± 66° of latitude). - all the cubes that have been acquired between the automn equinox and the winter solstice both for the northern and southern hemisphere. During this period, the polar night is progressing. This corresponds to an Ls interval ranging between Ls = 180°-270° for the northern hemisphere and Ls = 0°-90° for the southern hemisphere. - Among all of the corresponding cubes, the cubes that contained a CO2 ice signature were selected. The CO2 ice signature was evidenced with a band criterion defined by [5], sensitive to the band depth at 1.43 µm of CO2 ice. 60 OMEGA cubes satisfy these criteria for the northern hemisphere and 6 cubes for the southern hemisphere. Only 2 of them exhibit a positive signature of CO2 ice at 1.43 µm: cubes 278_0 and 294_0. Since the CO2 signature retrieved on cube 278_0 is the strongest,  it was selected for this study. Description of the observation:  The cube 278_0 has been acquired at Ls=15.73°. It is located in a zone between 64°S-13°E and 81°S-2°W, in the vicinity of the visible south polar cap border. The altitude of the Mars Express spacecraft at that time was 2772 km which gives a resolution at the surface of 3.3 km. Observation parameters vary in this frame: incidence angle between 72.8 and 90°, emergence angle between 0.68 and 1.74° and phase angle between 71.73 and 90°. By the time of the acquisition, the polar night was located at the latitude 83.4°. The observation has been corrected from atmospheric absorption with the method described in [6].   Figure 1: Albedo (reflectance factor at 1.08 µm), CO2 ice band depth at 1.43 and H2O ice band depth at 1.5 µm for OMEGA observation 278_0. The red squared box on the central image indicates the ROI chosen for the extraction of the spectrum on Fig. 2. Only central part of the image is displayed.       Evidence for CO2 slab ice:  Fig. 1 represents the albedo (reflectance factor at 1.08 µm), the 1.43 µm band depth for CO2 ice and the 1.5 µm band depth for H2O ice calculated on the OMEGA cube (only a portion of the cube is represented). The albedo undergoes no significant variation over the scene, as well as the  water ice band depth which is almost absent in the spectra. The CO2 ice band depth however shows positive values. We selected a region of interest (ROI) represented by the red square on the 1.43 µm band depth image. Spectra of this zone have been averaged and the resulting spectrum is displayed on Fig. 2.  The 1.43 µm band is clear and deep. The 2 µm absorption and the bands at 2.29 µm and 2.35 µm also indicate the presence of CO2 ice. The average reflectance level of the spectrum is low (0.3). This indicates that the grains of CO2 are massive, and the CO2 layer thin enough not to mask the underneath dust. The presence of CO2 snow is ruled out: the reflectance level would be much higher and the absorption bands much smaller. Quantitative values (surface coverage, thickness of the slab) have been retrieved with radiative transfer modeling.   Figure 2: Spectrum extracted from the ROI depicted on Fig. 1 corrected from atmospheric absorption (black) and its best fit calculated in the sense of the least squares (red). Radiative transfert modeling: Libraries of synthetic spectra are generated with the radiative transfer model SPECTRIMAG [7]. H2O and CO2 ices optical constants were taken from [8, 9, 10]. For Martian dust, n and k values were calculated with the Skuratov method on a dust spectrum sampled at the top of the cube [11]. The ROI spectrum was compared to each of the synthetic spectra and the best fit was chosen by minimizing a parameter 𝜙 in terms of the least square method :  𝜙 𝑠!, 𝑠! = Σ!𝜔!(𝑠! ! − 𝑠! !)! Σ!𝜔! 𝑠!! and 𝑠!! correspond respectively to the reflectance factor at wavelength 𝜆 of the ROI spectrum and of the synthetic spectrum. Weights (𝜔!) account for the imperfect atmospheric correction in the range 1.85 - 2.15 µm where we set 𝜔! = 0. The best fit obtained is displayed in Fig. 2. It is obtained with the following parameters : a 6 mm thick slab of CO2 ice covers 90% of the dusty surface (40 µm grains) of the area depicted in Fig. 1. The best fit exclude water to contaminate the slab. The rugosity (probability density function of facets orientation) of the slab is 10° and scattering is considered isotropic. The fit is particularly good between 1 and 1.9 µm. At 2 µm, the imperfect atmospheric correction is visible and the (over-)corrected observation differs from the calculated absorption band for CO2 ice. Lower reflectance values for the synthetic spectrum between 2.1 and 2.5 µm may be due to aerosols diffusion not taken into account in the atmospheric correction. The thickness obtained is consistent with the amount of CO2 ice condensation given by climate models [12, 13]. The Mars Climate Database gives 11 mm of slab ice condensed at the same Ls for this region. Conclusion and future work:  The major way for CO2 gas to be deposited on the surface is direct condensation from the atmosphere. This process leads to the creation of a thick layer of polycrystalline ice. This condensation starts early in the autumn and can preceed the polar night limit by 8° of  latitude. Experimental work is under way to validate this observation : direct CO2 ice condensation from gas on a mineral surface is simulated with the CarboN-IR cell at IPAG. This condensation is monitored morphologically to asses the CO2 ice grains microphysical properties of condensation and is spectrally monitored with a spectrogonio-radiometer [14] to directly compare with orbital data.
