Introduction: The possibility of OH/H2O formation in the lunar surface has been supposed to the interaction between the proton from solar wind and the oxygen in the regolith[1-3]. In this paper, five different grains i.e. olivine, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, plagioclase, and glass have been experimented by H+ bombardment to simulate the process of solar wind implantation. The ion implantation was used 7 keV H+ at the fluences of 1017 ions/cm2 in same implanted condition.  Compared with the characteristics of OH/H2O in the samples before and after ion implantation through infrared spectrometer, OH/H2O has formed only in the olivine, orthopyroxene, and plagioclase samples after ion implantation. The content and form of the new water are different in these samples. The increased OH content about 3500 cm-1 in olivine after ion implantation is 53 ppm. The increased -OH in olivine may be formed in silica tetrahedron[4]. The estimated new OH content about 3518 cm-1 in orthopyroxene after ion implantation is 9 ppm. The OH and H2O increased obvious about 3622 cm-1 and 3356 cm-1 in plagioclase after ion implantation, and the increased contents are 941 ppm and 794 ppm respectively. The result shows that the formation of OH/H2O by implanted by lunar solar wind is associated with the type of lunar grains.    References:  [1] Clark R. N. (2009) Science, 326, 562-564.
