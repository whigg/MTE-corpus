Introduction:  Constructing of lunar geological map is essential to understand the formation of lunar crust, the volcanic history, and the mixing of the lunar surface. Recently, Moon’s big data have been provided by new lunar explorers such as Japanese lunar explorer ”Kaguya (SELENE)”, and the data provides many new pictures (e.g. [1,2]). The geological map is made by combining various kinds of data, which are reflectance, topography, formation age and so on. However, it is almost impossible to make a global geological map based on the big data by hand work only without any computing techniques. We have started a project to make a new geological map of the entire Moon based on new data as topography, mineral and chemical composition obtained by Kaguya. We already reported a preliminary analysis of Multiband Imager (MI) using ISODATA [3] of unsupervised classification method [4] and showed a possibility of automatic classification for surface spectra on the entire Moon with very huge data set.  For the next step, we classified the data of Spectral Profiler (SP) onboard Kaguya using ISODATA. SP has more number of bands (296) than that of MI (8) and its data has precise information of reflectance spectrum on the lunar surface. This report presents analytical procedure and preliminary result of automatic classification of lunar reflectance spectra.  Data:  The SP observed lunar reflectance with 296 bands in the wavelength range of 510 to 2600 nm with footprint of 500 m�500 m. In this work, the SP data of 160 bands between 510 and 1600 nm was averaged pixel by pixel of 0.5 deg. �0.5 deg., called as SPCube Depth. The SP-Cube Depth was also removed a continuous part from each reflectance spectrum, which is a spectrum of absorption depth.  In addition, we used TiO2 abundance in weight percent obtained by MI [5] to classify mare region because of poor sensitivity for Ti at 450 nm in SPCube Depth. TiO2 is one of important parameters indicating character of source magma of mare basalts. Analysis and Result:  Analysis procedure is shown in Fig. 1. The SP-Cube Depth is divided into 66 classes conclusively.  Removing anomaly data : Absorption depth is defined as the ratio of the original spectrum with the tangent. Therefore, bands around a point of contact are removed from this analysis because almost pixels have a constant value nearly 1.   Fig. 2 Depth spectra before and after RXD adopting. Top: original spectrum, Bottom: spectrum after anomaly removal. Both plots are averaged the entire Moon and upper and lower lines show maximum and minimum values of each band.  Some pixels have irregular spectra due to mechanical errors and/or condition of sun light angle and so on, as corresponding to an averaged spectrum of the entire Moon. These pixels appeared often as a line along to revolution series of the spacecraft. For detecting these anomaly pixels, RXD (Reed-Xiaoli Detector) algorithm [6] was adopted. When RXD index exceeds 1000, those pixels are recognized as anomaly pixels that are 0.5 % in total. Figure 2 shows spectra before and after RXD adopting.  0.60.70.80.91.01.1600 800 1000 1200 1400 16000.60.70.80.91.01.1absorption depthbefore anomaly removalafter anomaly removalwave length (nm)SP-Cube Depth (160 bands)   SP-Cube Depth (150 bands)      without anomaly data   7 classes of SP-Cube Depth   19 classes of SP-Cube Depth   66 classes of SP-Cube Depth Removing anomaly data K-means classification TiO2 division for mare                        and Boundary ISODATA classification Fig. 1 Data and analysis procedure of automatic classification of lunar reflectance depth spectrum 1390.pdf

makotomakotomakotomakotomakotomakotomakotomakotoK-means for large scale classification.  K-means as unsupervised classification was adopted to the entire Moon, to reduce calculation time for ISODATA.  Here,  the  Moon  was  classified  into 7 sections by K-means. These sections seems to be basically divided by depth in the wavelength range of 900 to 1100 nm as shown in Fig. 4. The deepest spectrum corresponds with almost maria in the nearside excepting eastern maria (red in Figs. 3 and 4), the second one is mainly SPA (green), the third is maria around red region, eastern maria in the nearside and small maria in the farside (blue), the fourth is mainly boundary region between maria/SPA and highland, and some area in Mare Tranqutatis (yellow), the fifth is crater ejecta in highland such as Tycho and Giordano Bruno -Necho and regions in high latitude (cyan), and the sixth and the shallowest spectrum corresponds with nearside (light purple) and farside highland (deep purple). TiO2 dividing for maria and boundary class.  TiO2 is one of incompatible elements and important for mare characteristics. For instance, Apollo basaltic samples were classified by TiO2 abundance. Referring to this study, red and blue classes as maria and yellow class as boundary were divided into 5 classes, based on TiO2 abundance given by MI. In this step, the entire Moon was divided into 19 classes in total.  ISODATA for each class classification.  Each of 19 classes was classified by ISODATA. ISODATA is an unsupervised classification method that is similar to Kmeans, but we do not need to know number of classes. Consequently, the Moon was classified into 66 classes: 39 classes for maria, 8 classes for SPA, 6 classes for boundary, 8 classes for ejecta and high latitude, 5 clas- ses for highland. The classifications in Aristarchus region and SPA region are good agreement with those using manual procedure by  an  author (MO).  These regions are known to have complex unit due to impacts. This agreement indicates that the presented method provides relevant classification for the entire Moon.  References: [1] Ohtake M., et al., (2009) Nature, 461, 236–240.
