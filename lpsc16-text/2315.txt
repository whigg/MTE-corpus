Introduction:  The bulk compositions of most calcium-aluminum inclusions (CAIs) record the cumulative effects of multiple high-temperature and largely volatility-controlled processes during the first 12 million years of solar system history [1]. CAI 3N from the Northwest Africa (NWA) 3118 CV3 carbonaceous chondrite is a unique ~2 cm-sized compound object, primarily a forsterite-bearing type B (FoB) CAI, that encloses at least 26 smaller CAIs of different types, including compact type A (CTA), B, C, and an ultrarefractory inclusion [2, 3]. 3N originated either as an aggregate of many smaller CAIs (mostly types A, B, C) plus accreted Fo-bearing material (resembling an amoeboid olivine aggregate) which experienced partial melting of the whole; or else as a FoB melt droplet that collided with and trapped many smaller solid CAIs. Relative to typical type A and B CAIs found elsewhere, the bulk compositions of the A and B CAIs within 3N more closely match the bulk compositions predicted by equilibrium condensation of a gas of solar composition. Being trapped within the FoB host-CAI may have protected them from melt evaporation that affected most "standalone" CAIs. Therefore the unique 3N CAI contains possibly the most pristine types of refractory material, and their bulk composions are very important for the investigation of CAI vaporization processes.  Here we present results on thermodynamic calculations of vaporization of several pristine CAIs enclosed in the 3N host CAI and discuss the trends obtained for composition changes of their residual melts crystallized after vaporization.         Results: For calculations of the residual melts changes obtained at a constant temperature of 2300 K from vaporization of several enclosed CAIs, we used the semi-empirical model of thermodynamic codes developed by [4, 5]. This model is based on the theory of associated solutions and experimental data of component activities in the molten oxide systems CaOMgO-FeO-Al2O3-TiO2-SiO2, found by the Knudsen mass spectrometric effusion method in the temperature range of 1600-2500 K. The original chemical compositions of several enclosed 3N CAIs (3N-1, 3N-6, 3N-7, 3N-12 and 3N-20) and the host 3N material are represented in Table 1 [3]. These compositions have different contents of the main oxides (CaO, MgO, Al2O3, SiO2 and TiO2, FeO), and variable ratios between them. In texture and mineralogy the host CAI 3N corresponds to Fo-bearing Type B; the CAIs 3N-1, 3N6 and 3N-12 belong to Type B; and CAI 3N-20 is Type A.  During CAI melt evaporation, FeO, MgO, and SiO2 evaporate rapidly from the melt in this sequence. The most refractory Al2O3 content in the residual molten material increases. CaO also evaporates rapidly, unless TiO2 is present in which case CaO is retained due to its affinity with TiO2 (perovskite compositional affinity). Despite variations in the CAIs' initial melt compositions (Table. 1), there is a certain general similarity in the change of the ratio of the most refractory components (CaO and Al2O3) in the residual melts during evaporation. The oxygen content in the gas phase above the evaporating melts is significant and increases almost identically for all of the melts from 37 to 55 mol. % [6]. Oxygen content in the gas also depends on the initial ratios of the Al2O3 and TiO2 contents in the melt, Al/Ti ratios: 3N-20 (8.3), 3N-Host (12.3), 3N-1 (17.3), 3N-12 (18.4), 3N-6 (19.7), 3N-7 (23.0). The observed differences in the gas phase above the evaporated melts reveal the outsized role of TiO2, which is a minor component in the initial melt.      Discussion: Based on the model results, we calculated composition change trends for CAIs crystallized from residual melts after evaporation and plotted them on a Ca2SiO4-Al2O3-Mg2SiO4 diagram (Fig. 1). All trends finally lead to CAI compositions corresponding to a Ca-aluminate binary system after FeO, MgO, SiO2 vaporization from the melts. However, at various points along these trends the CAIs could have different compositions - from known Types A and B, to hibonite-rich inclusions including transitional fields. If we vaporize the 3N host, 3N-1 and 3N-12, we obtain CAIs of Type B, A, and intermediate compositions between Type A and B. Vaporization of 3N-6 CAI material leads to the approximate composition of the hibonite-rich CAIs. It is interesting to note that CAI 3N-6 is more enriched in Al2O3 and depleted in SiO2 compared to other enclosed CAIs from CAI 3N, and a high concentration of Al2O3 affects the final compositional trend. Vaporizing 3N-7, we obtain hibonite-rich inclusions and unusual CAI compositions that do not match any known types of CAIs. However, the composition of 3N-7 could not be pristine because Type C CAIs by themselves could be a result of modification of previous material [7]. Vaporization of 3N-20 (Type    A) leads to a composition field that is characterized by an above-solar Ca/Al ratio. This probably depends on the high initial content of CaO and the special role of TiO2 in the evaporation process.  References: [1] MacPherson G. J.
