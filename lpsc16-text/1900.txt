Introduction: In China's Chang'E-1/2 (CE-1/2) microwave radiometer images, a class of young fresh craters was identified as "cold spot", of which brightness temperatures (TBs) in crater interior and ejecta at nighttime are on average ~9 K lower than the surrounding region [1, 2]. In contrast, in near-infrared image observed by Diviner radiometer, TBs of these craters are ~11 K higher than their background [3]. Considering the difference in penetration depth, the behaviors of cold spot craters at microwave and infrared bands probably reflect depth-dependent thermal properties of the ejecta and the surrounding region. However, there is almost no systematical study on the distribution characteristic and formation mechanism of these cold spot craters, which are crucial for understanding the emplacement of the materials during an impact cratering event and later modification of the ejecta.  Distribution of Cold Spot Craters: In this study, CE-2 microwave radiometer data at 37.0 GHz were used. The observed TB at 37.0 GHz mainly depends on physical temperature and dielectric permittivity from the surface to a depth of <0.5 m. Since cold spot craters are most prominent at midnight, we selected only those observed at local time of 2300-0100. Since physical temperature decreases with latitude, the observed TB was normalized with latitude (𝜑) using the best fit (cos!.!"𝜑) of all the observations. To avoid the nonuniform distribution of local time, the TB was further normalized with longitude (𝜆) using longitude variation of TB as 215.2 − 0.024𝜆. The normalized 37.0 GHz TB image at midnight for region within latitude between 60°N and 60°S is shown in Fig. 1. The most prominent features in Fig. 1 are blue circular regions, where TBs are several to ~30 K lower than their surrounding regions. The extension of the cold spot is ~2-10 times the diameter. Using a threshold value of 0 K between the cold spot region and the background, we totally identified 75 cold spot craters over regions with latitude between 60°N and 60°S. Population of cold spot craters over highlands is ~3 times as that over maria region.  As an example, Fig. 2a shows the TB for Aristarchus (23.7°N, 47.5°W; 40 km). TB in the cold spot region is ~20 K lower than background at midnight. Using the TiO2 abundance, the dielectric permittivities of the cold spot and background regions were calculated to be 2.2+i0.007 [4]. The difference in dielectric permittivity is too small to result in a 20 K difference in TB. Careful examination in the highresolution optical image shows that there are abundant meter-scale surface rocks in the cold spot region, and that almost no rocks occur in the background region (Figs. 3b-d). Since bulk density and thermal conductivity of rocks are much larger than those of the fine-grained regolith, we suspect that it is rocks within the ejecta that result in the cold spot in the TB map.  Models and Results: To verify our speculation, a rock-regolith mixture model is proposed for the cold spot region, whereas a fine-grained regolith layer is used for the rock-free background region. We first resolve the one-dimensional heat transfer equation to obtain the temperature (T) profile as a function of depth [5]. We then use a microwave thermal emission model for a semi-infinite regolith with temperature and dielectric profiles to calculate TB [2]. Bulk density and thermal conductivity of fine-grained regolith are taken from Vasavada et al. [6], and thermal capacity is taken from Ledlow et al. [7]. Bulk density and thermal diffusivity of rocks are taken as 2.95 g/cm3 and 1/(31.4+0.378T), respectively [8]. The effective bulk density and thermal capacity for a mixture of fine-grained regolith and rock are taken as the weighted average of the two endmembers, and the effective thermal conductivity is calculated using Maxwell's mixture approach [9].  To avoid problems in the absolute calibration in the microwave TB [10], we compare the TB difference (∆TB) between the cold spot and the background regions. Fig. 3 shows the comparison between model predicted ∆TB and the observed ∆TB for Aristarchus, Jackson and Petavius B, where the fractional volumes of rocks were taken as 0.2 and 0.25. As can be seen, there is a good correlation between the modeled and measured ∆TBs if volume fraction of rocks is 0.2, suggesting that the presence of rocks primarily caused the TB anomalies.  During an impact cratering event, materials at depth are excavated and then fall back, forming an ejecta blanket surrounding the crater. Since thermal inertia of lunar rocks is about hundred of times larger than that of fine-grained regolith, the presence of rocks within the ejecta can significantly reduce the temperature gradient. As a result, physical tempera ture is higher at the surface, and becomes much lower at depth that is comparable to the penetration depth of 37 GHz. This can further reduce thermal emission from the lunar surface, producing the cold spot region in microwave TB maps. In contrast, surface temperature is higher for region with a large rock population, causing the hot spot in Diviner thermal infrared maps.   Conclusions: In this study, global distribution characteristic and formation mechanism of lunar cold spot craters were investigated. Our preliminary results show that population of cold spot craters over lunar highlands is about 3 times larger than that over the maria region. Thermal emission model suggests that the cold spot is most probably caused by the presence of rocks within the continuous ejecta of the craters. This provides valuable information on the properties of lunar surface as well as in understanding the fragmentation and emplacement of materials during an impact cratering event.
