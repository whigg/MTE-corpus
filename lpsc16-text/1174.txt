DID THE ORIENTALE IMPACT MELT SHEET UNDERGO LARGE-SCALE IGNEOUS DIFFERENTIATION BY CRYSTAL SETTLING? J. P. Cassanelli1, J. W. Head1, 1Brown University Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences, Providence, RI 02912 USA (James_Cassanelli@Brown.edu).   Introduction: Lessons learned from exploration of the Moon, and the analysis of returned samples, have served as the foundation for our understanding of the formation of terrestrial planetary crusts. Specifically, information gathered from the Moon has allowed for the development of the magma ocean hypothesis for crustal formation [e.g. 1-4], suggesting that the earliest crust of a terrestrial body is crystallized [e.g. 5] directly from an initially molten state (in which a significant portion, or possibly all, of the body was in a liquid state [3]). Crystallization of the lunar magma ocean and formation of the primary crust has been followed by over 4 Gyr [6] of surface modification processes, predominantly in the form of impacts. Impacts are a powerful erosive agent, modifying the primary crust through fracturing, brecciation, physical mixing, and through shock-induced melting. The shock-induced melting caused by large impact events (e.g. those producing a crater ~300 km in dimater or greater; [7]) is predicted to generate significant volumes of melt [8]. Given the concentration of large impacts distributed across the surface of the Moon, up to ~5% of the Moon’s crust may now be comprised of impact melt products [7]. Despite the potentially significant contribution of impact melt to the crustal composition of the Moon, the processes involved in impact melt sheet cooling and crystallization are not well understood. After an impact event, melt would collect in the excavated crater and undergo cooling and solidification [8,9]. Two end-member cases for the crystallization of the impact melt sheet are: (1) The melt may undergo igenous differentiation during solidification [8-10], resulting in a newly developed crustal stratigraphy, or (2) The melt may undergo homogeneous solidification and will crystallize in equilibrium [7], thus homogenizing the crustal stratigraphy. Here, we perform a case study on the Orientale basin and explore the possibility for igneous differentiation of the Orientale impact melt sheet [11] by assessing the thermal and physical processes driving cooling and crystallization. We compare our results against petrologic predictions for the cumulate stratigraphy of the Orientale impact melt sheet derived for scenarios of fractional and equilibrium crystallization [7]. Cooling and Solidification: Following the impact event, melt created through shock heating will collect in the excavated crater [8,9]. Morphologic measurements of the Orientale impact structure suggest the thickness of the initial molten impact melt sheet, z, was ~15 km [7] (Figure 1). Given the observed radius of the melt sheet, this yields an initial melt volume of ~1.5x106 km3 [7], in agreement with scaling law predictions [8]. Immediately after formation, energy would be radiated away from the upper surface of the impact melt sheet at a rate governed by the difference between the surface temperature of the melt (Ts), and the equilibrium temperature of the surface (Te) (Figure 1). This radiative top-down cooling results in the formation of an unstable upper thermal boundary layer [e.g. 12] (Figure 1). At this stage a large temperature gradient would exist across the melt sheet, and the configuration would be characterized by very high Rayleigh numbers (~1019). Under these conditions vigorous convection would take place in the impact melt sheet interior [12] with downgoing plumes of cool dense material formed at the base of the upper thermal boundary layer (Figure 1).               Figure 1. Configuration of the convectively cooling Orientale impact melt sheet showing the upper thermal boundary layer (d) and the well-mixed interior (h) (where convection maintains a relatively constant interior temperature Tm). Convection within the well-mixed interior is driven by the temperature gradient across the layer (ΔTc) which is controlled by the viscosity (μ) contrast [12]. Heat is conducted through the upper thermal boundary layer at a rate F, governed by the convective processes in the interior [12], and is then radiated to space at a surface temperature Ts.  Continued cooling of the impact melt sheet is governed by the amount of heat that can be transported through the upper thermal boundary layer (F) [12] and radiated to space, since a conductive lid is not predicted to form (none of the crystallizing products are buoyant in melt of the upper crust; [7]). The heat flux across the upper thermal boundary layer depends critically on the temperature contrast within the mixed interior (ΔTc) which has been shown to be controlled only by the viscosity (μ) contrast across the layer [12]. We estimate total heat loss from the system as a function of time by equating the heat flux through the upper thermal boundary layer to the radiative heat flux from the upper surface and by tracking the evolution of the temperature-dependent viscosity [12] and the solid fraction of the melt sheet  (results shown in Figure 2a). 1174.pdf

a. b c. Crystallization Processes: In order to assess the crystallization processes involved in melt sheet solidification, we adopt a crystallization framework [13] developed for vigorously convecting magma chambers (given the generally analogous scale and convective vigor). In this framework, vigorous convection within the well-mixed interior of the melt sheet holds crystals in suspension and prevents settling. Instead suspended crystals settle at the boundaries of the system, where convective velocities decay to zero. The crystals in suspension settle out at the boundaries over a characteristic residence time [13-15]. If the residence time of the suspended crystals is less than the time required to solidify a unit volume of the melt sheet, all the crystals in suspension will settle out [13-15], and the suspended load will decrease until additional crystals are formed through further cooling. Thus, by comparing the time required to solidify each unit volume of the impact melt sheet against the residence time of the suspended crystals, we derive the fraction of suspended crystals which may settle throughout the cooling process (Figure 2b). This fraction, in conjunction with the total solid fraction of the melt sheet, allows the total fraction of crystals settled throughout the cooling process to be determined (Figure 2c). Conclusions: Estimates of convective cooling rates of the Orientale impact melt sheet suggest cooling of the system occurred rapidly, with complete solidification occuring in ~5.5 kyr (Figure 2a). Rapid convective heat loss results in cooling rates which are substantially more rapid than the residence time of suspended crystals during the initial stages of melt crystallization (Figure 2b). As a result, crystal settling is effectively prevented until the residence time of suspended crystals decreases below the cooling time scales at a solid fraction of ~0.6 (primarily due to dramatically increased viscosity and significantly slower convection). At this point crystal settling at the non-convecting boundaries becomes efficient and the settled crystal fraction rapidly increases (Figure 2c). However, while not treated in this analysis, at a solid fraction of ~0.6 the melt/crystal mixture is predicted to undergo a sharp rheological transition beyond which the material takes on a solid-like behavior [16]. This would subdue convection as well as crystal settling [16], and any remaining crystallization would likely take place in situ. The results of this analysis suggest that crystal-melt separation through settling is not an efficient process in the convectively cooled Orientale impact melt sheet. Therefore, equilibrium crystallization is predicted to dominate during solidification of the Orientale impact melt sheet. This is in agreement with petrologic predictions suggesting the Orientale melt sheet underwent equilibrium crystallization (giving a final stratigraphic sequence of dunite, overlain by pyroxenite, superposed by a thick  layer of norite; [7]). These results suggest up to ~5% of the lunar crust may have been homogenized by impact melting associated with large impacts. However, igneous differentiation of impact melt could occur by other mechanisms such as viscous emulsion differentiation [7]. References: [1] Wood (1975) Proc. Lunar Sci. Conf., 6, 1087.
