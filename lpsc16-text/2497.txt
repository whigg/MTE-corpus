Spectral ratios at ultraviolet (UV) and visible (VIS) wavelengths have shown a correlation with TiO2 concentrations on the lunar surface [1-10], with spectral characteristics most likely affected by the presence and quantity of ilmenite in the soil. Whereas lunar silicates show a consistent decrease in reflectance shortward of 500 nm, ilmenite exhibits an absorption at ~500 nm and resulting upturn at lower wavelengths [11,12]. Because ilmenite is the main Ti-bearing phase on the Moon and is well correlated with TiO2, we can use ratios centered in the 300-500 nm range for TiO2 determination of ilmenite-bearing to ilmenite-rich soils.  UV/VIS (502/250) ratios derived from Hubble Telescope data modeled an improved fit over a simple Clementine 750/415 ratio, but some areas exhibited negative TiO2 values [4-9]. Likewise, 321/415 ratios derived from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) Wide Angle Camera (WAC) were well correlated with TiO2 concentrations but resulted in some areas with negative TiO2 values when the relationship was globally expanded [9,10]. These negative values could be a result of maturity effects or phases such as glass, agglutinates, or pyroxenes bearing TiO2 instead of ilmenite. Here we examine the relationship between the 321/415 UV/VIS ratio and laboratory spectra of Apollo soils and what they may tell us about detecting lunar TiO2 using LROC. Methods:  We examined ~25 mg aliquots of 13 Apollo soils of varying composition and maturity using X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) reflectance spectroscopy. All 13 bulk soils were sieved to less than 210 Âµm. XRF and XRD methods for deriving chemistry and mineralogy, respectively, can be found in [13]. Spectroscopy methods can be found in [14]. We compared sample TiO2 concentrations to the sample 321/415 ratio obtained from reflectance spectroscopy; these bands were shown to have the best correlation with TiO2 from laboratory and spacecraft observations [9,10,14]. We used the values of the full width at half maximum corresponding to the 321 and 415 nm LROC spectral response functions to determine which wavelengths to average to create a representative 321 and 415 nm reflectance value. Results: A comparison of the wt% TiO2 found in a sample ilmenite to the total sample TiO2 shows a robust correlation between TiO2 contributed by ilmenite and total sample TiO2. Furthermore, plotting maturity (measured as IS/FeO [15]) vs. 321/415 ratio for high Ti mare soils reveals that the ratio increases logarithmically with increasing maturity.  Employing a least squares linear fit, we found a weak correlation between TiO2 and the 321/415 ratio for all 13 lunar soils (R2 = 0.31) (Figure 2). This correlation improves when immature soils with IS/FeO <40 are excluded (R2 = 0.90). The linear fit has a yintercept of 0.79, implying negative TiO2 values for any 321/415 ratio below 0.79. Discussion: The TiO2 contribution from ilmenite is well-correlated with bulk sample TiO2 (Figure 1). Because of the strong correlation, the 500 nm ilmenite spectral feature can be used as a good proxy for TiO2 detection.  Figure 2 complements findings from [16], where the UV/VIS ratio of high-Ti mare soils at first increased with increasing maturity but showed minimal changes in ratios at IS/FeO > 40. For immature laboratory soils, the 321/415 ratio increases with increasing maturity until the soil becomes submature to mature (IS/FeO < 40). Once a soil has an IS/FeO value of ~40, any subsequent maturation ceases to have a large effect on the 321/415 ratio. Since maturity does not appear to affect the soil ratio at these higher IS/FeO values, the effects of ilmenite/TiO2 on a spectrum or UV/VIS ratio must be more prominent and identifiable. Because our laboratory ilmenite vs. 321/415 ratio comparison has a similar fit to that of TiO2 vs. LROC 321/415 ratio (from [9]) when immature soils are excluded, LROC must be detecting mostly submature to mature soils at 100-400 m/pix. The 321/415 ratio saturates at IS/FeO values near or above 40 (Figure 2); when the immature soils from the fit are removed, only soils whose ratios are affected by factors other than maturity remain (such as ilmenite and TiO2).  We also note that the presence of a y-intercept for the submature to mature sample linear fit at 0.79 suggests negative TiO2 values at 321/415 ratio values below 0.79, similar to the negative values found in [9] and [10] with LROC WAC ratios. Because negative TiO2 values are unfeasible, we declare ~2% TiO2 the maximum detection limit for TiO2 determination using a UV/VIS ratio method. In addition, the submature and mature soil fit in Figure 2 suggests a possible logarithmic downturn below ~2% TiO2, which may allow  for a lower y-intercept and alleviate the problem of negative TiO2 values: This hypothesis will require further testing with mature, low-Ti soils. Conclusion: On the basis of our laboratory data, we infer that the correlation between the 321/415 ratio and TiO2 for soils with intermediate to high TiO2 values is best for mature soils, which achieve a more-orless uniform state of physical conditions such as grain size and agglutinate glass content. The amount of TiO2 hosted in ilmenite in these soils correlates well with bulk TiO2, and the 321/415 ratio in these soils is mainly a function of the ilmenite content (Figure 3).   Immature soils influence the soil spectral response through changes in maturity by increasing the spectral ratio with increasing maturity. These soils can also reflect strong effects on the 321/415 ratio for reasons other than ilmenite content [16]. We infer that the strong correlation between the LROC WAC 321/415 ratio and TiO2 concentrations for landing site "calibration sites" [9,10] as well as for Hubble results [8] occurs because the areas sensed at the calibration sites include mainly submature to mature soils whose reflectance spectra are no longer greatly affected by maturity.
