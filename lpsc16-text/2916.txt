Introduction: Northwest Africa 8114 (a pair of Northwest Africa 7034) is a polymict, martian basaltic regolith breccia with varied clasts in a fine grained matrix [1-3]. It is the most hydrated martian meteorite discovered [4] and the oxygen isotope and D/H isotope ratio analyses support the martian origin of water [4]. As this meteorite is a breccia, further study is required to determine which phases contain the water. The majority of the water is suggested to be hosted by hydrous Fe oxides, with a minor contribution from apatite [5,6]. The ferric phases maghemite and goethite have been detected [7], making this potentially the most oxidized known martian meteorite [4,7]. The meteorite was likely formed as a result of an impact event [8] which may have led to hydrothermal systems causing further alteration to it [7,9]. Previous study has characterized sections of NWA 8114 and shown partial breakdown and mantling by fine-grained material of pyroxene clasts to be associated with oxidation [10]. This investigation uses XRD, FTIR and Ar-Ar dating to better understand the origin of this impact regolith and the role of water in its evolution. Methods: Three polished sections from the main mass of NWA 8114, held at the University of Leicester were examined with a Hitachi S-3600N SEM with INCA 350 EDX system for initial elemental analyses. This was followed by analyses with a JEOL 8600S EPMA with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV and a beam current of 30 nA. The FIB sections for TEM analysis were taken from different specifically chosen clasts of NWA 8114 using an FEI Quanta 3D Dual Beam FIB/SEM. A JEOL JEM-2100 LaB6 TEM with a Princeton Gamma Technology Avalon EDX system was used to obtain TEM and STEM images and EDX data. Beamlines at the Diamond Light Source synchrotron, Oxfordshire, UK were used: I-18 for X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) analyses [10] and X-ray diffraction (XRD), and B-22 for Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Transmission spectra of a double polished thin section and reflectance spectra of the 3 single polished sections were recorded with a Brucker Vertex 80 V FTIR interferometer in the 500-4000 cm-1 range with a 4 cm-1 resolution. The measurement spot was 10 μm x 10 μm. A reference water-bearing silicate glass standard was also measured [11]. Fe-K XANES, XRD and FTIR were carried out at sample points on a representative variety of clasts, as well as XANES 5 µm resolution and FTIR 8 cm-1 resolution maps.  Four clasts were separated from the bulk meteorite, analysed by SEM-EDX and fragments of them subsequently analysed with an Argus VI mass spectrometer, at SEAES, for Ar isotopes and halogens [12].    Results: FIB-TEM: Some of the pigeonite clasts, with bulk compositions Wo12-18En31-34Fe47-56, and lowCa pyroxene clasts Wo2En65-68Fs29-33, when examined by TEM, are seen to have broken down to a submicron, granular mixture of iron oxide ~10-20% and an amorphous Al-silicate ~20%, with relict and recrystallised pigeonite or low-Ca pyroxene (<2.5% Wo) the remainder (Fig. 1). Unaltered cpx-dominated clasts have negligible ferric iron contents - determined by FeK XANES -  but altered pigeonite and low-Ca pyroxene have Fe3+/Fetot ≤25% [12].

FTIR: Transmission spectra from a double polished section of NWA 8114 were obtained and matched with SEM mineralogical data. Fig. 2. shows a pyroxene, En 66Wo6Fs28, which has partially broken down into iron oxide and Fig. 3 shows three FTIR spectra taken in that area.  Figure 3:  FTIR transmission absorbance spectra from different clasts of NWA 8114 and a water-bearing silicate glass standard [11]. The altered pyroxene contains microscopic grains of goethite.     Figure 4: Unit cell dimensions a, b, c in angstroms plotted for goethite standards from the ICDD database [13] against calculated values from XRD data for NWA 8114 for the area highlighted in the BSE image. The five most intense dspacings for NWA 8114 were: 2.704, 2.524, 1.840, 2.451, 4.188 vs the ICDD standard: 4.171, 2.443, 2.686, 1.715, 2.577 (all in angstroms). The yellow crosses indicate further XRD points similarly shown to be magnetite. Fig. 3 shows a peak at 3565 cm-1 for the hydrated silicate glass standard containing 0.17 wt% H2O [11].  The three pyroxene FTIR spectra, together with another taken from an iron oxide clast instead all show a peak at 3400 cm-1 in close agreement with [6] indicating the presence of –OH groups. The homogenous unaltered pyroxene clast and feldspar clast do not show a peak in this range. The small feature at 1730 cm-1 is indicative of pyroxene while peaks between 880-1120 cm-1 show the silicate bands. We don’t see evidence in any NWA 8114 phases for dissolved H2O. XRD: Unit cell parameters were calculated after assigning hkl planes to the d-spacings calculated from the XRD data and compared to standards from the ICDD database (Figure 4), showing a good match with goethite FeO(OH). Similar analysis was carried out showing a good fit between the other grains marked on Fig. 4, and magnetite. Ar-Ar Dating: Three alkali feldspar clasts and one augite clast show a range of disturbed ages. When calculated from measured 40Ar39Ar ratios, the pyroxene clast showed a possible isochron between 1.1-1.2 Ga, whereas the feldspar clasts gave more varied values. The Action of Water in the Formation of the NWA 8114 regolith: The pyroxenes which have recrystallised to form magnetite and amorphous silicate at a submicron scale, show the effect of high temperature and oxidation during the regolith formation. The oxidation may indicate the presence of H2O.  The additional presence shown by our XRD and FTIR analyses of goethite within much of the pyroxene clasts, shows that water was also present at a later, low temperature stage in the regolith’s history. Given the D/H isotope ratio evidence [4], although some terrestrial contamination cannot yet be ruled out,  this indicates alteration in the presence of water as the regolith was cooling on Mars. The 40Ar39Ar potential age of 1.1-1.2 Ga  may relate to the high temperature phase of regolith formation. References: [1] Stephen N. R and Ross A. J. (2014) LPSC XLIV, Abstract #2924.
