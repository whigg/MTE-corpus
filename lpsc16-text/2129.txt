Introduction:  Kaula's rule gives a bound on the RMS of the gravity coefficients of each order as a power law K/n2, where n is the degree. Kaula [1] derived the value of K for Earth as 10-5. This rule has been used as an a priori information bound on the gravity coefficients of other planetary bodies before their gravity fields are measured by spacecraft. To apply Kaula's rule to other bodies, the simple scaling based on the relative gravity of each body is used - (gEarth/gPlanet)2. This scaling was successfully used even for Vesta [2], where K = 0.011. However, if Kaula's rule is applied to very small bodies, such as the OSIRIS-REx target asteroid Bennu, the scaling results in un-useable bounds. In this case, KBennu ~ 105. This fact has motivated further investigation into the derivation and application of a Kaula-like power rule to bound the gravity field of small bodies.   Methodology:  This study investigated two main effects that could cause the gravity field computed from a constant density shape model to vary. First, we vary the topography of the shape to within the approximate accuracy of the radar data used to derive the shape. Second, we investigate modifying the density so the internal density distribution is non-homongeneous.  The topography variation method applies vertical perturbations to each vertex of the shape model which are correlated with each other to prevent unrealistic "spikey" perturbations to the topography.  The density distribution includes three different inhomogeneous mass distributions: a core, a layer and a torus model. The core model applies a density variation on a spherical core of given radius centered in the origin of the shape. The layer model applies a density variation to over the surface of the shape to a given depth. Finally the torus model applies a density variation to a ring around the equator of the body of configurable size. This methodology was originally discussed in [3]. Results for Bennu: Our initial investigation focuses on the specific application to Bennu. This is enabled by the fact that a fairly accurate shape model of Bennu has been derived based on three Earth-based radar apparitions along with a constrained bulk density based on astrometry and thermal measurements. [4] A total of 250 different shape models were constructed with vertical perturbations up to ±15m (corresponding to the radar accuracy) and correlation distances ranging from 25 to 300 m.  Several interesting facts were discovered through this analysis. First, the top shape of Bennu, common to a number of near-Earth asteroids, results in the even zonal coefficients being larger than the odd zonal of one lower degree - e.g. C4,0 > C3,0 . Second, the zonals in general are significantly larger than the coefficients with order > 1, so that the zonals will dominate any fitting of K to a power law. This encourages us to fit two K's - one for the absolute value of the zonals (K=0.087), and a separate value for the RMS of the other coefficients (K=0.025), which is shown in Figure 1.  Figure 1 - Non-zonal coefficients and Kaula rules fit to the max values (dashed) and the best-fit (solid) with an exponent of -2. Values for K are given in the key. Third, although the shape model is thought to be quite accurate, variation in the topography within this uncertainty dominates the variation in the gravity field coefficients over basic inhomogenous density distribution effects. The density of Bennu is estimated to be 1.26 g/cm3 [5] and was varied over a range of ±0.25 g/cm3 in the perturbed regions, such as the 50 m layer model shown in Figure 2. The opposite region was also varied in density so that the total mass of the body remained constant. Finally, with significantly non-spherical shapes, it is not clear what value for the reference radius should be used when deriving the gravity field coefficients. The interesting finding here is that when using the radius of the volume equivalent sphere, the power law follows the expected exponent of -2. However, if using the radius of the circumscribing sphere, the exponent changes to -3.2.  0 2 4 6 8 10 12 10−4 10−3 10−2 10−1 100 RM S C nm , S nm c oe ffi ci en ts Degree n  0.025/n2 0.043/n2  Figure 2 - Illustration of the layer density model tested. Comparison to Other Small Bodies:  We also use this methodology to compare to other small bodies of interest that have good shape models available.  Itokawa is a perfect candidate since a very accurate shape model is available, and the shape is different to start since it is not the top-shape, and so the zonal dominance seen for Bennu does not exist. The gravity field based on the Itokawa shape model [6] with a constant density of 1.9 g/cm3 and a reference radius set to the maximum radius of 535 m [7] is shown in Figure 3. In this case, it appears that the Kaula rule used should have an exponent around -5!  Furthermore, if you compute the Kaula rule based on a reference radius equal to the mean radius of 0.162 km [8], the RMS actually increases with the degree! This is shown in Figure 4.  Figure 3 - Itokawa gravity coefficients and RMS (black) computed with Rref = the maximum radius. Possible Kaula rules are shown exponents of -2 (green), - 3 (orange), -4 (yellow) and -5 (purple).  Figure 4 -Itokawa gravity coefficients and RMS computed with Rref = the volume mean radius Clearly there are many details to understand before blindly applying the Kaula rule to small bodies. This work will elucidate rules and guidelines based on the above works, as well as several other asteroids for which shape models are available.
