Introduction: Early collisions (those occurring ~10 Myrs after CAIs or less) have been invoked to explain the mixing/juxtaposition of materials of different thermal histories observed in a given meteorite and the thermal evolution of meteoritic materials which cannot be explained by radiogenic heating alone [1-8].  Unfortunately, while collisions are believed to be responsible for these features, it is unclear what collisional parameters would produce samples consistent with the observed petrologies, chronologies, and cooling rates. We aim to use quantitative methods to investigate the origin of these features.  In particular, we are focusing on the Iron IAB, Winonaites, and Iron IIE, whose origins are believed to be related to an impact and for which the cooling rates of multiple samples have been determined [4,5,8].  Previously, we reported our hydrocode-N-body hybrid methodology for tracking the reaccumulation of material after an impact between young planetesimals [9].  In that work, we simulated a high-energy collision using the hydrodynamic code iSALE, and then followed the gravitational reaccumulation of ejected materials using the N-body code REBOUND. We found that the reaccumulated remnant exhibited mixing of material from different regions of the initial target body, which had been heated to different degrees due to the decay of 26Al.  This type of post-impact mixing is similar to that invoked for the Iron IAB/Winonaites [4,5,8] and Iron IIE [7] parent bodies. We have continued to develop our methodology and extended it to study the long-term, thermal evolution of the reaccumulated remnant.  Here we report on our preliminary results, focusing on comparing model output to data collected from the Iron IAB and Winonaites. Post Impact Reaccumulation: As we described previously [9], we ran an iSALE simulation for a given collision scenario until the shock wave from the impact had dissipated in the target body.  The final states of all materials in the iSALE simulation are then taken as the initial conditions for our REBOUND simulation, which represents the post-impact body as a collection of particles. We looped over a large volume of hexagonally closed packed (HCP) spheres, interpolating the properties (mass, velocity) of each from the iSALE output to initialize the REBOUND simulations. Each particle was also assigned thermodynamic properties from the post-impact state that were retained throughout the REBOUND simulation. This differs from our approach in [9] where we converted each iSALE Cartesian grid cell directly to particles. Using an HCP body allows us to retain the volume of the impacted body more accurately and better resolve the reaccumulation of the final remnant.  We will perform a series of simulations using the N-body code pkdgrav to validate our results. Here we report the results of our study of a 10 km body striking a 100 km target at 10 km/s at a 45-degree angle. The target is assumed to have been heated by radioactivity for 5 Myr at the time of the collision, after having accreted 2.2 Myr after CAIs. The left panel of Figure 1 shows a slice through the body at the initiation of the REBOUND simulation (end of iSALE), while the right panel shows the postaccumulation structure after ~33 hours of simulation time. The spheres are colored based on their temperatures as described in the figure caption. We again see that some materials from different regions (different colors) of the parent body are mixed as suggested for the formation theory for IAB/Winonanaites [4,5,8]. More energetic collisions would lead to greater excavation and levels of mixing. These will be the focus of future simulations. Thermal Evolution: In order to understand the post-impact evolution of the reaccreated material we then took the final positions of the REBOUND simulation, interpolated to a Cartesian grid, and imported to a 3D thermal evolution model [3,10].  The 3D model tracks the conductive cooling of the reaccumulated body.  We set the surface elements of the planetesimal to the assumed ambient temperature (170 K) for our initial calculations, but will relax this assumption in the future.  The grid used in our preliminary study had a grid spacing of 1 km in each direction.  A uniform heat capacity of 8.e6 erg/g/K was assumed along with a constant thermal diffusivity of 0.007 cm2/s.  We initially tracked the cooling of materials over ~10 Myr to focus on the thermal evolution of materials that were accreted at the surface of the remnant, and will consider cooling of the entire body in the future.      The top panel of Figure 2 shows the thermal state of a slice through the reaccumulated remnant after 10 Myrs. The bottom panel shows the cooling rate over that entire time period. The region around the impact site initially contains materials of very different temperatures, highlighting the mixing of materials, and this leads to large variations in cooling rates.    Figure 3 shows the cooling rate of material around the impact site as a function of the peak temperature reached.  Here the cooling rate is taken as the cooling rate at T=773 K, the approximate temperature at which metallographic cooling rates are recorded in meteoritic samples. We have removed the very high cooling rates seen in materials at the surface of the remnant, as their high cooling rates are a result of the boundary conditions used in our model.  Despite this, there is a large spread of cooling rates for materials buried within the final remnant, with these rates spanning 3 orders of magnitude for a given peak temperature. As discussed in [3], this is due both to the mixing of hot and cold materials, as well as the removal of insulating crust over deeper, heated materials at the impact site. An unimpacted body would evolve with an onion-shell structure, showing a tight trend of higher peak temperature regions cooling more slowly than lower ones. The lower range of the cooling rates seen in Figure 3 is close to those reported for the IAB/Winonaites [4,5,8].  Future Plans:  We are currently investigating a suite of impact scenarios with our methodology, varying impactor size, velocity, and angle of impact, as well as target size and thermal structure in order to determine which impacts produce remnants whose evolution is consistent with what has been inferred for meteorite parent bodies. We will also consider differentiated bodies and the fate of mantles and cores.  Ultimately, our model predictions will be used to constrain the dynamic state in the early Solar System.

There is a clear spread in the cooling rates most likely due to the impact upon the body and mixing of material that has experienced different thermal histories.
