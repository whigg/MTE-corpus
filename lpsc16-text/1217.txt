Introduction:  In addition to the widespread plains deposits that have shaped much of Mercury's surface [e.g., 1], the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) mission has provided abundant evidence for explosive volcanism [e.g., 2, 3]. At numerous sites across the planet, pyroclastic deposits surround scalloped rimless pits (interpreted as the source vents). These deposits are characterized by high-reflectance, "red" (steep increase in reflectance with wavelength) spectral slopes, and diffuse borders [2-4]. In the most recent catalogue [5], 150 identified pyroclastic deposits were found to be concentrated along fracture zones at the margins of impact basins, within impact craters, and along lobate scarps. The deposit to the northeast of Rachmaninoff impact basin (NE Rach) is by far the largest of Mercury's pyroclastic regions, with a radius of 130 km [5], and has the planet's highest visible-wavelength reflectance [6]. The volatiles responsible for Mercury's pyroclastic activity, however, have yet to be determined. Geochemical results from MESSENGER's orbital campaigns have so far revealed that Mercury's silicate fraction is highly reduced and volatile-rich [e.g., 7-10]. Here, we present an analysis of MESSENGER X-Ray Spectrometer (XRS) data for NE Rach, updated from an earlier report [11]. Combined with results from the Neutron Spectrometer (NS) and the Mercury Atmospheric and Surface Composition Spectrometer (MASCS) Visible-Infrared Spectrometer (VIRS), we are thus able to constrain more fully the chemical composition of the pyroclastic deposit and make inferences concerning the nature and origin of the volatiles that drove the eruption. XRS data: During MESSENGER's second extended mission, several sites were the focus of XRS "targeted observations." During these measurements, the spacecraft was rotated to keep the instrument's field of view centered on a target for up to tens of minutes. On 14 December 2013, a powerful solar flare occurred during a targeted XRS observation of NE Rach. We used our standard forward modeling procedure [e.g., 12] to fit the first 200 s of the XRS spectra and thus derive elemental abundance estimates for NE Rach (Table 1). We find that NE Rach has similar Mg/Si and Al/Si ratios, but higher Ca/Si, than the immediately surrounding terrain. Our Fe/Si map indicates that the deposit has a relatively high Fe content, but the full regional context cannot be established because of incomplete coverage. Our results also confirm a striking excursion from the otherwise ubiquitous positive correlation between Ca/Si and S/Si (Fig. 1A) on Mercury [e.g., 10]. The S/Si ratio of NE Rach (0.02) falls at the low end of the planet's S/Si distribution and is much lower than would be expected on the basis of its Ca/Si value of 0.24 (the expected S/Si is ~0.11). Indeed, NE Rach has by far the highest mapped Ca/S ratio on Mercury's surface. Table 1. Elemental abundance ratios for the NE Rachmaninoff pyroclastic deposit, derived from forward modeling of targeted XRS data. An average surface composition for Mercury is shown for comparison. Ratio NE Rachmaninoff Average surface Mg/Si 0.485±0.011 0.439 Al/Si 0.212±0.010 0.275 S/Si 0.021±0.003 0.073 Ca/Si 0.236±0.004 0.161 Fe/Si 0.072±0.007 0.052 Discussion: Mercury's pyroclastic deposits—typified by high reflectance and red slopes—are an ultraviolet-near-infrared spectral reflectance endmember (Fig. 1B). The low reflectance of fresh craters on Mercury compared with the Moon also indicates that Mercury's surface contains an abundant opaque phase. It is thought [6, 13] that C (in the form of graphite) can account for Mercury's generally low reflectance. Low-altitude NS data have been used to assess the composition of a 600×600 km region centered on NE Rach [13]. These data indicate a decrease in thermal neutron count rate over the pyroclastic deposit, attributable to a 1-2 wt% depletion in C relative to the surrounding region [13]. Nearly all Mercury's pyroclastic deposits (including NE Rach) also exhibit a downturn in spectral reflectance at <0.4 µm, i.e., the edge of an oxygen-metal charge transfer (OMCT) band [14] (see NE Rach spectrum in Fig. 1B). By comparing the strength of the band in the NE Rach spectra and in low-Fe laboratory spectra [15], we estimate that NE Rach contains no more than~0.1 wt% FeO. 1217.pdf

LBP: low-reflectance blue plains. IP: intermediate plains. Pyroclastic eruptions are caused by exsolution of volatiles during magma ascent. It has been suggested that, despite the extremely reducing conditions of Mercury's interior, oxidation of C and sulfides in ascending magmas via reaction with oxides can drive degassing [16]. Reaction of oxides with C and sulfides could occur by either of two scenarios that are consistent with the MESSENGER NE Rach data: assimilation of C- and S-bearing low-reflectance material into oxiderich magma, or assimilation of oxide-rich country rock into C- and S-bearing magma. The XRS and NS data indicate that the deposit is depleted in both S and C compared with typical Mercury surface materials. These low abundances may arise from oxidation of C and sulfides, and the resultant loss of the liberated volatiles. A loss of C (as graphite) would result in higher reflectance, and an increased UV slope could result from the removal of a few tenths of a percent of FeO (reduced to Fe0). The OMCT band would thus become unsaturated and the UV slope would increase, as has previously been suggested [14]. We have tested this hypothesis by evaluating the amount of C and S exsolution required to produce the spatial extent of NE Rach. If we assume the source magma had a Ca/S ratio typical of Mercury's crust, we estimate that 2.5 wt% S was lost during the eruption. Furthermore, low-pressure oxidation of C could have led to the formation of CO [16]. We use the maximum difference in C content between NE Rach and the surrounding area (2 wt% [13]) to estimate an exsolution of 4.7 wt% CO during the eruption. These volatile abundance estimates are the same order of magnitude as those calculated from the size of the deposit and a volcanological model [2]. We therefore propose that oxidation and exsolution of C- and S-bearing volatiles were responsible for the NE Rach eruption. Conclusion: Complementary MESSENGER geochemical and spectral reflectance measurements provide evidence for the origin of pyroclastic volcanism on Mercury. Our results are consistent with exsolution of S- and C-bearing volatile species as the cause of at least one explosive eruption. Assimilation of oxiderich country rocks during magma storage and/or ascent may have promoted oxidation of reduced C and sulfides and thus produced the volatiles necessary to drive the eruption. It remains uncertain, however, whether NE Rach is representative of Mercury's other pyroclastics. Comparable geochemical analyses for the smaller deposits with MESSENGER datasets are not possible, but this will be an interesting question for the forthcoming BepiColombo mission.
