Here	  we	  develop	  mod-­els	   for	  mass	   anomalies	  within	   the	   crust	   and	   consider	  their	   expression	   at	   the	   lunar	   surface,	   and	   compare	  results	  to	  observations	  from	  the	  GRAIL	  and	  LOLA	  data	  sets.	   The	   objective	   is	   to	   understand	   the	   extent	   to	  which	   source	   depths	   of	  mass	   anomalies	   can	   be	   con-­strained,	  given	  the	  inherent	  non-­-uniqueness	  of	  gravity	  measurements.	  	  Approach:	   	   To	   study	   crust	   and	   upper	   mantle	  structure,	  we	  combine	  gravity	  and	  topography	  to	  pro-­duce	   Bouguer	   gravity	   that	   reveals	   the	   distribution	   of	  mass	   in	   the	   subsurface.	   	   Increasingly	   high	  degrees	   in	  the	   spherical	   harmonic	   expansion	   of	   the	   Bouguer	  gravity	   are	   sensitive	   to	   increasingly	   shallower	   struc-­ture,	  with	  the	  sampling	  depth	  taken	  to	  correspond	  to	  the	  spatial	  block	  size	  or	  half	  wavelength	  of	  the	  degree	  and	  order	  of	  the	  spherical	  harmonic	  coefficients.	  	  	  Figure	  1.	  Model	  crust	  and	  associated	  depth	  zones	  de-­fined	  by	  degree	  ranges	   in	  the	  power	  spectrum	  of	  the	  GRAIL-­-LOLA	  Bouguer	  anomaly.	  	  	  We	   specify	   spherical	   harmonic	   degree	   (L)	   ranges	   to	  isolate	  contributions	  from	  different	  depths.	  We	  define	  a	   model	   crust	   illustrated	   in	   Figure	   1.	   We	   consider	   a	  maximum	  of	  L=	  540,	  corresponding	   to	  a	  spatial	  block	  size	  and	  depth	   range	  of	  10	  km,	  because	   the	  Bouguer	  spectrum	   is	   essentially	   error	   free	   to	   that	   point.	   We	  break	   the	   crust	   into	  degree	   ranges	  of	   	   271	  <	  L	  <	  540	  (10	  -	  20	  km	  depth),	  181	  <	  L	  <	  270	  (20	  -	  30	  km	  depth),	  and	  120<	  L	  <180	  (30	  -	  45	  km	  depth).	  Lower	  degrees	  (L	  <	   120)	   correspond	   approximately	   to	   mantle	   depths	  [6].	  	  	  We	  compare	  observations	  of	  Bouguer	  gravity	  de-­constructed	   into	   various	   degree	   ranges	   to	  models	   to	  address	  what	   information	  might	   be	   obtained	   regard-­ing	  vertical	  density	  distribution.	  We	  extend	  depth	  sen-­sitivity	   when	   compared	   to	   earlier	   work	   using	   GRAIL	  gravity	  [7].	  Illustrative	   Observations:	   We	   initially	   focus	   on	  highlands	  crust,	  where	  >98%	  of	  free	  air	  gravity	  is	  asso-­ciated	  with	  topography	  [1],	  so	  high	  degree	  and	  order	  mass	  anomalies	  that	  remain	  after	  the	  Bouguer	  correc-­tion	  constitute	  <2%	  of	  the	  full	  gravitational	  signal.	  We	  deconstruct	   the	   gravity	   field	   and	   plot	   the	   subsurface	  distribution	   of	   density	   anomalies	   for	   several	   repre-­sentive	   regions	   of	   the	   lunar	   highlands,	   including	   sev-­eral	  basins.	  	  	  	  	  Figure	  2.	  Profile	  of	  Bouguer	   anomaly	   along	   the	   lunar	  equator	  from	  190	  E	  to	  270	  E.	  The	  full	  anomaly	  is	  at	  the	  top,	  with	  contributions	  below	  shown	  for	  degree	  rang-­es	  271	  <	  L	  <	  540	  (10	  -20	  km	  depth),	  181	  <	  L	  <	  270	  (20	  -	  30	  km	  depth),	  120	  <	  L	  <	  180	  (30	  -	  45	  km	  depth).	  	  Figure	  2	  shows	  a	  profile	  of	  the	  Bouguer	  anomaly	  along	  the	  equator	  with	  contributions	  from	  depths	  shown	  in	  Figure	  1,	  illustrating	  how	  the	  gravity	  field	  contains	  the	  most	  short	  wavelength	  content	  at	  shallowest	  depths,	  but	  many	  of	  the	  highest	  amplitude	  signals	  originate	  at	  approximately	  Moho	  depths.	  This	  point	  is	  further	  illus-­trated	  in	  Figure	  3,	  which	  shows	  a	  map	  view	  of	  decon-­structed	   Bouguer	   gravity	   within	   a	   gravitationally	  smooth	  region	  of	  the	  equatorial	  farside	  highlands.	  2105.pdf

	  	  Figure	  3.	   	  Contributions	  to	  surface	  Bouguer	  gravity	   in	  the	  farside	  highland	  region	  10	  S	  -	  10	  N,	  180	  E	  -	  190	  E.	  	  Approximate	  depth	  ranges	  from	  left	   to	  right	  are	  10	  -	  20	  km,	  20	  -	  30	  km	  and	  30	  -	  45	  km,	  respectively.	  	  	  Depth	   Constraints:	  We	   next	   develop	   a	   forward	  model	  as	  an	  initial	  step	  to	  address	  the	  extent	  to	  which	  the	   depth	   of	   a	  mass	   source	   can	   be	   constrained.	  We	  consider	  a	  block	  mass	  10	  x	  10	  x	  10	  km3	  and	  calculate	  the	   surface	   gravity	   anomaly	   assuming	   the	   block	   at	   a	  range	   of	   depths,	   see	   Figure	   4.	   The	   calculation	   shows	  that	  the	  surface	  signal	  is	  a	  maximum	  when	  the	  mass	  is	  taken	  to	  be	  at	  the	  correct	  depth.	  Further,	  the	  surface	  signal	   decreases	   rapidly	   at	   shallower	  depths,	   particu-­larly	  when	  compared	  to	  the	  decrease	  at	  depths	  great-­er	  than	  the	  depth	  of	  the	  mass.	  As	  a	  result,	  the	  ability	  to	   recover	   the	   corrected	   depth	   degrades	   for	   more	  deeply	  buried	  masses.	  	  These	   preliminary	   calculations	   demonstrate	   an	  approach	   for	   recovering	   the	   depth	   of	   crustal	  masses	  such	  as	  dikes,	   intrusions,	  major	   faults	  and	  other	   sub-­surface	  structures	  within	   the	   lunar	  crust,	   taking	  max-­imum	  advantage	  of	  the	  GRAIL	  and	  LOLA	  data	  sets.
