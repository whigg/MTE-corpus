 ICE SUBLIMATION, OUTGASSING, AND MELTING ON CERES: MODELS AND OBSERVATIONS.   P. O. Hayne1 and O.

With a bulk density of ~2 g cm-3, Ceres may have a significant water component, either in the form of an icy mantle [1], hydrated silicates [2], or both. Because its growth was apparently arrested at the protoplanetary stage, observations of Ceres could test models for planetary formation, incorporation of water, and interior evolution [3]. One of the key observations to be made by the Dawn mission is the presence (or absence) and distribution of ice on the surface and near-subsurface. Motivation:  On billion-year timescales water ice is unstable against sublimation at nearly all latitudes on Ceres' surface, but may exist in the near subsurface at high latitudes [4][5]. Therefore, if Ceres has an ice-rich mantle, processes such as mass wasting on slopes and impacts may expose ice, which would then sublimate and outgas to space. Water vapor and OH observed around Ceres may be evidence of such outgassing [6] [7]. Thus, depending on the excavation rate, exposures of ice could be common at high latitudes. Conversely, a lack of exposed ice could indicate a crust heavily processed by meteorite impacts or an intrinsically low ice fraction. Here we compare models to reported observations by the Dawn mission, to place limits on the ice content of Ceres' uppermost crust, and investigate the role of water in surface modification and outgassing. Models:  We simulate surface and subsurface temperatures on Ceres with a numerical heat and vapor diffusion model, using realistic topography and illumination conditions [8]. Sublimation at the surface is controlled by radiative heating, balanced against cooling by thermal emission and latent heat removal:  		 εσT 4 = Fsolar − L !E   (1) where ε  is the bolometric infrared emissivity, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, 	T  is temperature, 	Fsolar  is the absorbed insolation flux, 	L  is the latent heat of sublimation, and 	 !E  is the sublimation rate. At typical noontime equatorial temperatures of ~240 K, granular H2O frost would sublimate extremely quickly, with a timescale of days. However, water ice will never reach these temperatures, due to the efficiency of latent heat removal. Instead, the peak temperature of ice at the equator is given by solving equation (1), giving 		Tmax ≈  190 K. In the polar perennial shadows, water ice is stable indefinitely. Within ~2° of both poles, it is stable on illuminated surfaces on billion-year time scales as long as it maintains high albedo [8]. Subsurface ice is stable for > 1 Gyr within ~1 m depth above ~45° latitude. We also model ice sublimation over a range of ice grain sizes from microns to meter-size blocks or bedrock, which have much longer lifetimes. Ice exposure and removal:  By analogy with observations of fresh, icy craters on Mars [9], we model the exposure and gradual disappearance of icy ejecta materials. The thinner outer portions of the ejecta blanket disappear first, producing the highest outgassing rates, which then decay as the surface area decreases. Outgassing rates and vapor densities are estimated using a simple plume model, where vapor escape is determined by the mean thermal velocity, 	vth , at the surface. In this case, the gas density is approximated by  		 ρ gas ~ !E vth = !E m/(k BT )  , (2) where 	m  is the molecular mass, and 	kB  is Boltzmann's constant. An instrument measuring the line-ofsight column density would see 		M ~ ρ gasD , where 	D  is the diameter of the source region. Melting of buried ice:  Melting is not expected under normal conditions on Ceres, because solar and geothermal heat fluxes are too low and there is no appreciable atmosphere. However, high heating rates during impacts may produce transient liquid H2O in the sub  Figure 1: Lifetime of H2O ice blocks/bedrock on Ceres' surface (defined as time to remove 1 m), based on numerical modeling.

We investigate possible melting by modeling impact heating and conduction into the subsurface, accounting for latent heat removal and vapor diffusion through the regolith [10].  Results:  Lifetimes of exposed ice vary widely depending on latitude, surface slope, albedo, and thermal inertia [8] [11]. Figure 1 summarizes some of our results. At the equator, lifetimes of >104 yr are possible for cohesive ice blocks with high albedo (>0.55). However, such features would have outgassing rates below detection limits. Large outgassing rates can be achieved in the low- to mid-latitudes for darkened or granular ice deposits, which will disappear rapidly. For example, bright ice deposits (albedo ~ 0.25) at the ~20° latitude of Occator [12] (Fig. 2) would have lifetimes of ~5 - 100 yr, corresponding to sublimation rates of 10-7 to 10-5 kg m-2 s-1. Given their surface area of ~100 km2, only ~1 - 20% of the Occator bright spots would need to have been active to explain the the vapor production rate of ~6 kg s-1 inferred from observations by [7]. This could be the case, for example, if a large mass-wasting event temporarily exposed water ice, which was subsequently removed by sublimation. Impacts may produce sustained H2O vapor production at Ceres by exposure of icy ejecta materials. We calculate lifetimes (Fig. 3) and outgassing rates for such events. Although long lifetimes are possible, the development of a darkened sublimation lag deposit would obscure the ice and affect its sublimation. Nonetheless, these results show that impact-excavated ice could persist on Ceres' surface for >104 yr at latitudes >65° even for small craters < 1 km in radius. Conclusions:  Lifetimes of exposed water ice layers on Ceres vary widely, depending on latitude as well as surface slope, albedo and thermal inertia. Outgassing from exposed ice can be rapid, but only for those deposits with short lifetimes. Therefore, the ice must be resupplied on short time scales if sublimation outgassing is observed. Given the moderately long lifetimes of impact-excavated water ice at high latitudes, it would be surprising if no such exposures were observed. Models of heat transfer following hypervelocity impacts suggest both sustained vaporization and melting of H2O are possible. This process could remove large quantities of subsurface ice, especially at high latitudes. In this case, instability and structural failure are possible, resulting in observable signatures such as slumping, landslides or collapsed crater walls. We will present several possible models that will be tested with existing and future Dawn observations.  References: [1] Castillo, J. C. and T. B. McCord (2010), Icarus 205, 443-459. [2] Zolotov, M.
