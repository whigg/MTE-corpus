RECONSTRUCTING THE INITIAL EMPLACEMENT OF THE NORTH POLAR LAYERED DEPOSITS, MARS WITH SHARAD.  S. Nerozzi1 and J. W. Holt1, 1Institute for Geophysics, Jackson School of Geosciences, The University of Texas at Austin (stefano.nerozzi@utexas.edu, holt@utexas.edu)   Introduction: Planum Boreum (PB) is a dome of layered icy material rising ~3 km above the surrounding plains in the northern hemisphere of Mars. Orbital imagery, spectroscopy and radar sounding allowed the subdivision of PB into the terrigenous basal unit [1-3] and the overlying water ice-rich north polar layered deposits, NPLD [4-7]. The basal unit can be further subdivided based on internal structure into the Rupes Tenuis unit and the overlying cavi unit [8,9]. The cavi unit is an aeolian deposit characterized by cross strata and includes ice and periglacial features [8,10,11]. Its contact with the overlying NPLD is complex and has conformable, time transgressive and gradational chracteristics [8]. Since their discovery, the rich stratigraphic record of the NPLD has long been regarded as the key for understanding the most recent climate evolution of Mars [4] and its dependency on periodical variations of Mars’ orbital parameters (orbital forcing) [12-14]. The emplacement of the NPLD on top of cavi unit represents a major, globalscale shift of water ice on Mars, likely driven by climate change, yet the reasons and time scale for this event are still unknown. This is primarily due to a general lack of outcrops of the lowermost NPLD and the contact between the two units, as well as an incomplete understanding of global climate. It is now feasible to decipher the stratigraphic record of Planum Boreum by following an integrated approach that couples radar sounding and high-resolution visible imagery. Here we present the preliminary results of radar reflector mapping along the BU-NPLD contact. Methods: This study involves the tracking of radar reflectors (“horizons”) in SHARAD radargrams in Planum Boreum [15]. Single reflectors are assumed to represent isochron surfaces and to result from changes in the concentrations of dust that significantly alter the dielectric constant [6,7,16]. A set of horizons was tracked across 700+ radargrams in a seismic interpretation environment (Landmark DecisionSpace) and after depth conversion with the assumption of a bulk composition equivalent to water ice (εr=3.15) [7], thicknesses were calculated for each stratigraphic interval using ESRI ArcMap. Results: A preliminary analysis of SHARAD profiles in the Gemina Lingula region revealed the presence of a weak reflector located beneath the NPLD and adjacent to the presently mapped cavi (Fig. 1, red arrows and dotted line). This reflector is interpreted as the top of the Vastitas Borealis Formation (on which PB sits, [8]), and delineates the base of a ~50m thick sedimentary body that appears continuos to cavi unit. In fact, the reflector can be traced beaneath cavi unit and the two units share almost identical radar scattering signatures. At the presently mapped extent, this lobe of material covers an area of over 15000 km2 but does not outcrop; more work needs to be done to determine the full extent of this unit, and hopefully find visible exposures that would allow an imagery-based characterization and understand its relationship with the overlying NPLD.  Although SHARAD does generally detect subtleties of the gradation between cavi and the NPLD, perhaps due to the limited vertical extent of the transition, we did find evidence of a lens of material located between cavi unit and the NPLD in the PB main lobe (Fig. 1, green Figure 1: Delay time and depth corrected samples of SHARAD profile 1294501. Diffuse radar returns (red arrows) and a weak reflector (red dotted line) appear beneath the NPLD in the Gemina Lingula region. Note that the reflector becomes flat when a depth conversion assuming bulk water ice composition (εr=3.15) is applied (d). A lens of material is detected between cavi and the NPLD as a combination of sharp, diffuse and lack of reflections (green arrows). The yellow line delineates the interpreted top of cavi unit.The lowermost NPLD reflectors (pink and purple) have limited lateral extent and appear to pinch-out onto the top of cavi unit. These are completely overlain by younger icy deposits (light blue lines, lateral extent depicted in Fig. 2). 2665.pdf

arrows). The top of this deposit is a relatively sharp reflector protruding from the underlying cavi unit, followed by a diffuse return and a non-reflecting zone. This feature extends over an area of at least 4000 km2 and could be evidence for a final episode of siliclastic deposition (i.e., cavi) in that area. Moving upwards in the stratigraphic column, the earliest record of NPLD deposition is characterized by the limited lateral extent of two reflectors sharing similar scattering characteristics and are located just above the cavi unit (Fig. 1c,2). The units delineated by these two horizons are laterally bounded by pinch-outs that delineate a non-depositional or erosional hiatus, or a thickness below the theoretical SHARAD vertical resolution [15]. These units are completely buried under the overlying NPLD reflectors, which extend farther to the south over large areas in the PB main lobe and Gemina Lingula (Fig. 1c,2). Discussion: The limited extent of the oldest NPLD, immediately overlain by larger, more extensive deposits is indicative of a southward growing ice sheet that gradually buried the cavi unit, with a possible renewed pulse of cavi deposition in at least one area. This scenario agrees well with the cavi-NPLD time transgressive contact observed in visible outcrops in the mouth of Chasma Boreale [8], and suggests that portions of cavi were still active and undergoing accumulation during the first phases of NPLD emplacement, in some areas. In addition, our reflector mapping provided fundamental stratigraphic context for the interpretation of the gradational and laterally transgressive contact between cavi and the NPLD observed in outcrops. In fact, at least two of the earliest polar layered deposits are completely buried under younger units, therefore meaning that coeval cavi and NPLD accumulation persisted at least after those two initial water ice deposition episodes. Finally, we interpret the lens of material located between cavi and the NPLD as a transitional deposit composed of a terrigenous dune field sitting on top of cleaner water ice. Multiple terrigenous dunes have been observed within the first tens of meters of the lowermost NPLD in outcrops (Fig. 3). This could be the first detection of such transitional deposits in radar profiles and provides new information on the potential size of these features. Future work: The modern Olympia Undae region represents an excellent analog of contemporaneous cavi and NPLD accumulation. Thin blankets of nearly pure water ice cover portions of a large dune field that appears to be active where terrigenous sediment is not completely frozen [17]. We plan to analyze dune-ice interactions and the progressive stages of dune burial under the NPLD in available HiRISE images, and compare the observations with stratigraphic mapping of visible cavi-NPLD outcrops and SHARAD profiles.
