(thomas.ronnet@lam.fr) Introduction:  The  origin  of  the  two  martian moons,  Phobos  and  Deimos,  still  remains  unknown. Both moons exhibit featureless red spectra in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) range, relating them to either D-type asteroids [1] or 'primitive' objects such as comets [2]. Their spectral characteristics along with their irregular shape and low density have long lead authors  to  associate  them with captured  asteroids  (e.g. [3]). However,  the  nearly-circular  and  nearly-coplanar orbits of the moons disagree with a capture origin. Several  studies  suggested that  Phobos and Deimos were captured  in  an  extended  martian  atmosphere  due  to drag forces ([4] and [5]). This atmosphere need then to be quickly removed with the right timing ( when both bodies are close to the synchronous orbit at ~6 Mars radii) in order for the captured satellites to match today's  observed  martian  system.  A capture  scenario seems  then  to  be  a  succession  of  very  improbable events, making it very inefficient to account for the origin of Phobos and Deimos. Several authors recently suggested that the martian moons could have formed in situ, following the impact of Mars with a body roughly the size of the moon [6], as coplanar and circular orbit is a natural outcome of such a formation mechanism. Here  we investigate  the  bulk  composition  of  the satellites that would form in an accretion disk around Mars and relate it to the observations of Phobos and Deimos. We aim at bringing new constraints on the formation  conditions  under  which  formed  the  martian moons. Formation of  Phobos and Deimos in an accretion disk around Mars.  Similarly to the Moon impact scenario, a disk of debris around Mars could have originated from the impact of a large object with the protoplanet.  Such  an  impact  would  explain  the  excessive prograde angular momentum of Mars if the impactor mass was ~1022 kg. Moreover,  if the disk's mass was large enough, numerous moonlets could have formed within, thus explaining the elongated crater population on the  surface  of  Mars  as  many bodies  would  have fallen back to the planet under tide effects. Recently, the impact of Mars with a body the mass of the Moon has been modeled using SPH simulations [7]. These authors showed that, depending on impact angle and relative velocities of the two bodies, 2-4% of the impactor mass was set into orbit around Mars. This results in a disk several order of magnitude more massive than Phobos and Deimos. Unfortunately,  the numerical resolution used in this study did not allow to derive precisely the thermodynamic properties  of  the system as only ~280 particles finally ended up in the disk out of the 3×105 initially used to model Mars and the impactor.  Thus the thermodynamic conditions inside a circum-martian disk are poorly constrained and the same applies  for  its  composition  given that  it  is mainly composed of the impactor mantle (see e.g. [8]). Methods.  Given the few constraints on the properties of an accretion disk around Mars, we assumed a disk similar to the proto-lunar disk. This is a two-phase disk consisting in a melt layer concentrated at the midplane and surrounded by an atmosphere of vapourized material.  In  such  a  disk,  moonlets  form beyond  the Roche limit where gravitational instabilities set in, allowing large clumps to emerge from the magma [9]. These clumps are already the size and mass of Phobos and Deimos and need not to accrete together in order to form larger bodies. Based on these considerations, and given that Phobos and Deimos are not massive enough to allow the melting  of  rocks  or  an  efficient  differentiation,  the composition of the moonlets should be that of minerals that  form as the melt cools down. We used a CIPW norm calculation in order to estimate this mineralogic composition. The CIPW norm is a simple calculation based on sequences of crystallization and geochemistry calculations, it allows to infer the mineralogic composition of a rock sample from its chemical composition. Although it  is  not  a  precise  crystallization  sequence calculation, it accounts for the most abundant minerals and gives a good estimate of their final proportions. It is  based  on  idealized  mineralogy but  it  may applies well in the case of the martian disk because it supposedly cooled down slowly [10]. Results and Discussion. Considering the impactor probably formed near proto-Mars (e.g.  [11]),  the two bodies would have a closed composition. We then first performed our calculation on a magma with a Bulk Silicate Mars composition. We found the most abundant minerals to be Olivine (~90 wt%) and Pyroxene (<10 wt%). In this scenario Phobos and Deimos would thus be very Olivine rich. Olivine and Pyroxene have characteristics absorption bands at 1 µm and 1 and 2  µm respectively that should be observed in the spectra of the moons. Such a com position is in disagreement with the featureless measured spectra of the satellites. This method should be applied to different magma compositions in order to discriminate between scenarios and bring new constraints on the conditions of formation of Phobos and Deimos.
