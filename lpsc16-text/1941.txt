(thomas.ronnet@lam.fr)Introduction:  The  origin  of  the  two  martianmoons,  Phobos  and  Deimos,  still  remains  unknown.Both moons exhibit featureless red spectra in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) range, relating them toeither D-type asteroids [1] or ‘primitive’ objects suchas comets [2]. Their spectral characteristics along withtheir irregular shape and low density have long lead authors  to  associate  them with captured  asteroids  (e.g.[3]).However,  the  nearly-circular  and  nearly-coplanarorbits of the moons disagree with a capture origin. Several  studies  suggested that  Phobos and Deimos werecaptured  in  an  extended  martian  atmosphere  due  todrag forces ([4] and [5]). This atmosphere need then tobe quickly removed with the right timing ( when bothbodies are close to the synchronous orbit at ~6 Marsradii) in order for the captured satellites to match today’s  observed  martian  system.  A capture  scenarioseems  then  to  be  a  succession  of  very  improbableevents, making it very inefficient to account for the origin of Phobos and Deimos. Several authors recently suggested that the martianmoons could have formed in situ, following the impactof Mars with a body roughly the size of the moon [6],as coplanar and circular orbit is a natural outcome ofsuch a formation mechanism. Here  we investigate  the  bulk  composition  of  thesatellites that would form in an accretion disk aroundMars and relate it to the observations of Phobos andDeimos. We aim at bringing new constraints on the formation  conditions  under  which  formed  the  martianmoons.Formation of  Phobos and Deimos in an accretion disk around Mars.  Similarly to the Moon impactscenario, a disk of debris around Mars could have originated from the impact of a large object with the protoplanet.  Such  an  impact  would  explain  the  excessiveprograde angular momentum of Mars if the impactormass was ~1022 kg. Moreover,  if the disk's mass waslarge enough, numerous moonlets could have formedwithin, thus explaining the elongated crater populationon the  surface  of  Mars  as  many bodies  would  havefallen back to the planet under tide effects.Recently, the impact of Mars with a body the massof the Moon has been modeled using SPH simulations[7]. These authors showed that, depending on impactangle and relative velocities of the two bodies, 2-4% ofthe impactor mass was set into orbit around Mars. Thisresults in a disk several order of magnitude more massive than Phobos and Deimos. Unfortunately,  the numerical resolution used in this study did not allow toderive precisely the thermodynamic properties  of  thesystem as only ~280 particles finally ended up in thedisk out of the 3×105 initially used to model Mars andthe impactor.  Thus the thermodynamic conditions inside a circum-martian disk are poorly constrained andthe same applies  for  its  composition  given that  it  ismainly composed of the impactor mantle (see e.g. [8]).Methods.  Given the few constraints on the properties of an accretion disk around Mars, we assumed adisk similar to the proto-lunar disk. This is a two-phasedisk consisting in a melt layer concentrated at the midplane and surrounded by an atmosphere of vapourizedmaterial.  In  such  a  disk,  moonlets  form beyond  theRoche limit where gravitational instabilities set in, allowing large clumps to emerge from the magma [9].These clumps are already the size and mass of Phobosand Deimos and need not to accrete together in order toform larger bodies.Based on these considerations, and given that Phobos and Deimos are not massive enough to allow themelting  of  rocks  or  an  efficient  differentiation,  thecomposition of the moonlets should be that of mineralsthat  form as the melt cools down. We used a CIPWnorm calculation in order to estimate this mineralogiccomposition. The CIPW norm is a simple calculationbased on sequences of crystallization and geochemistrycalculations, it allows to infer the mineralogic composition of a rock sample from its chemical composition.Although it  is  not  a  precise  crystallization  sequencecalculation, it accounts for the most abundant mineralsand gives a good estimate of their final proportions. Itis  based  on  idealized  mineralogy but  it  may applieswell in the case of the martian disk because it supposedly cooled down slowly [10].Results and Discussion. Considering the impactorprobably formed near proto-Mars (e.g.  [11]),  the twobodies would have a closed composition. We then firstperformed our calculation on a magma with a Bulk Silicate Mars composition. We found the most abundant minerals to be Olivine(~90 wt%) and Pyroxene (<10 wt%). In this scenarioPhobos and Deimos would thus be very Olivine rich.Olivine and Pyroxene have characteristics absorptionbands at 1 µm and 1 and 2  µm respectively that shouldbe observed in the spectra of the moons.

position is in disagreement with the featureless measured spectra of the satellites.This method should be applied to different magmacompositions in order to discriminate between scenarios and bring new constraints on the conditions of formation of Phobos and Deimos.References: [1] Pajola  M.  et  al.
