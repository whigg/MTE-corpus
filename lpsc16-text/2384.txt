A common explanation for the stability of liquid water is a thicker atmosphere rich in CO2 [3]. Today, this atmosphere has decreased, as did the amount of water. Numerous explanations have been proposed for the decrease of the amount of water and CO2 on Mars since the Noachian [i.e. 4]. We present here a mechanism that could explain it. We also describe our method to quantify the problem to justify its interest.    Serpentinization and Carbonation: Serpentinization is an efficient mechanism that could lead to the storage of water in the Martian crust by its hydration. Carbonation is also an efficient mechanism to store carbon dioxide in the Martian crust.  Numerous authors reports the detection of small amount of serpentine together with other Fe,Mgphyllosilicates and small amount of carbonates [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. In particular [6 and 10] show that the serpentinization and the carbonation of the Martian crust has been widespread in the Martian crust during the Noachian.  Quantification of the problem: [11] describes the thermodynamical conditions in which the serpentinization and the carbonation of the Martian crust could have happen thanks to EQ3/6 modelling. We suggest combining this knowledge and the results from a global geological study of the serpentines and carbonates detections to quantify the stored water and carbon dioxide by serpentinisation and carbonation.  Discussion:  We will resume our global result concerning the detection of serpentine and carbonates on Mars and the thermodynamical model compatible with a widespread minor serpentinization and carbonation of the Martian crust. Then by combining these results we will quantify the maximum amount of water and carbon dioxide that could have been stored in the Martian crust. We will conclude on the role of the serpentinization and the carbonation in the evolution of the atmosphere and of the hydrosphere of Mars during the Noachian.
