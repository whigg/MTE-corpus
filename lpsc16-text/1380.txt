Introduction:  Lobate scarps are common tectonic landforms on terrestrial planets, which are the surface manifestation of thrust faults formed by the contraction of the lunar surface [1-7]. However, compared to other terrestrial planets (e.g., Mercury, Mars, and Earth), those on the Moon are relatively small, typically <10km in length [12, 6-8]. Lobate scarps are among the youngest landforms on the Moon (< 1 Ga) based on their crisp appearance, absence of superposed craters, and age-dating studies by [7, 9-11]. Located in the back-limb of some lobate scarps are small-scale graben likely caused by flexural bending; their shallow depths also attest to their youth [12]. Recently, [13] mapped over 3,200 lobate scarps with high resolution 0.5 to 2m/pixel Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) images from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera [14], and revealed that these features are globally distributed. Their orientations seem to not only be influenced by isotopic stresses, but also by the diurnal tidal stresses that contribute to the present stress state of the lunar crust [9,13].   The crisp morphologies, and the survival of the small-scale graben suggest that most of the scarps were likely active in the last 50 Ma, possibly even forming today [13]. However, the ages of scarps can also be investigated using crater degradation rates and crater size-frequency distributions (CSFDs) [9-11], which allow more specific comparison of the periods of activity on different scarps. In the current study, we compile these age determinations and analyse whether there are global trends with age and/or distribution. We are interested how the crustal stresses developed over time and whether scarps formed during punctuated episodes or continuously.   Data and Methods:  For the global distribution map, we include all ages of lobate scarps by [9-11].  The data and methods used by [9-11] are described in further detail below. Investigation by Binder and Gunga [9].  Using Apollo panoramic imagery, a maximum and minimum age for each of 20 lobate scarps was determined by looking at craters crosscut by or crosscutting the scarp [9]. Using the method of [15], crater ages were computed by classifying craters according their state of degradation using the calibration data of [16].  Scarp complexes (e.g., Mädler A and Koval'skiy) whose subscarps produced distinctly different ages indicate that thrust fault activity occurred over a period of time, Figure 2: Global distribution of lunar lobate scarps ages as derived by [9] , [10], and [11].  Thinner plus sign symbols represent ages derived by [9] and thicker plus sign symbols are AMAs from [11]. Figure 1: Romer P lobate scarp (26.3N, 39.8E) on NAC image pair M180909323.  upwards of 400±100 Ma [9]. The ages of the scarps investigated by [9] range from 60±30 to 680±250 Ma, with an uncertainty +2x to -4x.  Factors that may bias the age estimates to be older than actual include: (1) the resolution (~2 m) of the panoramic imagery results in the softening  of rims of small (10-40 m) craters therefore, making them appear larger and older and (2) the method of [15] was created for craters on flat mare surfaces, however several scarps are on slopes, so the craters degrade faster and appear older [9].  Ages were determined for scarp complexes and their respective scarp segments. In general, the scarp segment ages were uniform with the age of the overall scarp complex [9]. Even though the derived ages might vary, the ages usually overlap within uncertainty [9]. For our study, we incorporate only the ages for the scarp complexes into Fig. 2. Investigations by van der Bogert, et al. [10] and  Clark et al., [11]. Using NAC (Narrow Angle Camera) image data, we measured CSFDs for areas both proximal and distal to the fault trace. The absolute model ages (AMAs) derived from the hanging wall CSFDs range from 53 to 439 Ma. As observed by [10] and [11], the hanging wall of the thrust fault is younger than its respective footwall due to small craters being erased during fault movement. The ages determined at different locations along the scarp trace also vary. We include the youngest age for each scarp in Figs. 2 and 3, since it can be interpreted as representing the most recent fault movement. Results: Fig. 3 shows that faulting began in the last 700 Ma, with fault activity increasing overtime.  Most faulting events occurred in the last 300 - 425 Ma, peaking around 195 Ma. One might hypthosize that scarps older than 700 Ma were destroyed by erosional and depositional effects.  The fact that all the observed scarps formed in the Copernican correlates well with the assumption that the lobate scarps are formed partially in an isotropic stress field due to late-stage contraction [9,22,23]. We observed that AMAs of [10,11] tend to be younger than the ages of [9]. We infer that this is partially due to improved surface dating techniques and more abundant high resolution imagery (e.g., LROC). The distribution of lunar lobate scarps with ages is reasonably well dispersed across the globe, such that it is possible to make some preliminary observations. We  observe that faults activated in the last 100 Ma are primarily located in the southern hemisphere. Addition of further age determinations for scarps is needed to confirm whether this is a real trend or related to sampling bias. Summary and Outlook:  Presently, there are voids in Fig. 2 primarily from the data of [9] being limited to the equatorial region due to the Apollo panoramic image coverage. We will continue to derive AMAs of lobate scarps and the results will be incorporated into Fig. 2 to produce a more complete global distribution.  In addition, we will investigate the frequency distributions of ages of different lobate scarp groups (e.g., arcuate and linear) as there could be implications for  the evolution of the lunar stress field in the last billion years [9].
