Introduction:  As of 2016, the origin of chondrules seems more opaque than ever, with nebular and planetary scenarios finding comparable support in recent literature. The issue is compounded by the variety of chondrules themselves across chondrite clans [1] but on the other hand, if a unity in origin can be surmised, the logic underlying these variations may be key to understand. In particular, a first-order dichotomy in the chondrule world to rationalize is between the FeO-poor "type I" and FeO-rich "type II" chondrules [2]. As yet, it is debated whether the difference reflects formation under different oxygen fugacities e.g. as a result of varying dust/gas ratios [3, 4], or intrinsic compositional differences [5] and/or the duration of the thermal episode [6]. Trace elements, with their variety of geochemical behaviors, are a tool of choice to make further progress on this issue. Analyses at the mineral scale in unequilibrated ordinary chondrites (which alone contain a substantial population of pristine type II chondrules to be compared with their type I counterparts) by SIMS have been already reported previously [7-9]. The advent of LA-ICP-MS, with its lower detection limits and greater analysis speed, however warrants a re-investigation of those objects, in continuity with our previous study on carbonaceous chondrites [10], as ferromagnesian silicates are generally very poor e.g. in rare earth elements (REE) of interest. We [11] have thus set out to analyze silicate phases in type I and type II chondrules in LL3 chondrites Bishunpur and Semarkona. Results and interpretation: Average REE patterns of individual chondrule phases are shown in Fig. 1. The results are fairly similar to those we obtained in carbonaceous chondrites [10], even if no single very light REE (LREE)-depleted olivine (as equilibrium partitioning would require) was found (probably owing to kinetic effects [7,12,13]), and compares reasonably well with previous SIMS studies [7-9] except in that the most incompatible elements such as LREE are more depleted (by one order of magnitude) than reported there, presumably as a result of our lower detection limits.  Type II chondrule olivine has systematically lower refractory lithophile element abundances than its type I counterpart (Fig. 1 and 2; see also [7,10]). As this is in a direction contrary to empirical data on olivine/melt    Figure 1: Average REE patterns (geometric) of the different analyzed mineral phases in type I and type II chondrules.

partition coefficient dependence on FeO content [14], this is interpreted to indicate that type II chondrule olivine formed by fractional crystallization (that is olivine core records equilibrium with the original, ~chondritic melt) while type I chondrules olivine results from batch crystallization (i.e. olivine maintained equilibrium with the residual, incompatible elementenriched melt solidified as mesostasis; [10,15]). This is tested further in Fig. 3. This difference indicates that type II chondrules cooled faster than type I chondrules (on average), with a limiting cooling rate estimated of the order of 10 K/h in between [10].   Type II chondrules are less depleted in volatile elements than type I chondrules (Fig. 3; see also [15]). We detected Na in olivine cores in agreement with previous EMPA measurements [16-17]. The positive correlation of Na with Al at the (type II) chondrule bulk scale (Fig. 4; [18]) seems to indicate a precursor effect (e.g. chondrule mesostasis) and suggest an essentially closed system during chondrule formation rather than e.g. buffering under a common partial pressure of Na.     Conclusions: There surely are intuitive links between several type I/type II chondrule differences (which must reflect different formation environments, e.g. because of the contrasting thermal histories). For example, the reduced volatile element depletion of type II chondrules may be traced back to more oxidizing conditions (stabilizing the oxides) and/or  reduced processing time. Yet, if our contention that type II chondrules cooled faster holds, it is not obvious why it should correlate with higher oxygen fugacities/solid-togas ratios. If type I and type II chondrules formed by a similar mechanism, this is a constraint on the physics of the latter. It is noteworthy that such a correlation is predicted by both shock [19] and impact jetting [20] models. References: [1] Jones R. H. (2012), M&PS, 47:11761190. [2] Scott E. R. D. & Taylor G. J.
