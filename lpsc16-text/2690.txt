As such, there is no established cartographicreference for Pluto or Charon, aside from that currentlydefined by the IAU based on ephemerides, not surfacecharacteristics [see 4].Data: We made use of the New Horizons LORRI andMVIC data for purposes of establishing a control network and cartographically controlling the data. Imagesprior to one Pluto rotation (approximately seven daysprior to closest approach) were of low enough resolution that they were not helpful in providing identifiablefeatures for matching and were also superseded by images that covered the same area but with better resolutionnearer to closest approach.SPICE data is key to this work [5, 6]. At the timeof the flyby only predict kernels were available whichhad discrepancies when used with the images that weretaken, and required extra manual effort to make use ofin that period. As expected, the reconstructed SPICEkernels provided 90 days after the encounter provided amore accurate description of the position and pose of thespacecraft. However, while those kernels were a significant improvement, there was often still a slight mismatchof the reconstructed SPICE position and the actual location of the object (see figure 1, again, as expected).Figure 1: P LORRI FULLFRAME (lor 0299123689)showing an offset of about 14 pixels from where theSPICE data calculate the limb and where it is in the image.Geometric CorrectionMethod: Images were broughtinto the ISIS [7] system and associated with their reconstructed SPICE information. Due to current limitationsin the way that ISIS treats framing cameras and line-scancameras, the LORRI and MVIC data had to be workedwith independently.LORRI network: All LORRI images for a body (thesame method was used for both Pluto and Charon) wereinspected and image to image control points were assigned with the ISIS qnet program. Where possible,a control point was located on a feature that was identifiable in many images and a ‘measure’ was added foreach image. This way control points were not just image pairs, but consisted of the same feature in multipleimages, which provided for better control solutions.Once selecting control points was completed, theISIS bundle adjustment program jigsaw [8] was usedon all of the LORRI images to adjust only the instrument pointing parameter (but not the spacecraft position). We found that we got improved results when wealso let jigsaw solve for the local radii of the givencontrol points, rather than forcing the program to leavethem fixed at a surface of average radius for the body.This process resulted in a pointing solution for eachLORRI image that allowed robust mosaicking. Practically, the result of this process is an improved SPICE Ckernel that describes the updated spacecraft pointing atthe time of each observation.A controlled LORRI mosaic was then created fromthis control solution.MVIC network: Ideally, the above process would alsoinclude MVIC images such that the bundle adjustmentprocess in jigsaw would operate on a pool of control points that connect both LORRI and MVIC images.However, they must be treated separately. The MVIC images were inspected and given control points in a similarfashion, such that control points representing a featurewere identified in as many MVIC pan and color bandsas possible. However, in order to get these images tomatch the LORRI solution, we used qnet to identifythe LORRI mosaic as a ‘Ground Source’ such that thelocations of features in the LORRI mosaic were treatedas known control points.This resultant control network that contained MVICto MVIC control points, as well as MVIC to LORRImosaic ground control points was then given two runsthrough jigsaw. The first run did not solve for camerapointing, but only adjusted the spacecraft position. Thesecond run of jigsaw was then allowed to solve for cam2690.pdf

We also used the photomet programwith a lunar Lambert photometric function to correct forthe changing observation angles due to planetary curvature within a scene. This process allowed for much betterseam matching and more visually consistent mosaics.References[1] S. A. Stern, et al. The Pluto system: Initial results from itsexploration by New Horizons.
