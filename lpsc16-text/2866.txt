CONSTRAINTS ON H2O AND H2 PROPORTIONS IN THE VOLATILE ENVELOPES OF YOUNG, H2PRODUCING, SMALL-RADIUS EXOPLANETS.  M. Melwani Daswani1 and E. S. Kite1, Department of the Geophysical Sciences, University of Chicago (5734 S Ellis Ave., Chicago, IL 60637, melwani@uchicago.edu).   Introduction:  Small-radius exoplanets with low densities discovered by Kepler could have either accreted their volatiles from the nebular disk, or produced them via outgassing, i.e., through water-rock interaction. In the simplest scenario, Kepler exoplanets can be interpreted as rocky Earth-like core compositions, under a low molecular weight enveloping layer dominated by H2. Two main reactions can generate H2 in planetary formation conditions: elemental Fe oxidation [e.g., 1]:  Fe0 + H2O → FeO + H2 (Reaction 1),   and Fe-silicate hydration [e.g., 2]:  6Fe2SiO4 (fayalite) + 11H2O → 3Fe2Si2O5(OH)4 (serpentine) + 2Fe3O4 (magnetite) + 5H2    (Reaction 2).  In order to test the potential for small-radius exoplanets to generate the entire volatile inventory of their envelopes from water-rock interaction, we must first constrain the equilibrium H2O/H2 for plausible fO2 conditions that existed during planetary formation, since the upper weight limit of the envelope is ~ 1.7 wt. % for terrestrial-like rocky core compositions [3, 4, 5]. Methods:  H2O/H2 was calculated for 5 log units below the iron-wüstite (IW) fO2 buffer to 2 log units above IW, at pressures of 1 and 10 kbar, and varying temperatures using the van Laar gas mixing model [6], and the compensated-Redlich-Kwong (“CORK”) equation of state and CHO program by T. Holland [7] for H2O and H2 molar volumes in mixed gases. Low H2O/H2 would signify that a low molecular weight envelope could be achieved at planet-forming conditions and may be achieved by outgassing, whereas high H2O/H2 would produce a high molecular weight envelope – a “water-world” different from the two-layer (core + envelope) models of e.g., [8, 9]. Results:  Fig. 1 summarizes the H2O/H2 calculations for the studied range of conditions. Overall, for fO2 from IW-2 to IW+2, H2O/H2 increases at 10 kbar compared to 1 kbar, while at IW-5 to IW-3, H2O/H2 is comparable at both pressures. Temperature also has a more marked effect on the ratio at 10 kbar than at 1 kbar, with IW-2 to IW+2 decreasing H2O/H2 sharply from 200 to 1000 °C.  Figure 1. log10 (H2O/H2) as a function of (log10) temperature at specified fO2 conditions, calculated for A) 1 kbar pressure, and B) 10 kbar.  Discussion and further work:  Constraints can now be placed on the fO2 conditions during planetary formation if outgassing produced the low molecular weight envelopes of small-radius exoplanets. Further refinements to the H2O/H2 could be carried out by calculating the ratio with different equations of state (e.g., Pitzer-Sterner [10]) and extending the range of H2O/H2 values to higher temperatures. In future work, we will integrate these constraints with calculations of H2 production in a thermally evolving planet using a dynamical model incorporating nebular disk migration. The model will account for H2 accretion and loss to space, water-rock interactions during planetary accretion and up to the planetary embryo stage, and surface-interior recycling of volatiles. 2866.pdf

The model results will be compared to constraints for the abundance of volatiles on small-radius planets discovered by Kepler and K2, using mass constraints from Radial Velocity and Transit-Timing Variation analyses.
