Inthis study, spectral data in visibile-infrared range werecollected on  CM2 carbonaceous chondrite  powders,Mighei,  of  which  modal  composition  determined  byXRD  is  olivine  (15.6%);  enstatite  (6.6%);  calcite(1.1%);  magnetite  (3.6);  cronstedtite  (45%);  Mg-richserpentine  (23%);  and  FeS  (4.6%)  [1].  Other  minorphases  consist  of  Mg serpentine,  epsomite,  diopside,pigeonite, refractory inclusions,  brucite, chrysotile [2].Instrument  setup: The  imaging spectrometer  installed in SPIM is a spare of the spectrometer on Dawnspacecraft [3,4]. It works in the 0.22-5.05 μm spectralrange, with a spatial resolution of 38x38 μm on the target. Two bidimensional focal plane arrays, one for thevisible between 0.22 and 1.05 μm (spectral resolutionof 2 nm) and one for the IR between 0.95 and 5.05 μm(spectral resolution of 12 nm) allow to obtaining thespectral  coverage.  The  illumination  and  emissionangles are 30° and 0° with respect to the normal to thesample surface, respectively.Results:  Data were collected on powders <200μm.Given the high spatial resolution of SPIM, every spectrum profile could be a mixture of several spectral contribution of  different minerals. Thus, as first step allpotentially spectral endmembers were identified, keeping into account the mineralogical phases found in literature. In most the pixel spectra CO2 features relatedbands at 4.25μm occur; whereas only in some of thepixels occur  H2O band at 1.9μm.  The spectrum in fig.1  shows 1  μm broad band absorption that can be attributable to  crystal field transitions in octahedrally coordinated Fe2+ inmagnetite  (fig.1). In fact, respect to silicate minerals,magnetite spectra are characterized by low reflectance,a weak absorption band near 0.48  μm likely due to aspin-forbidden absorption band,  and a broad absorption band centered beyond 1.0 μm that is attributable toFe2+ [5]. However, we have to consider that olivine ispresent  in Mighei and could have variable composition. Fayalitic olivine from library data (Relab, Usgs)also shows one broad feature near 1.0 μm band similar,except for the higher reflectance value, to the absorption band plotted in fig.1. In  fig.2,  the comparison between one pixel  spectrum and the kerogen spectrum is showed. The absorptions in the range between  3-3.5 μm  could be ascribedto C-H compounds.  Fig.2 Pixel spectrum of carbonaceous matter detected in MigheiIn the  2.7-3.0  μm range there are features relatedto different phyllosilicates and perhaps sulfates. For example, in fig.3, the plot shows a pixel spectrum whoseabsorption features could be attributable to Fe-serpentine,  cronstedtite.  In  the same spectrum another twobroad absorptions  around 4.3 and 4.8 μm could be dueto SO4 overtone and combination bands in sulfates.Fig.1 Pixel spectrum of magnetite in Mighei1508.pdf

Moreover, Mg-serpentine and antigorite (fig.3-4) wereidentified analyzing this range between 2.7-3μm.Conclusions:  These preliminary results show thatSPIM spectral imager allows to identify several spectral  species  on  carbonaceous  chondrites  that  corresponds  to  different  minerals.  This  is  interesting  formultiple reasons: for carbonaceous chondrites spectralinvestigations  itself;  to  help  in  computing  inversionmodels in supporting of remote sensed spectral data ofC-type asteroids, like Ceres, but also for detecting minerals such as phyllosilicates and sulfates that are common on other environments  like Mars.References: [1]  Howard,  2008,  abs#5160,  JGR,  90,1151–1154.
