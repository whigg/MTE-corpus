This star was identified serendipitously by the Planet Hunters project [2] for its unusual light-curve, characterized by deep dimming (down to below ∼ 20% of the stellar flux) lasting between 5 to 80 days, and with an irregular cadence and unusual profile [3]. Since its discovery, KIC 8462852 has been the subject of intense multi-wavelength monitoring, and has spurred numerous speculations about the nature of the bodies, or even alien structures, responsible for the dimming of its visible flux [4]. Interest in KIC 8462852 is related to the very unusual dips in its Kepler time series photometry. One event near JD 2455626 (2011 March 5) lasting for ∼ 3 days, and a series of events starting from JD 2456343 (2013 February 19) lasting for ∼ 60 days, stand out for their unusual shape, lack of periodicity and depth. A search through the Kepler database for targets with similar dips turned out empty-handed. Realistic scenarios for the phenomena observed for this star include episodic occultation of the star by a circumstellar dust clump, either produced in the aftermath of a catastrophic collision in the system's asteroid belt or a giant impact in the system, or associated to a population of dust-enshrouded planetisimals, or produced by the breakout of a family of comets." [3,5]  Near-Infrared Studies. This announcement prompted a number of quick follow-up studies. In 2 of these [5,6], the authors used archival Spitzer and October 2015  NASA/IRTF 0.8 - 4.2 µm SpeX spectral observations to characterize the system. KIC's spectrum is consistent with purely stellar photospheric emission, within the uncertainties of the measurement (Fig. 1). By comparison to the spectra obtained for 8 other debris disk F-stars we observed as part of our ongoing Near InfraRed Debris DiskS (NIRDS) program, KIC 8462852 clearly does not show the markedly flattened, non-photospheric hot dust continuum + ~2.0 um CO emission lines of YSO HD 165014, a system which had previously been reported in the literature as a main sequence star [7]. Nor does it show evidence for the warm dust continuum excesses rising towards long wavelengths of the 10 - 200 Myr old systems HD 145263, HD 113766, HD 15407A, or HD 23514, all with known strong 10 and 20 um IRAS and Spitzer excesses [8]. Instead, KIC8462852's spectrum is consistent with that of the purely photospheric sys  tems HD 15745 and HD 15115. It may have a small fractional excess hidden in the noise of our short LXD measurement, but it is clearly less than the ~5% at 3.6 um and 2.5% at 4.5 um we have found for the 1.4 Gyr old HD 109085 (η Corvi) F2V system [9, 10]. Our observations are consistent with a normal main sequence star without sufficiently large amounts of circumstellar gas or dust, or inflowing or outflowing material, to produce a SpeX detection via the scattering or thermal re-radiation of the star's insolation. The measurements have eliminated the possibility that there is a sizeable amount of very close-in, very hot (>1000 K) material along our line of sight to the star during the IRTF observations on 31 Oct 2015. Such a population of hot dust could obscure a large solid angle for a highly inclined, nearly edge-on system, and account for the up to 20% drops in the Kepler lightcurve flux, and was not previously ruled out, as obscuration by asteroidal or Kuiper Belt dust was, by the high resolution optical spectroscopy and multi-wavelength photometry presented in [3]. We can further state that there are none of the hallmarks of a young, pre-MS system for KIC8462852. It lacks the usual "flat", nonphotospheric 2-4 um flux continuum and the gas emission lines seen in other YSO spectra from our NIRDS survey, like HD 51 Oph, HD 166191, or HD 165014. Presuming we observed the system during its quiescent, or non-obscured, phase (a more than 99% probability, assuming the two major Kepler lightcurve dips reported by [3] were 3 days wide and repeat every 750 days), any model for this system's strongly varying Kepler lightcurve will have to meet these baseline constraints on material outside the stellar photosphere.

the source of the obscuring material must be episodic in nature, with a localized  source reservoir and sink, surrounding a mature, Gyr-old star. Otherwise the material would have been detected by re-radiation of intercepted starlight in the infrared wavelengths. [Our observations cannot, however, rule out any artificial structure with an abnormally low (<1%) emissivity pointed in our direction.]   Discussion.  The cometary infall and breakup model most favored by [3] fits our new constraints well. Considering the minimum amount of dust mass required to obscure 20% of a star's light requires the conversion of a very large number of 1 km-radius comets (~105 or more) every 750 days into ephemeral 1 µm dust particles, the smearing out of  >105 1 kmradius comets into > 100 µm radiation pressure stable heavy dust grains along an orbital trajectory, or the violent outgassing of one very big comet-like body of > 100 km radius (aka as a Centaur or KBO in our solar system) passing near the star's corona.   η Corvi : These scenarios are interesting, in that in 2011 we presented compelling spectroscopic evidence at the LPSC for an currently ongoing exoLHB in the η Corvi system. I.e., in our 2011 LPSC abstract [11] we wrote: "We have analyzed the Spitzer IRS 5 - 35 um spectrum of the warm, ~360K circumstellar dust around the nearby MS star η Corvi (F2V, 1.4 ± 0.3 Gyr), a known IRAS excess object …that emits > 1000 times as much 24 um flux as other coeval (~1 Gyr) dusty disk systems….The η Corvi system contains an extended belt of cold Kuiper Belt dust (Mass ~ 2 x 1023 kg = 3 MMoon) at ~150 AU from the primary….The η Corvi system contains a reservoir of warm (~360K) dust massing > 3 x 1019 kg (~10-4 the mass of the Kuiper Belt dust) at ~3 AU from the primary, in the system's Terrestrial Habitability Zone (THZ)…The warm dust is very primitive, and definitely not from an asteroidal parent body. It is also very water and carbon rich, and while comet-like, its spectrum matches best the emission seen from the cold, extended dust disk found around HD100546, an ~10 Myr old Herbig A0V….The warm dust mass is much larger than that of a solar system comet (1012 - 1015 kg), but is very similar to the mass of a large Centaur or medium sized Kuiper Belt object (1019 - 1021 kg)…The warm THZ dust also contains a fraction of amorphous silica produced by impact processes…Conclusions: The best model for what is going on in the η  Corvi (F2V) system is that some process (e.g., planetary migration) is dynamically exciting the system's Kuiper Belt, causing frequent collisions amongst KBOs and producing the observed copious KB dust. As part of this process, one or more of the excited KBOs was scattered onto an orbit that sent it into the inner system, where it collided with a planetary-class body at ~3 AU, releasing a large amount of thermally unprocessed, primitive ice and carbon-rich dust (Fig. 2)….We conclude that the parent body for the warm dust was a Kuiper-Belt or Centaur-like body, which captured a large amount of early primitive stellar nebula material and kept it in deep freeze for ~1 Gyr, and was then prompted by dynamical stirring of its parent Kuiper Belt into colliding with a planetary body at ~3 AU at moderate velocities (5-10 km sec1). The interaction velocity was slow enough to preserve most of the original refractory silicates but also fast enough to refreeze ~1/3 of it as silica material, while also delivering large amounts of water (~1% of the mass of Earth's Oceans) and carbon rich material to the planetary body….This system is likely a good analogue for the LHB processes that occurred in the early Solar System at 0.6 - 0.8 Gyr after the formation of the CAIs, and is thus worthy of further detailed study in order to understand the nature of our LHB."   Figure 2: Model for producing the η Corvi disk system: over many Myr, a 100 to 200 km radius KBO is scattered onto an in-spiraling orbit, where it impacts a planetsized rocky body located in the THZ at ∼3 AU. Much of the resulting debris is left in a disk, where it continues to grind down. The dynamical process causing the KBO scattering also continues to stir up collisions in the system's Kuiper Belt, producing cold dust there as well.  Question: Could both of these mature, Gyr-old F2V exo-systems be currently undergoing a Late Heavy Bombardment, as demonstrated by the infall of large (> 100 km radius icy primitive bodies), but as the one in KIC8462852 does not contain extended debris disks, could it just be starting?"
