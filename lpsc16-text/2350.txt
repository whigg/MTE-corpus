SW Mg isotope data from Genesis DoS (diamondlike carbon on silicon) from 2010 gives a plausible, non-zero fractionation when the diamond-like carbon (DLC) film is assumed chemically and structurally inhomogeneous. These results can be used to interpret other Genesis isotope data; e.g. O [1]. Introduction:  In 2009-2010, an attempt was made to measure Mg isotopes in solar wind (SW) using Genesis DoS [2]. Mg isotopes are quite uniform in planetary materials: we can presume that they represent the solar value. Accordingly, accurate values for SW Mg isotopes quantify isotopic fractionation due to SW formation, thus allowing more precise interpretations of other Genesis isotope data of exceptional interest.  DoS is a unique, artisan, amorphous material, which, in 2010, seemed ideal for SW isotope analysis: low Z matrix, chemically resistant (contamination relatively easy to remove) and suppressed hydride formation during SIMS analysis using  an O2+ primary beam (no MgH+, lower MRP, more Mg cps). In 2010 the derived Mg isotopes were extremely scattered, the measured SW Mg profiles had inconsistent shapes as well as both variable depths of implant and intensity of Mg cps (even when normalized to C cps: Fig. 1). The anomalies did not seem instrument related but were otherwise inexplicable if the DLC were uniform. Investigating the analytical effects of these variations has allowed us to rework the 2010 data, giving plausible explanations for the anomalies and constraining fractionation in SW Mg isotopes. Experimental: SW Mg isotopes and  C2 and C matrix data, were collected by SIMS at ASU on (1) flight DoS and (2) an implant into flight-spare DoS. The  25Mg/26Mg ratio of the implant (determined by ICPMS) calibrated instrumental mass fractionation (IMF). Procedures included front-side depth profile using an O2+ primary beam, a 250µ raster, 60% DTOS, and a field aperture. Details are given in [2]. New Data reduction: Two alternate assumptions were used: (1) non-uniformities in SW profiles reflect inhomogenieties in DLC significant for SIMS measurements; (2) variations in (a) relative sensitivity factors (RSFs) for Mg/C  and (b) IMF reflect local variations structure and chemical bonding in both the standard and flown DoS. Local anomalies in Genesis DLC include variable Si background (cf. Fig.1 inset), embedded particulates (rare), density variations, and departures in carbon sp2-sp3 ratios (graphite-diamond)  resulting from annealing during fabrication [3]. To understand these inhomogenieties, we looked at multiple parameters which might reflect variations in local structure in hope of finding correlations. Unfortunately, Si was not included in the 2010 SIMS data. However, SW peak depth and shape parameters; sputtering rates; C cps and C2 cps (normalized to primary beam intensity); etc., were tested for correlations. C2/C is used here.  Results:  Figure 2 shows the entire 2010 data set sorted by the C2/C of the DLC. The error is included in the marker size. SW (25Mg/24Mg) and SW (26Mg/24Mg) pairs are connected by tie lines. The data pair in the oval averaged 3200 C-cps vs. 7700 C-cps. Since Si is an intrinsic, variable contaminant in DLC, and SiC grains have been seen in non-Genesis DLC, this data pair may represent an SiC composition. Perhaps the lower relative C2/C reflects a higher SiC component in the matrix. Data pairs with open markers have variable, unexpectedly shallow SW 24Mg peak depths consistent with the presence of Si. Note: Si could aid sintering in the DLC, making it more dense. The 26Mg/24Mg of open markers increase with decreasing C2. This 26 excess is not explained by any existing model.  However, the only plausible experimental explanation is an unresolved interference (i) at mass 26. i = (28Si12C2)++  seem the most likely, but it remains to be determined whether (SiC2)++ is sufficient in both Fig. 1.

stablity and abundance to explain the observed discrepancy.  The open diamonds with lowest C2/C have anomalously low 25Mg/24Mg: at high matrix Si (SiC), an interference at mass 24 could exist, or there may be non-linear sputtering through carbide grains. Figure 3 illustrates the data reduction of SW (solid markers, Fig. 2). The brown line in Figure 3a is a regression fit of SW 26Mg/24Mg vs. C2/C (R2=0.996); the blue line is half the slope of the regression (the correlation expected from IMF). The fit to  SW 25Mg/24Mg data is estimated. The C2/C of the IMF vs. that of the SW is shown.  Figure 3b plots the apparent fractionation of SW from solar (no IMF) and compares it to the extrapolateed IMF calculated from the standard (all vs. C2/C).  Figure 4 gives the data after IMF subtraction; i.e. fractionation of each (26Mg/24Mg, 25Mg/24Mg) relative to assumed solar (0,0). The red dot is what might be expected from solar physics [after 4].  Synopsis: A new reduction of previously-reported Genesis SW Mg-isotope data gives a (25, 26) fractionation of (-4+8‰, -16+8‰) from assumed solar, where 8%o is the 2σ error of mean plus 2‰, 4‰ (to compensate for error in IMFs of  25Mg/24Mg and 25Mg/24Mg, respectively). This value is consistent with both that calculated from theory [4] and estimated previously from Genesis data [5]. A non-zero isotopic fractionation less than theoretical was assumed in order to interpret Genesis solar oxygen isotopes [1].  Features of Genesis DoS make it tempting for isotopic analyses by SIMS. However, data from both standard-implants and flown collectors also suggest significant issues: e.g., spatial variation in IMF, variable Si concentrations, occasional Mg contamination at periodic annealing layers and small Mg-bearing embedded particulates. These variabilities in the DoS must be accounted for during data reduction.  References: [1] McKeegan K. D. et al. (2011) Sci. 1528-1532. [2] Rieck K. D. (2010) LPS IVI,Abs#2391 [3] Alam T. M. et al.
