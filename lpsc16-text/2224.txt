Sharp.  Using newly derived, high resolution orbital data and coanalyzing integrated datasets from four instruments (CRISM, THEMIS, HiRISE, CTX), we have generated a refined stratigraphy based on geologic and spectral mapping that incorporates observations of prior authors [1-6] while increasing the spatial resolution to discriminate meter-scale features.  Results provide insights into Mt. Sharp's formation and evolution.  Orbital Datasets:  We generated a HiRISE color mosaic (25 cm/pixel), using thirteen color images [7, 8], and a THEMIS thermal inertia mosaic (100 m/pixel), which uses pixel-specific albedo, slope, and elevation as model inputs.  We investigated alongtrack oversampled (ATO) CRISM data that have been regularized in the spectral and spatial dimensions to achieve a spatial resolution of ~12 m/pixel, using an iterative log maximum likelihood method approach [9].  We also utilized existing full resolution targeted (FRT) CRISM images (18 m/pixel), gray scale CTX (6 m/pixel) and HiRISE (25 cm/pixel) basemaps, and associated DEM mosaics (up to 1 m/spacing) that cover the NW quadrant of Mt. Sharp [10].  All datasets were merged into a GIS framework for multi data set analysis. Geologic mapping: Joint analysis of CRISM and TI datasets shows albedo and thermophysical properties are related throughout the lower mound, with discrete clusters corresponding to specific geomorphic units (Fig 1).  One endmember, defined by its high thermal inertia and overall low integrated I/F values corresponds to the "draping unit" in [11].  A second unit, higher on the mound and characterized by equally high thermal inertias but brighter integrated I/F values, has distinct morphology from the first high thermal inertia unit.  The Bagnold dune field is separated by its low thermal inertia and low overall integrated I/F values.  An intermediate cluster of pixels falls halfway between the average Mt. Sharp unit and the Bagnold dune field and is characterized by many sand filled hollows.  The Gale crater upper mound is distinct from the lower mound through its markedly higher TI. These results and previous mapping [1-6] suggest Mt. Sharp can be divided into seven broad units that are delineated by differences in texture, mineralogy, and thermophysical properties (Fig. 2).  From lowest to highest elevation these units are defined as: (1) a basal unit, referred to as the Murray formation (MF), that can be divided into three sub-units based on differences in thermophysical and albedo properties (Fig. 1) and morphology, (2) a phyllosilicate-bearing trough (PT), (3) a hematite capped ridge (HR), (4) a layer between the phyllosilicate trough/hematite ridge and layered sulfate-bearing unit with a unique NIR spectral properties (SS), and (5) a layered unit with spectral signatures of hydrated sulfates (LS).  Transects (Fig. 3) show all of these units are relatively flat lying across ~10 lateral km.  The two additional units defined by much higher thermal inertia (Fig. 1), high TI unit 1 (HTI1) and high TI unit 2 (HTI2), are unconformable with the rest of the lower mound (Fig. 3). Composition: CRISM ATO spectral data show three spatially extensive hematite-bearing outcrops present in lower Mt. Sharp (red outlines, Fig. 2).  These deposits appear to be contained within discrete stratigraphic horizons.  The previously identified hematitecapped ridge is ~300 m above the basal contact of the Murray formation [11] (MOLA elevation -4520 m), shows no evidence of a 1.9 µm hydration feature, and sits atop the phyllosilicate trough [3].  The second two deposits (MH1 and MH2) both occur in the lower Murray formation, ~20 m above the basal contact of the Murray formation (MOLA elevation -4800 m) (Fig. 3).  The larger western deposit (MH1) also lies atop a phyllosilicate deposit, is associated with a 1.9 µm water-OH combination absorption, and has a sharp contact with underlying strata.  Both MH1 and MH2 are associated with well-defined ridges, which are hypothesized to be erosion-resistant fracture fills.  CRISM ATO data also show weak hematite signatures scattered throughout the vicinity of the Murray formation explored by Curiosity, uncorrelated with elevation or obvious changes in HiRISE features but consistent with orbital predictions [4] and recent discoveries by Curiosity [12].  Expansive deposits of hydrated silica are exposed in the walls of an eroding scarp in the vicinity of MH1.  Additionally, there are scattered silica and also phyllosilicate signatures associated with nearby, lowlying bedrock and veins.  This entire area is part of a unique region that is characterized by high TI and strong 1.9 µm absorption.  Additional spectral signatures of hydrated silica are found in isolated outcrops in the Murray formation, again consistent with orbital predictions [2] and ongoing rover analyses [13]. Higher on Mt. Sharp, a layer characterized by a steep spectral slope from 1.3 - 1.6 µm is mapped (pink, Fig. 2).  The data indicate a distinctive composi2224.pdf

tion, resulting from primary mafic minerals [2], ferrous secondary minerals [14], or ferric phases with strong spectral slopes such as present in iron sulfates.   Interpretation and discussion: Thermal models of Gale Crater predict peak temperatures at the base of Mt. Sharp would have once been warm enough to sustain diagenetic fluids when Gale Crater was completely or partially buried in its past [15]. There is also abundant morphologic evidence of secondary processes throughout lower Mt. Sharp, especially in MH1, MF3. The distribution and discrete nature of the hematite deposits and association with possible resistant fracture fills suggests diagenesis likely played some role in their formation.  Either (1) hematite or a precursor iron oxide was an authegenic phase within the Murray formation that then became transformed at select locations to make it spectrally visible to CRISM data (i.e. through coarsening grain sizes [16] or transformation from precursor amorphous phase like ferrihydrite [17]) or (2) hematite was not part of the initial sedimentary mineral assemblage but was later precipitated by diagenetic fluids whose location was determined by stratigraphically controlled, residual matrix porosity or fracture porosity. Detailed textural and chemical analyses from Curiosity will be able to resolve these scenarios.  Variation in TI across Murray unit could be related to regolith/dust cover, although the fact that the two TI groups are also associated with distinct textural and spectral changes supports the hypothesis that differences in TI reflect differences in cementation [18].  These variations could again reflect the role of diagentic processes in shaping Mt. Sharp. References: [1] Anderson, R. and Bell, J.
