Introduction:  Liquid water has profound effects on geologic processes and is central to the search for life on Mars [1]. The strongest evidence for significant liquid water on Mars in recent geologic history is geomorphic: fresh gullies resembling terrestrial aqueous features [2], and annually-growing Recurring Slope Lineae (RSL) interpreted as current liquid flows [3]. However, current activity suggests that gullies can form due to CO2 frost processes. Although the behavior of RSL resembles seepage, processes with minimal water should be considered for their formation.  Gullies:  Martian “gullies” resemble terrestrial alluvial fan systems, with upslope alcoves, channels, and depositional aprons. The channels are the features considered most indicative of aqueous processes. However, channel erosion occurs in the present climate [4], with seasonal timing that suggests that CO2 frost is the key volatile [5]. We have observed mass movements (sometimes multiple flows) at 43 southern-hemisphere non-dune gully monitoring sites (~5x5 km areas), and dune gullies are even more active. As the recurrence interval for activity  at a site appears to be decades to centuries [4], it is likely that most fresh gully sites may be active if monitored for a sufficient timespan.  Some observers suggest that specific morphologies indicate aqueous processes. For instance, leveed lobate flows could indicate major liquid runoff during a recent high-obliquity period [6-7]. Such deposits are rare and we have not seen new examples in gully change observations to date. However, formation of lobate sand deposits with levees has occurred in an equatorial crater (Fig. 1). This location does not have known RSL, so the flow may have formed without volatiles, although trace nocturnal frost is possible.   Figure 1: Formation of leveed flows on an equatorial sand slope near Meroe Patera. Sinuous channels have also been suggested to require wet flows [8]. Previous observations revealed some indications of sinuosity changes [4], but we have now observed more marked development (Fig. 2). This suggests that sinuosity can develop as flows descending an existing channel system impact and erode the outer banks. Terrace formation, also considered indicative of liquid flow [9], has also been observed via local erosion within broader, older channels. Gullies on different terrains are morphologically similar, suggesting a common formation process [10].  Figure 2: Enhancement of channel sinuosity after a gully flow in Matara crater. These observations demonstrate that many finescale aqueous-like features are forming today, at times and places where significant volumes of liquid water are unlikely. This suggests that these features are not diagnostic of present-day or past liquid water. The evidence from gullies is consistent with, though not proof of, minimal liquid over the last several Ma.    RSL:  Following these results from gullies, and considering the difficulty of producing significant volumes of liquid water in the present climate [11], we consider RSL formation processes with minimal water. 2327.pdf

There has been no direct detection of liquid water associated with any RSL, so the evidence for water playing a role is indirect. The seasonal nature of their growth suggests a role for some volatile species, and the gradual growth is consistent with slowly seeping liquid, leading to interpretations of RSL as due to water or brine flow [3, 12-14]. Ojha et al. [15] detected hydrated salts during active periods and suggested that they formed by wet flows. However, thermal analyses have not detected the signature predicted for wet ground [16], although the data is at low resolution. The source of water is also an issue. RSL on isolated peaks argue against a deep groundwater source. Trace deliquescence is likely to occur on Mars [e.g. 17-18], but accumulation of enough water for saturated flow is problematic because of high evaporation during the day. The ability of subsurface hydrated salts to store and release water [19] is still being evaluated.  One possible resolution is for RSL to be effectively dry flows triggered by traces of water. RSL occur on slopes near the angle of repose [3] and only small disturbances would be needed to trigger movement. This could occur via seasonal changes in salt hydration state with associated volume changes, or freezing or boiling of small amounts of deliquesced water [c.f. 20]. Alternatively, insolation and associated thermal effects can provide a lifting force [21]. RSL are not found in dusty regions [12] where this should be most effective, but cohesive forces might be more important for dust.   Regardless of the trigger, nearly-dry RSL are consistent with many observations. Incremental growth could be caused by repeated disturbances in the source area, or by further destabilization of displaced material by diurnal temperature changes. Darkening could be due to grain sorting, consistent with spectral changes [22], or hydrated salts could be stirred up from the shallow subsurface. However, the rapid fading of RSL requires explanation. Fading could be due to dust deposition or changes occurring upon exposure of subsurface material to the atmosphere. RSL colors in HiRISE “IRB” color images sometimes resemble nearby ripple crests, consistent with grain sorting. Anomalous incompletely-fading lineae like those in Aram Chaos [12] could be explained if erasure processes are inefficient. Dry flows could be extensive and transport material across bedrock (observed in Ganges Chasma), or involve only minor shifting of grains propagating downslope. Such a process favors occurrence only on slopes that are near the angle of repose, consistent with observations [3]. Some RSL-like dark striations are also observed on dune slipfaces where grain flows triggered by eolian processes are likely [23].  This model is not without difficulties. RSL with color changes along-length [3,12] suggest minor displacement in some cases, but incremental growth is then puzzling. Some RSL occur on talus slopes [23], although possibly within a fine-grained fraction. Fading timescales are much less than those of slope streaks or crater blast zones [24-25], which likely fade due to dust fallout but may have different roughness properties. RSL that leave bright or HiRISE IRB-green deposits [12] suggest deposition of salts.  Discussion:  This RSL hypothesis posits a type of flow never described on Earth, which makes definitive tests difficult. However, the difficulties associated with producing enough surface water for normal liquid flow on Mars suggest that unusual processes should be considered. Alternatively, the current water cycle on Mars may be poorly understood. RSL-like flows have not been seen on the Moon, suggesting that atmospheric and/or volatile processes are essential. If RSL are neardry, combined with the evidence for CO2-driven gullies, the volumes of liquid on Mars in the geologically recent past may have been minimal, with only traces of deliquesced brine. This would reduce the habitability of the Martian near-surface and affect the treatment of gullies and RSL sites for future exploration.
