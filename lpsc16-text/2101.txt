Introduction: The CK chondrites are one of the most oxidized groups of carbonaceous chondrites, as evidenced by the absence of Fe-Ni metal, high abundances of magnetite and Ni-rich sulfide minerals, and FeO-rich olivine [1,2]. Because magnetite is the primary oxide component in the CK chondrites, it has been extensively studied [e.g., 2]. However, these studies have focused exclusively on the equilibrated (petrologic type 4-6) CK chondrites. Prior to the discovery of Watson 002 in 1991 [3], no type 3 CK chondrites had been identified. Since then, more than twenty CK chondrites have been classified as petrologic type 3. Prior to our study, magnetite compositions had only been reported from two meteorites classified as unequilibrated CK chondrites: Dhofar 015 [4] and Watson 002 [5,6]. Additional analyses are necessary to effectively characterize the range of magnetite compositions in the unequilibrated CK chondrites. This is important because magnetite compositions have been used to argue that the CK chondrites and CV chondrites are derived from the same parent asteroid [5]. In this study we present mineralogical analyses from seven unequilibrated CK chondrites and five equilibrated CK chondrites chondrites (Table 1).  Table 1.

Magnetite in Dhofar 015 was analyzed using an SX-50 at the University of Tennessee [4]. Operating conditions for all samples include 15 kv potential, 20-25 nA beam current (depending on the machine used), and 2 µm beam size. An average of 25 magnetite grains were analyzed per sample. Magnetite Compositions: Magnetite in the unequilibrated (type 3) CK chondrites is rich in chromium, aluminum, and nickel. Average Cr2O3 content ranges from 2.58 - 2.95 wt%, average Al2O3 from 2.72 - 3.24 wt%, and average NiO from 0.30 - 0.37 wt%. Magnetite is also rich in TiO2 and MgO, with average abundances ranging from 0.60 - 0.94 wt% and 0.59 - 0.88 wt%, respectively. In all unequilibrated CK chondrites, MnO is present at abundances ≤0.10 wt% while CoO is below detectable limits (0.02 wt%). V2O3 was analyzed in five of the seven unequilibrated CK chondrites and is present at average abundances ranging from 0.11 - 0.16 wt%.  Generally, average oxide abundances are higher in the unequilibrated CK chondrites than in the equilibrated CK chondrites. The one exception is Cr2O3, which ranges from 3.21 - 4.82 wt% in the equilibrated chondrites. MnO and CaO are both present at average abundances ≤0.10 wt%. V2O3, analyzed only in NWA 4422, has an average abundance of 0.10 wt%. Al2O3 is more heterogeneous than other oxides, with abundances ranging from 0.53 wt% to 1.89 wt%. These abundances are consistent with those measured in previous studies [e.g., 2,5]  All magnetite analyses from our twelve samples, along with magnetite compositions from previously analyzed CK chondrites [2,5,6], are plotted in terms of MgO vs.Cr2O3, TiO2, NiO, and Al2O3 on Figures 1a-d, respectively. As demonstrated in Figures 1 a-d, oxide abundances in equilibrated CK chondrite magnetite plots in a tight clusters that are compositionally distinct from abundances in unequilibrated CK chondrite magnetite. This is true for all oxide abundances vs. MgO (not shown), suggesting that magnetite compositions in the CK chondrites can be used to distinguish between unequilibrated and equilibrated samples.  Dhofar 015: Dhofar 015, which was initially assigned a petrologic subtype of 3.9 based on sharplydefined chondrules, friable matrix, and a large range in feldspar compositions [4], plots firmly in the equilibrated chondrite clusters on all compositional diagrams. The average fayalite content of Dhofar 015 (Fa32) [4] is also consistent with that of the equilibrated chondrites, suggesting that Dhofar 015 is actually an equilibrated CK chondrite, despite its nebular features [4].  2101.pdf

Open squares represent previously published data [2,5,6].  Magnetite as an Indicator of Equilibration: Magnetite compositions provide a simple mechanism for determining if a sample is equilibrated, which is particularly useful for samples like Dhofar 015, where textural evidence of equilibration may be difficult to distinguish between type 3.9 or type 4. We have not observed any relationship between magnetite compositions and petrologic type once equilibration is reached (type 4), so magnetite compositions do not appear to be an appropriate indicator of petrologic type within the equilibrated CKs. However, petrologic type can be determined instead using other variables, such as the extent of matrix and chondrule recrystallization [7,8]. Although based on texture, Dhofar 015 is petrologic type 3-4, its magnetite compositions suggest that it is an equilibrated CK.  References: [1] Kallemeyn G.W. et al. (1991) GCA, 55, 881-892.
