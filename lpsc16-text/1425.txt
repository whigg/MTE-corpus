Introduction:  The broadest application of intracrystalline Fe2+-Mg partitioning between the M1 and M2 crystallographic sites in the pyroxene structure is the determination of the closure temperature (Tc) of the Fe2+-Mg exchange reaction that provides important constraint on the cooling rate of the pyroxene-bearing host rocks (eg. [1]). Although this approach has been successfully developed and applied for orthopyroxene and pigeonite-bearing rocks, relatively few data are available for clinopyroxenes (cpxs). The most recent calibration for cpxs has been obtained by [2]. Calculations performed for cpxs in some Earth and planetary contexts, provided (i) Tc consistent among different samples and coherent with their respective geological setting; (ii) cooling rates for different samples from the same context in significant disagreement one to another. [3] showed that the relative low Tc calculated for augite from Miller Range nakhlite (MIL 03346) using the available geothermometers would correspond to a slow cooling rate inconsistent with the petrologic evidence for an origin from a fast-cooled lava flow. In order to account for these discrepancies [4] performed an ex situ equilibrium annealing study on augite crystals from Miller Range 03346 nakhlite (MIL 03346, Fs24). This calibration has been then applied also to the augite from Theo’s Flow always regarded as the terrestrial analogue for MIL03346. With the new calibration it is clear that the nakhlites Tc is about 600°C thus lower than that of 720°C  for TS7  sample, which was supposed to be cooled at a burial depth of 85m. However, despite the similar geological setting, the difference in Tc could be just ascribed to the differences in Fe content that may affect the Mg-Fe equilibrium behaviour. Aim:  Therefore, we have carried out a new equilibrium annealing experiments at 800, 900 and 1000°C in order to obtain a new geothermometric calibration for the  Fe-poor augite from Theo’s Flow (Fs9). This new calibration will enable us to evaluate the compositional effects (mainly Fe content) by comparison with the data previously obtained on augite from MIL 03346 sample.  Experimental:  The annealing experiments have been carried out at 800, 900 and 1000°C using TS7 N.16 crystal until the equilibrium in the Fe2+-Mg exchange reaction was reached. The crystal was sealed into a silica vial, after alternate flushing with nitrogen and evacuating, together with an iron-wustite buffer to control the oxygen fugacity fO2. Inside the silica tube, the crystal and the buffer were put into two small separate Pt crucibles to avoid contact between them. After equilibrium in the Fe-Mg exchange reaction was reached, quenching was performed by dropping the tubes into cold water. Further details on the annealing protocol used are given in [3, 5]. HR-SC-XRD data (i.e. up to 0.434 Å-1) were collected on crystal TS7 N. 16 before and after each annealing experiment using a three-circle Bruker AXS SMART APEX diffractometer, equipped with a CCD detector and 0.3 mm MonoCap collimator (graphite-monochromatized MoKa radiation, λ = 0.71073Å operating 55 kV, 30 mA) following the same procedure described in [3]. After the annealing experiments Electron Microprobe Analysis (EMPA) have been carried out on the same crystal. Results:  The Fe2+-Mg ordering state was estimated from the site population determined as in [3]. The intracrystalline distribution coefficient (kD), was calculated using the same expression adopted by [2]: kD = ([Fe2+ M1][MgM2]/ [Fe2+ M2][MgM1]). The obtained kD values are 0.052, 0.071, 0.096, 0.120 for the natural sample and the three temperatures (800, 900 and 1000°C) respectively. These results are represented together with those obtained on MIL 03346 in Figure 1.  Figure 1. LnkD versus 1000/T (K) for the augite samples considered in this work together with those by [4, 5].

Conclusions:  It is clear from Figure 1 that there is no effect on the equilibrium behavior (i.e. closure temperature) arising from the different Fe contents. Therefore it has been possible to calculate a single calibration equation valid for augites with composition ranging between Fs9 and Fs24. The resulting equation is:  lnkD = -4136(±142)/T(K) + 1.18(±0.13) (R2=0.992). However, it cannot be excluded the possible role of Fe content on the kinetic behavior. Therefore, while the closure temperature can be reliably determined using the geothermometer here reported the cooling rate calculation still require new kinetic data for clinopyroxenes.
