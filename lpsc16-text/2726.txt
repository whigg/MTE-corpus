EVIDENCE FOR AN IMPACT ORIGIN FOR SEDIMENTS IN GALE CRATER, MARS. D. M. Burt1 and L.P. Knauth2, 1,2ASU School of Earth and Space Exploration, P.O. Box 871404, Tempe, AZ 85287-1404,1dmburt@asu.edu; 2Knauth@asu.edu.Introduction: The Curiosity Rover (Mars ScienceLaboratory or MSL) on Mars has, since 2012/08/06,been traversing what was, well before its landing [1],interpreted from orbital data to be the distal end of abasin-filling alluvial fan near the bottom of Gale Crateron Mars, where erosion, transport, and deposition wereassumed to have been carried out by water or wind.Not surprisingly, all rocks observed directly by MSL todate have been classified according to this narrow priorexpectation [2][3], that is, as aeolian (if fine-grainedand cross-bedded), alluvial (if coarser grained, whetherrounded and sorted or not), or lacustrine (if extremelyfine-grained, whether bedded or not). This classification appears to have been based almost entirely on depositional features such as bedding and grain size.Numerous features that appear to conflict withthese narrow terracentric interpretations appear to havebeen ignored or discounted, as have been alternativedepositional processes that might be particularly appropriate for early Mars, such as deposition by mass wasting of crater walls (e.g., long run-out debris or mudflows) or deposition by regional- or planet-modifyingimpact cratering. Discounting the influence of widespread impact cratering on early Mars seems particularly surprising, inasuch as cratering is the dominantsurface-modifying process in the solar system and remains a dominant geomorphic agent on Mars.Contradictions in the Existing Gale Interpretation: The main aspect of the Gale rocks that seem tocontradict the terracentric story is their mineralogy andgeochemistry. All of the Gale Rocks apparently hadabout the same primary mineralogy and geochemistry,corresponding to typical martian basalt (and alkalinedifferentiates) [4]. Primary compositional differencescan be interpreted as resulting primarily from differential physical sorting of grains of diffent types [4]. Mineralogical and geochemical features involving waterapparently originated after sediment deposition, that is,diagenetically only. These postdepositional aqueousprocesses were, for the most part, limited in effect andextent and consisted mainly of disseminated clay minerals and salt growths (visible as crystal pseudomorphsand dendritic concretions) in fine-grained rocks andlate salts, mainly Ca-sulfates, growing in fractures.Postdepositional surfical alteration (to silicic compositions) apparently also occurred extremely locally, alongfractures and in one unit, possibly caused by acid surficial fluids [5]. Similar post-depositional silicic surfacealteration was seen by MER-A near Home Plate in Gusev Crater.These features, in that they all occured after deposition, appear to conflict with the terracentric story.Where is the geochemical and mineralogical evidencefor initial weathering to mud-sized particles, and for alteration by the flowing and standing water of streamsand lakes?Basalts on Earth tend to react extremely rapidlywith naturally acidic waters to form clay minerals, farmore rapidly than terrestrial rocks that are richer in Siand Al. On Mars the ancient atmosphere is believed tohave consisted mainly of acid-generating CO2 with variable SO2, so that ancient martian waters should havebeen even more acidic and reactive than terrestrialwaters. Why were there no aqueous chemical reactionsto clays until, apparently, after sediment deposition?Was it too cold? If so, note that the authors [3] goto great lengths to exclude periglacial climates as having contributed significantly to Gale sedimentary features (e.g., there are no observed traces of ice wedges,moraines, or lacustrine dropstones), although, in an apparent inconsistency, they compare a small outcrops offine layering to varves in a periglacial lake.In this regard, shale, made up predominantly of fineclay minerals, is the normal lake or alluvial plain sediment on Earth; it seems to be completely lacking in thefine-grained so-called lacustrine mudstones of GaleCrater, which, by mineralogy and geochemistry, couldhave been deposited nearly anhydrously (i.e., as martian dust). Shale observations also seem to be lackinganywhere else in Gale Crater.Multiple other contradictions exist. Why are thepresumed aeolian deposits (as in the 0.7 m thick"Shaler outcrop" ) quite thin, relatively poorly sorted,intimately interbedded with supposed fluvial deposits,and typified only by low-angle crossbeds? These features seem atypical for aeolian deposits, including inthose dunes currently being traversed by MSL.Why did the postulated streams (based on orbitaldata) never produce, at any scale, diagnostic lateral andvertical sedimentary facies variations, such as exposedflow channels containing gravels, despite abundant exposures of gravelly rocks? Why did the putative standing lake waters that were interpreted as having dried upmultiple times never leave diagnostic dessicationcracks or discrete evaporitic salt layers, not to mentionpaleo-shorelines?2726.pdf

Why is there absolutely no evidence of dewateringtextures (such as load casts, a type of soft-sediment deformation resulting from uneven compressional dewatering) in any of the sediments that were interpreted hashaving been under water when deposited and as havingundergone compressive dewatering afterwards? Suchobvious features would be present in almost any sequence of terrestrial sediments deposited and dewatered under the postulated water-soaked conditions.Impact Sedimentation: An Alternative Interpretation: A viable alternative to making early martiansedimentation extremely earth-like and wet is to consider sedimentation resulting from distal impact processes. Impacts and secondary impacts on the airlessMoon produced ground hugging debris flows thatsurged outward for up to 600 km [6]. Their seismicwaves generated long runout landslides from the wallsof older craters. Impacts on objects with a significantatmosphere, such as that of early Mars, or signicantsubsurface volatiles, also produce base surges (a fartravelling type of density current somewhat analogousto a terrestrial dust storm) that can generate the extremely pervasive low-angle crossbedding observednow by all three rovers [7][8]. The full range of basaltic grain sizes, glassy tectites and glass fragments, shattered and shatter-coned rocks, metallic meteorite fragments, and a variety of melt spherules and accretionarylapilli that resemble concretions are also produced byimpacts, and most have already been reported from inside Gale Crater [9]. Note that the volatile-rich andsalt-rich nature of the Martian surface implies a greatervolume of impact-generated glass on Mars than on themuch drier Moon, because these components act as natural fluxes.The current attempt to totally terrestrialize ancientMars depositional environments therefore appears tobe completely unnecessary. Everything observed so farin Gale Crater is consistent with known impact and other blast processes followed by minor amounts of surface and subsurface aqueous alteration (includinghighly local acid alteration and leaching, itself possiblygenerated by condensation of impact-generated S-richvapors). None of the contradictions mentioned above(fresh basaltic compositions, even for "muds", climateinconsistencies, post-depositional aqueous alterationonly, and that relatively localized and minor, lack of diagnostic depositional and post-depositional featuresthat would indicate the assumed aqueous depositionalenvironments) apply if impact sedimentation is responsible for the sequence of beds.Impact-derived deposition (the blast bed hypothesis[8]) also accounts for relatively abrupt grain-size variations in outcrops, relatively poor sorting, even in"muds" and supposedly aeolian sands, highly variablerounding in gravels, extensive sequences of beds withoriginal dips (draped-over and plastered-on"sticky" sequences), high contents of grains that appear amorphous or glassy (impact glasses [10]), localized-onlypost-depositional clay minerals and related amorphousphases (preferentially altering olivine and metastableimpact-derived basaltic glass), the ubiquity of low-angle cross-beds in beds covering a wide range of grainsizes (although high-angle cross-beds can form locallyunder favorable conditions), planar rather than channel-shaped scours (unconformities caused by energeticlater impacts), local beds with shrinkage cracks causedby cooling and/or dehydration, and so on.Conclusions: For the above reasons, the thick sequence of beds observed to date inside Gale Cratermay well be an ideal place to study details of an impact-dominated stratigraphic succession virtually unhindered by the tectonic, weathering, and diageneticprocesses that have erased or obscured such ancientsections from early Earth. Once formed, the deep depression of Gale Crater probably acted as a natual trapfor density currents derived from various-sized impactsover the full history of Mars, although later ones mayhave been scoured away by deflation. It may even preserve a record of impact sedimentation that occurred asMars was losing most of its atmosphere.As others have hypothesized [1], there may well bean aeolian-dominant succession of strata higher in thestatigraphic section in Gale. If there is an aqueously-deposited (rather than altered) part of the section, it apparently hasn't yet been encountered. If it is present, itprobably underlies the part of the section that the Curiosity rover has been able to examine, and drillingwould be needed to explore it.References: [1] Anderson R.B. and Bell III J.F.(2010) Mars J. 5, 76.
