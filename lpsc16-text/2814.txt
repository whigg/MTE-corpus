Introduction:  Magellan radar images [1] of the Venusian surface have revealed the presence of complex and compound channels, as well as rectangular, labyrinthic, and pitted valley networks that were most likely formed by low-viscosity lavas [2]. The surface temperature on Venus is ~740 K and the surface pressure is ~9.8 MPa [3]; liquid water at these temperatures and pressures would be unstable [2].  Venusian "valley networks" are troughs with integrated branching, probably indicating formation by processes that include sapping and fluid flow. They are believed to have been formed by lavas with viscosities approaching that of water and proposed compositions of silicate (mafic to ultramafic, or mafic alkaline) to carbonatite or sulfur [4] (Fig. 1).   "Complex" and "compound" channels (also likely formed by low viscosity lavas) have previously been qualitatively categorized based on their planform morphologies [4].  They are typically sinuous with an approximately constant width, and commonly contain branching segments, streamlined islands, and bedforms signifying formation by fluid flow [3, 5] (Fig. 1).  With the exception of 6 recently analyzed channels [6], there has been little quantitative analysis of the planform morphology of these Venusian channels and valley networks [2]. Combined with morphological data from terrestrial lava channels and tubes, and fluvial and glacial drainage networks on Earth, a comparison of quantitative morphometric data gathered from Venusian channels and valley networks has the potential to provide a better understanding of the rheology and behavior of the responsible lavas on its surface.  This can also provide a foundation for comparison of the morphometric properties of drainage networks formed by more exotic fluids on other bodies in the solar system, such as the hydrocarbon drainage networks on Titan [7].  We hypothesize that fluids with distinct rheologies create drainage networks with distinct planform morphologies.  Numerical and analog simulations demonstrate that rheology does indeed play a strong role in controlling lava flow morphology, flow path, and branching [8, 9, 10].  Data collected of valley networks and complex/compound channels on Venus's surface can be used for a quantitative comparison of planform morphologic differences between drainage networks with different drainage network-forming fluids.   Methodology: Magellan Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data (12.6 cm wavelength, 120-160m surface resolution, <50m vertical resolution [1]) were used for morphometric analysis of features on Venus.  Twelve venusian valley networks identified by Komatsu et al. [4] were analyzed, along with 38 additional compound and complex lava channels. ImageJ [http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/] was used to measure angles of juncture for the Venusian valley networks and channels.  Channel lengths and shortest path lengths for complex and compound channels were also measured using an ImageJ plugin called NeuronJ [http://www.imagescience.org/meijering/software/neur onj/], which automatically identified the position of a channel wall by searching for the pixels that most likely belonged to the channel wall.   Planform Measurements:  Bright/dark pixel pairings within the Magellan SAR images were used to identify the presence of a channel or valley network wall (Fig.1).  When measuring channel length, breaks and discontinuities in a network where channel walls could not be confidently identified were not measured.  Channel segments that were too narrow (generally < Figure 1:  Orange lines indicate the location of junction angle measurements, dark features indicate low radar backscatter.  a)  A complex channel (11.5째S,67째E).

Channel length measurements for the main venusian channels and their branches were categorized and analyzed separately.  Channel segments (separated by branching) that are <10 km long were ignored. Actual and shortest path channel lengths for the venusian channel segments were used to calculate sinuosity.  Junction angles measured for venusian lava channels were assumed to be distributary branching, and were measured along the interior walls of the branching channels. Flow direction for venusian valley networks was locally difficult to determine, and inferences were made based on features surrounding the valley network, and the locations of any lava channels that initiated from the valley networks.  Topographic data was not useful: longitudinal profiles for longer Venusian channels known as canali commonly show evidence of tectonic deformation after initial channel formation [11]. The morphology of any streamlined islands was used to infer flow direction. Many channel networks also contained irregular depressions or valley networklike sections at one end and/or smaller scale (with a channel width usually ~0.1 km to 0.4 km wide) branching at the other end.  We inferred that the irregular depressions reveal channel sources and the smallscale branching the terminating end of the channel network [5, 12].   Preliminary Results:  Measurements are summarized in Figure 2.  Median values for both junction angles and sinuosities are similar between channel network categories. Junction angle medians are also relatively similar between valley network categories, but noticeably differ from the medians for the channels.  Junction angle distributions for channels appear to generally be skewed toward larger angles, whereas those for valley networks appear to be more variable.  Median values for channel sinuosity, while slightly lower, still appear to be similar to the median value for lunar sinuous rilles [13]. Future Work: These results will be combined with analyses of terrestrial fluvial and lava drainage networks, as well as analyses of hydrocarbon drainage networks on Titan.
