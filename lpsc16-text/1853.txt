However the formation of  molecules  of  biological  interest  requires  first, concentration  of the  primary molecules  in  order  for reactions to start [1,2]. Liquid and solid environments in the universe are consequently more appropriate. A second requirement for synthesis of peptide like molecules  seems to be the presence of CO instead of CO2 [3]. Carbon monoxide is widely present in the gas phase. However its concentration might be higher inside veins of rocks or faults, niches and cavities [2]. Question is: how CO can be formed in a rocky world?  I  call  geobiotropy the  process  of  physicochemical  evolution  from the  world of rocks towards the  world  of  molecules  of  biological  interest. Geobiotropy  is  a  word  constructed  with  the  greek word  ἡ  trop  , ή used by Platon and Aristote to mean evolution. This process is developed below.Results and Discussion:  CO has been experimentally formed through hydrogenation of CO2 in a flow of H2 at  500°C  and  atmospheric  pressure  [4].  It  is  also produced at 300°C and 350 bar [5] or in supercritical water  [6]   It  is  consequently  necessary  to  consider local  heat  and  local  physico-chemical  conditions instead of global ones. Questions become: where in a rocky world are found high concentrations of H2? and which  elementary  reactions  could  produce  enough heat to transform CO2 into CO? Rocks  such  as  peridotites,  gabbros  and basalts,  which  contain  ferromagnesian  minerals,  can thermodynamically  evolve in  the  presence  of liquid H2O  and  dissolved  CO2,  towards  the  formation  of prebiotic molecules [7-9]. Some elementary reactions are  exothermic  and  produce  serpentine  and carbonates:  such  are  hydrolyses  of  enstatite  and forsterite  and  carbonations  of  both  iron  and magnesium  olivine  and  pyroxene.  Heat  locally released from these exothermic reactions can  induce the endothermic production of H2 which in turn reacts with  CO2 in  hydrothermal  conditions  to  form  CO. Excitation  by gamma  rays  [10]  or  cosmic  radiation would consecutively produce prebiotic molecules.This process of H2 production requires liquid water and  a  triggering  process  which  allows to  overcome activation energies of the exothermic reactions. Up to now, water in the universe was considered mostly in solid and gas phases. However local events [9] might induce physico-chemical conditions where water is in liquid  or  supercritical  states  and  that  produce sufficient  heat  to  overcome  activation  energies.  A recent experiment  on forsterite exposed to water and carbon  dioxide shows deposits  of magnesite  crystals and quartz particles, at 120°C and 80 bar of CO2. [11]. Consequently local  heating  processes around  120°C, 80  bar  are  sufficient  to  trigger  the  exothermic carbonation  reactions.  In  this  local  context, ferromagnesian  rocks  can  evolve  towards  the formation of CO.  Signatures of such geological origin of biomolecules might consequently be, serpentine and or  talc,  associated  with  iron  and  magnesium carbonates [7-9]. I  analyze  [7-9]  the   thermodynamic equilibrium E-pH diagrams constructed for iron, water and dissolved carbon dioxide at different temperatures and pressures and I deduce equation 1:2FeII +2H+➙2FeIII +H2      T=350°C  pH 11.5-14   (1)H2 seems released for T and P values near the critical point  of water and for high pH values, 11.5-14. This observation might explain the laboratory values of pH, 9.7-12.2 and [H2] up to 76 mmol.kg-1 obtained when peridotite  reacts  with  water  at  200°C  and  500bar during  3-7  months  [12].  It  might  contribute  to  the explanation  of the  high  pH, 9-11,  of the  Lost  City hydrothermal  vent   located  at  800m  depth,  where rocks  are  highly  serpentinized,  chimneys  are  in carbonates,  temperature  are  reported  to attain  90°C, and  [H2]  increases  up  to  15mmol.kg-1 [13,14]. Elevated production of H2 seems to occur in ultrabasic environments, for  HTHP water up to the supercritical  point.  Such  areae  might  be  around  the  heating processes cited above [9], either on Earth or Mars and extraterrestrial objects. I  analyze  [7-9]  also  the  E-pH  diagrams constructed  at  250°C  for  ternary  systems  Fe-S-H2O and I construct equation 2:3FeS +4H2O ➙Fe3O4 +3SH2 +H2 pH 3.5-8,    T=250°C     (2)I discuss these equations here.  SH2 release occurs at lower pH  as a consequence of the evolution of FeS. This  observation  might  explain  the  Rainbow 1853.pdf

hydrothermal  site  where  pH 4.97  and  T  370°C  are measured at Auberge vent [15]. Equation  2  might  also  explain  the  effects produced by the fall of the asteroid near  Chelyabinsk in  February 2013  [16].  In  the  recovered  meteorites, olivine  and  pyroxene  seem to  be not  serpentinized, troilite grains FeS are abundant and a great amount of CHNO  and  CHOS  organic  molecules  have  been discovered. Sulfur smells and heat are witnessed  and anomalies in magnetization are described. Reaction 2 would contribute to explain not only the sulfur smell,  but also the anomalies in magnetization which might  be introduced by the synthesis  and  deposit  of Fe3O4. And also the H2  produced might  induce formation of organic molecules as described above. Another application of equation 2 is the belt of sulfates discovered on Mars [17]. By superposition of this belt on the USGS geological map of Mars, we see  that  it  follows  exactly  Valles  Marineris  until Meridiani  Planum.  In  Meridiani  Planum   haematite and magnetite have been detected in association with olivine and pyroxene and no serpentine [18]. The belt continues  into  Terra  Sirenum  and,  to  some  extent, seems  to follow the banded structure of the magnetic field [19].Equation  2 predicts  that  hydrolysis of troilite  would lead  to  the  formation  of  H2S,  magnetite  and  H2. Magnetization anomalies might be contributed by the synthesized  FeIII  ions,  and  sulfates  deposits  by the radiolytic  sulfur  cycle showing the  action  of cosmic radiation on water and sulfur grains,  sulfur ions and H2S. It  would consequently be appropriate  to search for  some  remaining  troilite  in  Terra  Sirenum  and along Valles Marineris until Meridiani Planum. In the context of geobiotropy, evolution from the Rainbow floor,  the Chelyabinsk asteroid and  the the  path  Meridiani  Planum,  Valles  Marineris,  up to Terra  Sirenum on Mars,  start  not  with  ferrosilicates but with ferrosulfide. Another signature for synthesis of molecules of biological interest might consequently be the presence of troilite associated with magnetite or FeIII ions. A  third  signature  of  the  rocky  world  to predict a possibility of geobiotropy is the presence of radioactive rocks at the origin of water radiolysis.  It is discussed  [20,10,21,9]  that  whenever  radionuclides such as U, Th, or K, are present,  there is enough H2 available through water radiolysis to produce CO from CO2 in  a  locally warm environment,  which  in  turn,  will  produce biological  molecules after  excitation  by gamma rays. It seems appropriate to search for shortlived  now-extinct  radionuclides  and  also  long-lived ones . Conclusion: The  described  thermodynamics  of elementary  chemical  evolution  of  ferromagnesian, ferrosulfide  and  radioactive rocks,  associated to the analyses  of  oxydo-reduction  diagrams,  allow  the determination  of  three  kinds  of  signatures  for geobiotropy on Earth  or extraterrestrial  objects. Such signatures  might  be iron  and  magnesium carbonates in  association  with  serpentine  and/or  talc,  or troilite located  in  ancient  water  areae  and  associated  with magnetite or FeIII ions, or long-lived and now extinct radionuclides.References: [1] Bassez M.
