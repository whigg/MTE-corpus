Introduction:  Measurements of the physical properties of meteorites are essential to help determine the physical characteristics of the parent asteroids. The study of the physical properties can also provide information that is useful to the understanding of meteoroid behavior in the atmosphere and help determine methods to deflect potentially hazardous asteroids.  A large variety of material enters the atmosphere as seen by the over 45 classes of meteorites [1].  Only stony and iron meteorites play a greater relevance to planetary defense because of their quantity and/or likelihood of making it to the ground.  Our initial focus is on ordinary chondrites because they make up most of the meteorites, over 70% [2]. At Ames Research Center the Asteroid Threat Assessment Project (ATAP) has been set up to investigate the full risk and outcomes that near Earth asteroids pose to the planet.  One of the tasks of this program is to study the physical properties of meteorites that pertain to atmospheric entry. We are assembling a laboratory that will perform a large suite of measurements on the same samples.  To date, we have developed methods for density, porosity, acoustic velocity, and emissivity, and currently working of equipment to measure specific heat and thermal conductivity. Procedure:  The physical properties of over 15 ordinary chondrites have been studied by non-destructive methods.  Each meteorite is weighed and 3D scanned by a NextEngine to obtain volume and density.  For the other tests conducted, two 1.5 cm cubes are made from each meteorite. Grain density is then determined by a Quantachrome gas pycnometer using nitrogen gas displacement.  From both bulk and grain density the porosity of each sample is calculated.  The acoustic velocity, both the longitudinal and shear wave, are measured using an Olympus 45-MG meter.  Thermal properties currently studied are emissivity, thermal conductivity, and heat capacity.  For the thermal measurements the range studied is from 20 up to a maxium of atmospheric entry temperatures.  Emissivity requires a broad range of measurements for future modeling conducted by the ATAP group.  Emissivity data is based on averaged measurements over the wavelength range of 8 to 14 µm. Physical Properties Data:  The first meteorite analyzed as part of this study is Tamdakht, a H5 ordinary chondrite observed fall from 2008. Density and Porosity.  The understanding of the physical history of meteorites, and possible the asteroid parent body, is primarily done by measuring density and porosity.   It can also provide clues to the physical environment in which the meteorite was lithified and how it evolved.  Density and porosity are key determinants in meteor behavior in the atmosphere and deflection [3].  Table 1:  Densities and porosity for  H chondrite averages and both pieces of Tamdakht.

Acoustic Velocity.  This parameter provides an insight into the wave propagation through a meteorite, its internal structure, and porosity.  The range of longitudinal velocities in H chondrites is 2.66 to 6.99 mm/µs [5,6].  This range is based on data published on only eight meteorites. Tamdakht has a much lower longitudinal velocity than the normal rage.  One possibility for this is that it has a higher porosity than the average H chondrite.  The velocity is consistent across all three axes in both samples (Table 2).  The one exception to this is the slightly slower velocity in the x-axis for cube #2.  This has been attributed to a fracture on the axis face upon examination of the cube's surface. 2642.pdf

Table 2: Acoustic velocity for Tamhakht. Measurements are made in three axes to understand any possible internal structure differences caused by voids and fractures. Tamdakht cube X-axis (mm/µs) Y-axis (mm/µs) Z-axis (mm/µs) 1	   1.17±0.03	   1.13±0.01	   1.13±0.02	  2	   1.01±0.02	   1.15±0.02	   1.14±0.03	  Emissivity.  The calculated emissivity range for ordinary chondrites is 0.984 to 0.991 at 20 °C [7].  The two samples of Tamdakht have emissivity values of 0.993±0.003 (cube #1) and 0.9911±0.0001 (cube #2) at 20 °C.  Tamdakht is on the high end of the emissivity range for H chondrites.  It can be observed in Figure 2 that the emissivity of Tamdakht decreases by roughly 0.06 when heated to 45 °C.  The emissivity of the heated samples stays consistent at this lower value up to near 200 °C within error.  Figure 2:  Emissivity measurements for Tamdakht from 20 to 180 °C.  The H chondrite average is composed of: ALHA 77299 (H3), Marilia (H4), two samples of Millen (H4), ALHA 77294 (H5), São Jose do Rio Preto (H5), Uberaba (H5), Ucera (H5), and ALHA 77271.  The error bars on the 20 °C data points are smaller than the symbol. Thermal Conductivity and Heat Capacity.  The thermal conductivity of meteorites is significantly lower than that of pure minerals that the meteorite is composed.  The pure minerals are a factor of at least three greater [8].  Only one large study of meteorites' thermal conductivity has been conducted to date and that shows the range at 300 K to be 0.632 to 3.54 W/(m-K) for H chondrites [6].  The average H chondrite thermal conductivity is 2.48 W/(m-K) [1].  Most studies deal with temperatures up to about 300 K, in these the conductivity value peaks around 100 K and then slowly decrease as temperature increases.  Iron is a major constituent to ordinary chondrites.  Beyond 300 K the conductivity of iron rapidly decreases, but after 1000 K it steadily increase.  It is logical to assume that the thermal conductivity of meteorites would behave the same way. Heat capacity is mostly affected by the mineralogical make up of the meteorites.  In the case of the H chondrites the capacity range is 487 to 502 J/(kg-K) at 200 K [9].  It has been determined that heat capacity for H chondrites rapidly increases as temperature increases until a leveling off between 500 and 600 K [6]. Conclusions: The properties of density, porosity and emissivity (at 20 °C), Tamdakht match to a typical ordinary chondrite.  For heated emissivity, below 200 °C, stays constant at a slight decrease from room temperature.  The oddity of Tamdakht is the longitudinal wave velocity.  The difference in the x-axis on cube 2 is caused by a fracture on the surface.  The higher than average porosity is the most likely cause of some of the depressed acoustic velocity.  A CT scan of the cubes is required to rule out additional fractures. We are working towards adding further measurements to the laboratory's portfolio and to begin a major study of 27 Antarctic meteorites. References: [1] Sears D.W.G. et al.
