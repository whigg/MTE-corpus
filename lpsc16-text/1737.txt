This presentation focuses  on the surface  compositions of  thetwo largest bodies, Pluto and Charon.New Horizons' primary instrument for mapping surface compositions is Ralph, a near-infrared spectral imager paired with a CCD camera system [2].   Ralph'sLinear Etalon Imaging Spectral Array (LEISA) component provides spectral coverage from 1.25 – 2.5 µm, ata resolving power (λ/Δλ) of 240.  The Multi-spectralVisible Imaging Camera (MVIC) includes 4 CCD arrays  with  affixed  interference  filters  covering  wavelengths from “BLUE” (400-550 nm), through “RED”(540-700 nm), “NIR” (780-975 nm), and a methane absorption band “CH4” (860-910 nm).  Ralph normallyoperates in a scanning mode with the spacecraft sweeping its field of view across the scene, to accumulate thedata needed to assemble a multi-wavelength image.Pluto:  MVIC color imaging of Pluto's encounterhemisphere  (the  anti-Charon  hemisphere)  at  700  m/pixel resolution reveals a  latitude-dependent  distribution  of  colors  (Fig. 1).   An equatorial  belt  of  dark,heavily-cratered,  reddish  terrain  exemplified  byCthulhu Regio1 gives  way to  lighter  reddish  terrainsthat  grade into a neutral  mid-latitude belt  and finallygolden hues at the pole (Lowell Regio).  This latitudinal  pattern  is  dramatically interrupted  by the  bright,heart-shaped Tombaugh Regio (TR).LEISA spectral imaging of Pluto at 6 to 7 km/pixelresolution reveals the encounter hemisphere to be dominated by volatile ices of N2, CO, and CH4, along withnon-volatile  (at  least  at  Pluto  temperatures)  components including H2O and tholins [3].  The spatial distributions of these materials (Fig. 2) are highly revealing.The most volatile of Pluto's ices (N2 and CO) are especially prevalent in the western half of TR, the strikinglyflat Sputnik Planum (SP).  SP occupies a large basinlike  feature  a  few km below surrounding elevations.The high mobility of N2 and CO ices enables SP's surface to refresh itself sufficiently rapidly that no impactcraters are seen there [4].  This likely occurs through acombination of solid state convective overturning (as1 All place names throughout this abstract and the associated talk are informal.Fig. 2.

evidenced  by  the  presence  of  cellular  patterns  on  ascale of tens of km) and sublimation/ condensation (asevidenced  by  regular  patterns  of  pits  and  ridges  onscales of 102 to 103 m).  N2 ice also appears in mid-latitude topographic lows, such as the floors of craters.CH4 ice is less volatile than N2 and CO ices at Plutosurface temperatures, but it is still mobile.  CH4 occurson SP, but it is also seen in other regions where N2 andCO absorptions are less evident, including the northernpolar region, the eastern half of TR, and along the periphery of the dark, red, equatorial terrains.  In manyareas,  CH4 appears  to  favor topographically high regions.  Its propensity to condense on ridges could playan important role in constructing the bizarre bladed terrain seen in Tartarus Dorsa.The characteristic absorptions of non-volatile H2Oice are most evident at latitudes below about 30° (except for TR).   H2O can be discerned across much ofCthulhu Regio, and also in a few isolated spots, such asVirgil  Fossa and Viking Terra.   In  many of these regions, H2O absorption is associated with reddish tholincoloration.  Since both are  inert,  H2O ice and tholincould have similar geological behaviors on Pluto, possibly  including  aeolian  transport  or  mobilization  byvolatile ice glaciation.  But in another  isolated H2Orich  region  around  Pulfrich  crater,  the  reddish  coloration is lacking, so the two materials are not alwaysassociated.For  structural  integrity,  rugged mountains like alIdrisi and Zheng-He should be composed of H2O ice[1], but they show relatively weak H2O spectral signatures.  Evidently their H2O is partially hidden beneath aveneer  of  more  volatile  ices.   Geochemically,  H2Oshould be ubiquitous.  It  likely makes up the bulk ofPluto's mantle [5].  Although H2O should be geologically inert at such low temperatures, it is clearly participating in Pluto's  active geology,  appently enabled  bythe action of the more volatile ices on it.Charon: Whereas Pluto's H2O ice is sculpted andat least partially veiled by more volatile ices, Charon'sheavily  cratered  H2O  ice  is  exposed  for  all  to  see(Fig. 3).  H2O ice bands at 1.5, 1.65, and 2 µm, whichare characteristic of cold, crystalline ice, are seen everywhere on Charon's encounter hemisphere.  But despite being ubiquitously coated in H2O ice,  the samematerial that dominates the surfaces of numerous comparably-sized satellites of Saturn and Uranus, Charonmanages to be unique among icy satellites.Charon's north polar region is strikingly red.  Thisarea, Mordor Macula, is likely the result of the uniquethermal environment of Charon's poles, which becomeexceptionally cold during the long, dark winters.  Extremely low temperatures enable volatiles such as CH4that would not otherwise be stable on Charon's surfaceto become temporarily cold trapped as ices.   FrozenCH4 can be very rapidly radiolytically processed in situinto heavier and less volatile molecules that are precursors to tholins [3,6].Charon  also  exhibits  a  weak  NH3 absorption  atabout  2.22 µm, as  known from Earth-based  observations [7,8,9,10].   This  absorption band is seen to  bestrongest in a few isolated regions, most strikingly Organa crater.  It is possible that this particular crater istoo young for NH3 excavated from Charon's subsurfaceto have been radiolytically destroyed (estimated to occur in ~107 years [9]).  Other ideas include Charon'ssubsurface having local concentrations of NH3 thanksto a history of cryovolcanism, or that the NH3 was delivered by an impactor, or is created by processing oflocal N-bearing precursor materials [11].References:  [1] Stern et al.
