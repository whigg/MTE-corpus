Introduction:  After nearly a decade en route, New Horizons flew through the Pluto system in July 2015. The spacecraft's sophisticated suite of instruments revealed a spectacularly complex system [1].  This presentation focuses  on the surface  compositions of  the two largest bodies, Pluto and Charon. New Horizons' primary instrument for mapping surface compositions is Ralph, a near-infrared spectral imager paired with a CCD camera system [2].   Ralph's Linear Etalon Imaging Spectral Array (LEISA) component provides spectral coverage from 1.25 - 2.5 µm, at a resolving power (λ/Δλ) of 240.  The Multi-spectral Visible Imaging Camera (MVIC) includes 4 CCD arrays  with  affixed  interference  filters  covering  wavelengths from "BLUE" (400-550 nm), through "RED" (540-700 nm), "NIR" (780-975 nm), and a methane absorption band "CH4" (860-910 nm).  Ralph normally operates in a scanning mode with the spacecraft sweeping its field of view across the scene, to accumulate the data needed to assemble a multi-wavelength image. Pluto:  MVIC color imaging of Pluto's encounter hemisphere  (the  anti-Charon  hemisphere)  at  700  m/ pixel resolution reveals a  latitude-dependent  distribution  of  colors  (Fig. 1).   An equatorial  belt  of  dark, heavily-cratered,  reddish  terrain  exemplified  by Cthulhu Regio1 gives  way to  lighter  reddish  terrains that  grade into a neutral  mid-latitude belt  and finally golden hues at the pole (Lowell Regio).  This latitudinal  pattern  is  dramatically interrupted  by the  bright, heart-shaped Tombaugh Regio (TR). LEISA spectral imaging of Pluto at 6 to 7 km/pixel resolution reveals the encounter hemisphere to be dominated by volatile ices of N2, CO, and CH4, along with non-volatile  (at  least  at  Pluto  temperatures)  components including H2O and tholins [3].  The spatial distributions of these materials (Fig. 2) are highly revealing. The most volatile of Pluto's ices (N2 and CO) are especially prevalent in the western half of TR, the strikingly flat Sputnik Planum (SP).  SP occupies a large basinlike  feature  a  few km below surrounding elevations. The high mobility of N2 and CO ices enables SP's surface to refresh itself sufficiently rapidly that no impact craters are seen there [4].  This likely occurs through a combination of solid state convective overturning (as 1 All place names throughout this abstract and the associated talk are informal. Fig. 2.

N2 ice also appears in mid-latitude topographic lows, such as the floors of craters. CH4 ice is less volatile than N2 and CO ices at Pluto surface temperatures, but it is still mobile.  CH4 occurs on SP, but it is also seen in other regions where N2 and CO absorptions are less evident, including the northern polar region, the eastern half of TR, and along the periphery of the dark, red, equatorial terrains.  In many areas,  CH4 appears  to  favor topographically high regions.  Its propensity to condense on ridges could play an important role in constructing the bizarre bladed terrain seen in Tartarus Dorsa. The characteristic absorptions of non-volatile H2O ice are most evident at latitudes below about 30° (except for TR).   H2O can be discerned across much of Cthulhu Regio, and also in a few isolated spots, such as Virgil  Fossa and Viking Terra.   In  many of these regions, H2O absorption is associated with reddish tholin coloration.  Since both are  inert,  H2O ice and tholin could have similar geological behaviors on Pluto, possibly  including  aeolian  transport  or  mobilization  by volatile ice glaciation.  But in another  isolated H2Orich  region  around  Pulfrich  crater,  the  reddish  coloration is lacking, so the two materials are not always associated. For  structural  integrity,  rugged mountains like alIdrisi and Zheng-He should be composed of H2O ice [1], but they show relatively weak H2O spectral signatures.  Evidently their H2O is partially hidden beneath a veneer  of  more  volatile  ices.   Geochemically,  H2O should be ubiquitous.  It  likely makes up the bulk of Pluto's mantle [5].  Although H2O should be geologically inert at such low temperatures, it is clearly participating in Pluto's  active geology,  appently enabled  by the action of the more volatile ices on it. Charon: Whereas Pluto's H2O ice is sculpted and at least partially veiled by more volatile ices, Charon's heavily  cratered  H2O  ice  is  exposed  for  all  to  see (Fig. 3).  H2O ice bands at 1.5, 1.65, and 2 µm, which are characteristic of cold, crystalline ice, are seen everywhere on Charon's encounter hemisphere.  But despite being ubiquitously coated in H2O ice,  the same material that dominates the surfaces of numerous comparably-sized satellites of Saturn and Uranus, Charon manages to be unique among icy satellites. Charon's north polar region is strikingly red.  This area, Mordor Macula, is likely the result of the unique thermal environment of Charon's poles, which become exceptionally cold during the long, dark winters.  Extremely low temperatures enable volatiles such as CH4 that would not otherwise be stable on Charon's surface to become temporarily cold trapped as ices.   Frozen CH4 can be very rapidly radiolytically processed in situ into heavier and less volatile molecules that are precursors to tholins [3,6]. Charon  also  exhibits  a  weak  NH3 absorption  at about  2.22 µm, as  known from Earth-based  observations [7,8,9,10].   This  absorption band is seen to  be strongest in a few isolated regions, most strikingly Organa crater.  It is possible that this particular crater is too young for NH3 excavated from Charon's subsurface to have been radiolytically destroyed (estimated to occur in ~107 years [9]).  Other ideas include Charon's subsurface having local concentrations of NH3 thanks to a history of cryovolcanism, or that the NH3 was delivered by an impactor, or is created by processing of local N-bearing precursor materials [11].
