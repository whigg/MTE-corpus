Introduction:  10  Years  of  the  Simulated  Mars Rover Model Competition - This is a report about the success,  organization  and  management  of  the  Simulated  Mars  Rover  Model  Competition  events  from 2006 to 2015. Ideas: Challenge is  the engine of  evolution.  The young grow old and replenishment is needed.  Knowledge is not born with us. The empowering of skills can be speeded up by a forced evolution in competitions. Where do today's teenagers get that little spark that will start  them  on  the  difficult  but  interesting  scientific course? Each year  we take  significant  efforts  to  organize and implement this traditional competition of applied engineering sciences. Ten years of success - www.magyarokamarson.hu. ('Hungarians on Mars'). We presented  our  previous  works  (Sipos  et  al  2009-2015) [1,2,3,4,5]  at  the 40th-46th Lunar and Planetary Science  Conferences.  Contestants  came from more than twenty participant  technical  high  schools,  secondary grammar schools, universities and doctoral schools. Simulation and Realization: Organizers  and authors of this article prepared CGI and physical simulations of the dashboard, robots and race and communicated them before the date of competitions. Importance for researching and developing is to reach the capability to supply a good emulation environment before any mission,  first  at  our  competition  and  next  in  a  wide spectrum of  space  and  planetary  environments.  The method is entertaining-and educational to get the attention of possible younger competitors also and similar to a sci-fi trailer. [6][7] Missions: Each year the most important task is to command the robots with automatism. In order to become a winner automatic devices are to be used. 2006-2010: One rover was on the stage. The actual goal of the competition can be achieved by building a moving device (usually a rover) with manipulators. The track is an 8x8 square meter sized field of special material and tracks, different during years. Controlling of rovers was necessary from behind of a folding screen and  using a  delay to  simulate  the  distances  between planets. 2006: Competitors had to build a rover which starts from either corner of the field to reach the target crater at the opposite other corner and to collect debris or soil of the crater. 2007: Competitors  had  to  search power  cubes to collect energy across of field. 2008: Competitors had  to collect liquid material. 2009: The goal of this year could be achieved by building an amphibian rover with sensors, manipulators and advanced communication.  2010: To  reach the target  place  and to  read  and send back to base a DNA sequence represented by a 16 character display and to collect soil, and to carry and put the specimen into the harbor where a space-elevator model was. The end of the mission was to reach the top of the space-elevator. 2011-2016: More than one rover was on the stage from this year on due to the increased and large number  of  competitors  and  full  mission  time  was  not enough to complete the contest one by one. 2011: The mission was to reach and occupy marked places on one's own field and to try to occupy other marked places on the fields of other competitors, thus some robots had to be substituted by other's robots. 2012: Spider like robots occupied pyramid like targets by "eggs" and pushed down other's eggs. 2013: Doubled wheel robots in an 8mx8m labyrinth placed own magnetic eggs and eggs taken from others. 2014: All skills to be used as before additionally with a hovercraft to simulate the micro gravitation in 2D. 2015: This 10th year anniversary was special, we organized  an  additional  event  in  spring  -  a  seminar  - where competitors presented their solutions used previously on plotting boards. In the autumn of 2015 in the '9.5th contest' all skills were required as previously, in addition robots were necessary to build in situ on spot during the time of the competition from materials available locally. It  symbolized the necessity of how local materials should be used for the energy-efficient performance of the missions in a remote place. Conclusion: Competitors  have  to  be  capable  of designing,  developing  and  constructing  complex autonomous robots, and moving them by driving from wheel  and  caterpillar,  through  amphibians,  elevator climbers, legs, balanced double wheels and air cushion. Organizers  and  participants  of  the  competition  have written several publications and uploaded hundreds of videos to sharing sites.
