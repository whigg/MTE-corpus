A PHENOMENOLOGICAL THEORY OF THE REFLECTANCE OF PARTICULATE MEDIA: SCATTERING REGIMES AND LORENTZ BAND FEATURES C. A. Jeffery1, B. Henderson1 and T. Kulp2, 1Space & Remote Sensing (ISR-2),Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, 2Remote Sensing & Energet. Mat. Dept.,Sandia National Laboratory, Livermore, CAIntroduction: The confounding effectsof particle morphology on the spectra of particulate surfaces can impede the remote detection and identification of planetary minerals. Hunt and Vincent (1968) [1], and laterMoersch and Christensen (1995) [2], showedhow the interplay of surface scattering andvolume scattering behavior leads to four classesof Lorentz band features. Class 1 featuresare reflectance peaks that increase with increasing particle size; Class 2 features evolvefrom troughs to peaks, while Class 3 featuresare troughs that decrease in contrast withincreasing particle size. Class 4 features refer to the Christiansen effect where n passesthrough unity. While [1] and [2] documentthese classes, using supporting examples frommeasured mineral spectra, they do not provided a unified theory or framework that predicts the transition from volume to surfacescattering behavior or the complex dependenceof band classes on the two refractive indices,{n, k}, as well as size parameter, Rx. It isthe goal of this presentation to present a phenomenological theory of the reflectance of particulate media in the three-dimensional spaceof {n, k, Rx}.Methods: We use a numerically exactsolution to the conventional one-dimensionalradiative transfer equation (RTE) for the reflectance, R, of a homogeneous slab of scatters [3]. This modeling approach computes Rfor normal incidence assuming a Lorenz-Miesingle scattering phase function for spherical particles [3] that is averaged over a smallrange of neighboring particles diameters toremove the small ripples that are superimposed on the larger Mie resonances.Results: Using 3000+ solution to the1D RTE, we determine analytic boundaries,as a function of {n, k, Rx}, that separate volume and surface scattering, as well as Class1-3 band feature behavior, for size parameters Rx≥ 1. We find a transition in scaling for k > 1.5 associated with the knowncomplex formulation of extinction of light ina single sphere at large k; this transition isestimated analytically. Implications for theevolution of reststrahlen features with particle size are highlighted. Contour plots showing the sensitivity of reflectance to changes inparticle morphology and refractive indices arepresented and explained in separate {k, Rx}and {n, k} spaces. We apply our phenomenological theory to published spectra of calcite,quartz, gypsum, and various phyllosilicates.References: [1] G. R. Hunt and R. K.Vincent, (1968) J. Geophys. Res. 73(18),6039–6046.
