RBT 04262 has been identified as a lherzolitic shergottite [5]. Primary mineralogy is composed of coarse grained olivine, pyroxene, and maskelynite with minor amounts of oxides, and phosphates [6]. Weathering of Martian basalts to form calcium sulfates such as gypsum and iron sulfate minerals like jarosite has been identified as one possible formation mechanism for sulfates found in Martian meteorites. This suggests the presence of an acidic oxidizing fluid present within the meteorite. Although weathering of RBT 04262 has likely transpired in Antarctica [4], it has some interesting implications for Mars. It might be expected that a similar weathering process of iron sulfides leads to increasingly acidic fluids, enhancing the dissolution of calcium phosphate minerals.  Micro-Raman spectroscopy was used to investigate sulfates minerals found in RBT 04262. Raman spectroscopy of minerals produces clear spectral features allowing for an easier identification of minerals especially in fine-grained mixtures. Unlike visible, nearinfrared and thermal spectroscopy, there is minimal overlap of spectral features [6]. Micro-Raman allows the same spectral resolution on a micron spatial scale.   Sample and Methods: Martian thin section RBT 04262,30 was studied using a Wi-TEC  alpha300R  confocal  Raman  microscope  system equipped  with  a  50  mW  frequency  doubled  532  nm  Nd:YAG  excitation laser at the Stony Brook University Vibrational Spectroscopy Laboratory.  Point spectra were collected using 100x objective with sub-micron spatial resolution.  Spectra were collected between 0-3700 cm-1. Micro-Raman mapping was also completed on select sulfate grains.  RBT 04262,30 was also imaged using the Wesleyan JEOL JSM6390LV/LGS SEM with BSE and EDAX Genesis and hyperspectral EDS mapping. Results:  In sample RBT 04262,30 micro-Raman spectroscopy confirms the presence of jarosite initially identified by SEM.  Figure 1 shows the initial grain studied. Layered vein fill, approximately 10µm in width, can be seen crosscutting pyrrohite grains. Multiple spectra were collected around the bottom left edge of the grain using micro-Raman spectroscopy. Using Crystal Sleuth® spectral matching software paired with the RRuff™ spectral database, a combination of natrojarosite (Na-rich), hydronium-jarosite, and jarosite (Krich) (Fig. 1B) was identified [7][8]. Raman mapping of the region detected predominantly K-jarosite, however point spectra identified pockets of natrojarosite. Additionally in two of the Raman spectra collected, a minor manganese phosphorus phase was found intermixed with jarosite. Using spectral matching this was identified as frondelite. Previously EDS spectra were collected for this region showing enrichment in sulfur and iron, with lesser amounts of sodium, phosphorus and potassium (Fig. 1A). These assemblages support the Raman conclusion of a combination of natrojarosite and jarosite.  Three other weathered sulfate grains were investigated for presence of jarosite alteration products. Raman spectroscopy showed that vein fill was instead composed almost exclusively of hematite. Although unexpected, this could be a result of laser induced oxidation and requires more study.  Discussion:  Four weathered pyrrohite grains were studied. Grains are extensively crosscut by vein networks and appear to be composed of iron oxide alteration products of varying crystalline structure. We hypothesize that some veins are composed of poorly crystalline iron oxides and hydroxides that were transformed into hematite upon excitation by the Raman laser. Crystalline regions appear to be composed of multiple phases of jarosite most notably natrojarosite, and hydronium-jarosite.  The manganese phosphate frondelite was detected by Raman spectroscopy as a minor component within two of the regions of jarosite alteration (Fig. 1C). Frondelite, if correctly identified would be the first iron phosphate identified for a Martian meteorite. Frondelite is described as a hydroxylated phosphate containing Fe2+ and Mn2+.  On Earth they are formed as alteration products of iron-manganese phosphates in pegmatites [9].  The presence of jarosite as vein fill indicates aqueous alteration after the shock event. Jarosite requires acidic conditions for formation and is common in acidic environments around Earth. Hydrogen isotopes suggest jarosite formation likely occurring in Antarctica [4].

A new iron-manganese phosphate may have been observed, however additional Raman Spectroscopy will be needed to confirm its presence.
