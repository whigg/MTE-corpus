Introduction:  The presence of ethane in liquidfilled lakes on Titan was confirmed by the Cassini Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) in 2008, and has been investigated in further detail by the Cassini radar instrument [1,2]. Radar sounding, infrared absorption, and modeling suggest that the lakes are predominantly liquid methane and ethane, with trace amounts of propane, butane, other complex hydrocarbons, and dissolved nitriles [3,4]. Measuring the composition of Titan lakes is essential for understanding the chemical interchange between Titan's atmosphere and surface, and the complex pluvial, erosional, and climatological processes that govern the distribution of organic materials. Insitu measurements of lake chemistry, then, would provide a dynamic dataset on Titan meterology and limnology. Spectroscopy, as a non-destructive method requiring no sample preparation, is an ideal tool for investigating the bulk composition of Titan's lakes, and can be achieved using robust, small-scale fiber optic probe devices. Prior work conducted by M.L. Cable and T.H. Vu demonstrated the utility of fiber optic probes in analyzing complex organic mixtures within the near and midinfrared (NIR and MIR; 0.9-2.5 µm and 2.0-9.0 µm, respectively) [5]. This study follows up on earlier results, and shows how distinct absorption features in NIR spectra (within the windows of Cassini VIMS) can be used to determine the relative abundances of ethane and methane in varying mixtures at Titan-like temperatures. Methods: Liquid hydrocarbon mixtures were prepared by condensing gaseous ethane or methane into a plastic pipette submerged in liquid nitrogen; measured amounts were added to a 20 mL beaker (for larger volumes) or a 6 mL test tube (for smaller volumes).  The 20 ml beaker was set into a 100 mL beaker filled with steel ball bearings, and both beakers were anchored to a large dewar filled with liquid nitrogen [6]. For measurements using smaller volumes, the inner 20 mL beaker was filled with 16 mL of liquid ethane, and set to remain at 94 K using a silicon diode thermometer and nickel-chrome heating elements. The test tube was placed inside of the liquid ethane bath, and up to 6 mL of liquid hydrocarbons was added for subsequent measurements. Aliquots of hydrocarbons were prepared by cooling plastic pipettes filled with gasous ethane or methane in a liquid nitrogen bath. Mixtures were then formed by adding the appropriate volume of ethane (or methane) to the test tube, and adding aliquots of methane (or ethane) to create the desired ratios.  Near infrared (NIR) spectra were taken from 0.9 to 2.5 µm using an Ocean Optics NIRQuest256-2.5 spectrometer with a  Mikropack Tungsten Halogen HL2000-FHSA Lamp, and a fiber optic probe.  All measurements were taken inside a glove bag purged with a constant flow of nitrogen gas to maintain a total oxygen concentration of less than 0.1% on average.   Figure 1. A.

Results: Diagnostic absorption features within the NIR spectra allowed for determination of methane and ethane ratios. Changes in band intensity and position within three key regions (Figure 2) were used to identify methane and ethane abundance. Variance in the measured band intensities for each mixture may be due to the presence of methane bubbles, as methane began to evaporate during the measurement causing overall lower absorbance.   Region 1: 1.1-1.2 µm. The doublet between 1.1 and 1.2 µm is the second overtone of the C-H stretch, with a possible contribution from a combination of the first overtone of the symmetric and asymmetric C-H bends and the fundamental C-H stretch [7]. In this region, the dominant band in ethane at 1.145 µm is shifted to shorter wavelengths as the mole fraction of methane decreases. In pure methane, this appears as a weak band at 1.134 µm. 2051.pdf

 Figure 2. NIR absorbance spectra collected at 94 K showing key regions identified for more detailed study.  Region 2: 1.3-1.45 µm. In both ethane and methane, a series of sharp bands is present between 1.2 and 1.45 µm, possibly due to a combination of the first C-H stretch overtone with the C-H bending fundamentals [6]. However, in methane, the primary band is centered at 1.33 µm, while in ethane one of the primary bands is centered at 1.43 µm. The intensity of both of these bands changes with increasing methane mole fraction, with the band at 1.33 µm increasing in intensity, and the band at 1.43 µm decreasing in intensity (Figure 3).   Figure 3. Plot showing the change in the intensity of the 1333 nm (1.33 µm) and the 1433 nm (1.43 µm) absorption bands with increasing mole fraction methane.  Region 3: 2.0-2.06 µm. An undefined complex of three sharp bands between 2.0 and 2.06 µm is present in all mixtures containing ethane. As the mole fraction of methane increases, these bands decrease linearly in intensity until they are no longer present in spectra of pure methane. Discussion: The preliminary results of this work show the utility of NIR spectra in determining the relative abundances of methane and ethane within mixtures. Future work will involve calculating integrated peak areas in order to create calibration curves for methane and ethane abundances. Additional calculations will yield the molar extinction coefficient and the absorption coefficient within each mixture. Ideally, these calculations can be compared to analogous quantites from radar loss tangent data and theoretical chemistry models for hydrocarbon lakes.   Furthermore, this work demonstrates the capabilities of fiber optic probe spectroscopy at Titanlike conditions, and the importance of spectroscopy as a tool for non-destructive and accurate analysis.
