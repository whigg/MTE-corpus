THE EFFECT OF SURFACE ROUGHNESS ON SHALLOW RADAR SOUNDING OF DEBRIS-COVEREDGLACIERS IN DEUTERONILUS MENSAE, MARS. E. I. Petersen1, J. S. Levy1, J. W. Holt1, E. A. McKinnon2,and T. A. Goudge3, 1Institute for Geophysics, University of Texas at Austin, Austin TX (eric petersen@utexas.edu),2Bureau of Economic Geology, University of Texas at Austin, 3Jackson School of Geosciences, University of Texasat AustinIntroduction: Lobate debris aprons (LDA) are abundant in the northern and southern mid-latitudes of Marswhere they surround the bases of high mesas and massifs[1]. Many LDA exhibit basal reflectors in MRO ShallowRadar (SHARAD) sounding data, consistent with a composition of nearly pure water ice under a debris cover nothicker than 10 m [2,3]. These LDA are now referred toas debris-covered glaciers (DCG).Not all LDA are confirmed via geophysics to beDCG. LDA in the northern mid-latitude region ofDeuteronilus Mensae exhibit varied SHARAD resultsthat correlate well with longitude: features in the westgenerally exhibit strong, clear basal reflectors while features in the east exhibit weak or non-existent basal reflectors (see fig. 1).Ongoing work in flow modeling [4] and geomorphiccharacterization is being used to test whether these differing radar properties are a result of differing bulk compositions or of differing physical properties of the surficialdebris layer. In this work, which focuses on 4 LDA complexes in Deuteronilus Mensae (2 each with SHARADdetections and nondetections), we show that surface morphologies attributable to glacial processes may play astrong role.Methods: HiRISE Geomorphology: Surface geomorphology is mapped at the tens to hundred meter scaleusing 3-4 HiRISE images over each site. Surfaces arecharacterized into 3 broad categories and 8 subcategoriesbased upon general appearance, surface roughness, andhypothesized formation mechanism. These include brainterrain, polygons, and other.Brain terrain exhibits high roughness at the tens ofmeters scale, with buttes typically five meters in height.This scale is relevant to SHARAD as it produces incoherent signal losses and scattering. Brain terrain is hypothesized to form via infilling of extensional or thermalcracking in ice with overlying sediments, followed by icetable lowering [5]. Brain terrain is thought to be uniqueto debris-covered ice.Polygons are formed as a result of thermalcontraction-cracking of the debris-covered ice in theLDA itself or in subsequent deposits of latitudedependent mantle [6]. Polygons are very smooth at thescale relevant to SHARAD and may serve to mask orsmooth out underlying and neighboring morphologies.Other morphologies include clast-rich flow lineations, deflated smooth surfaces bereft of polygons, andfrozen dunes. Most miscellaneous morphologies areFigure 1: (A) MOLA-derived map of DeuteronilusMensae with confirmed detections and non-detections ofLDA basal reflectors mapped.

We produced aDTM for this using the Ames Stereo Pipeline [7,8], giving reliable results for the topography of features on thetens of meters scale. Roughness height deviation is produced by subtracting the mean elevation in a surrounding50 meter wide square cell from each DTM pixel.The roughness height values are then used to calculate the expected transmission losses in a subsurface return due to incoherency produced as it passes through thesurface, following the methods of [9]:σφ =4piσhλ(√�− 1),ρ = e−σ2φI20 (σ2φ2)Where σφ is the rms phase delay in the SHARAD sig2618.pdf

The signal loss ρ is then calculated fromσφ using the zeroth-order Bessel function of the firstkind, I0.Theoretical transmission signal loss is then calculated as a function of the dielectric constant assumed forthe surface debris layer, using the cumulative roughnessresults from the HiRISE DTM.Results: HiRISE Geomorphology: Geomorphiccharacterization revealed that W1 is dominated by brainterrain and altered by ejecta from a nearby synglacialcrater, W2 is dominated by polygonal mantle deposits,E1 is dominated by flow lineations and deflated troughs,and E2 is dominated by polygons punctuated by largefields of tall brain terrain buttes.All exhibited a significant amount of brain terrain. Inorder of most to least, site W1 had 76%, E2 had 54%,W2 had 42%, and E1 had 35%. Shadow measurementswere used to estimate maximum butte heights of up to8m for W1, 9m for E1 and E2, and 4.5m for W2. Typicalbutte heights are closer to 2-3m for W1, 5m for E1 andE2, and negligible for W2 due to the paucity of shadows.W2’s brain terrain has been heavily softened by extensive polygonal mantle deposits.HiRISE DTM Roughness: Roughness heights produced from the HiRISE stereo DTM on E1 (Fig. 2) confirm estimates produced from shadow measurements andprovide more extensive statistics for the E1 site (Fig 3A).Theoretical rough-surface transmission losses can bequite significant for SHARAD (Fig. 3B). If we assumea debris layer formed of basaltic clasts (� = 9) with aporosity of 30%, we can estimate the effective dielectricconstant to be � = 5.7 from the Maxwell-Garnett mixing formula [10]. Transmission losses for this value areFigure 3: (A) Roughness heights and (B) subsequentSHARAD signal loss as a function of dielectric constantcalculated from HiRISE DTM on E1 produced fromESP 035327 2255 and ESP 035327 2255 (Fig. 2). Theblack dashed line in (B) corresponds to the dielectricexpected for a debris layer composed of basalt clastswith 30% porosity (see text).calculated at -40 dB. If we assume the debris layer isdusty or formed of a porous mixture of sandstone clasts(� = 5), with a resultant dielectric constant of � = 3-4,then transmission losses are reduced to -12 to -20 dB.Discussion: The presence and extent of brain terrainon LDA surfaces does not correlate with SHARAD performance (Fig. 1), which would seem to indicate that itis not a primary control. However, differences in brainterrain butte heights and debris composition may play amuch stronger role than extent.SHARAD’s SNR performance is nominally -50 dBrelative to a specular reflection from a � = 3 surface [11].We have shown that measured roughness on the surfaceof LDA study site E1 can reduce the signal of a basalreflection by up to 40 dB from transmission losses. Wetherefore judge surface roughness to be a strong candidate to explain the lack of basal detection at this site.HiRISE stereo coverage exists on LDA study siteW1, however we have not yet produced a DTM productthat faithfully captures its terrain on the scale of less than20 m. When this is accomplished we can more directlycompare the sites to assess if surface roughness can fullyexplain the difference in radar properties of LDAs.References: [1] Levy, J., et al., 2014, JGR: Planets, 119(10), [2] Holt, J., et al.
