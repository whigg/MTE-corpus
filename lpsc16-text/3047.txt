Introduction:  The differentiation of planetesimals into core, mantle and crust is one of the most fundamental processes in the early solar system. Differentiation involves the physical separation of metal and silicate through the segregation of dense metal melts towards the center, forming a core, and the upward migration of silicate melts, forming a crust. Direct evidence for these processes comes from differentiated meteorites and in particular from the iron meteorites. Most iron meteorites have chemical compositions that are consistent with crystal-liquid partitioning during crystallization of metallic melt. These samples, termed magmatic iron meteorites, are, therefore, thoguht to be fragments of the metal cores of differentiated planetesimals. Based on their chemical composition and in particular the concentrations of moderately volatile elements, several distinct groups of magmatic irons (e.g., IIAB, IIIAB, IVA, IVB) are distinguished; each of these groups represents a separate parent body. The time of core formation in iron meteorite parent bodies can be very well studied using the extinct 182Hf182W system. Recent measurements have shown that there are small but resolvable variations in the  182W compositions of different magmatic iron meteorite groups [1], indicating that core formation in their parent bodies occurred over an interval of at least ~1 million years (Ma) and may have involved an early segregation of Fe-FeS and a later segregation of Fe melts. Of note, the Hf-W model ages for core formation are inversely correlated with the S content and, hence, the liquidus temperature inferred for each core. Thus, core formation in S-rich bodies (e.g., IIAB) occurred earlier and at lower temperature than in S-poor bodies (e.g., IVB). While this interpretation can qualitatively account for the observed difference in core formation times in iron meteorite parent bodies, it has yet to be evaluated as to whether the Hf-W data are quantitavely consistent with the complex process of melting and melt migration during planetesimal differentiation. We calculated the thermal evolution and differentiation of the parent bodies of the magmatic iron meteorites. The calculations were compared to the metalsilicate separation data available. Our models are consistent with the separation ages for all five iron meteorite groups investigated in [1] and place the group IVB into the general context suggested by [1]. Model:  The numerical model[2,3] used solves energy balance equation in spherical symmetry considering heating by short- and long-lived radionuclides, temperature- and porosity-dependent parameters, compaction of initially porous material by creep, melting and latent heat, metal-rock differentiation by Darcy flow, associated redistribution of radionuclides, and convection in a magma ocean and in the metallic core. We consider an object with a radius of 100 km that accretes very fast within 0.1 Ma relative to the formation of CAIs and has an ordinary H chondritic composition. The average density is 3740 kg m-3, the intrinsic thermal conductivity is 4.3 W m-1K-1, and the heat capacity is a temperature dependent fit. The thermal conductivity is two orders of magnitude smaller than the intrinsic one at the initial porosity and increases towards 4.3 W m-1K-1 during compaction. The mass fraction of metal is 0.22, the remaining part is represented by the silicates that form the mantle material. The initial and surface temperature is 260 K, the initial porosity is 40 %. Results:  For comparison we calculated a purely conductive model that includes porosity, compaction and porosity and temperature dependent parameters. In such a case the asteroid experiences a rapid heating and a complete melting of both metal and rock in the interior (Fig. 1, top). Such a model cannot reproduce the formation circumstances of IVB. As another extreme case we calculated a model that includes differentiation and convection. In addition, this model considers partitioning of 26Al into the silicate melt and convection in the mantle and in the core as well. Here, the melting of both metal and rock is only partial and the melting temperature of pure iron is not nearly reached (Fig. 1, middle). This model is not suited as well to reproduce the separation ages for IVB.  Finally, we implemented an alternative "mixed" model, where the differentiation is approximated as a quasi-instantaneous process. Assuming that plagioclase percolates upon reaching its liquidus temperature of 1570 K and takes ≈ 90 % of 26Al along, the heating rate by 26Al was reduced to ≈ 10 % at the depths with T>1570 K. Thereby, a liquidus temperature of 1570 K for plagioclase follows for an ordinary chondritic composition of the planetesimal, assuming taht the plagioclase phase has 85 % albite and 15 % anorthite. Heating by the remaining fraction of the radionuclides                                               Fig. 1: Evolution of the interior temperature with time. In the conduction model (top) an unrealistic temperature increase far beyond 2000 K occurs. In the convection model (middle) removal of 26Al and convective cooling are so effective that the melting temperature of of free iron is not reached. In the mixed model (bottom) both the necessary temperature and the separation age of IVB are obtained.  leads to a slow temperature increase above the melting point of free iron at t ≈ 2.9 Ma rel. to CAIs (Fig. 1, bottom and Fig. 2). The time of this event fits to the separation age of the iron meteorite IVB. Furthermore, the temperature increases to over 1900 K and decreases very slowly subsequently. At 23 Ma rel. to CAIs free iron crystallizes at the center, while the CMB cools below the metal solidus earlier. Fig. 2 shows the evolution of the temperature either at the center or at the core-mantle-boundary (CMB). Most of 26Al is contained in plagioclase and some small amount in the pyroxene. The remaining silicates have a higher melting temperature and remain solid.                 Fig. 2: Evolution of the temperature either at the center or at the CMB for the conduction, convection, and mixed models. No magma ocean forms and the temperature in the lower mantle can increase further without being reduced by the liquid-state convection (the latter would occur in models that assume only one single silicate phase with fixed solidus and liquidus temperatures). However, due to a reduced heat generation rate, the temperature increase is much slower than before the extrusion of plagioclase. Thus, the value of 1870 K is reached at ≈ 2.9 Ma rel. to CAIs. Conclusions: The models shown above are consistent with the separation age of IVB and place this group into the general context suggested by [1]. While the radius of the parent body of IVB can differ from R=100 km used here, calculations for bodies with different sizes lead to similar results. Our calculations confirm, in general, that the parent bodies of iron meteorites should have accreted early and that their cores must have formed slowly within several millions of years.
