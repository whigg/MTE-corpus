UNDERSTANDING MECHANISMS OF SULFATE FORMATION ON MARS: EXPERIMENTAL STUDY ON THE OXIDATION OF H2S UNDER LABORATORY CONDITIONS.    J. J. Ende1 (jende@vols.utk.edu) and A. Szynkiewicz1, 1 Earth & Planetary Sciences, University of Tennessee, 1412 Circle Drive, Knoxville, TN 37996  Introduction: The sulfur (S) cycle is important in many geological processes on Mars [1]. Many competing hypotheses have been proposed including formation of sulfate via volcanic S-rich emissions and ice-rock interaction [2,3,4], hydrothermal activity [5,6], deep groundwater discharge [7,8], and/or sulfide weathering [9,10,11,12,13]. Although the sulfate-rich minerals on Mars provide evidence of water activity, many of the key processes involved in oxidation of reduced volcanic S to sulfate (SO4) remain unclear. For example, we are uncertain about oxidation mechanisms under oxygen-limited conditions on Mars. To address this problem, we have been studying major processes controlling oxidation of H2S gas under oxygen-limited conditions.  Rationale: Our initial oxygen isotope results from a terrestrial volcano of Valles Caldera, New Mexico show that in surface aqueous environments majority of H2S from modern hydrothermal emission is oxidized to SO4 by water oxygen rather than atmospheric oxygen (O2) [14]. This is inferred from negative δ18O values of SO4 (-5 to -3 ‰; Fig. 1) in hot springs which were similar to negative δ18O of ambient water (-9 to -8 ‰). In case of higher contributions of atmospheric O2, higher δ18O of SO4 (> +5 to +10 ‰) would be apparent. Given that elevated concentrations of O2 were present in the springs and surface water (9-11 mg/L), it is unclear what environmental factors (pH, temperature, volcanic emission rates, metal catalyzers, microbial activity, etc.) are responsible for small contributions of atmospheric O2 during SO4 formation in Valles Caldera.  Because it is likely that Mars never had an O2-rich atmosphere, further quantifying the oxidation of reduced sulfur via water oxygen may provide important insight regarding plausible oxidation pathways of volcanic S-rich gases in Martian surface environments. Methods: In order to simulate H2S oxidation under laboratory conditions, pyrite was hand-ground in an agate mortar. A chromium chloride solution was reacted with 148.1 mg of pyrite to form H2S gas. Afterward, this H2S gas was bubbled through deionized water with a low oxygen (DO) content of 1.28 mg/L and neutral pH of ~7. The experimental setup simulated an open system where H2S gas was leaving the reaction flask after bubbling through the deionized water.  Initial Results: The initial results suggest that under low oxygen content in water the H2S oxidation was limited, with only 0.125 µg of H2S-sulfur oxidizing to SO4.  Since the reaction time of H2S with water was relatively short (~4 hours), in the next step we will increase the time and the amount of H2S reacting with deionized water. This will allow for better characterization of physical conditions necessary for efficient oxidation of H2S to SO4 in aqueous systems. Additionally, we will add the Valles Caldera bedrock regolith to the reaction chamber with bubbling H2S to investigate the plausible roles of metal catalyzers (e.g., Fe) and microbes in H2S oxidation to SO4.
