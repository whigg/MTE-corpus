Software for planetary image processing. We have developed photogrammetric methods, which provide the opportunity to effectively organize and optimize the processing of image data from planets and satellites. For this purposes we used PHOTOMOD™ [1] as basic software. Main core of PHOTOMOD software has been specially adapted for studies of small and large planetary bodies. Additionally the special software modules have been developed to perform various types of data processing: radiometric correction, synthesis of color images, calculation of shape parameters of celestial body, orthotransformation of images with large perspective viewing distortion, estimation of Sun illumination or Earth visibilities, etc. The software was written in C ++ using the Microsoft libraries in the dotNetFramework environment. Some modules can be used as stand-alone application or as additional module for extension of the PHOTOMODfunctionalities. The calculation of exterior orientation parameters, specifically planetary surface illumination or planetary bodies visibilities, is based on SPICElibraries [2], which include camera navigation elements and ephemerides of planetary bodies. Photogrammetric processing may be carried out for frame and scanner images, including current missions or archives orbital images as well as panoramas taken from surfaces. The developed software was used to create new three-dimensional control point network, to estimate shape parameters and libration, to produce digital elevation models (DEMs) and orthomosaic for studied planetary bodies.  Software for archive panoramas reconstruction. To recover the panoramic lunar images that have been transmitted by the Soviet lunar rovers (Lunokhod-1 and -2) special software was developed, which enables restoring parameters of orientation, that have been lost after missions [3]. Archive panoramas were assembled using new software and uploaded to lunar geodatabase [4], including metadata that also have been updated during modern digital processing. Combination with Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) high resolution orbital data helped to determine coordinates of observation points for Lunokhod’s images based on artificial panorama modeling using detail LRO NAC DEM. GIS-tools for characterization of landing sites. The possible presence of water on the Moon in the form of ice is registered by Russian scientific instrument [5], installed on LRO board. The most interesting for researchers are areas with low neutron flux detected by instrument LEND, which indicates the presence of subsurface ice. The highest indicators are registered in the polar regions of the Moon, as existing there permanently shadowed area [6] are cold traps for the volatiles. In this context the Lunar polar regions are considered as potential places for landing and probe. For secure contact of landers with the surface it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive study of surface characteristics within selected landing sites. Using criteria for safety landing [7] we have developed the method for estimation of potential landing surface. The algorithm, which has been implemented in ArcGIS environment, providing automated creation of binary hazard maps and further overlay analysis for compliance of the landing site with the scientific and engineering requirements: slopes less 7° [8], low roughness, visibility of Earth and Sun, low neutron count rate. Additionally the topographic profiles across the studied territory could be created. If there are a catalogue of small craters and DEMs with sufficient resolution it can be evaluated the degradation of craters. It allows detecting fresh craters, which could be threatening for landers footing. The results of application of the algorithm is the set of maps, that characterize the relief of studied surface, topographic profiles and map of safe areas within potential landing site. Planetary data Geoportal. To store the results of the planetary research, a planetary geodatabase with access via geoportal [4] has been developed using spatial and web-based technology. Data import and processing subsystem fulfills collection of the spatial information from a predefined set of sources and executes data transformation, which brings the data to chosen standard presentation, suitable for visualization and external access. For this purpose we selected typed XML-presentation of data based on established OGC standards. Typed XML means that for every data object, corresponding description in form of XSD schema is available. Data import and processing subsystem represents of a set of software components, which provide the key functions: data conversion and uploading them to SQL geodatabase in automatic mode.  To extent of geoportal functionalities the crossplatform web environment base on peer-to-peer architecture is developing now [9]. It will provide a heterogenic distributed on-line processing, analysis and visualization of spatial data and combines volunteer computing model and cloud possibilities, using both local and public cloud computing resources. It will allow 1057.pdf

immediate and direct reuse of data, algorithms, methodology, components, etc. The new software platform will give the ability to perform processing based on the algorithm specified by the researcher within a distributed cloud environment.  Conclusion: The developed software and GIStools were used for various planetary studies including estimates of shape parameters of Phobos [10], Saturn's moon Enceladus, and the Galilean satellite Ganymede [11], productions of accurate planetary maps [12], surface analyses at different levels of details [13, 14] as well as landing site studies for future missions [15].  The tools, described above, are now use into the ArcGIS as stand-alone software for planetary thematic tasks. In future it is planned to integrate them via cross-platform cloud GIS environment in new version of Planetary data geoportal with extended functionalities.  Acknowledgments.
