They are on the order of ~2km thick [1] and are interpreted to contain a record of past martian climates (e.g., [1-3]). The link between the current NPLD’s uppermost layer, commonly thought to be the North Residual Ice Cap (NRIC), and current martian climate is explored in this abstract.  Previous estimates of the NRIC age have ranged from 8.7kyr [4] to ~120kyr [5] based on crater counting. Banks et al. [6] used a combination of HiRISE images and the Hartmann [7] production function to determine that the NRIC did not have a single age, but rather the crater population was in equilibrium with an upper age limit of ~10-20Kyr.  We revisit the work of [6] using a production function developed from currently-forming small impacts (craters 10s of meters in diameter) in the dusty regions of Mars [8]. This production function offers an alternative to the scaled lunar isochrons for craters more similar in size (minimum 250m-diameter on the lunar mare) and timescale (Gyr on the lunar mare) to the craters on the NRIC (tens to hundreds of meters and thousands of years). We calculate crater lifetimes based on the two production functions [7,8]. We compare these data to results from thermal and ice accumulation modeling in order to estimate the current accumulation rate on the NRIC.   Fig. 1 Polar projection map of the region of interest (blue), locations of crater sites (black and red) and sites with DTMs (red). The base map is Mars Orbiting Laser Altimeter (MOLA) shaded-relief topography.  Crater Observations & Statistics: We revised the catalog given in [6] by re-measuring crater diameters and locations, as well as requesting HiRISE images for craters that were previously only measured in CTX images. We adopt the same region of interest (ROI) as in [6].  We have 85 impact sites in our catalog (Fig. 1) >10m-diameter, and do not consider the catalog complete below 31m-diameter due to resolution limitations. Effective diameters for crater clusters, easily identifiable due to the general lack of impact craters on the NRIC surface, are calculated using the formula (Σ D3)(1/3) [9, 10]. Fig. 2 shows the crater size-frequency distribution (SFD) of the NRIC craters, along with isochrones from the [7,8] production functions, which will be discussed below. Strength Correction & Viscous Relaxation:  The craters on the NRIC differ from those on the dusty surfaces on Mars because the target material is largely icy (<5% dust content [11]). This brings up two issues: the effects of material strength on crater diameter for rocky (craters which both production functions are calculated based on) vs. icy (the NRIC craters) targets and the potential effects of viscous relaxation.  We used pi-group scaling described in [12] as a basis for the calculated target strength correction. We used effective strengths of 0.5, 1.0, and 2MPa for the ice (in the range of effective yield strength of other materials considered in [12]) and the values for regolith given in [12, 13]. The results from the yield effective strength of 1.0MPa are shown in Fig. 2. Taking this scaling into account allowed us to re-bin the crater diameters (Fig. 2). In general, the relative strength of ice causes craters on the NRIC to be larger in diameter than an equivalent impact into regolith.  Viscous relaxation does affect larger South PLD craters (e.g. [14]), though viscous relaxation for a ~100m-diameter crater is on the order of less than 1 mm yr-1 [15]. This is not detectable over the lifetime of the NRIC, including those reported in previous work, e.g. [6].  Crater Lifetimes: To calculate the NRIC lifetime of craters (Table 1) as a function of crater diameter, we use the same technique as used in [6] for their reported lifetimes.  The Daubar et al. [8]-based production function produces a lifetime an order of magnitude shorter for   2154.pdf

  Fig. 2 Differential SFD of the NRIC craters plotted with isochrons (dashed blue) from the a) Hartmann [2005] production function [7] and b) Daubar et al. [2013]-based production function [8]. Red points are our NRIC crater data. Black squares are the scaled crater diameters, assuming a yield strength in ice of 1MPa. Solid lines are best fit lines to the differential SFDs from unscaled and scaled crater diameters. Uncertainties shown are one-sigma and calculated for small numbers according to [17].

Modeling:  In order to calculate the accumulation rate on the flat NRIC between craters, the crater lifetime results (which gives a timescale for observed accumulation within craters, e.g. PSP_009770_2655) need to be combined with an ice accumulation model. Our model (based on [16]) combines free and forced convection to calculate the amount of ablation (or deposition) on an icy surface. We use a thermal model (which will be combined with appropriate shadowing parameters) to calculate the temperatures within a crater on the NRIC. These temperatures will be combined with the accumulation modeling to calculate total predicted infill in craters, based on the calculated lifetimes. We can compare these results to observed bright deposits within NRIC craters (especially for craters that also have digital terrain models, Fig. 1) to give an overall accumulation rate within the crater.  This modeling will constrain values, like the nearsurface vapor content of the martian atmosphere in the north polar region, that will then be used to constrain the similar accumulation modeling on a flat surface on the NRIC. Latest results will be presented at the conference. References: [1] Byrne, S. (2009), AREPS, 37, 535360 [2] Murray, B.C., W.R. Ward, S.C. Yeung (1973), Science, 180, 368-640 [3] Thomas P. et al.
