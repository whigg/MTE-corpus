   Scientific Data and its Release Of Chang'E-3 Mission. W. Zuo1 , C. L. Li1, Z. B. Zhang1, X. G. Zeng1, Y. L. Zou1,and G. L. Zhang1, 1 Key Laboratory of Lunar and Deep Space Exploration, National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100012, China. zuowei@nao.cas.cn.  Introduction: The Chang'E-3 (CE-3) mission was successfully launched at December 1, 2013 as China's third lunar probe and first lunar lander/rover mission of the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program (CLEP). CE-3 landed at (19.51ºW, 44.12ºN) in northwestern Mare Imbrium on December 14, 2013. The Yutu rover separated from the lander on Dec.14, and the CE-3 lander and Yutu rover took photos of each other on Dec.15, marking the complete success of the CE-3 lunar probe mission.By December 31,2014, CE-3 had completed the main scientific objectives within its one-year expected life time. Up to now, CE-3 lander is still running which has been extended operation one year. Instrumentation and Science Mission Objectives: The CE-3 lander and rover each carries four science instruments. Instruments on the lander are: Landing Camera (LCAM), Terrain Camera (TCAM), Extreme Ultraviolet Camera (EUVC), and Moon-based Ultraviolet Telescope (MUVT). The four instruments on the rover are: Panoramic Camera (PCAM), VIS-NIR Imaging Spectrometer (VNIS), Active Particle induced Xray Spectrometer (APXS), and Lunar Penetrating Radar (LPR). The CE-3 science objectives includes: (1) investigation of the morphological features and geological structures of and near the landing area; (2) integrated in-situ analysis of mineral and chemical composition of and near the landing area; (3) integrated exploration of lunar interior structure; and (4) exploration of the terrestrial-lunar space environment and lunar surface environment and lunar-based astronomical observations. The details of these instruments and CE-3 science objectives are listed in Table 1.Table 1 CE-3 science objectives with instrument measurement capabilities Science Objective Instrument Science Exploration Tasks Contributing  Instruments Geomorphology and geological structures of and near the landing area LCAM 3D imagery Lander  Instruments TCAM PCAM Rover Instruments Mineralogy and chemical composition of and near the landing area VNIS In-situ analysis of （element content and distribution、mineralogical content and distribution、noble gases） Integrated analysis of mineral and energy resources Rover Instruments APXS Integrated exploration of lunar interior structure LPR Regolith thickness and subsurface structure Rover Instruments Terrestrial-lunar space environment and lunar-based, optical astronomical observation MUVT Moon-based astronomical observation Lander  Instruments EUVC EUV imaging of terrestrial plasmasphere  Classification and Storage of Science Data: The data from the CE-3 lander and rover can be divided into three major categories: science, engineering and anciallary data. The science data are further classified, base on the source instruments ,as LCAM , TCAM, PCAM, VNIS, APXS, LPR, MUVT and EUVC, respectively. Science data deposited in the data archive center at the Ground Research and Application System (GRAS) of CLEP with open access to the exploration and science community. Depending on how they are acquired and pre-processec, the science data are categorized into five leves including the raw data and levels 0,1,and 2 data, as detailed in Table 2. During 12 months of the nominal mission, the GRAS has received raw data of ~1.1 TB, and the processing of these leads to the data products of ~2.8 TB at various levels of various instruments. The statistics of the CE-3 science data is shown in Table 3. Table 2 CE-3 data processing levels Data level Data description Remarks Raw data Downlink data  Bit stream data Frame data Frame sequence after frame synchronization, descrambling, and RS decoding Real-time transmission Level 0A Payload data source packages   Level 0B Payload science data block  Level 1 Data after physical quantity conversion, and mosaicked based on exploration periods  Level 2 Based on level 1 data, further processed with radiometric Data after payload system calibration and geometric calibration,  Further divided into levels 2A, 2B and 2C 1353.pdf

The levels 2 data for all instruments are available for download by any interested user. The release products of CE-3 data as detailed in Table 4. The users should login to the GRAS website (http://moon.bao.ac.cn/ceweb/datasrv/dmsce3.jsp) to obtain these data. According to the regulations of data release and management as well as data application statistics, the GRAS has released data products of ~1.5 TB for all the 8 CE-3 instruments to a total mumber of 28 institutes from the mainland of China, and Macao. In addition, by December 31,2015, 3337 registered users had downloaded the data by logging into the lunar exploration data release system.
