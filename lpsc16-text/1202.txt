WHAT ACCELERATES THE DEGRADATION OF SMALL LUNAR CRATERS? UNEXPECTED,CONTRASTING RATES OBSERVED AT APOLLO 16 AND 17 REGIONS P. Mahanti1, M.S.Robinson1,T.J.Thompson1, C.H. van der Bogert2 1Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera, School of Earth and Space Exploration, Arizona State University, Tempe,AZ,USA (pmahanti@asu.edu);2Institut fu¨r Planetologie, Mu¨nster, Germany.Introduction: For most surfaces on the Moonsmaller crater populations are in equilibrium, that isthe craters disappear at the same rate as new ones areformed [1, 2]. Cataloging the degree of erosion sufferedby each crater in a small lunar crater (SLC ; 35 m< D < 250 m) population, within a geological unit,gives insight to the processes that control degradationover time and the rate of degradation. Analysis of craterdensity describes the retention of craters at a target butdoes not elucidate the effects progressive degradation.Here we use high resolution (2 to 5 m pixel scales)Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera Narrow AngleCamera stereo derived topography to investigate cratershapes within a crater population (depth over diameter,or dD ) and infer degradation rates and processes.In this work, we compare the time-dependent degradation state of SLCs by analyzing the population densityvs dD for the Cayley formation (Apollo 16) a highlandregion and mare plains exhibiting dark mantle depositsin the Taurus Littrow Valley (Apollo 17) with methodssimilar to a study based on craters in mare regions [3].The flat local topography for our two study regions (Fig.1) ensures that terrain steepness has minimal effect onthe slow impact-induced degradation process.Methods: Craters were identified manually fromNAC ortho-photo mosaics, the digital terrain model(DTM) and a derived slope map [4]. We characterized1471 craters in the Cayley formation region and 1372craters in Taurus Littrow. Most craters were smallerthan 100 m (median D < 75 m). Depth and diameter measurement for each crater was extracted automatically [5] from NAC DTMs and cumulative distributionfunctions (CDF) of dD was obtained. Degradation ratesare estimated as a product of crater production rate andinverse of ∂N∂(d/D) [3], where N is modeled from the CDFand [6] is a function of dD and is the number of craterswith dD greater than a given value. The crater production rate for the size range investigated is obtained fromprevious work and was found to vary between 10−10to 10−8 (cumulative number; per square km per year)[7]. Our estimated degradation rates originating fromthe change in crater shape with time are directly proportional to the true absolute physical degradation rate.Results and Discussions: A crater production rateof 10−9 yields degradation rates (measured as changein dD value per unit time) varying from 0.65 x 10−6 peryear (when dD = 0.17) to 0.04 x 10−6 per year (when dD= 0.1) for the Apollo 16 Cayley region. In contrast, corFigure 1: Local slope at Apollo 16 and 17 sitesresponding rates for Apollo 17 mare plains were 2.95x 10−6 per year and 0.05 x 10−6 per year. Degradation rates at the Apollo 17 mare plains was higher compared to the Cayley plains, implying faster transitionfrom fresh to degraded craters. Degradation slows overtime such that the difference in degradation rates alsodecreases as craters mature (rate for Apollo 17 is about5 times that for Apollo 16 at dD = 0.17 and atdD = 0.1,the rates are same (Fig. 2)).Figure 2: Degradation rates for Cayley and Taurus Littrowderived based on the CDF of dD. Small craters leave the population when depths are less than 20% of initial depth.The result obtained is counter-intuitive since degradation rates in the highlands (deeper regolith) are expected1202.pdf

to be faster compared to mare regions for smaller craters[8]. Degradation rates for larger craters (800 m−5 km)were found to be 10x slower in the maria in a recentwork [9]. At crater sizes investigated here, the degradation process differs in some significant manner fromthat of larger craters.Small crater lifetime is affected by factors (Fig.3)other than the average production and impact-baseddegradation rates - the dynamics of the formation obliteration equilibrium can change within an equilibriumpopulation, and SLCs can degrade faster (or slower)than the average equilibrium rate based on local conditions [10]. Degradation is accelerated at less-cohesive/weaker targets and targets can be intrinsically weakdue to the material property or layering. Effusive and(or) explosive volcanism can add discontinuous strengthboundaries in the target layers that accelerate or slowthe pace of degradation. Seismic and impact eventscan weaken existing targets, either instantly or progressively.Figure 3: Factors affecting degradation rate in small cratersFaster degradation of fresh SLCs at the Apollo 17 sitecould be attributed to various causes. Shaking from theimpact of Tycho secondaries [11] may have acceleratedthe degradation while possibly obliterating other SLCs.Another possibility is seismic shaking from movementalong the Lee-Lincoln scarp [12, 13]; both in terms ofweakening the mare materials and also directly accelerating degradation in then-existing craters.Recent work suggests an upper limit of 400 My forthe time in which small crater (D ≤ 50 m) depths arereduced by 99% [9]. However, SLCs are typically unrecognizable when their d/D drops below 0.03 (80%reduction (Figure 2)). Since the time spent at everysuccessive degradation step increases exponentially (therate decreases exponentially), we estimate that SLCsbecome unrecognizable in less than 25% of the suggested upper limit (100 My). Since post-Tycho craterscould have formed and matured to the current population, role of Tycho secondary impacts in acceleratingthe degradation of the crater population is questionable.Further, plotting dD values corresponding to crater location do not indicate a change in maturity with distance from either the general location of Lee-Lincolnscarp or the central cluster of Tycho secondaries (Fig.4). Thus, we propose the hypothesis that the unconsolidated nature of the target with multiple strength boundaries (basalt at base followed by effusive and pyroclastic layers) at various depths) causes SLCs to degraderapidly at Taurus Littrow, leading to a deficiency in SLCcounts[14, 15, 16, 17]. The Cayley plains are thick andunconsolidated but perhaps lack the presence of strengthboundaries leading to stabler crater walls.Conclusion: We characterize SLC degradation andestimate the faster degradation rates (about 5x for freshcraters) at the Taurus Littrow due to the weaker, noncohesive, multi-layered nature of the target (in comparison to the Cayley formation) that speeds the degradation process. Similar local accelerated degradation canchange the size-range of craters in equilibrium whichneeds to be considered when deriving absolute modelages from CSFDs.Figure 4: Spatial variation of dDat the Apollo 17 mare plains.References: [1] L.
