Introduction: It has been postulated that the Taurid Complex contains a resonant meteoroid swarm responsible for an enhanced activity of Taurid fireballs in specific years [1]. Calculations based on this assumption indicated that this increase in Taurid fireball activity would take place in 2015 [2]. This result was confirmed by the recordings performed by our meteorobserving stations. Thus, during the activity period of the Taurids in 2015 we focused our attention on the analysis of these fireballs with the aim to obtain their atmospheric path and orbital elements. We also employed an array of spectrographs to obtain information about the chemical nature of the progenitor meteoroids. Here we present a preliminary analysis of some of the emission spectra recorded during this monitoring campaign.  Methods: The emission spectra presented here were obtained by CCD video-spectrographs operating in the framework of the SMART Project. These devices work in a fully autonomous way thanks to the MetControl software, which was developed by the second author. The video-spectrographs are based on low-lux CCD video cameras (models Watec 902H and 902H Ultimate) that employ aspherical fast lenses (f1.0 to f1.2) covering fixed fields of view ranging from about 90ºx60º to 8ºx5º. To disperse the light emitted by bright meteors, holographic diffraction gratings are attached to these lenses. The spectra have been analyzed with the CHIMET software. Additional information about this research project, the equipment employed and the data reduction software is given in [3]. Emission spectra: As a consequence of optimal weather conditions we could cover the whole activity period of the 2015 Taurids from our meteor observing stations located in the south and the center of Spain. As a result of this monitoring campaign our videospectrographs recorded about 40 emission spectra of multi-station fireball events belonging to the Southern and the Northern branches of the Taurids. Several afterglow spectra were also obtained. Here we present a preliminary analysis of the emission spectrum of three of these fireballs. These meteors are shown in Figures 1 to 3 and were recorded on October 28, November 4 and November 6, respectively. Their association with the Southern or the Northern branch of the Taurids was performed by calculating the orbital elements of the progenitor meteoroids and the value of the DSH dissimilarity function [4]. In this analysis we have considered the usually employed cut-off value DSH<0.15.  Figure 1. Northern Taurid fireball recorded on 28 October 2015 at 22h16m38s UT.   Figure 2.

Emission spectrum of a Southern Taurid fireball afterglow recorded on 6 November 2015 at 23h16m46s UT. The calibrated emission spectra of meteors shown in Figures 1 to 3 are plotted in Figures 4 to 6, respectively. Because of the higher resolution of our new spectral devices, these signals show more detail than the Taurid spectra we discussed in [5]. The main emission lines identified in these spectra have been highlighted. Most of these correspond to neutral Fe, as usually found in meteor spectra. In all cases the contributions from Na I-1 (588.9 nm) and Mg I-2 (516.7 nm) are very noticeable. The H and K lines of ionized Ca have been also identified, but these appear blended. These Ca II-1 lines are also blended with the Fe I-4 line in the spectrum shown in Figure 4. Both fireball spectra (Figures 4 and 5) show the emissions of multiplets Ca I-2 (422.6 nm) and Fe I-41 (441.5 nm). Additional analysis of these fireball spectra is currently in progress in order to infer information about the chemical nature of the progenitor meteoroids. The Taurid afterglow spectra recorded during our spectroscopic campaign will be also analyzed in detail to study the processes that take place in the persistent train associated with these fireballs.  Conclusions:. We have presented a sample of three meteor emission spectra recorded during our monitoring of the activity of the Northern and Southern Taurid meteor showers in 2015. As a consequence of the enhanced Taurid fireball activity produced that year, we obtained over 40 emission spectra. Some afterglow spectra were also recorded. These signals are dominated by the emission associated with different Fe I multiplets. The emissions of the Na I-1 doublet and the Mg I-2 triplet are also very noticeable, and the contributions of Ca II-1 and Ca I-2 have been also identified. The detailed analysis of these spectra will provide information about the chemical nature of the progenitor meteoroids and about the processes that take place in Taurid fireball persistent trains.
