AUTOMATIC, EXPLORATORY MINERALOGICAL MAPPING OF CRISM IMAGERY CONTAININGGULLY FEATURES.  E. J. Allender1 and T. F. Stepinski1, 1Space Informatics Lab, University of Cincinnati, 2600Clifton Ave, Cincinnati, 45221. (allendej@mail.uc.edu).Introduction:  Many processing methods exist toextract  mineralogical  information from Compact  Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM)images [1, 2, 3],  however,  such methods are not designed with large-scale, exploratory surveys in mind.Typically,  for  manual  analyses  mineral  informationmust be provided a priori (that is, analysts must knowin advance the mineral type they are looking for) in order  to  select  an  appropriate  RGB  combination   ofCRISM summary products [4, 5] for visualization. Ifspectral  unmixing is  to  be performed as  in [3],   thenumber of potential mineral endmembers must be assumed a priori. Regardless of whether manual analysisor  unmixing takes  place,  resulting mineral  units  andendmembers must be matched to a spectral library foridentification, using either visual [6], or distance-based[7] methods. We present a fully-automated processing pipelinewhich is able to take a raw CRISM TRR3 image as input, and produce a classified and labeled map of interesting mineralogy within an image. Extending the survey performed by [8], we intendto perform a global survey of all 450 gully-containingCRISM images, which overlap observations from [9],and examine the mineral content of these images in order to determine if gully formations may be associatedwith some hydrated mechanism. The existence of anymineralogical  association with orientation,  region,  orlatitude will also be investigated.Automated pipeline: The pipeline requires no userinput other than the initial download of TRR3 imagesand their arrangement into a simple directory structure.Unlike  manual  and  unmixing  methods,  no  a  prioriknowledge is required to implement the pipeline – inplace of a traditional hyperspectral  signature,  we usethe entire suite of band-depth-based summary products[4, 5] to capture key absorption features at each pixel.This way, no tri-color CRISM summary product combinations need to be selected a priori, as is usually performed for mineral visualization, because we utilize allsummary products  relevant  to  surface  mineralogy atthe same time. Additionally, due to the algorithms [10,11] we have chosen for the mineral detection and exemplar  identification stage, we are able to automatically estimate the number of 'interesting' mineral typeswithin an image. Following each run of the pipeline,exemplar signatures – each of which represent an 'interesting' mineral type present in an image – may bequeried with respect to their mineral type. This greatlyfacilitates exploratory analysis as hundreds of imagesneed not be manually searched by an analyst lookingfor a specific mineral type. Instead, they may query amineral type of interest (for example, Mg-Carbonate),and be presented with a list  of FRTs containing evidence for this mineral. The pipeline operates in stages, as follows:Stage 1. Pre-processing: The pipeline is initializedin  the  GRASS GIS  environment  [12]  with  a  singlecommand  and  performs  all  standard  pre-processingsteps using CRISM ANALYSIS TOOLKIT (CAT) procedures. IR summary products are also generated foreach image. At the end of this stage, each image is represented  by a raster,  in  which  each  pixel  contains  avector  of  18  (surface-related)  summary  product  responses.  Pre-processed  images  are  passed  through  acontrol  script  which  calls  all  subsequent  processingstages  whose   components  are  written  in  C,  R  andbash.Stage 2. Segmentation:  Graph-based segmentation[13] is then performed to segment the image into homogeneous regions called 'superpixels'. The mean signatures  of  these  superpixels  are  the input  for  subsequent processing stages.Stage 3.  Mineral detection and exemplar identification: We use the DEMUD algorithm [10] to identifythe most unique superpixel signatures within each image, and the OPTICS clustering algorithm [11] to eliminate redundancy within this set and to output a finalset of exemplars representing mineralogical units to bemapped. Stage  4.  Mineral  type  labeling:  Using  a  customLookUp-Table (LUT) based on summary product sensitivities from [5] a mineral type is assigned to eachexemplar based on the elements of its summary product  signature  that  are  enhanced  with  respect  to  theoverall image. A text file containing the labeled exemplars is output along with a map of their spatial distribution for each image. Stage 5 (optional). Mineralogical query:  In orderto make use of the output from the labeling stage whenprocessing a large number of sites we have additionallybuilt in a search function, so that a user may query amineral type of interest and obtain a text file containing the names of all FRTs in which evidence for thatmineral type has been detected. Preliminary results:  Initial testing was performedon 20 sites containing a range of surface features (notonly gullies) whose content has previously been docu1518.pdf

mented using manual methods [6, 14, 15, 16, 17]. Figure 1 shows our pipeline output for FRT3E92, an image from the initial testing phase manually studied by[14], who specifically set out to analyze phyllosilicatecontent at the site. We produced this map with no a priori knowledge of its content, and made no a priori assumptions  as  to  how  many  mineral  types  may  bepresent. The image was simply presented to the pipeline, and the map was output along with a labeled filedescribing the interesting mineral  types detected. Wewere not limited to the detection of any particular typebased on the selection of summary products used, as[14] was.Figure 1: Output  map for testing image FRT3E92.Based  on  encouraging  results  from  the  testingphase  we  have  now  progressed  to  exploring  100CRISM images containing poleward-facing gully formations. These 100 sites are only a subset of our eventual goal of processing all 450 CRISM images containing gullies of a variety of orientations from [9] to investigate  whether  a  hydrated  mechanism  may  haveplayed a role in their formation, or if any mineralogicalassociation exists with orientation, region, or latitude.The current subset of 100 poleward-facing sites coversthe Terra Sirenum, Aonia Terra, Noachis Terra, ArgyreBasin, and Hellas Basin regions, from -30 to -50 degrees latitude.88 of the 100 gully-containing sites were found tocontain interesting mineral types, as shown in Figure 2.These sites are labeled to highlight sites displaying evidence of hydrated mineralogy. From this figure no strong correlation with latitudeor region is observed, however, at present we presentonly the preliminary results of our global survey. Each of the 88 images containing mineral types ofinterest  were  individually  examined  to  determinewhether any mineral units were associated with gullyfeatures.  Of the  51 images  containing both hydratedand mafic minerals,  only 17 had  deposits  associatedwith gully features. Of the 36 images containing onlymafic minerals, 25 were associated with gully features.The single image containing only hydrated mineralogywas not associated with any gully features. Therefore,like [8] we suppose that the presence of hydrated mineralogy within gully features is a result of the exposureof underlying mineral deposits and not a result of thegully formation mechanism - gullies generally appearto be spectrally indistinct from their surroundings, asevidenced by the large number associated with maficmineralogy.Ultimately,  use of our pipeline will greatly facilitate  exploratory  analysis  and  large-scale  image  surveys,  as  hundreds  of  images  need  not  be  manuallysearched by an analyst looking for a specific mineraltype.  We have  preliminarily  demonstrated  this  on  asubset  of  100  gully-containing  CRISM  images,  andplan to continue our exploration at a global scale.References: [1] Murchie et al.
