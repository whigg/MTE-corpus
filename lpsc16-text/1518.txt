Introduction:  Many processing methods exist to extract  mineralogical  information from Compact  Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) images [1, 2, 3],  however,  such methods are not designed with large-scale, exploratory surveys in mind. Typically,  for  manual  analyses  mineral  information must be provided a priori (that is, analysts must know in advance the mineral type they are looking for) in order  to  select  an  appropriate  RGB  combination   of CRISM summary products [4, 5] for visualization. If spectral  unmixing is  to  be performed as  in [3],   the number of potential mineral endmembers must be assumed a priori. Regardless of whether manual analysis or  unmixing takes  place,  resulting mineral  units  and endmembers must be matched to a spectral library for identification, using either visual [6], or distance-based [7] methods. We present a fully-automated processing pipeline which is able to take a raw CRISM TRR3 image as input, and produce a classified and labeled map of interesting mineralogy within an image. Extending the survey performed by [8], we intend to perform a global survey of all 450 gully-containing CRISM images, which overlap observations from [9], and examine the mineral content of these images in order to determine if gully formations may be associated with some hydrated mechanism. The existence of any mineralogical  association with orientation,  region,  or latitude will also be investigated. Automated pipeline: The pipeline requires no user input other than the initial download of TRR3 images and their arrangement into a simple directory structure. Unlike  manual  and  unmixing  methods,  no  a  priori knowledge is required to implement the pipeline - in place of a traditional hyperspectral  signature,  we use the entire suite of band-depth-based summary products [4, 5] to capture key absorption features at each pixel. This way, no tri-color CRISM summary product combinations need to be selected a priori, as is usually performed for mineral visualization, because we utilize all summary products  relevant  to  surface  mineralogy at the same time. Additionally, due to the algorithms [10, 11] we have chosen for the mineral detection and exemplar  identification stage, we are able to automatically estimate the number of 'interesting' mineral types within an image. Following each run of the pipeline, exemplar signatures - each of which represent an 'interesting' mineral type present in an image - may be queried with respect to their mineral type. This greatly facilitates exploratory analysis as hundreds of images need not be manually searched by an analyst looking for a specific mineral type. Instead, they may query a mineral type of interest (for example, Mg-Carbonate), and be presented with a list  of FRTs containing evidence for this mineral. The pipeline operates in stages, as follows: Stage 1. Pre-processing: The pipeline is initialized in  the  GRASS GIS  environment  [12]  with  a  single command  and  performs  all  standard  pre-processing steps using CRISM ANALYSIS TOOLKIT (CAT) procedures. IR summary products are also generated for each image. At the end of this stage, each image is represented  by a raster,  in  which  each  pixel  contains  a vector  of  18  (surface-related)  summary  product  responses.  Pre-processed  images  are  passed  through  a control  script  which  calls  all  subsequent  processing stages  whose   components  are  written  in  C,  R  and bash. Stage 2. Segmentation:  Graph-based segmentation [13] is then performed to segment the image into homogeneous regions called 'superpixels'. The mean signatures  of  these  superpixels  are  the input  for  subsequent processing stages. Stage 3.  Mineral detection and exemplar identification: We use the DEMUD algorithm [10] to identify the most unique superpixel signatures within each image, and the OPTICS clustering algorithm [11] to eliminate redundancy within this set and to output a final set of exemplars representing mineralogical units to be mapped. Stage  4.  Mineral  type  labeling:  Using  a  custom LookUp-Table (LUT) based on summary product sensitivities from [5] a mineral type is assigned to each exemplar based on the elements of its summary product  signature  that  are  enhanced  with  respect  to  the overall image. A text file containing the labeled exemplars is output along with a map of their spatial distribution for each image. Stage 5 (optional). Mineralogical query:  In order to make use of the output from the labeling stage when processing a large number of sites we have additionally built in a search function, so that a user may query a mineral type of interest and obtain a text file containing the names of all FRTs in which evidence for that mineral type has been detected. Preliminary results:  Initial testing was performed on 20 sites containing a range of surface features (not only gullies) whose content has previously been docu mented using manual methods [6, 14, 15, 16, 17]. Figure 1 shows our pipeline output for FRT3E92, an image from the initial testing phase manually studied by [14], who specifically set out to analyze phyllosilicate content at the site. We produced this map with no a priori knowledge of its content, and made no a priori assumptions  as  to  how  many  mineral  types  may  be present. The image was simply presented to the pipeline, and the map was output along with a labeled file describing the interesting mineral  types detected. We were not limited to the detection of any particular type based on the selection of summary products used, as [14] was. Figure 1: Output  map for testing image FRT3E92. Based  on  encouraging  results  from  the  testing phase  we  have  now  progressed  to  exploring  100 CRISM images containing poleward-facing gully formations. These 100 sites are only a subset of our eventual goal of processing all 450 CRISM images containing gullies of a variety of orientations from [9] to investigate  whether  a  hydrated  mechanism  may  have played a role in their formation, or if any mineralogical association exists with orientation, region, or latitude. The current subset of 100 poleward-facing sites covers the Terra Sirenum, Aonia Terra, Noachis Terra, Argyre Basin, and Hellas Basin regions, from -30 to -50 degrees latitude. 88 of the 100 gully-containing sites were found to contain interesting mineral types, as shown in Figure 2. These sites are labeled to highlight sites displaying evidence of hydrated mineralogy. From this figure no strong correlation with latitude or region is observed, however, at present we present only the preliminary results of our global survey. Each of the 88 images containing mineral types of interest  were  individually  examined  to  determine whether any mineral units were associated with gully features.  Of the  51 images  containing both hydrated and mafic minerals,  only 17 had  deposits  associated with gully features. Of the 36 images containing only mafic minerals, 25 were associated with gully features. The single image containing only hydrated mineralogy was not associated with any gully features. Therefore, like [8] we suppose that the presence of hydrated mineralogy within gully features is a result of the exposure of underlying mineral deposits and not a result of the gully formation mechanism - gullies generally appear to be spectrally indistinct from their surroundings, as evidenced by the large number associated with mafic mineralogy. Ultimately,  use of our pipeline will greatly facilitate  exploratory  analysis  and  large-scale  image  surveys,  as  hundreds  of  images  need  not  be  manually searched by an analyst looking for a specific mineral type.  We have  preliminarily  demonstrated  this  on  a subset  of  100  gully-containing  CRISM  images,  and plan to continue our exploration at a global scale. References: [1] Murchie et al.
