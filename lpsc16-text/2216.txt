EDUCATION AND PUBLIC OUTREACH FOR THE 2015 CANMARS MSR ANALOGUE MISSION. P. J. A. Hill1, M. C. Kerrigan1, G. R. Osinski1,2 1Department of Earth Sciences and Centre for Planetary Science and Exploration (CPSX), University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada (phill6@uwo.ca). 2Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada.  Introduction: The 2015 CanMars MSR Analogue Mission [1] was a Mars Sample Return Analogue Mission carried out in partnership between the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates Ltd., and the Centre for Planetary Science and Exploration (CPSX) at the University of Western Ontario, as part of the NSERC CREATE project "Technologies and Techniques for Earth and Space Exploration" (create.uwo.ca). As with actual space missions, public education and outreach was a priority for this analogue mission. This was achieved  through a strong presence on social media; attention on local, regional, and national news networks; and interaction with the local community. This report will provide an overview of the various media campaigns used throughout the mission and comment on the success and shortcomings to provide insight for future missions. Social media:  The mission's presence on social media took three main forms: Twitter, Facebook, and a WordPress blog.  Twitter. The public could follow along with the mission using the hashtag #CanMars - chosen for its shortness and to emphasize that this was a Canadian mission. From November 15th to December 5th, 1,794 tweets utilized the #CanMars. To collect statistics on the performance of #CanMars, Hashtracking was used to provided daily analytics. There were multiple accounts that helped to populate the hashtag. As the CPSX was hosting mission control, @WesternUCPSX provided daily updates and an overview of mission on a day-to-day basis. Trainees in mission control were encouraged to tweet about their experiences with their instruments and their work with other members of the team. The CSA (@csa_asc) and NSERC (@NSERC_CRSNG) also provided a greater reach for #CanMars; however, their tweets were much more infrequent than CPSX's and the students. The final main contribution was from media outlets tweeting about the articles that they had written up after visiting mission control. The statistics for this time period are highlighted in Table 1. The temporal distribution of the mission's activity on Twitter can be seen in Figures 1 and 2.                                   Facebook. CPSX, CSA, and trainee's posted news articles and pictures from the mission providing the analogue mission's presence on Facebook. Statistics are only available for CPSX Facebook page and are shown in Table 2.             Blog posts. For each Sol of the mission trainees provided an overview of their instrument and the experience that they were gaining by being involved with the analogue mission. These were posted each day on the create.uwo.ca website and then later tweeted about 2216.pdf

These blogs covered all of the instruments on MESR as well as the tactical and planning aspects of the mission. In addition the CSA designated a specific webpage to the analogue mission and tweeted about it to gain awareness. Media Presence:  In addition to the mission's presence on social media, a media day was arranged for the Tuesday of the first week of operations. This was an open house opportunity by which members of the press were invited to interview the organizers of the mission and the trainees involved in mission control. Table 3 lists all the various news outlooks and the geographic reach of their audience.                    Outreach Event: To inspire the next generation of space explorers, a group of 10 to 12 year olds were invited to visit control and take part in an outreach activity. The objective of this outreach event was to provide the students with a sense of how rover mission are conducted by showing the student how mission control was operated. During the event, 11 students were given a short presentation on rover missions and analogue missions before being split into two groups and taken to the mission control centre. While the one group visited mission control, the other worked on an activity where they had to successfully build a lander that would land upright without breaking. Overall the students were enthusiastic and enjoyed the event and the instructor received very positive feedback. Pubic Night: To further engage the public, an open house night was arranged so that people could see how the mission was organized. The objective of this event was to increase public awareness about the 2015 CanMars MSR Analogue Mission and how the Univeristy of Western was involved in this mission. The general public met with members of the science team who talked to them about their roles in the mission and how the mission was structured. Replicas of the instruments that were used in the mission were on display for the public to interact with and members of the science team were present to explain their functionality. Finally Dr. Gordon Osinski gave a public talk on rover missions and the uses of terrestrial analogues. Though attendance was not counted, conservative estimates place the number of people present at over 70 people. Conclusions: The mission was well represented on all media platforms and actively engaged the public with the public. An audience of 2.6 million users was reached through Twitter and Facebook. In addition traditional media, and the events planned greatly increased awareness for the mission on a local level. Overall the success of this media campaign was due to the combined efforts of CPSX, the CSA, and the trainees involved; without the effort of these parties the mission would not have received the same attention. However, for any future missions the following improvements can be made: . The number of timeline deliveries and the reach on twitter peaked rapidly within the first few days of operations and trailed off towards to the end. This corresponded with the occurrence of the media day on the first Tuesday. To prevent this in the future, multiple media days that are spaced over the two weeks might cause a more evenly distributed of attention on Twitter. . The team in the field could take a more active role in future missions. Posting pictures of the rover from the field were some of the most popular tweets and Facebook posts; however, they were very few. An increase in activity from the field could engage a large audience. . Greater coordination between Western and the CSA in regards to Twitter could see even greater attention for future missions.  . The public night was a trial. Given its success a larger event in 2016 could bring in a greater audience. Attendance from government officials or people from outside of London would greatly increase public awareness. Also, activates that for younger children should be organized as many children became restless throughout the evening.
