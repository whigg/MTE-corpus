DRIVING IN THE DARK: RESULTS FROM SOUTH LUNAR POLE ANALOGUE STUDY.  M. D. G Cross1,2 and K. A.

Introduction:  Recent interest in prospecting at the south Lunar pole has renewed interests in the design and operation of Lunar rovers [1,2]. Until the 2014 Chang'e 3 Yutu rover, the most recent mobile robotic mission was the 1973 Lunakhod 2 rover [3]. Technology in communications, robotics, and autonomy has advanced since then, and landers and rovers have successfully operated on Venus, Titan, and Mars.  The focus of this study is on the direct-drive operations for a south Lunar pole prospecting mission, such are those proposed to carry the Regolith and Environment Science and Oxygen and Lunar Volatile Extraction (RESOLVE) payload suite [4]. A current baseline reference mission [1] relies on operating the prospecting rover during one lunar-sol of about 10-14 Earth days. The short-duration of the mission, with minimum sampling and traverse requirements, suggests to us that a direct-drive tele-operation approach would be a technologically simpler, and thus cost-effective means of going forward with the mission to ensure that it gets off the ground. The south Lunar Pole geography presents unique operational challenges. Due to the low solar incidence angle, there will be times at which the rover is facing directly into the sun. In other instances, the low sun angle cast long shadows accentuated by the already sharp contrasts of light and dark, as shown in Figure 1. The vacuum experienced at the moon allows the sun light to travel great distances without attenuation [5].   Figure 1. The long shadows cast by the sun at the south Lunar pole. Image courtesy of JAXA/SELENE. Background:  Both Lunakhod 1 and 2 were tele-operated by direct-drive from Earth. Two teams of 5 took turns operating the rovers: a commander, a driver, a navigator, an engineer, and the radio controller. The operators reported high levels of fatigue after short operating periods due to the low-quality imagery and time delay. Lunakhod 1 operators were reported to have heart rates of up to 130-140beats/min during early manoeuvres [3,6]. Images were sent back from Lunakhod 1 at 1 frame per 20 sec requiring the drivers to memorize features ahead of the rover while still driving and waiting for the next update. For Lunakhod 2 this was increased to 1 frame per 3.2 sec. The drivers also had to cope with extreme light contrasts from shadows to glare.  The Scarab rover was developed at Carnegie Melon University (CMU) to carry a RESOLVE payload in simulated lunar environments. It was designed for repeated coring over several kilometres of traverse, and for navigating in darkness. Scarab used active sensing to facilitate operations in the harsh lighting conditions of the south lunar polar environment. The field tests were conducted for 8 hours overnight, during which the rover was operated for more a kilometre worth of traverses [7].  The University of Oklahoma designed the Copernicus rover [8,9] to test a lunar rover mobility system concept and conducted field trials in the Mojave Desert under lunar-like operating conditions. Their concept was based on a goal to traverse several kilometres per day on the lunar surface with a direct-drive tele-operator, a distance greater than the sub-kilometre traverses of similarly operated Lunakhod. The mobility system was designed to be robust to occasional shocks due to falls from 30cm off of a rock due to occasional operator error. During 6 days of field tests, the driving conditions were adjusted to be closer to be lunar-like: a 4s time delay over a 100kbit/s communication link and low resolution video streamed back at 1.5 - 2 frames per second (FPS). By the 6th day the rover operated its full traverse speed of 35.5cm/s. The total drive, including stops for panoramic imaging and driver rest, was 1.9km over 170min, for an average speed of 18.6cm/s NASA has tested a fleet of Lunar rover test platforms and prototypes: The Lunar Electric Rover (LER), now called Space Exploration Vehicle [10] (SEV) the NASA/ARC K10 rover [10], NASA/JSC Centaur2 rover [11] and NASA/ARC KRex [11]. Each of these rovers were driven in analogue environments to assess LIDAR-based navigation. Testing and Results:  Our testing focused on the human performance of tele-operating a rover in similar lighting conditions experienced at the South Lunar pole over limited bandwidth and time-delay. Testing was performed on the grounds of the Elginfield Observatory located north of the University of Western Ontario. A Clearpath Robotics Husky mobile robot equipped with 2221.pdf

a monocular camera and headlights, shown in the foreground of Figure 2, was teleoperated over a wireless network connection.  Figure 2. A low angle light casts long shadows on the simpler test circuit.  Two sets of three time trials were performed; each set involved five test drivers. Each set of time trials was performed on different test circuits. The test drivers were located in a windowless room within the observatory such that they could not see the test circuit. The operator was provided a video stream at 15 FPS of the view in front of the Husky, and was able to drive it using a gamepad. The time trials were of increasing operational difficulty: daylight conditions without time delay, daylight conditions with time 4s delay, and harsh lighting with 4s time delay. The harsh lighting was after nautical dusk with a 1000W spotlight shining over the circuit. Garbage cans were placed in the path of the light to create long shadows. The video streamed was reduced to 2 FPS. The first circuit was a simple double figure 8 towards the spot light; from the operator's perspective the Husky was driving into the low-angle light around obstacles, and the driving away from the light into long shadows. The circuit was approximately 90m in displacement and two circuits were completed for a total displacement of 180m. A more complicated circuit with a total displacement of 150m, with more turns and greater distances between waypoints, was completed by a different set of drivers. This complex circuit featured similar situations of driving into the low light and into shadows. The results of the simpler circuit, given in Table 1, show that the drivers had consistent times for the ideal daylight conditions. The addition of the time delay caused an expected increase in completion time. However, by the final run in harsh lighting conditions, the drivers had learned the circuit and 4 of 5 improved their performance. The average speed over circuit in ideal conditions was 0.42m/s and 0.28m/s for harsh lighting conditions compared to a set speed of 0.5 m/s for the Husky. The results of the more complex circuit are shown in Table 2. The average speed for the ideal conditions was 0.41m/s which is consistent with the previous trial. When the time delay was introduced, the average speed reduced to 0.29m/s, and further reduced to 0.20m/s in harsh lighting.  Table 1.

By minimizing the use of autonomy and active sensing, then overall power and computational requirements are lowered which leads to a reduction in program cost. Over the duration of a longer mission, off-loading navigation to autonomy makes far more sense, however the short duration nature of a proposed prospecting mission may benefit from have direct human operators.  We propose that demonstrating the prospecting technology over the short-duration mission is the critical near-term stage; robust autonomy is better suited for a mission of greater duration.
