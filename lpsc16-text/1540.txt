 A Laboratory Based Grazing Incidence X-ray Fluorescence Instrument to Study Genesis Solar Wind Samples M. Schmeling, and J. Davidson Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, IL 60660, mschmel@luc.edu Introduction: The Genesis mission was the first mission returning solar material to Earth since the Apollo program [1, 2]. Unfortunately the return of the space craft on September 8, 2004 resulted in a crash landing, shattering the solar wind collectors into thousands of small fragments. Due to break-up of the return capsule the collectors were also exposed to desert soil and other debris. Consequently only small fragments of the original collectors are available now and each of those has a different degree of contamination with most of the contaminants present at the surface, but some also embedded in the upper surface layer as result of the high velocity impact. Thorough surface cleaning is required to allow for subsequent analysis of solar wind material embedded some 50-100nm below the surface. Various cleaning procedures were developed and are still being developed to remove particulates and a thin film organic contamination acquired during collection in space [3]. Total reflection X-ray fluorescence analysis (TXRF) a non-destructive and highly surface sensitive method is employed to evaluate the cleaning process of various collector materials [4]. TXRF instrumentation uses a fixed angle of incidence for X-rays, the critical angle, to characterize and also quantify materials deposited in micro amounts on a highly polished mirror-like surface. However, in the case of solar wind samples some contaminant material was also found to be embedded within the surface and sometimes a few atomic layers below it due to the high impact velocity. The fixed angle geometry does not permit for identifying material at this locations and grazing incidence X-ray fluorescence (GIXRF) capability is called for. At the moment grazing incident measurements are only possible at the 13-ID-C beamline of the GeoSoilsEnviro Consortium for Advanced Radiation Sources (GSECARS) at Argonne National Laboratory. The angle adjustable X-ray fluorescence set-up at the GSECARS was already successfully employed to determine Fe fluences in silicon solar wind samples [5, 6]. Unfortunately, measurement time is very limited and exceedingly difficult to obtain at GSECARS hence the necessity arises to build a laboratory based X-ray fluorescence instrument with comparable capability and permanent availability for solar wind samples. The somewhat reduced detection power of the laboratory instrumentation will be off-set by longer counting times. The laboratory set-up will feature the flexibility of analyzing under total reflection conditions at the surface (TXRF) and also under grazing incidence (GIXRF) for probing below the surface. Figure 1 shows how fluorescence intensity changes for material deposited at the surface (left) and embedded within the surface (right) in dependency of incident angle [7]. Figure 1: X-ray fluorescence intensity in dependence of incident angle for material deposited on top of a mirror-like surface (left) and embedded within the top few atomic layers of a mirror-like surface (right) (after [7]). Experimental: Figure 2 shows the conceptual drawing of the laboratory build grazing incidence Xray fluorescence spectrometer.

The set-up features two detectors (fluorescence and reflectivity detector), an x,y,z stage for sample movement, a goniometer for angle movement, and a camera for sample observation. The red line shows the path of X-rays through  the system and the purple arrows correspond to the fluorescence signal emitted from the sample. The primary goal of the instrumentation is the ability to change the angle of the incident X-ray beam in small continuous increments reproducibly at different locations of the sample. Thus the set-up must feature an x, y, z stage permitting for horizontal and height movement of the sample and a goniometer for tilting the sample with respect to the X-ray beam. All of them have to be computer controlled. Additional components are a fluorescence detector for recording fluorescence radiation emitted from the sample and a reflectivity detector recording X-ray reflectivity at the sample surface. The X-ray reflectivity will decrease with increasing incident angle thus providing a rough measure of beam intensity. A camera displaying the sample itself on a screen for selection of analysis area will be part of the set-up as well. Results and Conclusion: Figure 3 shows the current status of the instrumentation (as of January 2016) with the sample stage and goniometer already implemented. Figure 3: Current status of the GIXRF instrument. The labels correspond to the following items: a) goniometer and sample table for angle adjustment of the sample with respect to the X-ray beam; b) horizontal x,y motion stage; c) z-stage for sample height adjustment (lift stage); d) X-ray tube featuring a Mo Anode; e) monochromator; f) Si-drift X-ray fluorescence detector. To underline the capability of the future laboratory TXRF/GIXRF instrument figure 4 shows a crude angle scan on Genesis flight sample 60234 executed on the S2Picofox® TXRF spectrometer. The S2Picofox® permits only for rough, not very reproducible angle changes, intended for accommodation of different sample thicknesses. Figure 4: Rough angle scan of Genesis flight sample 60234 performed with the S2Picofax® TXRF spectrometer. The angle of total reflection is at 0.1 degrees, with the X-ray beam penetrating into the sample bulk after that. Sample 60234 consists of a ~3000 Å silicon layer epitaxially grown on polished aluminum oxide substrate. Nicely visible even in this crude scan is the Si layer structure reflected in the Si signal peaking before the X-ray beam starts exciting the aluminum bulk. Barium is present as surface contaminant, peaking before the angle of total reflection and Ca and Fe are probably present at the surface and below the surface. When completed, the new TXRF/GIXRF instrument will have a substantially better angle resolution than this graph shows for the S2Picofox®. It will also provide X-ray reflectivity hence monitoring X-ray penetration into the bulk substrate and because of the x, y motion stage, different areas of the sample can be analyzed reproducibly.
