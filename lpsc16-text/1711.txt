RE-EVALUATION OF THE ABSOLUTE CLOSURE AGE OF THE I-Xe STANDARD SHALLOWATER: IMPLICATIONS FOR THE 129I HALF-LIFE VALUE.  O. Pravdivtseva, A. Meshik and C. M. Hohenberg, La-boratory for Space Sciences and Physics Department, Washington University, CB1105, One Brookings Drive, Saint Louis, MO 63130 (olga@physics.wustl.edu).   Introduction:  Short-lived chronometers allow us to decipher the early solar system history with a high degree of precision. Yet, they all provide relative ages and anchoring them to an absolute time scale presents a challenge. Ideally, to normalize the I-Xe chronometer to an absolute time scale, such as that provided by Pb-Pb, the I-Xe and Pb-Pb ages would be measured in the same mineral with the implicit assumption that both chronometers closed at the same time. However, min-erals rich in iodine (hence 129*Xe) usually have concen-trations of uranium too low for high precision Pb-Pb dating, and vice versa.  Therefore, finding suitable material is elusive and, even when we do, "pure" min-eral separates often contain grains with differing I/U ratios and differing susceptibility to partial resetting by secondary processes and shock. Very few meteoritic materials fit the requirement for both good Pb-Pb and good I-Xe ages. The absolute age of Shallowater au-brite, the I-Xe standard, has never been measured di-rectly due to its low U content.  It is instead derived from the observed correlation between I-Xe and Pb-Pb ages in a number of different samples [1].  This ap-proach is more reliable and allows for fine tuning of the absolute I-Xe age normalization when the new data become available. Here we re-evaluate the effective absolute I-Xe closure age of Shallowater with the addi-tion of the new I-Xe data for Hammadah al Hamra (HH) 237 chondrule #1 [2] and Pb-Pb ages adjusted for an updated 238U/235U ratio of 137.794 and meteorite specific U-isotope ratios [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The closure age of Shallowater aubrite: Ac-cording to the proposed single-stage highly energetic event formation scenario for CB chondrules [8], HH 237 skeletal olivine chondrule #1 represents melt frac-tion of the impact-generated plume. The presence of both  U and I, and the likely simultaneous closure of both systems suggests HH 237 may provide suitable material and additional data for I-Xe age normaliza-tion. Release profiles and diffusion properties of radio-genic 129*Xe and 128*Xe extracted from this chondrule by step-wise pyrolysis, indicate presence of two iodine host phases with distinct activation energies of 73 and 120 kcal/mol. In spite of the activation energy differ-ences, the I-Xe isotope systematics of these two phases closed simultaneously at 0.29 ± 0.16 Ma after Shal-lowater, suggesting rapid heating and cooling (possibly quenching) of the CB chondrules, and it was not af-fected by secondary processing. The release profiles of U-fission Xe and I-derived Xe correlate in the high temperature host phase supporting simultaneous clo-sure of I-Xe and Pb-Pb systems. Because of the scarci-ty of interchondrule matrix material in CBs, the Pb-Pb age of silicates from the HH 237 chondrules can be represented by the 4561.9 ± 0.9 age of HH 237 sili-cates [8]. In addition, a U-corrected weighted average Pb-Pb age of 4562.49 ± 0.21 Ma for three magnesian skeletal Gujba (CBa) chondrules has been reported [9]. For the absolute age computation (Figure 1 and Table 1) we include both values for HH 237 chondrule #1.  The Pb-Pb ages are corrected using latest U-isotope ratios for the Earth and solar system of 137.794  0.027 and the meteorite specific U-isotope ratios for Richardton (137.711  0.008) and Acapulco (137.796  0.013). An average of two Allende bulk U-isotope ratios [5,7] of 137.78  0.027 was applied to the Pb-Pb ages of the earliest chondrules and the value of 137.794  0.014 for Gujba [5] used here as a proxy for HH 237 U-isotope ratio value.  Figure 1.  Assuming concordant evolution of I-Xe and Pb-Pb systems in the samples used for absolute age nor-malization, the slope of the Pb-Pb - I-Xe correlation line should be 1.00, if all half-lives are correct. Correc-tions for U-isotopic ratios brings the slope of the free fit Pb-Pb - I-Xe correlation line from the previous val-ue of 0.96  0.11 [1] to 0.98  0.11. The addition of the HH237 chondrule #1 data (Table 1) brings the slope to 1.01  0.11 (Fig.1), supporting simultaneous closure of the I-Xe and Pb-Pb systems in HH 237 chondrule #1 and valuable new data. Derived from this correlation the absolute age of Shallowater is 4562.2  0.2 Ma, 0.1 Ma younger than the previous value [1]. There seems to be stronger correlation (higher R value) for the chondrule data  within the available data set.

lation line that is based only on the chondrule data (Fig.1, solid symbols), is 4562.5  0.2 Ma, although the slope of the line is 0.91  0.21. We suggest a medi-an value of 4562.4  0.2 Ma as the best current esti-mate of the absolute age of Shallowater. This value could be further refined when new suitable data be-comes available. Implications for the 129I half-life: The slopes of I-Xe - Pb-Pb correlation lines range from 1.01  0.11 for the whole set of data points to 0.91  0.21 for chondrules only. These slopes are dependent upon the half-life assumed for 129I. The widely used value of 17 Ma is obtained as an unweighted average of all availa-ble half-life data [16, 17, 18, 19], since the most pre-cisely quoted results of 15.6 ± 0.06 Ma [17] and 15.7 ± 0.06 Ma  [18] Ma for the 129I half-life contain insuffi-cient experimental detail to be properly evaluated [20]. All I-Xe data used here and in the previous estimations of the absolute age of Shallowater [1] have been calcu-lated using the 15.7 ± 0.8 Ma value, an average of two most precise measurements. In order to bring the slope of 0.91  0.21 for the chondrules I-Xe and Pb-Pb ages correlation to about 1.00, the half-life of 129I should be even lower, about 14.6 Ma. However, given the uncer-tainties, we can only propose that the half-life is less than the previously used value of 17 Ma. Although we cannot set the low limit for the half-life of 129I based on these observations, since the slopes of I-Xe - Pb-Pb correlation lines are ≤ 1, the half-life of 129I most prob-ably is ≤ 15.7 Ma. This value is in a good agreement with half-life of 129I 16.1 ± 0.7 Ma listed in Table de Radionucléides (BNM-LNHB/CEA, 2004) and based on the same data [16, 17, 18, 19] but calculated now as the weighted average. Since the 129I half-life only affects the relative I-Xe ages, the few Ma relative to Shallowater, the absolute I-Xe ages are almost immune to this uncertainty in the 129I half-life.  A 10% differ-ence in relative ages, consistent with using 17 Ma ver-sus 15.7 Ma half-life value for calculations, will corre-spond to 0.004% difference in the absolute I-Xe ages for these samples.
