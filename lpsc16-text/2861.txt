Introduction: Extraterrestrial organic molecules are detected in many environments, unfortunately by different means, from the radioastronomy for galactic center sources and molecular clouds to in situ probing for cometary surface or dust particles[1]-[3]. In each of these locations is observed a compound diversity that is sorted by the complexity of the molecular graphs. Complexity increases as chemical reactions operate additions of new atoms or groups onto existent compounds [4]. For instance, that is how hydrogenation process in prestellar cores converts H2 and CO in H2CO first then in methanol [5]. Meteorites bear unmatched natural molecular diversity. So-called simple molecules are reported along macromolecules that cannot be described in other way than statistically[6], [7]. There is a size continuum among the soluble compounds extracted from the Murchison chondrite, revealed by the use of Ultra high resolution mass spectrometry [8]. These compounds size is inbetween the molecules detected in space environments (tens of atoms) and heavier macromolecules found only in meteorites. They may have recorded signatures of molecular complexification during the transition from the diffuse interstellar medium to dense molecular clouds. They also may have undergone hydrothermal transformation on the meteorite parent body. Laboratory experiments intended to simulate parent bodies, planetary atmosphere or solar nebula [9]-[11]. Molecular growth is systematically observed, regardless of the conditions. Oxygen- and nitrogen-bearing small molecules (CO, formaldehyde, water, etc.) are turned into mixture of thousands of compounds. The study of the stoichiometric variability is the key point in identifying the chemical mechanism at work. The link between experiments and natural samples can be made through the finding of the universal patterns . The aim of this study is to extract univocal signature of the molecular growth process from an extraterrestral sample. We thoroughly investigated the molecular complexity of more than 2000 compounds at a time and identified patterns consistent with saturated aliphatic chain growth on icy grains.  Materials: The phase we extracted will be referred to as WI-FOM (for Water-Insoluble Free Organic Matter). The goal is to focus on the products of extended molecular growth and to eliminate potential contamination. 65 g of Murchison were washed with distilled water during freeze-thaw disaggregation. The resulting powder is free of water-soluble magnesium sulfates, which jeopardized electrospray measurements carried out in a previous study. The sample was macerated in a Fisher Optima Methanol and Toluene (1:2) mixture for 1 week in a dark clean room with no sonication. Glas sware was washed several times in Ethanol with caustic soda and baked at 250°C for at least 12 hours before use. Extracts were recovered after centrifugation and stored in glass tubes. Mass spectra were acquired with a Thermo LTQ Orbitrap XL coupled with an Electrospay ionization (ESI) source, in the 50-500 and the 150-1000 m/z range, both for cations and anions at resolving power m/Δm=100000.  Data treatment: FT-MS techniques yield the exact mass of ions at very high resolving power, revealing molecular diversity. We developed statistical tools that take advantage of the mass defect versus mass (MDvM) representation. The mass defect of a molecule is the difference between its exact mass and the closest integer. It is, in most cases, the sum of the nuclear mass defects of the atoms in this molecule. MDvM plots represent raw data and do not require any assumption on the elements present in the sample. In such diagrams, a polymeric pattern sticks out because of the alignment it generates. If some molecules differ from one another by the addition or subtraction of a given number of atoms, the difference in mass and mass defect between those molecules will correlate. The description of chemical diversity relies here on the correct identification of the most frequent slopes along which data points are aligned. In favorable cases, differential chemis try is described by few consistent "molecular patterns". The complete understanding of a mixture is achieved by the identification of the invariant parts of the molecular population. These "seeds" are as many as required to explain each detected mass by addition or subtraction of one or several molecular pattern(s) to a seed. Thanks to a ± 10 -4 u accuracy, molecular formulas can be computed from each exact mass by a combination algorithm that takes into account stoichiometric rules. Once most significant patterns are identified, we extract from the spectrum the intensities related to molecules from one family. Most of the time, remarkable   distribution can be fitted by a function and therefore be interpreted.  Results: We consider only the cations. Most of the molecular content is restricted to the 150 to 600 m/z range. The resolving power is high enough to rule out any isobaric interference in this m/z range. More than 2000 singly charged cations have been identified. Figure 1 shows at the top (A) the spectrum itself in the classic intensity vs mass-per-charge space and on bottom (B) the MDvM diagram. Alignments are already visible at this scale.  Figure 1  As previously reported at the 45 th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, the compounds found in our extracts belong exclusively to polymeric series based on CxHy , which means that the spread in mass is due to a variability of the hydrocarbon skeleton of the molecules at first place. The overall H/C ratio equals 1.6 and keeps constant at the mixture scale. This is consistent with the polymeric pattern C5H8 being one of the most frequent in this sample. Everything behaves like 1 saturation (cycle or double bond) would add every 5 carbon atoms added to the molecule. This can be due to addition of the carbon chain onto itself to form 6-carbons sp 3 cycles. An other pattern of interest is CH2, as its mass is low and CH2 families have numerous members  (10 to 35 C atoms). In blue on the Figure 1 is highlighted the most intense ions belonging to the HC4N CH2 family. The intensity enveloppe is bell-shaped. Every CH2 families have such distributed intensites. The best fit for these functions is  a lognormal distribution. This distribution has been empirically used by Wesslau et al. (1956) [12] to describe polymerization of polyethylene and is commonly opposed to Schultz distribution to interpret polymer degradation mechanisms [13], [14]. The lognormal distribution is trivially obtained when a normally distributed variable implies a geometric operation. For instance, if one event makes a molecule lose a constant fraction of its mass and the number of this event is normally or Poisson distributed, then the mass distribution is lognormal. This is observed in the electronic ionization reference mass spectra in the NIST database for alkanes. The observation in Murchison extract requires alternatively that the CH2 families come from the degradation of much heavier molecules or that an equilibrium between destruction and addition of saturated chains is reached. The IOM can hardly be the source of so long (up to 35 carbons) chains. On contrary CH2 chemistry is invoked to explain isomeric diversity in certain molecular clouds[1]. Efficient chains destruction mechanism [15] in Photon Dominated Region has been recently reported and may be involved in the Murchsion CH2 families processing. If true, the complexity of this chondritic extract is a signature of the chemical evolution occurring on icy grains. This pushes further the need for very large molecules detection capability in space.  References: [1]Belloche A. et al. (2014) Science., 345, 6204 p. [2] Sandford S. A. et al.
