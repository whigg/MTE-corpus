McDonnell Center for Space Sciences and Physics Department CB1105, Washington University, St. Louis, MO 63130 (am@physics.wustl.edu).        Introduction:  Fission of heavy nuclei is energetic process causing several  µm recoil of fission fragments and evidently could result in significant losses from submicron grains. Whether or not these losses are identical for all isotopes of fission products depend on the micro-distribution of fission fragments.  Kennett and Thode [1] studied the micro-distribution of Xe isotopes in neutron irradiated U3O8 powder imbedded in U-free matrix and found that at low extraction temperatures the apparent fission yields of 131Xe and 132Xe in this material was enriched ~10-fold relative to 134Xe and 136Xe.  A modified version of their experiment included the isotopic analyzes of the Xe accumulated in the neutron irradiated quartz ampoule containing the U-oxide powder [2].  Fission Xe in the ampoule was found to be enriched in 136Xe and 134Xe, complimentary to the low temperature Xe releases from the irradiated powder itself which was depleted in these isotopes.  In both experiments samples received high neutron dose in relatively short time which is not typical for natural environments, with the exception of the Oklo reactors in Gabon [3] which still remains the only occurrence of natural nuclear chain reaction. This isotopic modification of apparent fission yields was attributed to CFFeffect (Chemically Fractionation Fission) [4] and was considered to be a rather exotic process observed mainly in the environments with pulsed neutron flux or short neutron bursts. There were several observations of 131Xe and 132Xe enrichments, similar to those found in the above experiments, but they were either not reproducible [5, 6] or tentatively attributed to neutron capture reactions on Te [7].  The experiment reported here demonstrates that CFF process can modify apparent fission yields not only in the reactors and at nuclear test sites, but also in conventional U-bearing ores where the relatively low neutron flux is nearly constant over time and the temperature changes are slow.        Experiment: The sample used in this work was a fragment of a common uranium rich ore: an assemblage of various uranium oxides, brannerite, coffinite closely overgrown with silicates, forming a U-Si metagel as the result of secondary alteration of coffinite [8].  Xe release profile obtained during stepwise pyrolysis of the original sample (Fig. 1a) was a superposition of Xe released from different minerals costituting the assemblage. Isotopic composition of Xe (after subtraction of small atmospheric contamination) was uniform in all temperature steps.       The aliquot of the same sample was powdered to <74 µm and treated with 6M HNO3 at room temperature until the reaction completed. About 80 wt.% of the original sample has been dissolved by this treatment. The release profile of fission Xe from the treated sample (Fig. 1b) revealed a noticeable low temperature release peak apparently absent in the original sample.     Fig. 1.  Release of fission Xe from the original U-bearing sample (a) and from the sample treated with HNO3 (b). Xe release below 800°C in the acid treated sample tend to form distinct peak with anomalous isotopic composition shown in Fig. 2.   Fig. 2.  Isotopic composition of Xe released from acid treated sample during stepped pyrolysis. All temperature fractions form linear arrays (solid lines) different from mass fractionation lines (dashed).  Fission Xe in all temperature fraction of original sample (blue) is isotopically uniform. Xe in low temperature fractions of treated sample (black) are the different from fractions above 800°C and from the bulk composition (red).   The isotopic shifts of weighted average fission Xe released below 800°C from the bulk Xe composition are correlated with half-lives of radioiodine, an immediate Xe precursor (Fig. 3).     Fig. 3.  Isotopic shifts in fission Xe (136Xe normalized) released below 800C from the acid treated U-bearing sample vs. half-lives of corresponding I isotopes, Xe precursors in fission chains.  This correlation (over 13 orders of magnitude in halflives!) is evidently caused by higher mobility of chemically active radioiodine, a precursor of Xe in fission 3038.pdf

chains.  Apparently, the longer an I isotope lives before decay, the greater distance it can diffuse. After iodine decays, the resulting Xe isotope will reproduce the spatial distribution of its precursor since any -recoil effect is negligible.         Our experiment has demonstrated that microdistribution of fission Xe is isotope-specific even in conventional terrestrial rocks with uniform neutron flux. The acid attacks the radiation damaged zones first releasing the least retentive 136Xe and 134Xe, making the remaining fission Xe complimentarily enriched in 132Xe, 131Xe and 129Xe.  This remaining Xe is released at low extraction temperatures, perhaps indicating association with near surface residences and/or the association with the smallest grains.  This implies that CFF process works only on a small scale and must be averaged on a large scale, in the bulk rock.  Indeed in the untreated sample we do not observe any statistically significant isotopic effects.        Both aqueous alteration and weathering reduce effective grain sizes increasing the surface areas and exposing radiation-damaged zones.  In this case partial fission xenon losses could be accompanied with isotopic modification caused by the CFF-effects. This process is apparently at work at the DOE's Hanford Site in SW Washington State.  Xe releasing from highly radioactive man-made transuranic waste is enriched in the least retentive 136Xe and 134Xe, with the former being approximately twice higher than the latter [9].         Xenon in phase Q: Phase-Q contains the majority of Xe in primitive meteorites. Isotopically Xe-Q is very close to solar Xe fractionated by ~1%/u with 1.5% addition of Xe-HL apparently produced by in supernovae and associated with diamond-rich separates from meteorites [10]. It was recently suggested that in addition to carbonaceous carrier phase Q may contain sulfides known to host U, and therefore  Xe-Q can be modeled as fractionated solar Xe with the addition of uranogenic Xe.  However, this model does not pass the likelihood criterion: the difference between Xe-Q and the model composition  exceeds 7 σ for 132Xe and 134Xe.  Meanwhile the model composition involving Xe-HL agrees with the Xe-Q within 1-2 σ [10].  The association of solar and "presolar" components in phase Q does not have a satisfactory explanation and it is difficult to explain why a nanodiamond-free Saratov (L4) has high concentration of Xe-Q [12].         Phase-Q has a clear excess of 129Xe from extant 129I (15.7 Myr), but apparently little, if any, fission Xe from 244Pu (80 Myr). Our experiment suggests that, due to CFF process, a micro-distribution of fission Xe is not uniform, but isotope-specific. Phase-Q is very finegrained substance separated by severe chemical treatment, somewhat similar to what we applied to the Ubearing sample in our experiment.  We therefore may expect that CFF-process could be at work there and it could modify apparent fission yields from 244Pu fission in the same manner as our experiment modified fission yields of 238U.         Figure 5a shows the composition of Xe-Q fractionated by 0.65%/u in order to match fission-free 124-128Xe isotopes to solar Xe.  After this procedure 131-136Xe become overabundant comparing to the solar Xe. The composition of these isotopes does not match 244Pu or other known fission spectra. But it match very well the composition of Xe releasing from the Hanford nuclear waste site (Fig 5b).  Therefore phase-Q may contain Pu-fission Xe, not a normal one, but modified by CFF in the same way as Xe in the Hanford site was modified from normal 235U fission Xe.  Having completely different nature and origin, these two objects may have one thing in common - they selectively captured least retentive CFF-Xe isotopes, from 235U in Hanford site and from 244Pu in phase Q.   Therefore we can model composition of Xe-Q as 0.65%/u fractionated Solar Xe with 3% (for 136Xe) addition of CFF-Xe from 244Pu.    Fig. 5. Xe composition of fractionated Xe-Q matches Xe releasing from nuclear waste facility. The only exception is 129Xe which did not have enough time to accumulate from decay of fissiogenic 129I at the Hanford site. Conclusion:  CFF is not yet another Xe component with a unique isotopic composition, but is a physiochemical process modifying micro-distribution of fission Xe.  It may explain the composition of Xe-Q without involving pre-solar components.  Supported by NASA grants NNX13AD14G and NNX14A124G.   [1] Kennett T. J. and Thode H. G. (1960, Can. Journ.
