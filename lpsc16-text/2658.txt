MODELING SOLAR COSMIC RAY INDUCED COSMOGENIC NUCLIDES IN SMALL METEOROIDS.  R. Trappitsch1, A. S. G. Roth2, and I. Leya2, 1Department of the Geophysical Sciences and Chicago Center for Cosmochemistry, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA (trappitsch@uchicago.edu), 2Space Research & Planetary Sciences, University of Bern, 3012 Bern, Switzerland (antoine.roth@space.unibe.ch, ingo.leya@space.unibe.ch).   Introduction: Meteoroids in space are irradiated with galactic (GCR) and solar (SCR) cosmic rays. GCRs penetrate the meteoroid to depths in the range of meters and produce cosmogenic nuclides mostly via secondary particle cascades [1,2]. SCRs have a higher flux density than GCRs but lower average energies. They only penetrate the top few cm and do not produce much secondary particles. If the production rate of a cosmogenic nuclide is known, the cosmogenic nuclide amount in a sample can be used to determine a cosmic ray exposure (CRE) age. Due to ablation losses in the atmosphere, meteorites usually do not contain SCR contributions. However, several meteorite types, i.e., martian and aubrites, often show indications for SCR contributions. In addition, [3] demonstrated that SCR contributions can also be found in samples from small ordinary chondrites. Here we present new cosmogenic SCR production rates in ordinary chondrites and we demonstrate that small meteoroids can indeed preserve their cosmogenic SCR record. Interestingly, via deconvolution techniques we can interpret the SCR signals with respect to irradiation time and distance to the sun, because both parameters are closely connected.  Model: For calculating SCR production rates we use a rigidity spectrum with a flux at 1 AU of J0 = 100 cm-2 s-1 and a rigidity of R0 = 125 MV (unless otherwise noted). As target material we use ordinary chondrite compositions (H, L, LL). Using a parameterized description of the Bethe-Bloch equation [4] we then calculate depth dependent particle spectra for various meteoroid sizes. These spectra are then used to calculate depth and size dependent production rates (e.g., [5]). Mean irradiation radius. While GCRs have an almost homogenous flux within the Solar System, SCRs are produced in the sun and their flux decreases proportionally to r-2, where r is the distance from the Sun. For a meteorite with SCR and GCR contributions, the cosmogenic record can be interpreted with respect to r. For example, the measured cosmogenic 21Nemsr is composed like: N"# e%&' = ùëò√óùëù"#,-./ + ùëù"#,1./ √óùë° (1) Here, t is the CRE age and k is a factor scaling the SCR flux to the distance from the sun. The factor k is related to r via k = r-0.5, with r in AU and an SCR flux given at 1 AU. The SCR and GCR production rates are given by p21,SCR and p21,GCR, respectively. The equation contains two unknowns, the CRE age t and the average orbital distance k. Consequently, since the average orbit distance of the meteorite is not a priori known, the CRE age cannot be determined using just one isotope. However, if also the cosmogenic 22Ne composition has been measured, the cosmogenic 21Ne/22Ne together with the cosmogenic 21Ne concentrations can be used to solve equation (1) for t and k. However, additional unknowns are the meteoroid size and shielding depth. One constraint is that the pre-atmospheric size of the meteorite cannot be smaller than the collected total mass. For example, for meteorites with a size of ~1 cm that still contain an SCR record, a meteoroid size of 7 cm would require that 99.7% were lost due to ablation, which already seems unreasonably high.  Here we focus on small meteoroids and calculated SCR production rates in meteoroids with radii of 1 cm, 3 cm, 5 cm, and 7 cm. Using the same model as [1] we also calculated GCR production rates. Since both models use the same cross section database, they are fully consistent. For each meteoroid size and each depth, we can then calculate a possible r and t that fulfills the measured values. An additional constraint is that meteoroids are likely to be irradiated at distances between 1 and ~4 AU, which allows us to further filter the possible radii to reasonable values.

Results and Discussion: Figure 1 compares our production rates with the earlier ones from [6] using as target chemistry the chemical composition of the Apollo 15 drill core. As can be seen, the newly calculated production rates agree reasonably well with the ones from [6]. Differences are most likely due to our updated nuclear cross-section database.  Roth et al. [3] found cosmogenic 21Ne and 22Ne in small meteorites with a size of ~1 cm. Using the new model, we now exemplarily discuss one of their data points. We have chosen the meteoroid Jiddat al Harasis 466 (JaH 466), an H6 ordinary chondrite found in the Omani desert. Roth et al. [3] analyzed a sample for helium and neon isotopes and found that the neon signature is clearly a mixture of SCR and GCR produced neon. The measured 21Ne/22Ne ratio was much lower than ~0.8, which is about the smallest value possible by GCR irradiation. Figure 2 shows the evaluation of the studied sample. Only meteorites with 1 cm and 3 cm pre-atmospheric radius provide solutions that agree with the measured data and are in agreement with a mean orbital distance between Earth and the asteroid belt. Considering that the sample that reached Earth had a radius of about 1 cm, we can calculate ablation losses by assuming that the meteoroide did not break-up while passing through the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere, a feasible assumption for small meteoroids.  Assuming that the meteoroid was ~1 cm in radius, the ablation loss in the atmosphere must have been small in order to leave a 1 cm sized object behind. In this case the CRE age was in the range 3.5 Ma and the mean orbital distance was in range 2.5-3.1 AU.  Figure 2: The JaH 466 H6 ordinary chondrite measured by Roth et al. [3] and evaluated using our new model. Error bars are 1œÉ uncertainties from the measurements.  If the meteoroid was 3 cm in radius, the ablation loss must have been higher in order to leave only a 1 cm fragment behind. Therefore, more of the outside layers need to be removed by ablation and the total SCR flux must have been higher in order to have enough production at the central 1 cm. The CRE age assuming a 3 cm meteoroid is between 2 and 2.5 Ma and the average orbital distance is around 1 AU. Such an orbital distance would imply that the sample is from a Near Earth Object, which we consider unlikely because we have to assume an unrealistically high ablation loss of about 98%.  Conclusions and Outlook: We presented new production rates for SCR produced cosmogenic nuclides in ordinary chondrites of type H, L, and LL. Our model is fully consistent with previous models for GCR produced cosmogenic nuclides [1,2]. Using our model, we developed a method to determine the CRE age and the time averaged orbital distance of a given meteorite, assuming its cosmogenic record shows contributions from SCRs and GCRs. Using the noble gas data measured for JaH 466 [3], we applied our model and demonstrated that this meteorite most likely had a small pre-atmospheric radius in the range of ~1 cm and a CRE age of about 3.5 Ma. The mean orbital distance, which is related to size and CRE age, was between 2.5 and 3.1 AU. The model presented here is fully flexible to also study other chemical compositions, i.e., Shergottites or returned lunar rocks.   References: [1] Leya I. and Masarik J. (2009) Meteoritics & Planet.
