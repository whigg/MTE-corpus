Introduction: Previous magnetic studies of laser irradiated olivine grains revealed single domain (SD) and superparamagnetic (SPM) grains of iron varying in size [1]. Most of these minute grains are nanophase iron (npFe0). The importance of characterizing npFe0 is to better our interpretations in remote sensing of planetary surface minerals [2]. The presence of npFe0 has a strong effect on the spectral reflectance of silicate minerals in the visible (VIS) to near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths, cumulatively summed as "space weathering": (1) npFe0 darkens the overall reflectance [3], (2) steepens (or reddens) the spectral slope [4], and (3) decreases the contrast in the 1 μm band [5].  As a result of space weathering, the variations in sizes and populations of micrometeorite-derived npFe0 are thought to differ as a function of impact energy and flux [6]. Therefore, the process and products of space weathering could be fundamentally different from Mercury to the asteroid Belt [7-9]. Here we report more of the magnetic observations of irradiated olivine powder which describe the sizes and populations of npFe0. The purpose of this study was designed to examine: (1) a link between npFe0 sizes/populations and different fluxes/energies of simulated micrometeorite impacts through resulting spectral changes, and (2) whether this link is observable through magnetic susceptibility (MS) . Methods: The samples for this project were natural olivine (Fo93). Olivine was chosen because it is a common forming monomineralic mineral in the Solar System (next to plagioclase and pyroxene [10]). The olivine was powdered and dry-sieved to 45-54 µm to simulate the mean-grain size of the lunar regolith [11]. The powder was equally separated into four aliquots, 5g each of unpacked olivine powder, unlike previous experiments which pressed the powder [12,13].  The experimental setup at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa is similar to that of [12]. Space weathering simulation was achieved using a Continuum Surelite SL-I20 Nd:YAG pulsed laser with a fundamental wavelength of 1064 nm and frequency of 20 Hz. Pulse duration is 5-7 ns, which is comparable to the timescale of micrometeorite impacts [14]. Each pulse could deliver from 1-220 mJ. The beam was rastered across the sample to ensure even weathering. All irradiation was done under a vacuum of 0.13 Pa with a Pfeiffer Hicube dry roughing and turbo pump.   Reflectance spectra of the sample were taken before and after irradiation and at ambient atmosphere and under vacuum (Fig 1c). We measured spectral reflectance from 0.35 to 2.5 µm with an Analytical Spectral Devices Inc. (ASD) FieldSpec FR spectrometer. The observational geometry had an incidence angle of 0°, and an emission angle of 40°. Reflectance is measured relative to a spectralon standard (99%). Magnetic scanning was done with an X-Y motorized stage controlled by MagScan software developed by Youngwood Science and Engineering USA. A hall probe in the Zdirection directly measured the magnetic component perpendicular to the surface. We took small amounts from each aliquot of sample and mounted them in epoxy into a level surface. The probe was placed ~1 mm above the sample. The output is a 2D image with data values of magnetization.  Finally, we investigated the temperature dependent magnetic susceptibilities of the samples with a MKF1-FA susceptibility meter built by AGIGO Brno CZE (Figure 1). The sample was cooled from -195°C and warmed to 0°C, at 1, 4, and 16 kHz operating frequencies and 200 A/m scanning. We extracted frequency dependent magnetic susceptibility data from the 4 and 16 kHz temperature dependent data.    Figure 1: MKF1-FA susceptibility meter in a typical rock section analyzing mode.  Discussion: The approximation of the laser flux requires knowledge of interplanetary dust flux and equating them to some amount of laser energy and flux. [12] compared the energy and frequency of their laser pulses with spacecraft data [15] on fluxes and median sizes of dust impactors in the inner Solar System [15,16]. This is detailed more in [17]. One of the analytical techniques of this work is that temperature dependent MS and frequency dependent MS can be used as a measure of the relative degree of SW and of spectral alteration. Since olivine contains paramagnetic iron, the conversion of even a small amount of this iron to ferromagnetic metallic iron should produce a significant difference of MS. This difference in MS is based on the interaction of the npFe0 particles with the measurement frequencies done by the ZH instruments SM-100/105 susceptibility meter and the MFK1 Kappabridge.  Most ferromagnetic objects have complex magnetic characteristics dependent on grain size. Between large and small grains, the number of domains in each grain reduces, until it is a single domain and uniformly magnetized to both strong and weak fields. These grains tend to reverse their magnetic moments over time without a magnetic field by a characteristic temperature dependent decay function [18]. As the grain size decreases even more in single domain, it becomes superparamagnetic (SPM) with remanence and coercivity going to zero along with high susceptibility to small external fields [19] and very short decay times.

[17]. Essentially for our 4 and 16 kHz sampling, grains smaller than 10.46 nm will be SPM. These grains that were originally SPM in the range of 10.46 nm and 10.84 nm are magnetically perceived as single domain. The influence of these grains to the total susceptibility is now reduced due to increasing frequency of the coil, and the measured susceptibility is less. In regards to temperature, the effect of temperature is directly proportional to the transition volume. Results: All samples were observed under SEM and contained few npFe0 ranging from 0.01 µm to 3 µm. The magnetic images of fresh olivine, asteroidal, lunar, and mercurian irradiation energies in terrestrial ambient field reveals magnetic anomalies up to 2 µT. Temperature dependence frequency susceptibility at 1kHz reveals an increase in MS with each increased energy of irradiation. Extracting the frequency dependence MS at 4 and 16 kHz reveals with higher frequencies inside the measuring coils, magnetic forces generate delay of magnetic moments inside these samples and the susceptibility decreases; the higher the frequency, the lower the MS [20]. The fresh olivine sample has some nanophase magnetic source indicated by lower value of MS for 16 KHz than 4 KHz (Figure 2). Laser irradiation resulted in the formation of a small fraction of the nanophase iron as indicated by the decrease of MS for 16 kHz frequency. The lunar case resulted in 4 kHz MS decrease indicating that more iron within the sample was transformed into the magnetic phase. The 16 kHz MS decreased further to negative values. This is evidence that the resulting magnetic phase is npFe0 (< 10 nm). In the Mercury analog sample, a further increase in MS indicated more magnetic particles. There significant increase in the 16 kHz MS compared with lunar sample. The Mercury analog example reveals that the excess energy saturated our sample with nanophase iron. This started to lump the smaller grains into the large iron grain sizes (>10 nm), which we understand as an increased volume of grains of iron. The smaller offset between 4 kHz and 16 kHz MS curves in Figure 2d points to a decrease in the nanophase iron but the large grain size iron is increased as indicated in Figure 3. We interpret that Mercury SW must be so intense that nanoparticles of iron are transformed into the larger grain sizes. Asteroidal analog sample revealed similar MS as olivine precursor for 4 kHz, however 16 kHz shows significantly higher MS and this is evidence that laser irradiation has produced very little nanophase iron in this sample.  Figure 2: Temperature dependent behavior of frequency dependent MS for olivine, lunar, asteroid, and Mercury analog samples at 4 and 16 kHz. Error in each data point is 1x10-6 units of measurement.   Figure 3: MS with temperature of the laser irradiated samples of Olivine at 1 kHz to show the increased differences in MS. Error in each data point is 1x10-6 units of measurement.  Conclusions: SW simulation of micrometeorite impacts via laser irradiation allows the neoformation of npFe0. Irradiated samples visibly darkened and formed npFe0 which exhibit the optical effects of SW: lowered albedo, reddened continuum, and reduced spectral features.  From the MS of both frequency dependence and thermal cycling, there is a correlation between them to qualitatively confirm the presence of laser-produced npFe0. For the most energy deposited to simulate Mercury, the largest volume of new iron was created but the laser irradiation saturated the sample with production of npFe0, thus limiting the 10 nm sizes characteristic for space weathering textures. The presence of larger than 10 nm particles is consistent with darkening of the spectra. This confirms the spectral observations that Mercury's surface is darker but not as red.  The lunar case, revealed slightly less volume of newly formed iron but the greatest amount of npFe0 as indicated by frequency dependent MS. Spectral observations for this case are supported by lunar studies.  Finally, for the asteroid case, there was the least volume of npFe0 of <10 nm size fraction, compared to the other 2 cases.  Our data like thermal processing of olivine from Kohout et al. (2014), suggests that with laser irradiation there is a linear increase of nanoparticles with SW time, and a logarithmic increase in spectral change also with SW time. The spectral observations agree well with the results of similar experiments reported in the literature for lunar SW [1,6,12,21,22], and for the other regimes we did find consistent levels of change in terms of spectral properties greater or less than the lunar case.
