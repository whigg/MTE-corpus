This area lies in a high-latitude region on the lunar and includes the north of Mare Imbrium, the whole Sinus Iridum and the northeast Oceanus Procellarum at 60°W-0° Long. and 30°N-65°N Lat. Main topographical units include famous mountains like the Jura, the Alps and the Tenerife and famous impact craters like the Plato. Referring the detection results of the lunar surface with Clementine and gamma-ray spectrometry [1, 2], the main mineral composition on the lunar surface was inversed using Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) statistics and maturity view according to the spectral characteristics of Chang'e-1 IIM data and the absorption features of mineral elements on the lunar surface. The subdivision of the tectonic units on the lunar surface was also conducted under the analysis of multisource exploration data and existing lunar geological maps in various scales.  Data: Various data wre used in this study, but we choosed the Chang'e-1 data as the primary data. The data includes the laser altimeter (LAM) data, CCD image data, and hy-perspectral (IIM) data of Chang'e1 [3], the ultraviolet visible light (UVVIS) data of Clementine [4], the LOLA, LROC from Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO)  were used to make up the defects [5, 6].  Method: Establishing the statistical relation between the spectral characteristics and the sample contents of mineral elements is an important means to explore the distribution of mineral elements on the lunar surface. We employed Minimum Noise Fraction method (MNF) to separate band 32 data of Chang'e-1 IIM and obtained 32 wave bands. Distribution of noise and real energy reveals that the spectral energy is mostly concentrated in the first five components. The five MNF components were selected as the equation factors to establish a statistical relation between MNF variable and sample contents. P=a·MNF1+b·MNF2+c·MNF3+d·MNF4+e·MNF5+g                                                                                (1) Where MNFi is the separated components, and a, b, c, d and e are the correlation coefficients. The correlation between the spectral characteristics of Chang'e-1 interference imaging spectrometry (IIM) reflectance images and the mineral contents of LSCC (Lunar Soil Characterization Consortium) lunar surface mineral samples was discussed and the spatial distributions of FeO and Al2O3 contained in both pyroxene and plagioclase on LQ-4 were studied using the improved angle parameter method, MNF, and band ratio statistics.  Results: The gochemical composition distributeons in LQ-4 were carried carried out. On basis of their ditributions, we subdivided the tectonic units of this region. Geochemical composition distribution. Based on this study, we got the distribution of FeO(Figure 1), Al2O3(Figure 2), Plagioclase(Figure 3), Pyroxene(Figure 4). The terrain area is composed mainly of plagioclase (feldspar), norite (feldspar and pyroxene), troctolite (olivine and feldspar) as well as high-magnesium lunar rocks, generally containing similar chemical components of troctolite, norite and pure peridotite, as well as high magnesium content lunar rocks and breccia (generate after collision). The mare area is composed mainly of basalt, ilmenite and KREEP rocks [7]. Mare basalt differs from terrain plagioclase in that the former is rich in Fe and Ti while the latter is rich in Al and Ca. Magnesium-rich lunar rocks mainly contain troctolite, norite, peridotite, olivine and hypersthene. Plagioclase accounts for about 60% of the lunar surface while magnesium-rich lunar rocks account for about 19% of plagioclase. KREEP rocks are distributed in the mare basalt region, typically in Oceanus Procellarum and Mare Imbrium [8]. A comparison of the mapping results of the optical models by Lucey, Shkuractov and other researchers on Clementine and the gamma ray spectrometry data shows that the content error is within 0.6% for lunar mare areas and close to 1% for the highland areas [9, 10]. Subdivision of tectonic units. According to the topography, rock mineral composition and the distribution of different tectonic elements, the terrain and mare are divided as first-level tectonic units to represent the nonuniformity of tectonic evolution 2102.pdf

across the moon (Table 1). Large basins are divided as second-level tectonic units to highlight their important influence and constraint on regional tectonic evolution. Lower-level tectonic units of the basin tectonic units are further divided to reflect the constraint of the basin tectonics in future.  Figure 1 FeO distribution on Lunar LQ-4.

Figure 2 Al2O3 distribution on Lunar LQ-4   Figure 3 Plagioclase distribution on Lunar LQ-4   Figure 4 Pyroxene distribution on Lunar LQ-4  Conclusions: By using the China's Chang'e-1 IIM spectral data, associated with data from other detectors, the geochemical composition distributions in LQ-4 were gotten. With the geochemical information, take into consideration of the topography, the tectonic units system of LQ-4 region was proposed, which consists of three levels. The results of this study will help us to understand the evolution of this region, and the tectonic system may supply a clue to the global tectonic units.
