The low shields are located on a broad topographic rise, which was interpreted by [2,3] as a shield volcano. Many low shields have broad bases with low slope angles of ~2-3° and steeper upper portions with slopes of ~6-7° [4,5]. The dichotomy in slopes was interpreted to reflect changes in composition over time, i.e., increasing silica contents, resulting from magma differentiation [4,5]. However, because no spectral differences between the two dome morphologies and the surrounding mare basalts have been detected, the observed morphological differences are more plausibly explained by changes in effusion rates, temperature (viscosity), and/or crystallization over time [e.g., 6-12]. Such an interpretation is consistent with Diviner measurements, which did not detect differences in the position of the Christiansen Feature, which is sensitive to the silica polymerization, between the low shields and the adjacent mare basalts [11,13-15]. There also exist about 50 volcanic cones, which are either superposed on the low shields or occur isolated within embaying mare basalt units [4,5,7-9,11]. These cones were interpreted as evidence for volatileenriched lava or pyroclastic eruptions [7]. McCauley [4,5] and Heather et al. [9] proposed that the cones are younger than the low shields and were formed by more silica-rich basaltic eruptions at the end of the activity in the Marius Hills region. Spectral differences between the low shields and the cones are consistent with differences in eruption style or magma composition [e.g., 8-10].  Radar observations obtained at 12.6 and 70 cm wavelengths reveal high circular polarization ratios, which indicate that the Marius Hills have a rough, blocky surface, covered only by a few meters of regolith [16]. In addition, Mini-RF roughness estimates, NAC boulder counts, and Diviner-derived rock abundances all indicate that the low shields are blockier than the surrounding mare basalts [11,17].  Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) data document the occurrence of a major free-air gravity anomaly (150-236 mGal) in the area of the Marius Hills [1]. Kiefer [1] concluded that high-density material must be present at depth, most likely as mare basalts intruded into the underlying porous crust. The intruded material could have formed magma chambers that were the source for the surface volcanism. Kiefer [1] proposed that crystallization within these magma chambers resulted in the formation of crystal-rich, high viscosity lavas that formed the low shields.  Previous studies indicate that the volcanic activity in the Marius Hills region took place in the Upper Imbrian (3.2-3.8 Ga) [18]. A somewhat wider span of formation ages of the Marius Hills, ranging from the Imbrian (~3.3 Ga) to the Eratosthenian (~2.5 Ga) was reported by several other authors [e.g., 4,5,7,9,11,19,20]. Heather et al. [9] proposed that the Marius Basalt, which is part of the Hermann Formation [7] is 3.3 ± 0.3 Ga old. The Flamsteed Basalt and the Schiaparelli Basalt are part of the Sharp Formation of [7]. Both occur in the Marius Hills region and show ages of 2.5 ± 0.5 Ga [9]. Weitz et al. [8] reported that all low shields are embayed by younger mare units, indicating that they were formed during an older stage of volcanic activity in this region. Crater sizefrequency distribution (CSFD) measurements of mare basalts surrounding the Marius Hills revealed absolute model ages of 1.2-3.7 Ga [21]. High resolution images from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Narrow Angle Cameras (NAC) provide new opportunities to date small-scale surface features with CSFD measurements. Thus, in this study, we investigate the detailed stratigraphy between the low shields and the immediately adjacent mare basalts.  Data and Method: We used 36 LRO NAC images to perform CSFD measurements, supplemented by a LRO Wide Angle Camera (WAC) mosaic, Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) topography, and Clementine color ratios. The NAC images have fairly equal pixel scales of 0.83-1.31 m and incidence angles of 6276°. The images were calibrated and map-projected with ISIS 3 and imported into ArcGIS. Within ArcGIS, we used CraterTools [22] to perform our CSFD measurements. The crater size-frequency distributions were then plotted with CraterStats [23], using the production and the lunar chronology functions of [24]. Because the PF is only valid in the diameter interval of 10 m to 100 km [24], only craters larger than 10 m were fitted. However, we counted down to smaller crater diameters. The technique of CSFD measurements has been described extensively [e.g., 24-27]. For our crater counts, we mapped several homogeneous areas on the low shields and particularly paid attention to avoid obvious volcanic craters. We also avoided steep slopes  along the margins of the low shields, which are prone to more rapid crater erosion. Results: We performed CSFD measurements for 50 Marius Hills low shields. Of these low shields, 7 could not be dated because their surfaces were in equilibrium. Our count area sizes for the low shields ranged from 1.06 x 101 to 8.75 x 101 km2; those for the basalts varied between 6.17 x 100 to 8.01 x 101 km2. On the basis of our CSFD measurements for the 43 remaining low shields, we determined a wide range of AMAs of 1.03 to 3.65 Ga (Fig. 1). The data do not show a clear spatial correlation of ages versus locations of the dated low shields. We also performed CSFD measurements for basalts occurring immediately adjacent to the dated low shields. The 27 dated basalts show AMAs of 1.20-3.69 Ga, thus a similar range than for the low shields (Fig. 2). However, only three of the dated basalts are younger than 3 Ga, with the remaining 24 basalt units exhibiting AMAs of 3-3.5 Ga. Again, we did not observe a correlation of AMAs and the geographic position of the dated areas. Provided the AMAs were not affected by the relatively small size of the count areas and topographic slopes, these results imply that the volcanic activity in the Marius Hills region lasted > 1 Ga longer than previously thought [e.g., 4,5,7,9,11,19,20]. Discussion and Conclusions: On the basis of our CSFD measurements, we conclude that both low shields and adjacent mare basalts exhibit similar ranges of AMAs. However, most basalts were formed in the Upper Imbrian and at the beginning of the Eratosthenian between 3.0 and 3.5 Ga ago. Thus, although the range of ages appears similar, we find that in several cases the low shields are younger than their adjacent mare basalts. However, the stratigraphic relationships might be more complicated because [8,11] observed that the low shields are embayed by the basalts. Thus, further studies are required to unambiguously constrain the stratigraphic relationships and to characterize possible effects of small count areas and topography on the determination of AMAs with CSFD measurements.
