 IN SEARCH OF NUCLEOSYNTHETIC YTTERBIUM ISOTOPE ANOMALIES IN CHONDRITES.  T. Yokoyama 1, M. Nakahara 1, and R. Fukai 1 1 Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan (tetsuya.yoko@geo.titech.ac.jp).   Introduction:  Recent studies on high precision isotope analyses for bulk aliquots of meteorites discovered the existence of planetary scale nucleosynthetic isotope variabilities for a variety of elements including Ti, Cr, Sr, Zr, Mo, Ru, Ba, and Nd [1-6], although some elements (Te, Hf, W, and Os) do not show such anomalies at the current level of analytical precision [7-9]. The processes responsible for generating the isotopic heterogeneity/homogeneity in the early Solar System are not fully resolved yet, however, two plausible models have been proposed to account for the isotopic characteristics recorded in meteorites. The first model considers nebular thermal processing which caused selective destruction of thermally weakisotopically anomalous carriers, followed by subsequent physical separation of volatile phase and ultrarefractory components [1,10-11]. This model explains the lack of isotope anomalies in meteorites for ultrarefractory elements with T50% > ~1650 K, although it could be difficult to reconcile with the existence of Zr isotope anomalies [3]. On the other hand, the injection of isotopically anomalous materials from a nearby core-collapse supernova (ccSN) and subsequent aerodynamic sorting of grains in different sizes can be an alternative possibility to cause planetary scale isotope heterogeneity [12]. However, recent theoretical approaches argue against the production of heavy rnuclides (A > 110-130) by ccSNe [13], conflicting with the existence of isotope anomalies for Ba and Nd.  Ytterbium is an intriguing element which would provide a strong constraint on the origin of planetary scale isotope anomalies in the Solar System. It has seven stable isotopes with different contributions from the stellar nucleosyntheses of the s-, r-, and pprocesses (Table 1). The T50% for Yb (1487 K) is lower than those of the other heavy-REEs (1659 K) and is comparable to that of Sr [14]. Therefore, the thermal processing would lead to heterogeneous Yb isotope distribution in the Solar System, whereas the injection of a nearby ccSN would not generate r-nuclides of Yb. Previous studies investigated mass dependent Yb isotope fractionation for terrestrial and extraterrestrial materials [15], however, no studies reported nucleosynthetic Yb isotope anomalies in meteorites to date. In this study, we developed a technique for precisely analyze Yb isotope compositions in meteorite samples. We report preliminary results on Yb isotope compositions in ordinary and rumuruti chondrites. Experimental:  We analyzed Yb isotopes in one ordinary chondrite (Olivenza, LL5) and one rumuruti chondrite (NWA 753, R3.9). Powdered meteorite samples (~8 g) were decomposed by a mixture of HF, HNO3, and HClO4. The decomposed samples were dissolved in 1 M HCl and it was passed through a cation exchange resin to remove the majority of rockforming elements (e.g., Mg, Al, Ca, Fe). The fraction containing REEs was passed through 0.5 mL LN resin (Eichrom) to separate light-REEs (e.g., Nd, Sm) and heavy-REEs including Yb. The heavy-REE fraction was further passed through 1.0 mL LN resin to purify Yb by modifying the method of [16]. The main objective of this step is to reduce Er/Yb and Lu/Yb ratios at a level of 10 -8 and 10 -6 , respectively. The achievement of such an extremely low Er/Yb ratio is required to avoid the mass interferences from 168 Er (isotopic abundance: 26.78%) onto a minor isotope of 168 Yb (isotopic abundance: 0.13%). For this purpose, the final separation step using 1 mL LN resin was repeated twice.  Ytterbium isotope analysis was performed with thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) using TRITON-plus at Tokyo Tech. Approximately 5001000 ng of Yb dissolved in 1 μL 6M HCl was loaded onto a side filament of Re double filament assemblage together with 2 μL 0.01% H3PO4. The evaporation and ionization filaments were heated to ~1.8 A and ~4.7 A, respectively, which produced a 174 Yb + beam intensity of approximately 1-2×10 -11 A for 4 h. The Yb isotope ratios were acquired in a two-line configuration using 9 Faraday cups (Table 2), and corrected for mass fractionation by assuming 172 Yb/ 174 Yb = 0.68321 [17]. The results were obtained by averaging 360 ratios (2σ rejection level = 4.55% of the data) with the dynamic multicollection for 168,170,176 Yb/ 174 Yb and multistatic method for 171,173 Yb/ 174 Yb. The reproducibilities (2SD) of Yb isotope ratios were 1217, 33, 9, 7, and 13 ppm for 168 Yb/ 174 Yb, 170 Yb/ 174 Yb, 171 Yb/ 174 Yb, 173 Yb/ 174 Yb, and 176 Yb/ 174 Yb, respectively.  Table 1.

Figure 1 shows the μYb values for O- and R-chondrites measured in this study. Note that the μ 172 Yb and μ 174 Yb values are always equal to zero because these isotopes are used for the mass fractionation correction in TIMS measurements.  As shown in this figure, both chondrites possess large negative anomalies for μ 168 Yb and μ 170 Yb exceeding analytical uncertainties of the standard material, whereas the μ 171 Yb, μ 173 Yb, and μ 176 Yb values are indistinguishable from the terrestrial component. The patterns of μYb for the chondrites are not consistent with that representing the deficit of s-process nuclides relative to the terrestrial component (dashed line in Fig. 1). This could imply that the negative anomalies in μ 168 Yb and μ 170 Yb for the O- and R-chondrites represent the deficit of p-process nuclides relative to the terrestrial component. Although this scenario can be responsible for the negative anomalies of a pure pprocess nuclide 168 Yb, 170 Yb is thought to be a pure sprocess nuclide and the co-production of 170 Yb via the p-process nucleosynthesis has not been considered in theoretical studies. Furthermore, the isotope anomaly of a pure p-process nuclide 144 Sm was confirmed only in carbonaceous chondrites, not in ordinary chondrites [6, 18].  Alternatively, the negative anomalies of μ 168 Yb and μ 170 Yb in chondrites could be analytical artifact caused by insufficient correction of interferences from 168 Er and 170 Er. It is enigmatic that the problem of insufficient correction, if any, occurred exclusively for meteorite samples, because the 168 Er/ 168 Yb ratios observed during the analyses of the chondrites (4.6-5.2×10 -3 ) were within the range of those obtained for the standard measurements (2.9-6.0×10 -3 ). However, more careful treatment for the correction of Er isotope interferences must be conducted to completely resolve this issue. Apart from the p-process isotope anomalies, O- and R-chondrites display no anomalies for μ 171 Yb, μ 173 Yb, and μ 176 Yb in Fig. 1, the isotopes which were synthesized by the s- and r-processes. This is consistent with the lack of isotope anomalies in ordinary chondrites for Mo and Ru isotopes synthesized by the s- and rprocesses [4-5]. To further investigate nucleosynthetic Yb isotope anomalies in extraterrestrial materials, we will analyze carbonaceous chondrites by applying the technique of complete sample dissolution including presolar grains using a high pressure digestion vessel with HF-HNO3-H2SO4 as developed in [2].

Gray zone represents the reproducibilities (2SD) of repeated Yb isotope measurements for a terrestrial standard. Green dashed line is the pattern representing deficits in s-process nuclides relative to the terrestrial component. The s-process deficit pattern was calculated by using the s-process model of Arlandini et al. [19] and scaled to fit the μ 170 Yb of chondrites.  References: [1] Trinquier, A. et al.
