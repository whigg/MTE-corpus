A NON-CHONDRITIC IRON ISOTOPE COMPOSITION IN PLANETARY MANTLES AS A RESULT OF CORE FORMATION.  S. M. Elardo1 and A. Shahar1, 1Geophysical Laboratory, Carnegie Institution of Washington, 5251 Broad Branch Rd. NW, Washington, DC 20015, USA. selardo@carnegiescience.edu    Introduction:  The isotopic composition of Fe, the most abundant element in the bulk Earth and a major element in the cores, mantles, and crusts of the terrestrial planets and large asteroids, has the potential to record information about the conditions of planetary formation and differentiation. Analyses of meteorites and planetary basalts have revealed significant variations in Fe isotopic compositions. The δ57Fe of carbonaceous and ordinary chondrites are indistinguishable from 0‰ within analytical error [1]. Terrestrial midocean ridge basalts (MORBs) have an average δ57Fe of ~0.15‰ [e.g., 2] whereas abyssal peridotites, samples of the terrestrial mantle that produces MORBs, have compositions indistinguishable from the chondritic value [3]. Lunar basalts span a large range of mostly positive values that, in a general sense, correlate with TiO2 content. The Apollo 15 green glasses have a chondritic δ57Fe of -0.03 ± 0.05‰ [4], the low-Ti mare basalts have an average composition of 0.13 ± 0.05‰, and high-Ti basalts average 0.27 ± 0.03‰ [4, 5]. Martian basaltic shergottites and non-cumulate eucrites both have average δ57Fe compositions that are essentially chondritic, with values of 0.01 ± 0.03‰ and 0.02 ± 0.02‰, respectively [5].   Multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain the Fe isotopic differences among planetary samples. These hypotheses include Fe isotope fractionation during core formation [6], magma ocean crystallization [5], and mantle partial melting [3, 5, 7] under differing redox conditions. Additionally, these effects are not mutually exclusive and, in most cases, the relevant isotopic fractionation factors needed to model these processes are not currently known. In this study we present new high-temperature and pressure experimental data designed to quantify the fractionation of Fe isotopes between planetary cores and mantles during differentiation. These data can be used to constrain the Fe isotope compositions of planetary mantles and address the Fe isotopic differences among planetary basalts. Experimental and Analytical Methods:  Highpressure and high-temperature petrologic experiments were conducted in an end-loaded piston cylinder at the Geophysical Laboratory, Carnegie Institution of Washington. Starting materials consisted of a model peridotite composition similar to that used by Shahar et al. [8] mixed with pure Fe metal and varying amounts of Ni metal. Starting materials were spiked with 54Fe such that the three isotope exchange method [9] could be used to assess whether the experiments have obtained isotopic equilibrium. Capsules consisted of highpurity graphite, which were used to assess the effects of C entering the Fe-Ni alloy, and high-purity BN, which were used to provide a nominally C-free container that will not react to produce a third Fe-bearing phase nor significantly dilute the Fe-Ni alloy. In one experiment a synthetic Fe-Si alloy was used to reproduce conditions in which Si is present in planetary cores. All experiments were conducted at 1 GPa and 1850 °C. A time series was used to assess the experimental duration needed to achieve isotopic equilibrium. Run products were split for chemical and isotopic analyses. The compositions of Fe-Ni alloys and quenched silicate melts were analyzed using the silicon-drift detector energy dispersive spectrometry (SDD-EDS) detector on the JEOL field-emission SEM at the Geophysical Laboratory. Samples were coated with Ir and C contents of metal phases were determined using Alfa Aesar 99.999% pure Fe-metal as a C blank. The remaining half was crushed and pure metal and silicate fractions were picked under a microscope with the aid of a magnet. Fractions were sequentially dissolved in concentrated acids and Fe was purified from matrix elements using the short-column procedure outlined in [1]. Isotopic compositions were determined using the Nu Plasma II MC-ICP-MS at the Geophysical Laboratory. Analyses were conducted in highresolution mode and 53Cr was monitored to correct for the Cr isobaric interference 54Fe. Sample-standard bracketing was used to correct for instrumental drift. The bracketing standard was IRMM-524a, which has an identical composition to the IRMM-14 [1].  Results:  The results of experiments show that C, Ni, and S have differing effects on the fractionation of Fe isotopes during planetary core formation (Fig. 1). Shahar et al. [8] showed that at 1650 °C the S content of an Fe-Ni alloy positively correlated with Δ57FeMetalSilicate (i.e., the difference in Fe isotope composition between the molten alloy and molten peridotite). The results presented here show that C does not have a similar effect. At C saturation (~5 wt. % C in Fe metal), there is no resolvable Δ57FeMetal-Silicate in three experiments at 1850 °C within analytical error. These experiments did not contain Ni in the Fe alloy.  In our experiments at 1850 °C that contained an FeNi alloy, a positive Δ57FeMetal-Silicate is observed that is independent of the concentration of Ni in the alloy (Fig. 1). Experiments with alloys ranging in Ni content from 3.98 wt. % to 24.8 wt. % show a Δ57FeMetal-Silicate 1193.pdf

of ~0.12‰. Additionally, an experiment from Poitrasson et al. [10] with a similar alloy composition and a S-free experiment from Shahar et al. [7] produce similar Δ57FeMetal-Silicate values. The average Δ57FeMetalSilicate of our Ni-bearing experiments and those similar experiments from [8] and [10] is 0.12 ± 0.07 ‰. There is one outlier in our data set with a significantly lower Δ57FeMetal-Silicate at 4.99 wt. % Ni that is not included in our average Δ57FeMetal-Silicate until repeat MC-ICP-MS measurements can be made to confirm the value.  Interpretations:  The first important conclusion to be drawn from our data set is that light elements alloying with planetary cores have differing effects on the Fe isotope system. Shahar et al. [8] showed that S has a dramatic effect on Fe isotope fractionation that correlates with S content. However, our experiments show that C does not have a similar effect. This complicates efforts to use Fe isotope fractionations in planetary mantles to infer the light elements present in cores, at least for smaller planets and asteroids for which the conditions of these experiments are relevant. The difference in behavior may be related to differences in how S and C partition into Fe alloys. Sulfur replaces Fe atoms in Fe-S alloys, whereas C partitions as an interstitial atom.  The most interesting result from these experiments is that Ni alloying with Fe results in a resolvable fractionation of Fe isotopes between metal and silicate melts. Unlike light elements such as S, O, C and Si, the abundances of which in planetary cores are still heavily debated, Ni is expected to be a major element in the cores of every terrestrial planet and asteroid that has undergone core formation. This Ni-controlled fractionation is independent of the presence of light elements in planetary cores, though S would likely enhance the effect [8]. In Fig. 2, we show the δ57Fe of the bulk silicate portions of Earth, the Moon, Mars, and Vesta calculated using the Δ57FeMetal-Silicate of 0.12‰ from our Ni-bearing experiments at 1850 °C and estimated coremantle volumes and Fe contents for those bodies. The δ57Fe of these mantles are calculated as a function of core-mantle equilibration temperature. Fig. 2 shows that at the lower temperatures expected for core formation in the Moon, Mars, and Vesta core-mantle equilibration results in a resolvable negative δ57Fe composition in those bulk mantles. At the higher temperatures expected for core-mantle equilibration in early Earth (>3000 °C), the effect will be significantly reduced or negated. This can explain why terrestrial abyssal peridotites have an essentially chondritic δ57Fe.  When the effects of mantle partial melting are considered [3, 7], the presence of Ni in planetary cores can explain the differences in δ57Fe in basalts from different planets. In our model, MORBs are the result of partial melting of a roughly chondritic mantle and therefore have a positive δ57Fe, as partial melting results in a basalt that is isotopically ‘heavier’ compared to its source [3, 5]. Our data indicate that the roughly chondritic δ57Fe of non-cumulate eucrites, the A15 green glasses, and basaltic shergottities was coincidentally achieved by partial melting of isotopically ‘light’ mantle source regions. The effects of magma ocean crystallization on the δ57Fe of mantle sources are still unclear, as the relevant isotopic fractionation factors are still unknown, but this process is likely the cause of the spread in δ57Fe in lunar basalts that roughly correlates with TiO2 content. This will likely be an informative area of future study. References: [1] Craddock and Dauphas (2010) Geo. Stds. Geo. Analy. Res.  35, 101-123. [2] Teng et al. (2013) GCA 107, 12-26.
