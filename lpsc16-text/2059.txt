DART is targeted to impactDidymos secondary component (Didymoon) and serveas a kinetic impactor to demonstrate deflection of potentially hazardous asteroids. AIM will serve as anobservational spacecraft to evaluate the effects of theimpact and resulting changes in the Didymos dynamicparameters.ASPECT mission:  The AIM mission will alsocarry two CubeSat miniaturized satellites, released inDidymoon proximity. This arrangement opens up apossibility for secondary scientific experiments.ASPECT is one of the proposed CubeSat payloads.ASPECT objectives:  Whereas Didymos is aspace-weathered binary asteroid, the DART impactoris expected to produce a crater and excavate fresh material from the secondary component (Didymoon).Spectral comparison of the mature surface to thefreshly exposed material will allow to directly determine space weathering effects. It will be also possibleto study spectral shock effects within the impactcrater.ASPECT will also demonstrate for the first timethe joint spacecraft – CubeSat operations in asteroidproximity and miniature spectral imager operation indeep-space environment.Science objectives:· Study of the surface composition of the Didymos system.· Photometric observations (and modeling) undervarying phase angle and distance.· Study of space weathering effects on asteroids(comparison of mature / freshly exposed material).· Study of shock effects (spectral properties ofcrater interior).· Observations during the DART impact.Engineering objectives:· Demonstration of CubeSat semi-autonomousoperations in deep space environment.· Navigation in the vicinity of a binary asteroid.· Demonstration of a satellite survival duringimpact.· Demonstration of joint spacecraft – CubeSatoperations.ASPECT configuration:  ASPECT  is  a  3U  CubeSat (size of 3 units, Fig. 1) equipped with a spectralimager from 500 nm to 1600 nm (spatial resolution< 2 m, spectral resolution 10 – 30 nm; VIS channel512 x 512 pixels, NIR channel 256 x 256 pixels), anda non-imaging spectrometer from 1600 – 2500 nm.The design is based on the Aalto-1 CubeSat SpectralImager heritage. ASPECT will also demonstrate thecapabilities of a CubeSat and a miniature spectral imager for the first time in deep-space environment.Acknowledgements:  This work is done underSysNova: R&D Studies Competition for Innovationcontract with ESA.Fig. 1.
