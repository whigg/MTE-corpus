EVIDENCE FOR A SINGLE STELLAR ENVIRONMENT OF R-PROCESS NUCLEOSYNTHESIS FROM LIVE 247Cm IN THE EARLY SOLAR SYSTEM.  F. L. H Tissot1,2, N. Dauphas1, L. Grossman3, 1Origins Lab, Department of the Geophysical Sciences and Enrico Fermi Institute, The University of Chicago, IL (ftissot@uchicago.edu), 2Department of the Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences, MIT, Cambridge, MA, 3Department of the Geophysical Sciences and Enrico Fermi Institute, The University of Chicago, IL.  Motivation: The Early Solar System (ESS) abundance of short-lived radionuclides (SLR) can be interpreted in terms of a free-decay interval (Δ) or a mixing timescale (τ), which correspond to complete or partial isolation from fresh nucleosynthetic inputs of the molecular could core parental to the solar system. For rnuclides, however, the abundances measured in ESS materials require less isolation for 107Pd and 182Hf (Δ ~ 35 Myr) than for 129I (Δ=100±7 Myr) and 244Pu (Δ= 158±85 Myr) [1]. To make sense of these observations, models have proposed the existence of up to three different r-processes producing, respectively, the light rnuclides, the heavy r-nuclides and the actinides [1-4]. In this work [5], we determined the ESS abundance of another short-lived r-nuclide, the long sought after 247Cm [e.g., 6-7], and show how this additional constraint is consistent with either three different rprocesses, or, and more likely, a single stellar environment of r-process nucleosynthesis and a partial sprocess origin for 107Pd and 182Hf. Background: Elements with mass above ~70 amu are the products of three main processes of stellar nucleosynthesis: the s- (slow neutron capture), r- (rapid neutron capture) and p- (proton) process [8-9]. If the s- and p-processes are relatively well understood (neutron capture in AGB-stars and photodisintegration of seed nuclei in supernovae, respectively [10-11]), little is known regarding the astrophysical conditions under which r-process nuclides are produced [1-4]. In particular, the number of different r-processes is a topic of intense debate. Evidence for the existence of multiple r-processes comes from both spectroscopic observations of Low Metallicity Halo Stars (LMHS) and the relative abundance of SLR in meteorites. LMHS are stars with low metal content that formed early in the history of the Galaxy, before the onset of the s-process in AGB stars. Evidence for multiple rprocesses in LMHS include: (i) the favored production of lighter r-nuclides (such as Sr) over heavier rnuclides (such as Ba) ([12] and refs. therein); (ii) the obvious decoupling between r-nuclides of lower and higher atomic masses in the composition of star CS 22892-052 [13-14]; (iii) the overabundance of Th and U relative to lighter r-nuclides (e.g., Eu) in CS 31082001 [15-16]; or even (iv) the gradual decrease in the abundance pattern of r-nuclides as a function of atomic number, from Sr to Yb, in star HD 122563 [17-20].  The second line of evidence pointing to a multiplicity of r-processes comes from the relative abundance of SLR in meteorites. In particular, the abundance of 182Hf (t1/2=8.90 Myr) in the ESS is too high relative to that of another short-lived r-nuclide, 129I (t1/2=15.7 Myr). This led Wasserburg et al. (1996) [2] to propose that different r-processes were producing the light rnuclides (A≤135-140, up to ∼Ba) and the heavy rnuclides (A≥135-140), respectively. The existence of an actinide-specific (e.g., U, Th, Pu) site was also hypothesized based on the low meteoritic abundance of 244Pu (t1/2=79.3 Myr) compared to 182Hf [1]. The existence of an actinide-specific site is, however, not necessarily warranted because 244Pu has a long half-life and its stellar yield is uncertain [21], which makes it poorly sensitive to the history of nucleosynthesis prior to SS formation and whether or not multiple r-process sites contributed to the synthesis of this nuclide. In contrast, Curium-247, which ultimately decays into 235U, has a much shorter half-life (t1/2=15.6 Myr) and is very well suited to address this question, provided its abundance in the ESS can be accurately and precisely determined. 247Cm ESS abundance: Evidence for 247Cm decay can only be found as 235U excesses in ESS materials. Yet, the ESS abundance of 247Cm expected from models of Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) is low, and a 235U excess from curium decay will therefore only be resolvable in phases which formed early in the SS and preferentially incorporated Cm over U. Recently, 235U excesses of up to +3.5 ‰ (rel. to CRM-112a) were found in four fine-grained CAIs [7]. Those excesses correlate with Nd/U ratio (Nd is used a proxy for Cm, which has no stable isotope) and the authors interpreted their results as evidence for live 247Cm in the ESS. A complicating factor is that 235U excesses of such magnitude could have also been produced by isotopic fractionation during evaporation/condensation processes in the early solar nebula. Indeed, the kinetic theory of gases predicts that the lighter isotope will condense (evaporate) faster during condensation (evaporation), leading to isotopic fractionation that scale as the square root of the mass of the reacting species: in the case of monatomic U in a low pressure gas, α ~ √238/235-1 ~6.3 ‰. The excesses found by [7] are smaller than 6 ‰ and the question thus remained as to what were the causes of the observed U isotope variations.  1605.pdf

In the present work [5], we conducted a survey of the U isotope composition in 12 fine-grained CAIs characterized by group II Rare Earth Element (REE) patterns, in which the light REE are enriched relative to the heavy REE and U. As Cm is expected to behave like a light REE during evaporation/ condensation processes, group II CAIs, which display high Nd/U ratios (a proxy for the Cm/U ratio), are the best phases to investigate when looking for 235U excesses due to 247Cm decay. As in previous studies, most samples display 144Nd/238U ratios below 600 and δ235U values within 6 ‰ of the bulk SS value. The samples display a trend between δ235U and 144Nd/238U similar to that observed by [7], but there is significant scatter around the best-fit line. One sample (named Curious Marie) has an extremely high 144Nd/238U ratio (~13,720) and a 235U excess of ~+ 59 ‰. Considerable effort was expended to confirm this result that was eventually triplicated using different analytical protocols, demonstrating that the 235U excess in Curious Marie is real. Using the slope of the isochron (δ235U vs. 144Nd/238U diagram), the (247Cm/235U)Initial ratio can be calculated. Because the slope of the isochron is mainy leveraged by Curious Marie, the initial 247Cm/235U ratio obtained will correspond to the time when Curious Marie acquired its Nd/U ratio. The extreme U depletion observed in Curious Marie is likely due to solar nebula condensation and/or nebular/parent body alteration. The two can be disentangled by looking at the relative depletion of two refractory lithophile elements with similar volatilities (i.e., expected to condense together during nebular processes). In most samples, U and Yb present similar levels of depletion relative to solar composition and the abundance of other refractory lithophile elements (e.g., Nd or Sm), indicating that U and Yb have similar behaviors during evaporation/condensation processes under solar nebula conditions. In Curious Marie, however, the U/Nd ratio is 1000× lower than solar, while the Yb/Nd ratio is only depleted by a factor of 50. The twentyfold greater depletion in U relative to Yb in Curious Marie is likely due to alteration, either in the early nebula or on the parent body of Allende. Dating of aqueous alteration products on meteorite parent-bodies with extinct radionuclides 36Cl, 26Al, 53Mn or 129I suggests it took place no later than 10 Myr after SS formation [22-23]. Accounting for an alteration age of 5±5Myr, the (247Cm/235U)Initial ratio obtained from the two-point isochron between Curious Marie and average SS materials can be corrected to obtain a (247Cm/235U)ESS ratio of (1.1 ± 0.3)×10-4. This value is in agreement with the value of (1.1-2.4)×10-4 obtained by [7] based on CAI measurements and an upper limit of ~4 × 10-3 inferred from earlier meteoritic measurements [6]. It is also in line with the lower limit derived from GCE modeling: (5.0 ± 2.5)×10-5 [21]. Implication for the r-process: Using the (247Cm/235U)ESS ratio determined above and the open non-linear GCE model of [24], a free-decay interval of Δ = 87 ± 14 Myr is obtained. This value is in good agreement with the Δ value of ~ 100 Myr derived from 129I and 244Pu but is much longer then the value of ~ 35 Myr obtained from 107Pd and 182Hf. Recent nucleosynthetic models have, however, reconsidered the origin of 107Pd and 182Hf and find a significant s-process contribution (~80%) for both isotopes [3, 25]. In such a framework, the initial abundance of all r-process SLR in the ESS can be explained by a single r-process event, which last injected material into the protosolar molecular cloud ~100 Myr before SS formation. Our results indicate that the multiplicity of rprocesses inferred from LMHS abundance patterns may only be relevant to exotic conditions that prevailed in the earliest generation of stars of the Galaxy and that a single r-process may still be relevant to long-term GCE models.
