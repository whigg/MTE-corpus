Introduction: The chemical composition of the lunar core controls its physical properties (e.g., density, liquidus), its crystallization path, and affects the abundance of siderophile elements in the lunar mantle. For example, the nature and abundance of the light element(s) in the lunar core play a role in determining the duration and/or existence of a lunar core dynamo [1], the extent of siderophile element depletions of the lunar mantle following core formation [2,3], the extent of partitioning of heat producing elements into the lunar core, and therefore the deep interior thermal regime [4].   Weber et al. [5] reassessed Apollo era lunar seismograms and found evidence for a present-day partially molten outer core, from which they suggested that <6 wt% of a light element, likely S, must be present. Rai and van Westrenen [2] suggested that the depletions of Ni, Co, Mo, Cr, V, W and P are also consistent with the segregation of a S-rich lunar core (6 wt% S). Subsequent work modeled the evolution of the lunar core dynamo and found that up to 12 wt% S is required to sustain an early lunar core dynamo [1]. However, it is unclear how these estimates relate to the S abundance in the lunar mantle combined with the metalsilicate partitioning behavior of S.  Recently, we showed [3] that the lunar mantle depletions of 15 siderophile elements can also be reconciled with segregation of a S-free core. Similar to [2], this study also suggests the existence of a global, deep lunar magma ocean (LMO). In this study, we aim to provide new constraints on the lunar core compositon by considering the three most likely candidates to be present in significant amounts in the lunar core in addition to Fe: C, S and Ni. We reassess the lunar core composition by combining recently revised lunar mantle abundances of S and C with models that predict their metal-silicate partitioning.    Approach: We calculate Dmetal-silicate(S,C,Ni) by using the predictive models of [2,7,8]. Previous studies have proposed a fO2 during lunar core formation of -2 below the iron-wüstite buffer (IW) [2,3]. In this study, we consider three scenarios with different P-T conditions during lunar core formation (Table 1).  We then calculate the amount of C, S, and Ni in the lunar core by using a mass balance approach [9]:  CC (i) = CBM (i) / (xcore + (1-xcore) / D(i))                     (1)  where CC (i) is the concentration of element i in the lunar core, CBM (i) is the concentration by weight of element i in the bulk Moon (BM), xcore is the core mass fraction and D(i) is the metal-silicate partition coefficient (D) for element i. CBM (i) is calculated with Eq. (2) [2,3]:  CBM (i) = D(i) * CBSM (i) * (1- xm) + xm * CBSM (i)      (2)  where xm is the lunar mantle mass fraction and CBSM (i) the concentration by weight of element i in the bulk silicate Moon (BSM). We use the most recent BSM estimates of 74.5±4.5 ppm S from [10,11], 54±10 ppm C from [12] and 470±50 ppm Ni from [2]. Note that the estimates of core composition from this approach are independent of the assumed core mass. Previous studies [7,8] showed that D(S,C) are sensitive to Ni contents of the lunar core.We therefore also use the calculated Ni contents to model D(S,C). Given the rather weak depence of D(Ni) on S and C in metal [2,3], we assume XC,S = 0 in our calculations for Ni. Experimental data shows that D(C) is not affected by up to 5 wt% S in the metal [13], whereas D(S) is decreased with C [7]. However, we will later show that, given the low amounts of S in the lunar core, any effect of C would not significantly affect the results of this study.    Scenario P (GPa) T (K) XNi (Mol. Fr.)

between 71-116 ppm S for the BM, resulting in only ≤0.16 wt% of S in the lunar core, virtually independent of P-T conditions (Fig. 2a, Table 2).  Carbon: Assuming 54±10 ppm C in the BSM [12], we calculate a BM C content ranging between ~2001300 ppm. This results in a core concentration of ~0.34 wt% C, with the exact amount depending of the scenario considered (Fig. 2b, Table 2). We also note that the BSE C estimate of  ~765 ppm is within our calculated BM range.

To assess the amount of S and/or C in the present-day molten outer lunar core, we also have to consider the behavior of S and C upon core solidification. Fe-S and Fe-C phase diagrams [16,17] suggest that both S and C have higher solubilities in liquid metal. The solubility limit of S in solid Fe metal is <0.1 wt% accros the P-T range relevant for the Moon [14]. Given the calculated abundance of <0.16 wt% S in the  bulk core, it would be difficult to maintain a partially molten core over a long temperature/time interval.  The  calculated C content of the lunar core, combined with the estimated minimum T of ~1650 K at the inner core [5], would result in crystallization of Fe-rich metal [18]. This could have provided the compositional convection required for the onset of an early core dynamo. A C-rich lunar core would also explain the existence of a present-day molten state of the outer core [5]. Note that the densities of C and S bearing metallic liquids are also near identical up to 20 wt% S [19].   It is unlikely that the BSM abundance of S is underestimated, as the S isotope compositions of mare basalts suggest only <10% degassing occurred [20], consistent with minor devolatilization of other volatile siderophile elements in the lunar mantle [3]. Even if significant S (e.g., 230 ppm, corresponding to the upper value of the BSE) was lost from the BSM after core formation, the core would contain only <0.6 wt% S. A slight increase of the BSM C to 80 ppm would already result in a core C range of ~1.2-4.8 wt%. Conclusion: We show that S cannot be the dominant light element in the lunar core, at least from a geochemical point of view. Instead, recently proposed BSM estimates suggest the lunar core contains appreciable amounts of C. Future studies should therefore assess if the siderophile element lunar mantle depletions can be reconciled with a C-bearing core, if the C isotopic signature of the BSM is consistent with significant partitioning of C into the core, and if a C-bearing core is able to sustain an early lunar core dynamo.
