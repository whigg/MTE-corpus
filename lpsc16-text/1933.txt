Introduction: Chondrules, CAIs and other components in a wide range of carbonaceous meteorites are often surrounded by so-called "fine-grained rims" (FGRs). These FGRs can be usually distinguished from the surrounding "interchondrule matrix" (ICM) by a smaller grain size, a distinct chemical composition, and/or a higher abundances of phyllosilicates [e.g., 1]. The origins of these FGRs in a nebular or parent body setting were discussed controversially [e.g., 2]. Very recent studies [3, 4], however, concluded that an accretionary setting in the solar nebula is the most probable formation scenario based abundant presolar grains, as initially suggested [1]. FGRs in Renazzo-type (CR) carbonaceous chondrites have attracted considerable attention in recent years, because it has been shown that they contain highly primitive material with high abundances of amorphous silicates. Although these amorphous silicates have already been affected by subtle aqueous alteration in CRs [5], they still represent one of the most primitive components in meteorites [e.g., 6]. The chemical composition and texture of this amorphous silicate material can give important insights into early solar nebula and later parent body effects that are only observable on a nanometer scale. Experimental: In this study, we investigated FGRs in the Antarctic CR2 carbonaceous chondrites Graves Nunataks (GRA) 95229, Elephant Moraine (EET) 92161, and Miller Range (MIL) 07525 and the ICM of GRA 95229 and Acfer 094 by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) techniques. Electron-transparent lamellae were extracted in a Focused Ion Beam (FIB) - SEM (FEI Nova 600 NanoLab at the MPI für Polymerchemie, Mainz). TEM investigations were carried out mainly on a Zeiss Libra 200FE at the University of Münster using a Noran Si(Li) EDX detector system. A fraction of this work was performed on a FEI Talos F200X with ChemiSTEMTM technology at the University of Manchester. The FIB lamellae were documented in STEM - High Angle Annular Dark Field (HAADF) mode, and amorphous areas were located by brightfield imaging (BF) and diffraction mode. EDX analyses were performed in STEM mode using Spectrum Image maps. Results and Discussion: In BSE contrast, the FGRs in GRA 95229 and MIL 07525 are characterized by a smaller grain size compared to the ICM, which also contains a higher abundance of larger fragments, but no large chemical distinction (Fig. 1a). The BSE image of the FGR in EET 92161, on the other hand, shows a contrast difference, and EDX investigations confirm that this difference is due to a subtle enrichment of Fe in the FGR compared to the ICM (Fig. 1b).   Figure 1. a - SEM-BSE image of the FGR in GRA 95229 with the two FIB holes. The approximate boundary between FGR and ICM is marked by the dashed line. b - SEM-EDX-Fe Kα map of the FGR in EET 92161 with the approximate boundary marked as well.  In STEM-HAADF imaging, all FIB lamellae exhibit different petrographic textures on a µm to nm scale. In GRA 95229, the FGR material consists of a heterogeneous mixture of anhydrous silicates, sulfides, rare metal grains, and few phyllosilicates that are embedded in an amorphous silicate groundmass (Fig. 2). The fraction of this amorphous material constitutes approximately 30 vol.% of the whole FIB section. Sulfides are not distributed evenly but concentrate in certain domains that are either sulfide-rich or -poor, separated by sharp boundaries. This has been observed before in CM2 chondrites and could be explained by fluid activity or compaction of fragments with different degrees of sulfidization [7]. Some parts of the lamellae are porous and filled by organic, sometimes nanoglobular matter. Anhydrous Mg-rich silicates (mainly olivine) show signs of subtle alteration as thin rinds. The FGR lamella of MIL 07525, on the other hand, contains much less amorphous silicates (only ~12 vol.%). This amorphous material is also texturally more heterogeneous than in GRA 95229 and shows the onset of serpentinization as more abundant fine fibers. The sulfides in MIL 07525 are more evenly distributed than in the GRA 95229 lamella. Anhydrous silicates are rarer and show more signs of alteration. The FGR lamella of EET 92161, finally, exhibits a re-crystallized texture, with nearly no porosity left and very little abundance of any amorphous silicates (only ~5 vol. %). Sulfides and other  components show extensive signs of alteration and are difficult to separate from one another.   Figure 2. BF overview image of the FGR lamella from GRA 95229 with various heterogenously distributed components. An example of an amorphous region is marked by a dashed line.  STEM-EDX spectrum images over the previously determined amorphous regions of interest indicate a heterogeneous chemical composition. Whereas the GRA 95229 amorphous silicate material has a close-tosolar Fe/Si, we observe a subtle enrichment of Fe in the MIL 07525 sample and an even higher and more heterogeneous value in the EET 92161 samples (Fig. 3). This enrichment can be explained by the onset of aqueous activity on the CR parent body [5] and supports our textural observations. Interestingly, Fe-Mg-Si compositions of matrix and FGR in the GRA samples are indistinguishable from one another within errors. This underlines the assumption that they both formed from the same nebular reservoir and cannot represent a product of chondrule alteration [4]. All samples show a depletion of Mg compared to CI [8], which is most probably not the result of aqueous activity or an analytical artifact, but the fingerprint of disequilibrium condensation conditions that removed Mg from the gas phase [6, 9]. Compositions of Acfer 094 amorphous silicates that have been measured in comparison to the FGRs using the same settings agree well with this assumption, as they are also mostly Mg-depleted, but with a lower Fe/Si ratio compared to the CR samples as observed previously [6]. All samples exhibit a depletion of S compared to CI and sub-solar Ca/Si, consistent with previous observations and probably also due to aqueous activity.  Figure 3.

Conclusions: We have investigated the amorphous silicate material in the fine-grained rims of three Antarctic CR2 chondrites by FIB-TEM. For comparison, we also analyzed such material in the matrix of GRA 95229 and Acfer 094. The abundance of amorphous silicates decreases from GRA95229 => MIL07525 => EET92161, which is consistent with their alteration degree based on other petrographic indices such as Fe/Si ratios. Amorphous silicates of Acfer 094 have the lowest Fe/Si ratios followed by matrix and FGR of GRA95229, which have about the same chemical composition in Mg-Si-Fe space, which underlines their common nebular heritage. Almost all samples are depleted in Mg with respect to CI, which most likely represents a fingerprint of previous non-equilibrium condensation conditions [6, 9]. The abundance and chemical composition of this amorphous silicate material is therefore a sensitive indicator to track subtle nebular condensation and parent body alteration conditions in CR chondrites on very fine scales.
