Introduction: Geochemical models that constrain conditions of core formation in planetary bodies rely on the experimentally determined metal-silicate partitioning behavior of siderophile elements [1,2]. Although it is known that metal-silicate partition coefficients (D) of siderophile elements can depend on silicate melt composition, this dependence is not well constrained for many elements. Here, we study the metal-silicate partitioning of P, V, Co, Mo, Ge, and W as a function of silicate melt composition, with results for a wide range of other elements discussed sepearately [3]. We apply our results to study core formation in the angrite parent body (APB).  The angrites show siderophile element depletions [4,5] and evidence of a past magnetic field [6], suggesting the presence of a metallic core in the APB. Angrites are among the oldest basaltic meteorites and therefore provide insights into the earliest stages of planet formation and differentiation. However, the physical properties of the APB (e.g., size, core mass) and redox state (fO2) during core formation are poorly constrained. For example, previous work suggests the APB has a 8-60% mass Fe-Ni-C core which formed at fO2 ranging anywhere between -1 and +1 log units relative to the iron-wüstite buffer (IW) [4,5].  Approach: We equilibrated silicate-metal mixtures within MgO capsules at 1.5 GPa and 1683-1883 K. The effect of melt composition on D is studied by using the epsilon model [7], assuming valences of 2+ for Co, Ge, 3+ for V, 5+ for P and 6+ for Mo, W [8]. We use the apparent equilibrium constant (KApp) which is corrected for solute interaction in the metal.   Experimental results: Preliminary results suggest no effects of silicate melt composition on D(Co,Ge,V).   Fig. 1: Log KApp W, Mo, P vs cCaO of silicate melt  For data from this study only, we observe that KApp Mo, P and W are significantly affected by cCaO (Fig. 1). This is likely due to the formation of CaMOn complexes, which reduces siderophile behavior of Mo, P and W with CaO of the silicate melt [8]. We also observe a decrease of KApp P with S in the silicate melt, similar to that observed for Pb and Cd [3].  Modeling Core Formation in the APB: To study core formation in the APB, D's obtained at <5 GPa [3, 8-13 and this study] are parameterized to Eq. 1:   log D = a + b(∆IW) + c(nbo/t) or ∑ciXi + d(1/T) + e(P/T) + fln(1-XS) + gln(1-XC) + hln(1-XNi) + i(S)   (1)    where fO2 is represented by ∆IW, which defines the deviation in log units from the IW buffer, composition of the silicate melt is represented by molar major oxide fraction terms (cMgO, cSiO2, cAl2O3, cCaO, cFeO) or nbo/t, XS, XC, XNi are the molar fractions of S, C and Ni in the metallic liquid and i(S) is the concentration of S (ppm) in the silicate melt. Using the parameterizations obtained for Ni, Co with nbo/t, and Mo, W, Ga with mole oxide fractions, we model core formation in the APB using a Monte Carlo approach [1,2].  To calculate the required D's to explain the siderophile element depletions in the APB mantle (Dc/m), we consider a CV bulk composition [4,5,14,15] and use the APB mantle estimates for Ni, Co, Ga, Mo, W from [5]. Calculating Dc/m requires constraints on the APB core mass, which is a function of fO2 and core composition and was calculated using the approach outlined in [1,16] (Fig. 2,3).   Fig. 2: Core mass versus fO2   Constraints on fO2 in the APB interior are provided by pyroxenes in D'Orbigny, which record ∆IW0.7±0.6  [17]. Fig. 2 shows that at >∆IW-1, no core is formed if the core is pure Fe. This is increased to ∆IW0.6 for a 70% Fe core. The fO2 is therefore constrained to ∆IW-0.95±0.35. We further assume a CV chondrite APB mantle composition, T ranging between the solliq as a function of P determined for Allende composition [18], P = 0.1 GPa relevant for smaller-sized planetary bodies (e.g., Vesta) and  nbo/t = 2.7-3.     Fig. 3: Dc/m for a 80Fe-10Ni-10S core at different fO2   Modeling results: Preliminary findings suggest that the siderophile elements depletions can be satisfied within a fO2 range of ∆IW-1.50±0.45, depending on the composition of the core. This fO2 range corresponds to a core mass fraction range of 0.12-0.29 and lies partly within the fO2 range derived by [17]. There are no solutions for all elements for a pure Fe core (Fig. 4a), but a Fe-rich core with 20% Ni provides a fO2 range at which all siderophile element depletions are satisfied (Fig. 4b). The upper bound of the fO2 solution space is provided by the lack of solutions for W and/or Ga, whereas the lower bound is constrained by absence of solutions for Co and Ni. We also observe that an increase of core S content at constant Ni content effectively lowers the fO2 at which all siderophile element depletions are satisfied, similar to that observed for Mars [19] and Vesta [1] (Fig. 5).  Using the fO2 estimate from pyroxene cores in D'Orbigny [17], we can further constrain the core mass and core composition of the APB. For example, a APB core with 10% Ni leads to more reduced fO2 and is not consistent with independent fO2 estimates from D'Orbigny. To satisfy the D'Orbigny fO2 range, the core must therefore be Ni-rich (>10 wt%). A S-rich APB core is not likely, given that this results in more reduced conditions as well. Using the fO2 of [17], the core mass is constrained to 17±5 %.   Discussion: As the size of the APB is virtually unconstrained, future models should explore the effect of T and  P on these models. We also note that the APB mantle depletion of Ga, a volatile element, can be explained by core formation only, similar to what is observed in the Moon [2] and Vesta [1].
