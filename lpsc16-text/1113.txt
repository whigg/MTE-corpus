CHROMIUM PARTITIONING BETWEEN OLIVINE/MELT IN EXPERIMENTAL PARTIAL MELTS OF THE ALLENDE AND MURCHISON CHONDRITES.  James M. Karner. 1Dept. of Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106 (jmk207@case.edu).   Introduction:  We are interested in the partitioning of multivalent elements in basaltic systems as a way of estimating the oxygen fugacity (fO2) conditions under which basalts formed on planetary bodies (Earth, Moon, Mars, asteroids).  Cr is a minor element in basaltic melts, partitions into several minerals that crystallize from basaltic melts, exists in multiple valence states at differing fO2 conditions, and is therefore a powerful oxybarometer for basaltic melts.  Chromium is mostly 3+ in terrestrial basaltic melts at relatively high fO2 values (≥ IW+3.5), and mostly 2+ in melts at low fO2 values (≤ IW-1), such as those on the Moon and some asteroids [1].  At intermediate fO2s, (i.e., IW-1 to IW+3.5), basaltic melts contain both Cr3+ and Cr2+.  Understanding the partitioning of Cr3+ and Cr2+ into silicate phases with changing fO2 is thus crucial to the employment of Cr oxybarometers.   We take the opportunity here to examine the equilibrium partitioning of Cr between olivine/melt in experimental partial melts of natural meteorites at differing fO2 conditions [2].  The study will help add to the experimental data on DCr olivine/melt with changing fO2, and also help us better understand the equilibrium partitioning of both Cr2+ and Cr3+ in natural basaltic meteorite melts. Samples and analytical techniques:  The samples used in this study are experimental partial melts of the Allende (CV) and Murchison (CM) chondrites produced by [2].  The melts were produced at varying temperatures, fO2 values, and run times.  One of the significant findings from these experiments was that partial melts at low fO2 strongly resemble the composition of eucrites, while at high fO2 (IW+2) melts have compositions that resemble angrites [2]. The approach to equilibrium for these charges was well considered and documented (see details in [2]) and thus we are confident in using these samples to evaluate the equilibrium partitioning of Cr between olivine/melt.  The specific samples studied here are 1) Murchison at an fO2 of IW-1 and temperature of 1325° C (M_IW1_1325) 2) Allende at IW-1 and 1180° C (A_IW1_1180) 3) Allende at IW+1 and 1200° C (A_IW+1_1200) and 4) Allende at IW+2 and 1200° C (A_IW+2_1200).  Figure 1 shows back-scattered electron images of two of the samples- all four samples studied here contained olivine grains and adjacent melt appropriate for the evaluation of Cr partitioning between the two phases.  Major and minor element composition of olivine and melt were determined using a Cameca SX100 electron microprobe.  WDS was performed using a voltage of 15 kV, beam current of 20 nA, and beam size of 1 µm for olivine grains, while glass (melt) was analyzed at 15 kV, 10 nA and a 10 µm beam size.  Counting times were 30 s for major and minor elements and 45 s for Cr. Natural minerals including forsterite, chromite and volcanic glass were used as standards.  Exceptable olivine analyses were those that approached 100 wt.% oxide totals (± 1.5 wt.%), a sum close to 1 cation per the tetrahedral site (±0.02), and a total of 3 cations (±0.1) overall, based on 4 oxygens per the olivine formula. Glass (melt) analyses were acceptable if oxide totals ~100% (±1.5 wt.%).  Both olivine and glass analyses were compared with those of [2] and found to be analogous.  DCr values were determined by measuring several pairs of olivine rims and adjacent glass and then taking the average.  Figure 1.  Back-scattered electron images of two of the four samples. 1113.pdf

Results:  Figure 2 charts the average DCr olivine/melt values against fO2.  The M_IW-1_1325 sample shows an average DCr = 0.69 with a standard deviation of 0.02.  The Allende samples range from DCr = 1.01, s.d. = 0.07 at IW-1, to DCr = 1.2, s.d = 0.2 at IW+1, and DCr = 1.1, s.d = 0.4 at IW+2.   Discussion:  In 1998, [1] performed a series of experiments in various Fe-free and Fe-bearing compositions over a wide range in fO2 in order to better understand Cr2+ and Cr3+ partitioning between olivine/melt.  Their results show that at high fO2, (≥ IW+3.5) Cr3+ dominates in basaltic melts, while at low fO2 (≤ IW-1), Cr2+ dominates the melt.  Hanson and Jones [2] then parameterized equations to model DCr3+ and DCr2+ between olivine/melt.  DCr3+ covaries with the ratio of non-bridging oxygens to tetrahedrally coordinated cations (NBO/T), and DCr2+ is sensitive to liquid composition and temperature [1].  Figure 3a,b) show our measured values for M_IW-1_1325 and A_IW-1_1180 against the values predicted in [2], and show excellent agreement.  Thus, we conclude that at IW-1, Cr2+ dominates in the system and DCr2+ olivine/melt is indeed sensitive to melt composition and temperature as predicted by [1]. Samples A_IW+1_1200, and A_IW+2_1200 were equilibrated at fO2 values where a mixture of Cr2+ and Cr3+ exist in the melt.  Subsequently, our DCr values olivine/melt for these samples are equal to the sum of DCr2+ multiplied by the fraction of Cr2+ in the melt, and DCr3+ multiplied by the fraction of Cr3+ in the melt.  The Cr2+/Cr3+ ratio in the melt of our samples is unknown, and is very difficult to model in Fe-bearing systems [1].  As an approximation, [3] note at an fO2 of IW, the ratio of Cr2+/Cr3+ in basaltic melts is approximately unity.  Recently, [4] measured DCr olivine/melt at fO2s from IW-1 to IW+3.4 and report Ds from 0.59 to 0.72 in a martian melt composition.  Previous studies also show a lack of DCr variation with fO2 from IW to IW+4 with DCr olivine/melt ≈ 0.6 [5, 6]. The reason for this is that DCr2+ and DCr3+ olivine/melt are about equal [1].  This is because Cr2+ substition into the olivine structure for Mg2+ or Fe2+ causes no charge balance problems but it is just a little big for the M1 site in olivine [3].  In contrast, Cr3+ fits nicely into the olivine M1 site but requires charge balance [3].  Our measured DCr values are greater than those of [4-6] but similarly lack change with fO2.  Our higher DCr values could be a consequence of measuring low Cr contents in olivine and melt in samples which contain relatively Cr-rich spinel; as such our measurements for these samples show significant standard deviations. We plan to remeasure these samples with longer counting times to alleviate this problem.  We also note, however, that our samples were equilibrated at 1200° C, 120° to 200° lower than those in [4-6], and this could have some effect.  Lastly, we note that partial melts of eucrite meteorites (i.e., similar composition to our melts), yielded DCr olivine/melt of ~1.0 at IW, IW-0.6 and IW-1.25 [7].  These results are very similar to our results for the Allende samples with varying fO2. Figure 2.  DCr olivine/melt vs. fO2.    Figure 3a, b.
