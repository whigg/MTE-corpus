It has a low modal abundance (< 1 vol.%) and was found in several textural settings [1-7] associated with late-stage crystallization minerals such as troilite, ulvöspinel and kirschsteinite. It also occurs as euhedral inclusions or lathy grains in titaniferous and aluminous hedenbergite [7, 9, 10]. Previous studies show that the CSP is similar in composition to silicocarnotite, Ca5(PO4)2SiO4 and nagelschmidtite, Ca7(SiO4)2(PO4)2. However, the structure of CSP differs form that of the previous phases and seems to be isostructure to apatite [11]. Here we report about the new mineral tsangpoite (2014-110) [12] an hexagonal polymorph of silicocarnotite, which was described as silica-phosphate in the angrite D'Orbigny [7, 9, 10]. This component can help to understand the cooling processes involved in the genesis of these rocks. Analytical method: Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) thin sections were prepared by the focused-ion-beam technique. Single-crystal structure studies were based on selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns from micrometer-sized tsangpoite crystals using a JEOL 3010 AEM. The error of the d spacing measurements on SAED patterns taken at a camera length of 120 cm and calibrated by Al standard was estimated to be ± 0.002 nm. Sample and Results: The polished thin-section sample used for this study was kindly loaned by the Naturhistorisches Museum Wien, Austria (inventory number: Section D´Orbigny C-N1172-NH Wien). Textural setting: Rod-like tsangpoite (Tsa) crystals with characteristic hexagonal cross section are typically < 30 μm in length and 1-15 μm in width. Most Tsa crystals were observed to occur within the Al-bearing hedenbergite (Hd) domains in close contact with fayalite+kirschsteinite (Fa+Kir) overgrowths and FeS spherule (Fig. 1). In fact, abundant tsangpoite grains are frequently located within olivine grain boundary cusp bounded by (Fa+Kir) overgrowths and FeS-spherule. Optical microscopy showed that the tsangpoite crystals probably nucleated at FeS exposed to the olivine grain surface and then tangentially grew along the interface, forming bundles of palisade-like elongated tsangpoite crystals at the Hd - Fa+Kir interfaces (Fig. 2).  The presence of a central "tube" with segmental FeS within needle-like tsangpoite crystal was also noted. Occasionally, few crystals with a smaller grain size were enclosed within the Fa+Kir overgrowths of olivine.                 Figure 1, SEM micrograph showing abundant tsangpoite (Tsa) grains within hedenbergite domains in close contact with FeS-spherule surrounded by Fa+Kir overgrowths.                 Figure 2, Optical microscopy micrograph showing tsangpoite (Tsa) palisades at Hd-Kis+Fa interface.  TEM bight field (BF) image reveal that the phase distribution/arrangement of tsangpoite crystals in hexago nal cross-section, whitlockite crystals (Wht) in tabular cross-section, Fe-sulfide intergrowths of FeS-Fe1-xS, as well as the surrounding Al-bearing hedenbergite (Hd) matrix in the TEM thin section (Fig. 3).                      Figure 3, TEM BF image showing Tsa, Wht and Hd.                Figure 4 TEM BF image of the reaction layer depleted in Si and enriched in P (compared to tsangponite) at the contact between tsangponite and whitlockite crystal.  Despite that tsangpoite crystals appear to be oriented within hedenbergite matrix, as observed in SEM micrographs, there are no specific crystallographic orientation relationships between them. The c-axis of the Tsangpoite crystals in three different FIB thin sections were found to be sub-parallel to <110>, <112> or <134> direction, respectively, of the hedenbergite matrix. Although tsangpoite and whitlockite crystals frequently grew together, there is no definite crystallographic relationship between them, according to electron diffraction study. At the contact between tsangpoite and whitlockite crystal, a reaction layer depleted in Si and enriched in P (as compared to tsangpoite) was identified by TEM-EDX analysis (Fig. 4). Except the presence of Ca and O vacancies, hexagonal Tsangpoite appears to have the similar composition to orthorhombic silicocarnotite (IMA 2013-139). Phase equilibria study indicated that the system Ca2SiO4 - Ca3(PO4)2 forms a continuous α-Ca2SiO4 - α'-Ca3(PO4)2 solid solution phase of hexagonal symmetry at temperatures > ~1450°C [e.g., 13]. The existence of a continuous solid solution between two end members of different stoichiometries is somewhat unusual, but can be rationalized on a structure basis.  The solid solution with the stoichiometry Ca5(PO4)2SiO4 transforms to orthorhombic silicocarnotite upon cooling at 1450°C [14]. Our preliminary electron diffraction results strongly suggests that tsangpoite most likely is the quenched product of the high-temperature hexagonal silicocarnotite from above 1450°C. Under such a scenario, the temperatures prevailing in the late (metasomatic ?) stage must have been higher than 1450°C, in order to crystallize this hightemperature hexagonal phase. In such a extremely fast cooling process a hot fluid/gas (?) could have been involved, as a rapid heat dissipation into the relatively cold surrounding is needed to retain the metastable hexagonal structure instead of converting to orthorhombic silicocarnotite. Subsequently, the whole assemblage was slowly cooled to form whitlockite and kuratite, probably at temperatures >1000°, considering the 900-1100°C stability field of rhönites (kuratite) [15].
