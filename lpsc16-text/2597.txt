Introduction: The argument over relic biogenic signatures in ALH84001 has had some major implications for the search for life elsewhere in our solar system [1]. Foremost among these is that although this meteorite contains evidence of terrestrial biological contamination [2.3] the presence of these organisms was not detected by methods used to attempt to refute the McKay hypothesis [i.e. 4]. Microbiologists have had the tools available to check for signs of microbial life in the environment for many years, yet this vast realm of knowledge has been slow to be exploited within solar system exploration strategies. Only a few papers (in meteoritic research) claim to have undertaken microbial controls [3,5,6]. Only one of which has used PCR and 16S rDNA sequencing to identify bacterial cells from the Tatahouine meteorite [6]. None of these studies however have used direct DNA extraction amplification and sequencing from the meteorite. With the advent of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), microbiologists have been able to amplify the genetic material of eubacteria, eukaryotes and archaea. In general terms there is a basic inability to detect small concentrations of any microbial species in an organic poor environment. While the technique of choice (PCR), is capable of detecting bacterial speciation in any sample, the efficiency of extraction can vary depending on the mineralogy of the sample, concentration of DNA present and the extraction technique used (see [7] and references therein).  We describe here a protocol and results that allows the direct extraction (from the meteorite) of microbial contaminant DNA and its subsequent amplification and sequencing using 16S rDNA for eubacteria and the 18SrDNA region of eukaryotes. This approach is seen as a step towards the identification of microbial species in meteoritic samples that are involved in contamination and therefore, to trace the principle sources of contamination and understand more fully any terrestrial microbial metabolism within the meteorites. Ultimately the molecular biology approach may detect all the microbial species present in the meteorite and not only those that could be cultured on only a limited range of microbial growth media [5,6]. In this study we report the results of direct extraction and sequencing of the Allende CV chondrite and two ordinary chondrites collected in Antarctica. Materials and Methods: Six meteorites were studied, 3 samples of Allende were obtained from the Smithsonian Natural History museum; USNM 3655, USNM 3915 and USNM 4653. We also undertook analysis of three ordinary chondrites collected from the Alan Hills area of Antarctica; ALHA 77155 (L6), ALHA 77183 (H6), and ALHA 77258 (H6), also curated at the Smithsonian but encased in sterile packaging and stored in clean cabinets under dry nitrogen. Nucleic Acid extraction; Meteorite samples were pulverized under a laminar flow hood using flame-sterilized tools. DNA extractions were carried out on approximately 0.7 g of powdered Allende sample and one gram of each ordinary chondrite using a Power Soil DNA isolation kit (MoBio Laboratories Inc., CA) as per the manufacturer's instructions. For extraction controls we used an empty extraction tube as a negative control and a high-biomass sample as positive control. PCR amplification of genomic DNA, cloning, and sequencing; PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing were performed at the Bioanalytical Services Laboratory, Institute of Marine and Environmental Technology. A GenomiPhi DNA Amplification kit (GE Healthcare) was used to amplify the genomic DNA, following the manufacturer's instructions. PCR amplification was undertaken using universal bacterial (27F and 1492R), Archeal (8AF and 1513R), and eukaryotic (EUK-F and EUK-R) primer sets. Both negative and positive PCR controls were run alongside the meteorite extractions. PCR was performed under the following conditions: 30s denaturation at 95째C followed by 30 cycles (denaturation at 94째C for 15s, annealing at temperatures specific for each primer set for 30s, extension for 72째C for 60s), and a 10min extension at 72째C. PCR products were initially characterized using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system using the DNA 7500 kits to quantify the amount and size (in base pairs) of DNA present after PCR amplification. Samples giving visible bands in the Bioanalyzer runs were then visualized and separated using agarose gel electrophoresis. Bands corresponding to the PCR product size were then excised and cleaned ready for sequencing. PCR products were ligated into PCR-XL-TOPO vectors and transformed into OneShot TOP 10 chemically competent E. coli cells, using a TOPO XL PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Plasmid DNA was isolated from individual clones and purified using a CosMCPrep kit (Agencourt Bioscience, Beverly, MA)  using an EpMOTION 5070 liquid handling workstation. Partial 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained using the Big Dye version 3.1 kit and ABI Prism 3130xl genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). 96 clones from each successful bacterial clone library and 48 clones from the eukaryotic clone library were submitted for sequence analysis. Sequence and Phylogenetic Analysis; Chromatograms were transformed into FASTA format, and sequences were edited using SEQUENCHER (Gene Codes) prior to further analysis using the MOTHUR processing pipeline. Sequences were checked for chimeras, aligned and clustered as OTUs at an overlap identity cutoff of 90% using MOTHUR. A total of 326 valid sequences with approximately 600 bp were compared with sequences in the Ribosomal Database Project II within MOTHUR for classification. Results. Of the six meteorite samples studied, one of the Allende (USNM 4563) and two ordinary chondrites (ALH77155 and ALH 77183) were positive for eubacterial DNA but only the USNM 4563 Allende sample was positive for eukaryotic DNA. Table 1, shows the amount of eubacterial and eukaryotic DNA detected from the meteorites studied. Both extraction and PCR negative controls remained blank showing that there was no introduction of contamination during the analysis.  Table 1. The amount of PCR product (nmol) in all samples analyzed for both eubacterial and eukaryotic primers.  samples of Allende have enough extractable  DNA for sequencing. Tables 2 and 3 show eubacterial and eukaryotic results of sequence analysis respectively of the three samples that showed a positive PCR result.  Discussion; Eubacterial sequencing in all three samples where dominated by Enterobaceriaceae. However, there are differences between the ordinary chondrites whose next dominant species are Pseudomonadaceae and Allende whose next dominant species are the Methylophilaceae. The presence of green algae, moss, fungi and ground beetle DNA in Allende is extremely interesting and can only be explained by contamination at the point of impact i.e. before collection. Indeed the point of collection of the Allende meteorite was from a heavily irrigated area in northern Mexico [7]. Efforts are being made to track the exact area of collection of USNM 4653. The ground beetle DNA is from species native to northern Mexico and southern USA states and not present (alive) at the Smithsonian.  Conclusions: The speciation of eubacteria and eukaryotes found in two ordinary chondrites and one sample of Allende appear to reflect initial contamination, either before or at time of collection and indicate (in the case of the Allende sample), that once contaminated an ecosystem is formed the traces of which can survive for 40 years.
