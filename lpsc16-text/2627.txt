GEOLOGICAL CONDITIONS REQUIRED FOR THE FLUVIAL EROSION OF TITAN'S IMPACT CRATERS. R. M. Kinser1, C. D. Neish2, A. D. Howard3, P. Schenk4, V. J. Bray5, 1Physics and Space Sciences, Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne, FL, 2University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada, 3University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, 4Lunar and Planetary Institute, Houston, TX, 5University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ.   Introduction: In comparison to other icy satellites, Titan has a small number of impact craters on its surface. Its dense atmosphere screens smaller impactors from the surface [1], but this alone does not account for the lack of impact craters, especially at large diameters [2]. This suggests that Titan has a relatively young surface and/or erosional processes have effectively removed craters from its surface. For example, fluvial erosion could degrade craters such that they would be unrecognizable from an orbiting spacecraft such as Cassini. The amount of erosion, however, will depend on a number of factors including the geological and meteorological conditions of the region. In Neish et al. [3], a landscape evolution model [4. 5] was used to determine how effective fluvial erosion was at degrading craters on the surface of Titan. This was done using relatively fresh impact craters on Titan and Ganymede as a starting point, coupled with reasonable starting conditions for sediment grain size and bedrock erodibility. It was found that the fresh, 40 km diameter Ksa crater on Titan could be eroded beyond recognition for all case parameters studied. When the same parameters were applied to an analogous 40 km crater on Ganymede, however, it was found that in some cases, erosion of the crater rim stopped early on within the simulation [3]. This project aims to build off of this work and determine under which geological conditions (if any) the analogous 40 km diameter Ganymede crater could become completely eroded by fluvial processes. Methods: In order to accomplish this task, the analogous 40 km diameter Ganymede crater (Figure 1) was subjected to a range of starting conditions (Table 1) within the landscape evolution model used previously in Neish et al. [3]. These starting conditions included the overall bedrock and regolith erodibility, sediment grain size, and whether or not the regolith was fully saturated or unsaturated with liquid hydrocarbons. The associated values for each condition were kept constant throughout each simulation except for select cases where the saturation state was changed at a given time step during the model run. After each model run, the relative depth of the crater was calculated using digital terrain models output from the landscape evolution model. The relative depth, R, is a unitless estimate of how much of the original crater depth has been eroded at each time step denoted through the equation R=[D(0)-D(t)]/D(0), where D(0) indicates the starting depth of the crater and D(t) indicates the measured depth for each simulation time step, t. A relative depth of zero indicates that no erosion has occurred and a value of one indicates the complete erosion of the crater. Throughout the model runs, however, channels and other geological features can form within the basin of the crater that can skew these values. Due to this complication, visual confirmation of full erosion within the final digital terrain model output was used to determine how effectively the crater was eroded.

Results: By the end of the run in Cases A and B, the crater was almost completely eroded, with final relative depth values larger than 0.90. After decreasing the bedrock erodibility, shown by Cases C and D, it was found that the crater was no longer fully eroded, with final depth values of 0.56 ± 0.11 and 0.75 ± 0.17 respectively (Figure 2).    Figure 2: (left) Relative depth plotted against the model iteration and (right) final digital elevation model output for the 40 km Ganymede crater corresponding to Case C. The final relative depth, R = 0.56 ± 0.11, and the recognizable craterform in the digital elevation model demonstrate that the crater was not fully eroded by the end of the run.    For both of these cases it was found that the craterform did not significantly alter past the sixth iteration time step and the relative depth values for the remainder of the run stayed relatively constant. In subsequent case studies, the saturation state of the regolith was altered midway through the model runs, shown by Cases E and F. Altering the saturation state in this way allowed for sufficient erosion of the crater by the end of Case E with a final relative depth value of 0.96 ± 0.25 (Figure 3). There was also sufficient erosion by the end of Case F, but the trend of relative depth values towards the end of the run were skewed by the degraded topography of the crater region, producing a final relative depth value of 0.85 ± 0.21.    Figure 3: (left) Relative depth plotted against the model iteration and (right) final digital elevation model image output for the 40 km Ganymede crater corresponding to Case E. The final relative depth, R = 0.96 ± 0.25, and the lack of a recognizable craterform in the digital image demonstrate that the crater was fully eroded by the end of the run.    Overall, these results suggest that in order to completely erode certain craters on Titan, a variable surface saturation state over geological time scales may be needed. Implications: We found that the Ganymede impact crater studied in this work will only completely erode under certain geologic conditions. In particular, the saturation state of the regolith appears to be an important factor. If the majority of fresh craters on Titan erode in a similar manner, the observed lack of impact craters on Titan could have implications for its climatic history. For example, one way to have a varying saturation state of the regolith is to have the atmospheric quantity of methane vary over time. This may occur due to episodic outgassing from methane clathrate within Titan's crust [6]. This process could allow for differences in the methane content of Titan's atmosphere over geological time scales and in turn, the amount of surface liquids. This would create different saturation states of the crust, and as a result, the erosion rate of the surface could also vary. References: [1] Korycansky D.G and Zahnle K.J.
