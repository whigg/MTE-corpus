Introduction:  Schiaparelli Crater is a well preserved large impact structure on Mars, centered at coordinates 16.7ºE-2.7ºS. Its main morphological features: wrinkle ridges (basin floor), smooth material (near the western and southern portions of the rim), craters formed by more recent impacts and their ejecta (basin floor), have been known and described since the early days of Mars exploration [1]. Because of its long and varied geological history, its proximity to regions highly dissected by valley networks suggesting water cycles [2, 3, 4], the detection of hydrous minerals in the crater and around it [5, 6], evidence for volcanic and tectonic activity, Schiaparelli Crater is an ideal study site to collect information related to the possible past habitability of Mars.  Central to the study of Martian past habitability is a fine scale characterization of the nature of the surface materials and their grain-size. In a thermophysical map (thermal inertia and albedo) of Mars obtained by unsupervised classification methods, Jones et al. (2014) [7] showed that the interior of Schiaparelli Crater and the regions outside it are covered by a generally thin dust layer, making this region particularly suited to the application of our methodology. Here we present a set of preliminary results of our investigation of the thermophysical properties of surface materials in Schiaparelli crater.    Methods: After conducting a general survey of the crater to search for locations characterized by high variety of morphologic features, suggesting high variability of surface deposits, we focused our investigation on a small area centered at 14ºE-1ºS, in the NW quadrant of Schiaparelli, where high resolution orbital data are available (Table 1).  We derived thermal inertia (W/m/K) from THEMIS nighttime radiance values, using routine procedures and corrections [8, 9, 10]. Applying the unsupervised classification method described in [7], we were able to identify three-dimensional clusters within the thermal inertia, THEMIS daytime brightness temperature, and CTX brightness (albedo proxy) data sets.  We then validated the clusters by comparison to pixel density plots of all two-variable pairs, to ensure cluster boundary alignment with the underlying data structure. We  found  that  thermal inertia was strongly correlated   with nighttime temperatures (Pearson's correlation coefficient r = 0.9) and day-night temperature range (r = -0.8). Daytime temperatures and CTX brightness were moderately correlated with each other (r = -0.4), while showing weak (r = 0.2) to moderate (r = -0.6) correlations with thermal inertia respectively.  Separately we carried out an unsupervised classification procedure on the 3-band R= 874 nm, G= 694 nm, B= 536 nm wavelengths multispectral HiRISE image (Table 1), allowing us to locate boulders as small as 0.25 m, and conducted a spectral analysis of the classes of surface material using CRISM data.  Results:  We identified 6 thermophysical classes (Fig. 1) corresponding to as many grain-size ranges.  Most of the area is thinly covered by dust (grain size: ~0.01 mm), interspersed with sand (grain size: 0.06 - 0.5 mm). Bright dust (< 0.01 mm) is concentrated in high slope areas, such as on crater rim faces (classes 2 and 3). Fine sand (class 6) is consistent with the presence of dunes within Crater 1 (Fig. 1). Boulders (usually difficult to detect even in high resolution imagery) are uniquely accentuated (Fig. 2) by our classification method.  The thermophysical classes correlate with CRISM mineralogy. Most notably in Crater 2 (Fig. 1), class 4 (bright fines) is associated with high values (>1σ above the image mean) of the carbonate spectral index BDCARB [11].  Conclusions: The unique association of thermophysical classes and mineralogic composition of surface materials resulting from our analysis indicates the power of our approach, which we are applying to other geologically complex Martian locations where high resolution data sets are available.  In Schiaparelli Crater the recognition of a specific grain-size value linked to a strong carbonate signal corroborates interpretations suggesting a significant astrobiological potential for this area. We are therefore conducting further analysis of thermophysical properties in this location, linking their interpretation to morphological features as shown by high resolution imagery and elevation data. Applying our method to other locations of Schiaparelli Crater imaged by high resolution data sets (where these exist or will become available in the future) will allow us to establish a fine-scale 1284.pdf
