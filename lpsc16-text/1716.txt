SIMS MEASUREMENTS OF HYDROGEN AND FLUORINE IN LUNAR NOMINALLY ANHYDROUS MINERALS.  J. L. Mosenfelder and M. M. Hirschmann, Department of Earth Sciences, University of Minnesota, 310 Pillsbury Dr. SE, Minneapolis, MN, 55455 (jmosenfe@umn.edu).  Introduction:  The pioneering discovery of indigenous lunar H in glass beads [1] spawned intensive research in the past seven years into understanding the role of volatiles in the origin and early differentiation of the Moon, with subsequent identification of H in lunar apatites, olivine-hosted melt inclusions, agglutinates, and nominally anhydrous minerals (NAMs) (for review see [2]). However, the distribution and significance of H in lunar reservoirs remain incompletely understood and controversial [2]. One of the most surprising findings was the measurement by Hui et al. [3], using FTIR spectroscopy, of trace amounts of H in anorthitic plagioclase from three crustal rocks: one troctolite from the magnesian anorthosite suite and two ferroan anorthosites (FAN). The H in these samples is inferred to have been partitioned from the lunar magma ocean (LMO) and preserved throughout an ~4.4 billion year history including cooling of the LMO and surface processes such as cataclasis and shock from impact events.  In this study, we surveyed plagioclase and other NAMs from six lunar samples. We measured H and F using an ultra-low blank secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) technique recently calibrated specifically for feldspars [4] (Fig. 1). We also used FTIR to characterize olivine and plagioclase in one of the six samples.    Figure 1.   SIMS calibration for H in plagioclase, consistent with published calibration [4]. Measurements of GRR1968 anorthite are offset from more Na-rich plagioclase standards, which may be due to a matrix effect discussed in [4]. Concentrations calculated using GRR1968 as a standard are a factor of ~2 higher than those calculated using the multipoint feldspar calibration.  Samples: For our initial study we received aliquots from six Apollo return samples. Troctolite 76535 and FAN 60015 were previously studied by Hui et al. [3,5]. We also examined two moderately shocked, chemically "pristine" FAN, 60025 and 65315, that have young exposure ages (1.3-2 m.y. [6]) and mineralogy similar to 60015 [7,8]. 77035 is an impact breccia from which we obtained analyses of anorthite and orthopyroxene. Finally, we studied olivine, plagioclase and orthopyroxene from 14072, a mare basalt [9].  Methods:  SIMS measurements were performed on the Cameca 7f-GEO instrument at Caltech using methods outlined in our previous studies [4,10,11]. As shown graphically in Fig. 2, we achieved the same low limit of detection (LOD) - less than 1 ppm H2O - as in our calibration study [4]. Particular attention was paid to assessing contributions from organic contamination resulting from sample preparation, due to the extremely low H concentrations in the samples; we filtered out analyses with 12C/30Si > 0.0002 (cf. [10]).  We also acquired FTIR spectra for one anorthite and one olivine from troctolite 76535. The grains were prepared in the form of polished cuboids in order to obtain polarized spectra in three orthogonal directions. Spectra were measured at UMN with a Bruker Tensor 37 bench coupled to a Hyperion 2000 microscope, using 50-100 micron square apertures and 512 scans taken from 8000 to 650 cm-1 with 4 cm-1 resolution.    Figure 2.  Five sequential SIMS analyses demonstrating low detection limit. Three measurements of the dehydrated blank standard bracket analyses of gem-quality andesine with very low H2O content and an anorthite from lunar troctolite 76535. Slightly, reproducibly lower counts in An-rich 76535 compared to the blank are probably caused by a subtle matrix effect (lower sputtering rate of 16O, which combines with 1H in the cloud of secondary ions above the sample).  1716.pdf

Results:  Results are summarized in Table 1 and examples of SIMS and FTIR analyses are shown in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively.  Hydrogen concentrations.   Our results on FAN 60015 are consistent with Hui et al. [3,5] in that all anorthite crystals studied yield H concentations above the LOD. Our estimate of 2.1 ± 0.9 ppmw H2O, calibrated against a terrestrial An96 standard (GRR1968), is based on recent revision of the IR calibration for feldspars and on the assumption that there is a matrix effect for H in Ca-rich plagioclase, as discussed in our calibration study [4] and seen in both Figs. 1 and 2. If the calibration for all plagioclase standards is used instead, the estimate is 1 ppmw H2O. Hydrogen above the LOD was also measured in one out of ten analyses of four crystals from FAN 65315. We did not reproduce previous results [3] on 76535. Nine analyses of two anorthites from this troctolite all were below the LOD, consistent with IR spectra taken on one of the crystals (Fig. 3). On the other hand, one analysis of olivine yielded 2 ppmw H2O, whereas Hui et al. found that the olivine from this sample is dry [3]. The meaning of the olivine measurement is uncertain because our FTIR spectra indicate that broad band H2O (e.g., in fluid inclusions) may be present but not structural OH. No H was found in any NAMs from 77035 or 14072, and unfortunately analyses of FAN 60025 were compromised by organic contamination.  Fluorine concentrations. We measured surprisingly high amounts of F in anorthite from 60015 (6.3±4.1 ppmw, 2σ), well above the LOD (0.1 ppmw). Anorthite in 65315 also contains F concentrations slightly above the LOD (0.4 ppmw). The concentrations measured in 60015 are higher than those found so far in most terrestrial plagioclase crystals [4].    Figure 3.  Polarized FTIR spectra of anorthites from troctolite 76535. Spectrum in red (baseline estimate shown as dashed line) is from Hui et al. The crystal we measured (in three orthogonal directions) just barely shows OH above the detection limit and the OH may be associated with organic contamination, which was persistent despite aggressive ultrasonic cleaning.   Discussion:  This work points to the need for more measurements of lunar NAMs using low-blank techniques, to determine the distribution of H in lunar rocks in a more statistically meaningful way. One lingering question is why some anorthite grains from the same rock (76535) have H while others are dry and Ffree. This result cannot be related to any simple model of loss by volume diffusion, because we were careful in this study to measure the cores of anorthite grains, which were also sampled by the transmission FTIR measurements of Hui et al. [3].  We emphasize (cf. [2]) that estimating the H content of the LMO or UrKREEP from plagioclase-melt H partitioning still carries significant uncertainty resulting from limited experimental data [12] and uncertainty in the IR calibration for H in plagioclase [4]. A complete lack of plagioclase-melt F partitioning data and the need for improvement in F calibration by SIMS [11] constitute barriers to fully understanding the significance of the relatively high F contents we measured in 60015, which could otherwise suggest a higher F abundance for the bulk silicate Moon than the estimates derived by McCubbin et al. [2].   References: [1] Saal A. E. et al. (2008) Nature, 454, 192-196. [2] McCubbin F. M. et al. (2015) Am. Mineral., 100, 1668-1707. [3] Hui H. et al. (2013) Nat. Geosci., 6, 177-180.
