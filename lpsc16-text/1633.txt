Ft. Lowell Rd., Suite 106, Tucson, AZ 85719, USAIntroduction: Being in orbit at Mars since 2004,the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) [1, 2] hasobtained nearly complete global coverage allowing theconstruction of full-resolution image mosaics on a globalscale. The strong elliptical and highly irregular orbit ofthe spacecraft, which often results in large variations ofillumination and atmospheric conditions between adjacent images, turns the brightness correction into a major challenge. Therefore a photometric correction is required in addition to the standard radiometric correction.In [3], a first-order correction for varying illuminationconditions and resulting brightness variations assumingideal diffusely (Lambertian) reflecting behaviour of thesurface is described. This simple but robust correctionmethod does not account for bi-directional influences ofground properties. Now we present an enhanced photometric correction based on the Hapke photometric model[4] and compare it with the Lambertian correction. Inorder to achieve homogenous image products ready formosaicking, we derive one set of model parameters foreach quadrangle and apply the correction to all the images of the quadrangle with the same set of parameters.Hapke modeling: We choose the MC-10E quadrangle for the example model area to directly compare itwith the results of the Lambertian correction from [3].We exclude 13 out of 166 images with visibly high atmospheric contribution from the modeling process. For theremaining set of images for all five panchromatic channels of the camera, the incidence, emission and phaseangles are calculated by the use of an image-to-groundfunction for each channel using the VICAR framework[5] and the SPICE [6] library. The images are binnedto a spatial sampling of 200 m per pixel. In order toavoid over-weighting of uneven dense data distributiondue to the specific camera geometry the data is binnedalso in geometry space (i, e, a) with 5◦ bins. To avoidthe limitations of photometric models at extreme scattering geometries, we also discarded data points withi > 80◦ analogous to [7]. Figure 1 shows data plotsfor the geometric configurations used for the subsequentfitting. We choose the six parameter version of the original isotropic multiple scattering model [4] with a doubleterm Henyey-Greenstein (HG2) function for our modeling experiments. The sparse coverage and minor qualityat low phase angles does not let us expect a good representation of the opposition effect parameters in the modeling results. Due to the limited coverage of the emissionangle (caused by the fixed mounting of the five panchromatic channels on the camera platform) the roughnessparameter may not be well constrained either.

Theimplementation of the Hapke formulas are taken from[7] in a version ported from IDL to Python. We perform the least-square fit with at least 100 randomly generated initial parameter sets for each filter to ensure themodel converges to the true global minimum. All parameters are set free. As expected, it turns out that theroughness and oppositon parameters can not be well constrained. For the remaining three parameters, we findwell-constrained values of 0.83 for the single scatteringalbedo (ω), 0.63 for the asymmetry parameter (b) and 0.97 for the backscattering fraction (c) of the HG2 phasefunction (best fit with a mean error of about 10%, cf.Figure 2).Results: The complete set of images are correctedwith the Hapke model and then mosaicked together. Theresulting mosaic is compared to the Lambertian correction in Fig. 3. From the visual inspection, it is not clear ifthe Hapke correction provides a significant improvement1633.pdf

In areas, where theLambertian corrections seems to "overcorrect" the images (resulting in brighter images), the Hapke correctionappears to be more realistic. With regards to the complexity and stability of the two correction methods, theLambertian correction remains the better candidate forcurrent mosaicking efforts [9].Acknowledgements: This work is supported by the German Space Agency (DLR Bonn), grant 50 QM 1301 (HRSC onMars Express), on behalf of the German Federal Ministry forEconomic Affairs and Energy.References: [1] G.
