DISTRIBUTION AND GEOMORPHOLOGY OF THE LATITUDE-DEPENDENT MANTLING DEPOSITIN HELLAS PLANITIA, MARS.  M. Voelker, E. Hauber, R. Jaumann, German Aerospace Center, Institute ofPlanetary Research, Rutherfordstr. 2, 12489 Berlin, Germany (martin.voelker@dlr.de).Introduction:  Located  in  the  southern  mid-latitudes  of  Mars,  Hellas  Planitia  is  the  second-largestconfirmed impact basin on the planet, with a diameterof 2,300 kilometers. The basin also contains the topographically lowest parts of Mars, and hence, the highest atmospheric pressure on the planet of up to 11 millibar. Temperatures vary by season from 150 to 300 K[1, 2]. Thus, this vast depression is one of the atmospherically most active regions of Mars. This is alsoshown by the seasonal dust  storm activity within thebasin. This work will help to understand the distribution of landforms caused by water and ice in Hellas,and thus,  the geography of  potential  habitable  zonessupporting life.Methods: We applied  the newly developed gridmapping method as described by [3]. This is a usefulmethod for analyzing the geospatial distribution of predefined landforms over a large area, by using high spatial resolution datasets. Using this method, the wholestudy area is separated into 20,000 grids, each with asize of 20×20 km. Mapping has been carried out in aGIS environment on the basis of CTX images (ContextCamera  onboard  Mars  Reconnaissance  Orbiter)  at  ascale of 1:30,000. Because of the huge size of the studyarea,  only  every  second  grid  is  mapped  (approx.10,000 in total). At the time of writing, ~65% of thestudy area have been mapped.Results: According  to  the  roughness  map of  [4]most parts  of  the basin's  floor  are  covered  with socalled  Latitude-Dependent  Mantling  deposits  (LDM)(Figure 1 A and B). It is unclear if the process responsible for depositing LDM is still active on Mars or if itis just temporarily halted [5].  However,  according tocrater-size  frequency  distributions,  LDMs  were  deposited in geologically recent times (0.4 - 2.1 Ma) [5].At certain environmental conditions, like high obliquityor thawing conditions, LDM appears to get deformedor  eroded  into  several  morphologies,  e.g.,  scallopedterrain  and  Layered  Remnant  Deposits  (LRD)  incraters (Figure 1 C and D). Our mapping shows that there is an extensive area(~200 × 800 km) of an elliptical plan-view shape in theNE part of Hellas where LDMs are lacking. This observation is consistent with the roughness map of [4], asthis spot shows high roughness values. The rest of thebasin is covered with LDM. However, the more southLDMs  are  observed,  the  less  they  are  textured  anderoded, and they appear to be young and smooth.Scalloped terrain is referred to rimless and often axisymmetric depressions within LDM, formed by subsurficial loss of ice and/or volatiles thought to be contained in the LDMs [6]. It is assumed that their topography and development is linked to solar insolation andlatitude  [7].  Although there  is  an  almost  completelyclosed LDM cover in Hellas, scalloped terrain only appears  in scattered  locations south of  35°S.  However,there is no other obvious distribution pattern recognizable.North of 37°S there is an increased prevalence ofLRDs within smaller craters (0.1 - 3 km in diameter).They usually occur at the southern parts of the craterinteriors, and are hence exposed to the Sun.Discussion: We hypothesize that the lack of LDMsin NE Hellas  may be  the result  of  wind circulationswithin the basin. According to [8], wind currents rotateclockwise in Hellas. Cold polar winds, possibly catabatic, enter the basin at a gap in the rim in SW Hellas,draining down from the south polar highlands towardthe north. When they reach the northern parts of Hellasat a latitude of 30°S, they might warm up and begin tomove south again.  Thus,  they may trigger  either  enhanced sublimation of LDM material in NE Hellas orprevented an atmospheric deposition as the winds havebecome too dry at that place. This observation supportstheories of a high amount of volatiles within LDM.The evolution of LRDs remains much more enigmatic.  We  hypothesize  three  different  scenarios.  (1)Eolian processes might have caused sublimation. Butwind does not explain the strict location of the CCF inthe southern half of the crater bowls over such a hugearea.  (2)  Volcanic  ashes,  transported  over  wide  distances, like the Medusae Fossae Formation along someequatorial regions on Mars, are also a possibility. Theycan  explain  the  uniform  orientation  of  the  LRDs',caused by eolian and lateral transport of dry volcanicashes or  ballistic transport  of pyroclastic material directly  from  a  volcanic  vent.  However,  there  is  noknown volcanic  feature  northwest  of  Hellas.  On  theother hand, climate modeling by [9] suggests that a dispersal  of  volcanic ashes  during the late  Noachian orearly Hesperian is possible, but only originating fromvolcanoes northeast and southwest of Hellas. (3) Solarinsolation,  and  hence  thermal  sublimation,  could  explain the uniform location of these remnants over a bigarea. Moreover, this could explain the latitude-dependence  of  this landform, as  they predominantly occurnorth of 37°. But this does not explain why the LRD1360.pdf

layers  consistently  "survived"  in  that  part  of  cratersthat  (currently)  receives the most intense solar radiation. This theory would be conclusive if LRDs' werelocated in the shaded northern half of a crater. Nevertheless, we assume this scenario as the most likely. Because of Mars' permanently changing obliquity of up to47° within the last 20 Ma [10], it is also possible thatthe northern parts of the crater interiors once received ahigh amount of solar insolation even at these latitudes.Thus,  the  volatile-rich  material  could  have  been  removed there. If  LRD is or was rich in volatiles, it islikely that  it  is  composed  of  the  same material  likeLDM. Another  explanation for  this paradoxical  location might be that the LRDs' are a result of an invertedrelief. So it is possible that today's LRDs' were oncehollows,  that  have  been  refilled  by another  materialpoor of ice.Despite scalloped terrain being latitude-dependent,it does not appear continuously south of 35°S, althoughthere is a complete LDM cover. A possible reason forthis  scattered  pattern  might  be  a  varying  amount  ofvolatiles within the LDM blanket.Conclusion: On basis of grid-mapping, it was possible to analyze the geospatial distribution of cold-climate landforms in Hellas. Thereby, an extensive elliptical gap of LDMs in NE Hellas became apparent; probably caused by clockwise wind circulations within the impact basin, causing either prevention of LDM deposition or sublimation of a pre-existing LDM layer.The  exact  evolution  of  Layered  Remnant  Deposits(LRD) is still poorly understood. However, it appearslikely that these deposits were eroded by a process controlled  by  solar  insolation  (i.e.  sublimation),  whichmeans they contained, or still contain, certain amountsof volatiles like ice.  Hence, our observations supportexisting theories of a volatile-rich layer in the Martianmid-latitudes, typically termed LDM. Detailed statistical evaluations of our grid map will test, i. a., if there isa correlation between landforms and their elevation, aspect, and slope. Thus we will be able to derive furtherinformation about atmospheric conditions and layeringwithin Hellas as well as the influence of obliquity cycles.References: [1] Forget F. et al.
