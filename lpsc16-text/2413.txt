INNOVATIVE SOLAR SYSTEM SCIENCE WITH THE JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE.  S.N. Milam1, J. Stansberry2, G. Sonneborn1; 1NASA GSFC (8800 Greenbelt Rd, Greenbelt, MD 20771, USA; stefanie.n.milam@nasa.gov), 2Space Telescope Science Institute, Baltimore MD.   Introduction:  The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is optimized for observations in the near and mid infrared and will provide essential observations for targets that cannot be conducted from the ground or other missions. The observatory offers a suite of 4 instruments providing imaging and spectroscopic capabilities spanning the wavelength range 0.6 - 28.5 microns. The state-of-the-art science instruments, along with the telescopeâ€™s moving target capabilities, will enable the infrared study, with unprecedented detail, for nearly every object (Mars and beyond) in the solar system. This presentation features highlights for planetary science applications, extracted from the recent articles published in PASP as a special edition [111]. Additionally, a brief observatory overview and the current mission status will be presented. References: [1] Milam, S.N. et al. (2016) PASP, 128, 018001. [2] Thomas, C.A. et al.
