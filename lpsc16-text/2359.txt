Introduction: The data from the MESSENGER (MErcury Surface, Space Environment, Geochemistry and Ranging) flybys and orbital imaging have established that tectonic landforms (particularly shortening features) are common on Mercury's surface [1]. The most frequently observed features are lobate scarps: curvilinear surface expressions of thrust faults, with a steep front scarp and lower gradient back scarp, and topographic reliefs of a few 100 m to a couple of kilometres [2]-[4]. This work focusses upon a type of lobate scarp, that are distinct from the global population only on the basis of their location - they are found at the edges of the volcanic fill of impact basins (referred to as "tectonised basins") and can be hundreds of km in length [5]. One example of a tectonised basin is shown in Figure 1. Our theory (as described further in [6]) for the formation of these features is as follows:   Impact creates basin (by which we mean impact feature greater than >100km in diameter)   Basin is subsequently flooded by lava to form a 'smooth plains' surface.  Compression results in the formation of lobate scarps at the edge of the volcanic fill.  This process of formation explains why this type of lobate scarp follows the edge of basins, and why they always verge outwards, away from the centre of each basin. Compression may result in upward propagating thrust faults in the crust which intersect with the basin/fill interface, or possibly be nucleated on the interface surface itself, or in a fracture in the crust generated by the original impact.  In this work we apply the Marchi Production Function (MPF) method (eg [7-11]) to examples of tectonised basins that we first identified in a global survey, with the aim of establishing whether tectonised basins were volcanically filled at approximately the same time, and when basin infilling and tectonisation occurred in the broader geological history of the planet Mercury.

Global survey: In order to identify examples of tectonised and untectonised basins, and to establish how common tectonised basins are on Mercury, we carried out a global survey on the MESSENGER MDIS [12] global mosaic version 9. We visually examined each basin, using the global basin database [13], and identified all apparent examples of tectonised basins, in two size categories; 100-199 km diameter and >200 km diameter. We established that tectonisation occurs in 12% of basins in our survey, and is more common in the larger diameter category (36%) than the smaller (8%). Model crater retention ages: We applied the MPF method to the surface of basin fills, and the MPF and buffered count method [16], following the example of Giacomini et al. [17], to the basin-edge lobate scarps. Our results are shown in Table 1.  Table 1: MPF results for large and small tectonised basins. Errors stated result from the process of fitting a production function to the cumulative SFD data only (assumed to follow Poisson statistics), and do not include methodological errors. Poor fits are indicated by italics.   The buffer-derived results in Table 1 (which indicate the age of the cessation of activity on the scarps) show that activity on all the basin edge scarps in Table 1 ceased around 1 Ga (~0.6-1 Ga). The fills of the tectonised basins have model ages of ~2.2-3.5 Ga (large category) and ~1.5-3.9 Ga (small category). This wide spread of model ages indicates that tectonisationdoes not preferentially affect filled basins of a certain age. It also supports previous work indicating that small-scale volcanic activity continued for a long period after large-scale volcanic activity (such as the Northern Volcanic Plains) had ceased  [14, 15].  Discussion: We suggest that the explanation for tectonisation being more common in the larger size category of basin, is that there is a higher chance for upward propagating faults to intersect a large diameter basin, compared with a small diameter basin. The cessation of scarp activity around 1 Ga (between ~0.6-1.1 Ga) is later in Mercury's history than might be expected for scarps of this size. Giacomini et al. [17] employed the MPF method and stratigraphic analysis to obtain an estimation of the age of Blossom Rupes, a ~2000 km length thrust fault on Mercury. Their results suggest an end to activity on this fault between 3.5-3.7 Ga, considerably earlier than our results. The fact that our basin-edge scarps have geologically young model ages (late Mansurian) supports the work of Banks et al. [18], who suggests that tectonic activity (reactivation of large scarps, eg. Calypso Rupes, and formation of small lobate scarps - 10s km in length) may have been occurring during the Mansurian and into the Kuiperian. Conclusions:  - Effusive volcanism of sufficient scale to extend across the floors of basins 100 km in diameter or greater continued until at least mid-Mansurian (approximately 1.5 Ga). - Tectonisation is more common in large basins, possibly as there is higher chance for upward propagating faults to intersect a large diameter basin than a small one. - Basin-edge scarp activity ceased around 1 Ga, which is more recent than might be expected for 100 km length scarps.
