Introduction: Sulfur, F, Cl and a range of metals (Zn, Ga, Cu, Pb, Ni and other elements) are found coating glass beads in basaltic pyroclastic deposits from Apollo 17 (orange glass) and Apollo 15 (green glass) [1, 2]. The coatings are believed to have deposited from a volcanic gas during decompression and cooling of the eruptive plume [1, 3]. Using volatile element (H, C, Cl, S, F) concentrations measured in Apollo 17 orange glass beads [4, 5] and assuming an oxygen fugacity two log units below the iron-wüstite buffer (IW-2), we have derived a model for the composition of a lunar volcanic gas (mole%: H=31.8, O=15.4, C=15.9, Cl=0.2, S=34.6, F=2). Adding 0.001 mole% (arbitrarily set far below saturation) of the metals Zn, Ni, Pb, Ga, Cu and Fe, we have calculated the speciation of the bulk composition at pressures from 103 to 10-9 bar and from 500 to 1500 °C using a Gibbs Free energy minimization approach. Here we present a new model linking the thermochemical evolution of the lunar volcanic gas and the deposition of metal species during isentropic decompression and cooling with a simple ballistic flight path of the lunar glass beads onto which the metal species deposit. Isentropic decompression and cooling: The decompression and cooling of volcanic gas mixtures in eruption plumes is reasonably modeled as adiabatic [6, 7, 8] following isenthalpic or isentropic paths (Fig. 1). We use the isentropic path for our model, because lunar fire fountain eruptions decompress into the near vacuum and frictional heat loss is likely negligible. The eruption temperature at the vent is set to 1450 °C which is just above the liquidus temperatures of orange and green glasses [1298 to 1448 °C; 9]. The pressure at the vent, 0.1 bar is chosen in analogy to observations of explosive volcanic eruptions on Jupiter's moon Io [10, 11, 12, 13]. The pressure-temperature conditions at which equal amounts of metals are in the gas phase and in the solid phase (∑M(g) / ∑M(S) = 1) are shown in Fig. 1. For the more refractory metals such as Cu, Fe and Ni this condition requires high temperatures (> 900 °C) and pressures near the vacuum. Pb, Zn and Ga can exist in the vapor phase at very low pressures (< 10-6 bar), even at temperatures below 700 °C. Despite its lower vapor pressure, Pb is more abundant in the gas phase at higher pressures and lower temperatures than Zn, because it forms relatively more stable sulfide and chloride species in the gas phase over most of the pressure and temperature range, increasing its volatility relative to Zn which occurs mainly as Zn(g).   Fig. 1. The contours show the pressure and temperature conditions at which equal mole fractions of the metal are in the gas and solid phases. The stippled red line is the path of isenthalpic expansion and the solid red line is the isentropic expansion path of an ideal diatomic gas such as CO.      Fig. 2. Pressure and temperature evolution of an ideal CO gas along ballistic trajectories. The exit angles are 30°, 45°, 60° and 75°. The size of the dots represents the pressure and the color the temperture. The individual steps are 15 s apart and the cooling rate is 3 °C/s.   Dynamic model of a lunar fire fountain eruption and speciation of coating metals: We have calculated ballistic trajectories for lunar volcanic glass beads producing deposits with a maximum distance (d) of 80 km from the vent forming a dark mantle deposit that is similar in dimension to the Orientale Ring [10]. This distance can be reached in a vacuum and under lunar gravity (g=1.62 m/s2) with an exit velocity (v) at the vent of ~ 360 m/s. This is the minimum exit velocity required for a ballistic trajectory to reach the distance of 80 km in a vacuum and under lunar gravity with an exit angle of 45° (d = [v2sin(2*45°]/g). The cooling rate of glass beads is modeled as 3 °C/s although it may be as high as 100 °C/s [4, 14]. Since the path varies with the angle at the vent, the time at which the path ends on the surface ranges from 0 to 445 s, the temperature from 1450 to 118 °C and the pressure from 0.1 to 10-5 bar, as shown in Fig. 2.  This model shows that trajectories with different angles may deposit at the same distance with different P-T paths resulting in different species coating the glass beads. For example, a 30° exit angle results in a P-T trajectory depositing at a distance of 69 km after 222 sec., at 780 °C and 10-2 bar and forming coatings of PbS, Pb, ZnS, Ni, NiS and NiS2. A path originating at 60° exit angle deposits at the same distance, but due to a longer path (Fig. 2) after 385 sec., at 300 °C and 3*10-4 bar, forming coatings of PbS, PbCl2, ZnS, NiS and NiS2. This speciation was calculated assuming that the glass beads are at equilibrium with the surrounding volcanic gas and the metal phases coat the beads directly from the gas phase.    Fig. 3. Speciation of metal phases in glass bead coatings (Zn, Ni and Pb) shown as the ratio of sulfide species to the sum of all other solids (pure metal, chlorides, oxides and fluorides) shown as a function of the temperature at deposition. Modeled exit angles are also indicated. We show the calculated speciation of the solid phases as the ratio of the metal sulfides to the other solids (pure metal, chlorides, oxides and fluorides) (Fig. 3). For Zn, Ni and Pb, the sulfides dominate at all modeled conditions, with increasing relative abundance during cooling. Below 400 °C, PbCl2 becomes relatively more abundant. Below 500 °C, NiS2 is the major species and this changes to NiS at higher temperatures.  Our model predicts that coatings on lunar glass beads vary due to different deposition temperatures, pressures and times encountered by following different ejection angles. Glass bead coatings deposited at higher temperatures are generally richer in pure metals (Pb, Ni) compared to coatings formed at lower temperatures.  If the cooling rate is much higher (e.g. at 100 °C/s), all trajectories cool so fast that the temperatures are below 0 °C within 15 seconds and the speciation of the coatings is the same irrespective of the trajectories, once the glass beads deposit. Variations in the speciation of metals in the coatings can therefore reflect low cooling rates, a range of different trajectories, multiple eruptions or changes of the gas composition and metal content during an eruption.
