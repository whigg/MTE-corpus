Theinteraction  of  the  GCR with  a  planetary  atmosphereleads  to  a  change  of  the  isotropic  nature  of  theradiation  field  which,  on  Earth,  results  in  a  largerdirectional flux of particles from the zenith than fromthe horizon. Intuitively, this can be understood as dueto  shielding  by  the  atmosphere  which  has  a  muchsmaller  column  density  in  the  zenith  direction  thantoward  the  horizon.  In  this  work  we report  the  firstdetermination of this zenith angle dependence on thesurface  of  Mars  using  data  from  the  RadiationAssessment Detector (RAD) [1] which is part  of theMars Science Laboratory (MSL) payload [2]. Here we describe the zenith angle dependence ofthe radiation at ground level as J() ~ cos(')  cos()where  '  equals   for a zenith-pointing detector. Thefirst term describes the usual projection effect onto aplane surface, the second splits out the dependence onzenith angle. For an isotropic radiation field,   = 0, atthe Earths surface, = 1 is considered a standard value[3]. We find that the surface radiation on Mars at Galecrater  altitudes  is  quite  different  from that  at  Earth,with a  = 0.18  0.07. Data  Analysis:  The  Radiation  AssessmentDetector  (RAD)  is  a  very  compact  and  versatileinstrument which was optimized for operation on Mars[1] to asses the charged and neutral particle radiationenvironment.  A simplified  cross  section  of  RAD  isshown in Fig. 1. RAD is mounted inside Curiosity suchthat  its  field of  view points along the normal  to therover deck. Thus, the inclination of RAD is the same asthat of the rover which is known. For this study weused data from sol 525 to 806 when no changes weremade to the RAD instrument settings.  During thesessols,  MSL's  inclination angle varied  between 0°  and15°, the most probable value being 6.5°, the mean andmedian were 5.8° and 6°, respectively. Times when theDynamic  Albedo  of  Neutrons  (DAN)  instrument  [4]was active were excluded from our analysis to reducebackground. Detailed modeling of RADs response todifferent  zenith-angle  distributions  showed  that  theratio  of  particles  entering  RAD  through  the  outersegment  of  the  front  detector  (A1)  to  those  enteringRAD through the inner segment of A (A2) depends onthe zenith-angle dependence of the radiation field. Weused  this  fact  to  obtain  the  exponent,  ,  whichcharacterizes  this  important  property of  the radiationenvironment on Mars. A more detailed description ofthe data analysis is given in [5].Results:  The results of our analysis are discussedin detail in [5] and summarized in Fig. 2 which showshourly  values  of  the  ratio  of  counts  of  particlesentering  RAD  through  the  A1  and  through  the  A2segments of the top SSD and triggering B (see Fig. 1),which we call A1/A2 in the following. In an isotropicfield,  A1/A2iso = 4.202   6.6 10-4,  our measurementsshow A1/A2Mars = 4.173   0.012, which differs fromthe  isotropic  case  by  2.4  times  the  estimated  error.Assuming underlying Gaussian errors, the chance thatwe  are  truly  observing  an  isotropic  distribution  isFigure 1: Schematic of the RAD instrument. The inset shows one of the segmented Si-solid-state detectors. The ratio of particles coming from the outer segments to the inner segments depends in their zenith-angle distribution.1151.pdf

1.6%.  As  one  sees  in  Figure  2,  an  underlyingLorentzian  error  distribution  more  closely  resemblesthe data. Using this assumption and the correspondingfitted width of the distribution, we obtain a probabilityof  10% for an isotropic distribution "masquerading"∼as  non-isotropic.  Given  these  uncertainties,  we  maystate that the radiation field coming from within zenithangles of up to  15  at Gale crater is very close to∼ ∘isotropic  and  tends  to  show  added  shielding  fromlarger zenith angles.This result can be used to estimate the cos θ index,γ . Taking the values for the modeled ratio for A1  B⋅and A2  B coincidences, we can interpolate in them to⋅find the index, γ, corresponding to A1∕A2 Mars = 4.173± 0.012. We thus found γMars = 0.18 ± 0.07. As expectedfrom the discussion in the previous paragraph, this isnot too different from the isotropic value γiso = 0 andindicates  that  the  very  thin  Martian  atmosphereprovides only a small amount of shielding or that theshielding  effect  is  partially  compensated  by  thegeneration of second-day particles from the interactionof the GCR with the atmosphere.Interpretation:  We could show that the radiationcoming from within some 15° from the zenith directionat  Gale  Crater  on  Mars  is  nearly  isotropic  and  thatshielding plays only a minor role in this range of zenithangles. Seasonal and diurnal pressure variations do notinfluence the A1/A2 count ratio [5]. While limited to arather narrow range of zenith angles, this finding hasimplications for future human exploration of Mars andfor investigations of the interaction of radiation withthe  Martian  soil  and  the  possible  preservation  oforganic  molecules.  It  is  important  to  note  that  theseobservations were only made in a rather narrow rangeof zenith angles and our finding of a nearly isotropicradiation  field  should  not  be  extrapolated  to  largerzenith angles. In future work, we will attempt to extendthis  range  by  adding  newer  data  from  RAD  whenCuriosity  began  climbing  Mount  Sharp  andexperienced somewhat higher inclination angles. Thiswill require careful calibration of temperature effectsand other possible configurations changes to RAD.References: [1] Hassler, D. M., et al. (2012), Space Sci.
