The interaction  of  the  GCR with  a  planetary  atmosphere leads  to  a  change  of  the  isotropic  nature  of  the radiation  field  which,  on  Earth,  results  in  a  larger directional flux of particles from the zenith than from the horizon. Intuitively, this can be understood as due to  shielding  by  the  atmosphere  which  has  a  much smaller  column  density  in  the  zenith  direction  than toward  the  horizon.  In  this  work  we report  the  first determination of this zenith angle dependence on the surface  of  Mars  using  data  from  the  Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) [1] which is part  of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) payload [2]. Here we describe the zenith angle dependence of the radiation at ground level as J() ~ cos(')  cos() where  '  equals   for a zenith-pointing detector. The first term describes the usual projection effect onto a plane surface, the second splits out the dependence on zenith angle. For an isotropic radiation field,   = 0, at the Earths surface, = 1 is considered a standard value [3]. We find that the surface radiation on Mars at Gale crater  altitudes  is  quite  different  from that  at  Earth, with a  = 0.18  0.07. Data  Analysis:  The  Radiation  Assessment Detector  (RAD)  is  a  very  compact  and  versatile instrument which was optimized for operation on Mars [1] to asses the charged and neutral particle radiation environment.  A simplified  cross  section  of  RAD  is shown in Fig. 1. RAD is mounted inside Curiosity such that  its  field of  view points along the normal  to the rover deck. Thus, the inclination of RAD is the same as that of the rover which is known. For this study we used data from sol 525 to 806 when no changes were made to the RAD instrument settings.  During theses sols,  MSL's  inclination angle varied  between 0°  and 15°, the most probable value being 6.5°, the mean and median were 5.8° and 6°, respectively. Times when the Dynamic  Albedo  of  Neutrons  (DAN)  instrument  [4] was active were excluded from our analysis to reduce background. Detailed modeling of RADs response to different  zenith-angle  distributions  showed  that  the ratio  of  particles  entering  RAD  through  the  outer segment  of  the  front  detector  (A1)  to  those  entering RAD through the inner segment of A (A2) depends on the zenith-angle dependence of the radiation field. We used  this  fact  to  obtain  the  exponent,  ,  which characterizes  this  important  property of  the radiation environment on Mars. A more detailed description of the data analysis is given in [5]. Results:  The results of our analysis are discussed in detail in [5] and summarized in Fig. 2 which shows hourly  values  of  the  ratio  of  counts  of  particles entering  RAD  through  the  A1  and  through  the  A2 segments of the top SSD and triggering B (see Fig. 1), which we call A1/A2 in the following. In an isotropic field,  A1/A2iso = 4.202   6.6 10-4,  our measurements show A1/A2Mars = 4.173   0.012, which differs from the  isotropic  case  by  2.4  times  the  estimated  error. Assuming underlying Gaussian errors, the chance that we  are  truly  observing  an  isotropic  distribution  is Figure 1: Schematic of the RAD instrument. The inset shows one of the segmented Si-solid-state detectors. The ratio of particles coming from the outer segments to the inner segments depends in their zenith-angle distribution.  1.6%.  As  one  sees  in  Figure  2,  an  underlying Lorentzian  error  distribution  more  closely  resembles the data. Using this assumption and the corresponding fitted width of the distribution, we obtain a probability of  10% for an isotropic distribution "masquerading"∼ as  non-isotropic.  Given  these  uncertainties,  we  may state that the radiation field coming from within zenith angles of up to  15  at Gale crater is very close to∼ ∘ isotropic  and  tends  to  show  added  shielding  from larger zenith angles. This result can be used to estimate the cos θ index, γ . Taking the values for the modeled ratio for A1  B⋅ and A2  B coincidences, we can interpolate in them to⋅ find the index, γ, corresponding to A1∕A2 Mars = 4.173 ± 0.012. We thus found γMars = 0.18 ± 0.07. As expected from the discussion in the previous paragraph, this is not too different from the isotropic value γiso = 0 and indicates  that  the  very  thin  Martian  atmosphere provides only a small amount of shielding or that the shielding  effect  is  partially  compensated  by  the generation of second-day particles from the interaction of the GCR with the atmosphere. Interpretation:  We could show that the radiation coming from within some 15° from the zenith direction at  Gale  Crater  on  Mars  is  nearly  isotropic  and  that shielding plays only a minor role in this range of zenith angles. Seasonal and diurnal pressure variations do not influence the A1/A2 count ratio [5]. While limited to a rather narrow range of zenith angles, this finding has implications for future human exploration of Mars and for investigations of the interaction of radiation with the  Martian  soil  and  the  possible  preservation  of organic  molecules.  It  is  important  to  note  that  these observations were only made in a rather narrow range of zenith angles and our finding of a nearly isotropic radiation  field  should  not  be  extrapolated  to  larger zenith angles. In future work, we will attempt to extend this  range  by  adding  newer  data  from  RAD  when Curiosity  began  climbing  Mount  Sharp  and experienced somewhat higher inclination angles. This will require careful calibration of temperature effects and other possible configurations changes to RAD. References: [1] Hassler, D. M., et al. (2012), Space Sci.
