Introduction Analyses of high-resolution observations have shown that the dunes within the martian North Polar Erg (AKA Olympia Undae) are currently very active on seasonal and yearly timescales. An early study [1] estimated that over 40% of the dunes sampled within the North Polar Erg show dune brinks that erode each year, with small alcoves that generally feed into a depositional fan (Fig. 1). This mass-wasting may reflect a mechanism for dune advancement [1], in addition to the standard aeolian transport-driven dune migration.  Based on the apparent timing of gully activity, previous studies have proposed that either sublimation activity or simple loading could destabilize the dune slopes and overlying seasonal CO2 frost [1,2] (perhaps through a process like that modeled by [3]), or that alcoves also form before CO2 accumulation and therefore result from aeolian processes in the mid- to latesummer [4]. This project aims to conclusively distinguish between general aeolian versus seasonal frost process drivers of this gully formation. Our current results indicate that gully formation does have a seasonal driver (see next section). We are carefully examining several sites (Tab. 1), dispersed around the pole, over four Mars years. Comparisons of image pairs are used to constrain the timing of gully formation, as done in previous studies [1-3]. Information about the gully and dune environment are also gathered for evaluation of the formation hypotheses, as observations of gully formation within the north polar erg (versus the sourthern mid-latitudes [5,6]) are complicated by formation of the polar hood in the fall and the lack of images taken during the fall and winter when it is dark (Fig. 2). Thus, trends and variations in gully size, morphology, orientation, and location are also considered. Potential trends relative to latitude and dune type, size, and orientation are investigated.  Additionally, we estimate typical rates of gully activity and erasure to determine how important this process is in the evolution of the North Polar Erg (Tab. 1). In later images, many of these degraded brinks are "restored" to a crisp, continuous edge and ripples may appear within the filled-in alcove and over the apron. This has led to a proposal that present-day conditions result in a net equilibrium between erosion and restoration processes [1], although interannual variation has been observed [2]. However, exactly which processes are reshaping these dunes, and at what rates, has not yet been established.  Figure 1. Alcove formation on a dune slope in Kolhar dune field. During one Mars year, some dunes have multiple gullies form (as shown between the brackets); some new gullies form over older (and still visible) gullies, while some form on "clean" dune surfaces.  Table 1: So far, gully activity has been mapped and measured within five dune fields, each over one Mars year. Tleilax results are presented in more detail in [7].

Figure 3 shows results for Kolhar - each point is a dune where new gullies had formed. All fields except for Arrakis show high levels of gully activity, with new gullies found on 20-60% of dunes in the study regions. Preliminary analysis of three fields (Furya, Chusuk, and Tleilax) shows that most gully activity can only be constrained to the autumn-early spring period when no HiRISE images are taken (Fig. 2). However, a few gullies had activity that could be constrained to a short period (each ~2-4 weeks), right at the edges of the seasons when imaging is possible [7]. (Further analysis is needed to see if those gullies are any different from other new gullies.) As we have observed no gully activity during late spring through mid-summer, their formation is not consistent with a purely windrelated origin [4].  New and old gullies are located only on the slipfaces of dunes, but are oriented in different directions with no preferred trends observed. Some occur in clusters, and others are isolated features. Gully size is limited by dune size, but is not necessarily correlated with dune size (Fig. 4). Further work will include constraint of gully formation timing within Buzzel and Kolhar, investigation of latitudinal changes in activity time/rates or gully morphology as indicators for seasonal process controls, and exploring why Arrakis seems to have so much less gully activity. Additionally, as described in [7] for Tleilax, we are tracking the rate of gully erasure (equivalently, dune restoration) due to the wind.

New gullies in Kolhar dune field were identified through comparison of HiRISE images PSP_008968_2650 (Ls 90 MY 29) and ESP_017895_2650 (Ls 93 MY 30). Screenshot shown is from analysis done in JMARS.   Figure 4. New gullies "length" (alcove + apron) plotted against dune slipface "length" - for both, this is the planform distance from the top to bottom of the slope. In some cases, the gully is longer than the dune as the apron extends past the end of the dune slipface - showing that gully activity could be a major contributor to dune migration.
