Introduction:  The 2015 CanMars MSR Analogue Mission [1] was a high-fidelity, 11 command-cycle campaign designed to test the daily science activity and operations planning required for remote science exploration. This was a Mars Sample Return Analogue Mission carried out in partnership between the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates Ltd. (MDA), and the Centre for Planetary Science and Exploration (CPSX) at the University of Western Ontario, as part of the NSERC CREATE project "Technologies and Techniques for Earth and Space Exploration" (create.uwo.ca). The Mars Exploration Science Rover (MESR), developed by MDA, 'landed' in midNovember in a remote location in Utah, USA unknown to the science operations team. The daily science activity planning took place at a mission control centre [2, 3] located at the University of Western Ontario, Canada.  Daily Operations Planning: MESR featured a suite of mast-mounted imaging instruments, standoff science instruments, robotic arm-mounted contact science instruments, and drill and push core sampling instruments [4]. Science Activity planning followed realistic exploration and decision-making rules suited to the short-duration campaign [4]. Each command cycle was constrained by an operational resource budget for MESR as shown in Table 1. Individual activity sequences consumed portions of that budget, with examples of such consumption provided in Table 1.  Many of the activities had dependencies that required specific sequencing or multi-sol planning in order to accomplish [4]. The simulation was modeled to require post-drive imagery of at minimum a LIDAR scan and panoramic image as MESR was not able to drive 'blind'. The daily resource budget allows for a maximum of 100m/day drive range. However, these post-drive imaging activities require resources equivalent to 17m worth of drive to perform, which then limits the maximum drive to 83m. Imagery was required in order to target the standoff instruments, which meant that standoff science activity in Sol N+1 required imagery to be sequenced in Sol N. The contact science instruments,                                                                  1 The contact science suite example involves deploying the robotic arm, acquiring 1 high resolution TEMMI image, swapping instruments, acquiring 1 XRD measurement, and then stowing the robotic arm. the Three Dimensional Exploration Multispectral Microscopic Imager (TEMMI) and X-Ray Diffractometer  (XRD), and the sample acquisition tools required the robotic arm to deployed on a target within the arm's work volume. The robotic arm deployment required high resolution imagery and 3D information of the target, which meant that robotic activity in Sol N+1 required imagery in Sol N with no movement in between. The robotic arm had to be stowed before MESR could safely be moved again, and post-sampling images of the core site were taken following the arm stow activity.   Table 1.

Due to both the daily budgeting constraints and the overall mission duration limit, sample acquisition was performed within the same robotic sequence as contact science measurements; the decision to sample was based on stand-off science measurements and not on contact measurements, and the contact measurements were taken just prior to sampling. The full robotic arm activity of contact science and solid drill core sampling could not be completed within one sol and thus required careful consideration. 2 The push core sample suite example involves deploying the robotic arm, performing the coring activity, and then stowing the robotic arm. 3 The drill core sample suite example involves deploying the robotic arm, performing the coring activity, and then stowing the robotic arm. 1581.pdf

Resource Use Efficiency:  A summary of the resource consumption per sol is provided in Table 2. Conscious effort was consistently directed towards maximizing resource usage.  Typically, after the science "musthave" activities for a sol were sequenced, the remaining resources were considered for allocation.  When possible, activities with resource usage dependent on input parameters (such as the resolution of a zoom image) were assessed to see if an increase/decrease in their usage would be worth the return.  Additional raster points for a non-contact science activity (XRF/Raman) could be added, provided that this activity was already sequenced.  After this maximization process, a few alternate sequences of activities that conform to the budget leftovers were presented.  The sequence with the highest predicted return in value would then be selected. A summary of the science measurements acquired over the 11 sols is provided in Table 3.   Table 2. Resource consumption per sol as a percentage of available budget. Note that for Sol 11, 'out-of-sim' logistics constrained the available duration of the field activities. The science activities were planned to fully make use of the available duration. Bolded values indicate limiting resource for given sol.

The total efficiency for duration, data and energy budgets was 95.9%, 87.3% and 77.9% respectively.  Duration was the most commonly depleted resource; even when plans were duration-limited, it was common for one or both other resource budgets to be nearly maximized.  Based on the total allowable traverse distance for the mission of 913m, the mission consumed 234.1m, as shown in Table 4, which is 25.6% of the permissible distance, while acquiring four characterized samples. For future analogue missions with similar duration limits, this benchmark could be useful for estimating traverse planning.  Table 4. Commanded traverse distances.

In future, it would be of great value to study previous missions [5,6] and identify ways in which resources can be more effectively consumed in the name of greater scientific return.  Ideally, resource considerations and science plans looking towards future sols can be merged, to identify better ways to plan in advance.  Solutions from the field of mathematical operations research could be investigated and applied to this problem.  Conclusions: The 2015 CanMars MSR Analogue Mission was successful campaign that maximized the resource capabilities of MESR to acquire a large data set.
