Introduction: There has recently been widespread interest in the use of phosphorus (P), a moderately incompatible and very slowly diffusing element, to constrain the history of mineral growth and timescales of petrogenetic processes. The low diffusivity of P in melt leads to complex growth zoning in olivine, and the low diffusivity in olivine then allows the preservation of such zoning over magmatic residence times and high temperatures. P-rich silicates, especially olivine, have been found in many terrestrial and extraterrestrial rocks. However, various factors can affect P concentration in silicates, including (among others) nonequilibrium incorporation, melt composition, temperature, oxygen fugacity, and apatite saturation.  Here we present results obtained from a sample of an impact melt lithology of the Chelyabinsk meteorite. We provide textural and compositional data and infer constraints on new olivine growth and on cooling processes based on the distribution of phosphorus.  Material and Methods: Three polished sections from Chelyabinsk (N9832, N9834, and N9837; all from the Natural History Museum Vienna) were investigated. We carefully examined the different lithologies, and then focused our work on the impact melt lithology [1]. We first used transmitted and reflected light microscopy to characterize the texture and mineralogy. Then a JEOL JSM-6610 Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) was used to elucidate the texture and impact-related features (such as glass composition and heterogeneities at the micrometer scale). We finally studied the composition and zoning of phases in point and mapping modes within the impact melt using both SEM and a JEOL JXA-8530F Field Emission Gun Electron Microprobe (EPMA).  Results: The Chelyabinsk meteorite is an equilibrated ordinary chondrite, classified as an LL5 (e.g., [2,3]). Three lithologies are present: a light one, a shock darkened, and a (vesicular) impact melt lithology. Although shock veins are present, neither maskelynite nor planar deformation features (PDFs) in minerals were found. However, we and other authors have verified the presence of jadeite, pyroxene glass, and chromite exsolution in clinopyroxene in the same melt vein, suggesting both high pressure and high temperature [4, 5].  The impact melt lithology contains about 50 vol.% quenched melt, composed of small (<5 μm) zoned olivine and orthopyroxene crystals, silica-rich glass, and finely disseminated sulfide grains. Relict chondrules and individual (~100 μm) grains of olivine, pyroxene, and feldspar entrained in the melt are highly resorbed and surrounded by zoned melt regions. Composition of silicate minerals is similar to what is seen in the light lithology [6].  Olivine: In section N9834 the impact melt contains olivines (Fo64.5-85.8) with 0.02-0.52 wt.% P2O5. The Prich olivines (P2O5>0.2 wt.%) are generally Feenriched, Fo58.6 to Fo82.2. The olivines exhibit a weak to moderate positive correlation between P5+ and trivalent cations Al3++Cr3+ (Fig. 1).    Figure 1: Correlation between phosphorus and trivalent cations in 21 olivines grains.   Pyroxene: Orthopyroxene occurs as large porphyroclasts (>150 μm in length), as small subhedral to anhedral crystals (15-20 μm in length), and as tiny crystals (~10 μm in length) entrained in the melt. The large porphyroclasts have a composition En75-78Fs22-24; the small crystals have a broader range of composition Wo0-5En68-86Fs14-27; the tiny crystals show a homogeneous Mg-rich composition of En87Fs13. The Al2O3 contents vary from 0.06-0.2 wt.% in large Opx, from 0.15-1.49 in small Opx, and from 2.8-2.9 in the tiny entrained crystals. CaO contents range from 0.6-0.84 wt.% in large Opx, from 0.58-2.81 in small Opx, and from 2.04-2.12 in tiny entrained crystals. P2O5 abundances are low (≤ 0.06 wt.%) in all orthopyroxenes, with the exception of the tiny crystals, which exhibit a range from 0.13-0.19 wt.%.  Glass: EPMA spot analyses on glass reveal a SiO2rich composition (63.3-64.9 wt.%) with very low P2O5 content ≤ 0.05 wt.% and Mg# in the range of 24.41437.pdf

40.8. Unfortunately, the small glass areas between quenched crystals are too small to be able to obtain a significant number of clean glass analyses, so the given compositional range here may not be fully representative.  Discussion: Most of the olivines and a few pyroxenes entrained in impact melt show an outer rim which is highly zoned in Mg# and phosphorus content (Fig. 2). In olivine grains, the rim-rim profiles suggest welldefined oscillatory zoning, with the presence of narrow P-rich zones in the intermediate-rim area, and a relatively homogeneous core. Similar complex P zonation in olivine has been described elsewhere by several authors from very contrasting sample types. Elardo and Shearer [7] described phenocrystic olivines with P-rich (<250 ppm) bands irregularly spaced between P-poor zones from the basaltic lunar meteorite NWA 032, in which P is not correlated with any other elements. They interpreted the P variations in the context of a solute trapping model, with motion of growing olivines to different parts of a convecting magma chamber causing variations in cooling rate including transient rates in the broad range of 2-30 °C/h. Baziotis et al. [8] described second-generation olivines entrained in melt veins from Cima Volcanic Field mantle xenoliths, in which P-rich bands were 3-7 μm wide and P was negatively correlated with Si and Mg+Fe+Ca, and weakly positive with Al. The latter implied cooling rates near 10 °C/h [9] that generate disequilibrium solute trapping of P but near-equilibrium incorporation of Al.  Based on textural and geochemical criteria, we were able to narrow down the proposed models for the origin of the observed features. The occurrence of small pores at the boundary layer between the outer part of the unzoned core and the beginning of the high Mg# zone is an important clue (Fig. 2). These pores propagate toward the rim and in most cases evolve into a worm-like texture. The pores suggest expulsion of a fluid or vapor phase from the olivine`s interior, perhaps associated with decomposition of inclusions. This process likely involved extremely high temperatures for a short time. Most probably, fluid expulsion coupled to dissolution and reprecipitation mechanism explains the observed textural and compositional features. Putnis [10] showed that the development of porosity is often a consequence of mineral replacement processes, irrespective of the relative molar volumes of parent and product solid phases. The relative solubility of the solids in the fluid phase is of great importance and thus coupled dissolution-precipitation and autocatalysis become the predominant processes. High-P porphyroblastic olivines from terrestrial spinel peridotite xenoliths are explained by a similar dissolutionreprecipitation mechanism [11].    Figure 2: BSE image of an olivine entrained into impact melt lithology showing worm-like texture.   The impact melt lithology of Chelyabinsk was subject to shock pressures on the order of 25-30 GPa, but the subsequent annealing of the material likely erased shock features (such as mosaicism and PDFs) [12]. The matrix was dominated by olivine and orthopyroxene, preserved in their extensive homogeneous cores (Fo70 and En75-78). Then, during a high-T thermal event, the olivine and some rare pyroxene rims were restructured and porosity formed by nucleation at the inner rim, propagating to worm-like features in the outer rim. After that, the rapid evolution from Mg-rich to Fe-rich composition toward the exterior part of the grains is accompanied, only in the case of olivine, by the incorporation of phosphorus from the adjacent melt (DPOl/melt>DPPx/melt). This probably involved the formation of a P-enriched boundary layer during extremely rapid growth of the new olivine composition. Finally, the impact melt quenched rapidly, as suggested by the tiny prismatic/dendritic crystals of Ca and Al-rich orthopyroxene.
