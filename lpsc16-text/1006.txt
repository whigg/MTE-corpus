Introduction: The Geologic Lunar Research (GLR) group has an ongoing project to study lunar domes with the purpose of their classification based on rheologic properties [1]. The region west of Copernicus extending from Hortensius to Milichius and to Tobias Mayer contains large numbers of lunar domes and cones [1-2]. A comprehensive map of the area under description was recently produced by GLR group [5], and a classification of these domes was performed based on previous works [1, 3-4]. Further three domes located to the south of Hortensius region, where six well known domes are located near Hortensius crater, are described in [6]  In this contribution we provide an analysis of further three domes located in Mare Insularum, which have previously not been examined in detail. Accordingly we termed the examined domes as M16M18.       Spectral properties: For both examined domes, Clementine UVVIS spectral data indicate a R415/R750 ratio of about 0.60-0.61 indicating basalts of moderate TiO2 content and a weak mafic absorption for with R950/R750 = 1.031-1.039, suggesting a high soil maturity (Table 1).      dome dome Long.

Table 3: Rheologic properties and dike geometries inferred for the examined domes.     The basalts of Oceanus Procellarum exhibit a wide range of spectral characteristics and ages. Spectrally, large parts of Mare Insularum are influenced by basalt lavas of low to moderate TiO2 content on which ejecta of the craters Copernicus, Kepler, and Eratosthenes are superimposed [1].  Fig. 1: Telescopic image acquired on October 22, 2015, at 22:25 UT with a 254 mm F/14.6 Maksutov (Phillips). The image displays the domes M16-M18, while the morphometric properties of the other domes marked in the image have been reported in previous studies [1, 3]. North is to the top and west to the left.    Fig. 2: 3D reconstruction for (top) M16 dome, (middle) M17 dome and (Bottom) M18, based on CCD image. The vertical axis is 15 times exaggerated.         Morphometric dome properties, digital elevation map (DEM): Based on the telescopic CCD image we obtained a DEM of the examined domes by applying the combined photoclinometry and shape dome η [Pa s] Pa s] E [m3 s-1] Te [years] U  [m s-1]  W [m] L [km] M16 3.8x104 103 0.06 1.9 x10-4 10 50 M17 1.2x10 5 208 0.77 1.2 x10-5 17 80 M18   1.3x105 203 0.07 1.9 x10-5 18 81    from shading method described in [4]. The flank slopes, diameters, heights, and edifice volumes of these domes were extracted from the DEMs (Table 2). The heights of the domes M17 and M18 were determined to 90 ± 10 m, while M16 is 50 ± 5 m high, resulting in flank slopes of 0.93°, 0.84° and 1.14°, respectively. ACT-REACT Quick Map tool was used to access to the GLD100 dataset [8], allowing to obtain the cross-sectional profiles and the corresponding 3D view (Figs. 3-4), in agreement with the results obtained with photoclinometry and sfs applied to CCD telescopic image. According to [1] the domes M17 and M18 belong to class C1, while the dome M16 is of subclass E2.  Fig. 3: 3D reconstruction based on GLD100 dataset. The vertical axis is 7 times exaggerated. (Top) M16 and M17 domes. (Bottom) M18 which is bisected by a linear rille.      A comparison with the LRO WAC image (Fig. 3) displays the presence, for M18, of a linear rille traversing the dome, thus providing evidence for the presence of a near-surface dike.        Rheologic properties: The rheologic model developed in [9], which depends on the morphometric dome properties, yields estimates of the lava viscosity η, the effusion rate E, and the duration Te of the effusion process for a monogenetic lava dome. Using the morphometric values listed in Table 2, we obtained lava viscosities between 3.8 x 10 4 Pa s for M16 and 1.2 x 10 5 Pa s for M17 and M18 domes, effusion rates of 100-210 m 3 s -1 , and short durations of the effusion process between 0.2 and 1.0 years (Table 3). Furthermore, we estimated the magma rise speed U and the dike geometry (width W and length L) according to the model developed in [10].       We found that the magma ascended at high speeds between 2 x 10 -4 and 2 x 10 -5 m s -1 through dikes of widths between about 10 - 20 m and 50-80 km long (Table 3). Thus three examined domes are typical representative of rheologic group R1 as defined in [1], characterized by lava viscosities of 10 4-10 6 Pa s, magma rise speeds U of 10 -5 -10 -3 m s -1 , dike widths W around 10-20 m, and dike lengths L between about 30 and 150 km.  Fig. 4: Cross-sectional profile based on GLD100 dataset for (top) M16, (middle) M17 and (bottom) M18.       The inferred rheologic properties of M16 are comparable to those of the dome M7 in the Milichius region for small diameter, low-volume and spectrally red material, belonging to class E2.       The domes M17 and M18 are typical mare domes and for their rheologic properties are similar to most domes found in Milichius-Tobias Mayer region characterized in previous studies [1] belonging to class C1, as for M1, M3, and M5 with volumes smaller than 12 km 3  and M2, M6, M10 and M15 with volumes larger than 20 km 3. In this wide dome field only the domes M11 and M12 (Milichius π) with their steeper slopes > 2.5°, belong to class B1. References: [1] Lena et al.
