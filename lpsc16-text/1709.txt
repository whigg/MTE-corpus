Introduction:  Fe-poor pyroxene (<1 wt.% FeO) (hereafter termed enstatite), is the most common silicate minerals in aubrites (enstatite-rich achondrites) [1]. A number of asteroids have been identified as possible aubrite parent bodies, including Steins [2], and other E-class asteroids [e.g., 3,4,5]. A few aubrite reflectance spectra have been studied, by previous investigators [e.g., 6, 7]. We have measured a number of aubrite spectra in various forms to better understand their spectral-compositional properties. Methodology:  The aubrites that we have characterized are listed in Table 1. Compositional data are provided in Table 2. ________________________________________ Table 1.

Reflectance spectra were measured at RELAB (www.planetary.brown.edu/relab/) and HOSERLab (psf.uwinnipeg.ca) from ~0.35 to 2.5 µm at i=30° and e=0°. Spectra were corrected for dark current and referenced to calibrated  halon/Spectralon standards. Results. Fe-poor enstatite is the major silicate in aubrites, and is expected to display Fe2+ absorption bands near 0.9 and 1.8 µm [12]. Reflectance spectra of visually clean <45 and 45-90 µm powders of HC and NC (Fig. 1) are bright (>40% reflectance at 0.56 µm). HC spectra are slightly red-sloped with a weak absorption band near 0.8 µm, likely due to trace amounts of Fe-oxyhydroxides. A feature near 0.5 µm may be due to oldhamite [7]. The 45-90 µm spectrum shows a probable, but weak, enstatite absorption band near 0.9 µm, as expected [12]. The NC spectra are more bluesloped; the 45-90 µm spectrum shows a weak expected enstatite absorption near 0.92 µm, while the <45 µm spectrum has a broad absorption centered near 1.4 µm. There is no good evidence for the weaker expected 1.8 µm pyroxene band.  Fig. 1. Reflectance spectra of two powder fractions of Norton County and Happy Canyon.        The reflectance spectrum of an unsorted powder of CF (Fig. 2) is moderately bright (23% reflectance at 0.56 µm), and blue sloped. There appears to be a weak enstatite absorption band near 0.92 µm; an expected longer wavelength enstatite absorption band near 1.8 µm may be present but obscured or overprinted by a weak H2O band. The F chondrite dark inclusion [13] spectra (Fig. 2) have low reflectance (<8% at 0.56 µm) and a broad absorption near 0.93 µm. Their spectra suggest spectrally dominant pyroxene [14].  Fig. 2.

For NC, an unsorted powder spectrum is brighter than slab spectra, as expected (Fig. 3). The powder spectrum does not show the expected 0.9 and 1.8 µm enstatite absorption bands. The slab spectra do show a 0.9 µm absorption band, but no definitive 1.8 µm band.  Fig. 3. Reflectance spectra of a powder and spots on a slab of Norton County.        Two samples of Bi (<150 µm powder and unsorted powder + coarse fragments) were spectrally characterized (Fig. 4). This sample has likely been affected by terrestrial weathering as evidenced by 1.4 and 1.9 µm region OH/H2O absorption bands. Nevertheless it displays an evident 0.9 µm region enstatite band and a possible weak 1.8 µm enstatite band. As expected, the <150 µm spectrum is brighter and less blue-sloped than the unsorted powder + fragments sample spectrum.   Fig. 4. Reflectance spectra of Bishopville: a <150 µm and a powder + coarse fragments mixture.        Discussion and conclusions: The aubrite spectra show some commonalities and important differences:  . Decreasing grain size (or powders versus slab) leads to increasing reflectance, less blue sloped spectra, and decreasing enstatite absorption band depths . A 0.9 µm enstatite absorption band is not ubiquitous; a 1.8 µm enstatite absorption band is rarely seen . Oldhamite spectral features are apparently present in at least one aubrite spectrum: HC Trace amounts of ferrous iron can result in detectable absorption bands in the 0.9 and 1.8 µm region, and band depth rapidly increases with increasing Fe2+ content. This can be seen by comparing the reflectance spectra of the aubrites (0.07-0.13 wt.% FeO) with a terrestrial pyroxene containing 0.59 wt.% FeO (Fig. 5). The latter has high reflectance and moderately deep absorption bands (up to 40% deep). It is also evident that the 1.8 µm absorption band is weaker than the 0.9 µm band (e.g., 25% vs. 42% in the 45-90 µm spectrum), likely accounting for its apparent absence in many of the aubrite spectra.
