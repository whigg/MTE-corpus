Introduction:  The Sun has variably supplied energetic particles throughout the solar system.  Whereas the low energy, 1-2 KeV, protons associated with the solar wind have limited radiation effects, highenergy/flux protons from a Young Stellar Object (YSO) phase could have caused chemical, nuclear, and morphologic changes in early solar system solids.  Despite the ubiquitous nature of the particle environment in the early solar system, few experimental efforts have investigated the role of energetic protons on early solar system solids [1].  Our recent experiments [2, 3] have noted that a sintered mixture of olivine, pyroxene, and plagioclase irradiated by high-energy, high-flux protons can 1) cause catastrophic fragmentation, forming submillimeter sized particles; 2) exhibit short-term radioactivity as measured by gamma rays; and 3) result in partial melting of the mixture as observed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  In this study, we investigate the irradiation conditions necessary for melting a silicate mixture of olivine-pyroxene-plagioclase and compare these requirements to possible conditions present in the early solar nebula.   Method: Fragments of San Carlos olivine (Fo90) and Nain anorthosite (An50-70) were individually ball- milled then mixed together in an 80/20 weight ratio, respectively.  The mixture was pressed into 13mm pellets and sintered at 1150 °C for 8 hours at 2x10-6 torr in a vacuum furnace; sintering in vacuum minimizes the oxidation of the fayalitic component of the olivine. Slabs ~ 0.5mm thick were ground using progressively finer SiC up to 1000 grit.  Irradiations were performed with a NEC 5-SDH tandem accelerator at the University of Wisconsin’s Ion Beam Lab.  A 2 MeV, 3 µA beam current was defocused over a 3x3 mm set of slits located approximately 1 m from an electrically isolated sample stage. The stage was monitored with a Brookhaven Instruments Corporation (BIC) current integrator to collect total charge. Post-irradiation backscattered secondary electron (BSE) images and energy dispersive x-ray spectra (EDS) were acquired using a Phenom PRO X SEM in a low-pressure chargereduction mode.   Results: Optical and BSE images of three pellets irradiated with respective proton fluences of 5x1015 (22 sec), 1x1016 (43 sec), and 2x1016 (96 sec) P/cm2 can be observed in figure 1.  The pellets show progressive amounts of macroscopic damage with increasing fluence.  At the microscopic level, greater fluence alters the surface from one that exhibits a large degree of porosity, to a texture where isolated mineral grains are surrounded by a glassy phase, remnants of a melt.   The melt texture is maximized at the center of the beam spot and decreases further from the irradiated center. Outside the immediate area of the beam, no melt texture is observed. A black carbon residue is observed in a radius surrounding the beam spot. EDS maps (figure 2a) indicate that the isolated grains are olivine, while the glassy component chemically resembles plagioclase.  Further SEM interrogation of the 2x1016 P/cm2 pellet (figure 2b) resulted in discovery of FeNi metal blebs in what would have been under the surface of the pellet.  The subsurface was exposed during post-irradiation handling of the pellet, but was likely aided by a spalling process associated with the high-flux irradiation [2, 3].   Discussion:  The micrographs indicate that high-flux protons may be capable of melting silicate mixtures associated with  Figure 1.  Optical and SEM images of (a,d) 5x1015, (b,e) 1x1016, and (c,f) 2x1016 P/cm2 irradiated pellets; (c) was carbon coated, postSEM analysis for electron probe measurements.  Pellets show both an increase in carbon deposition and fracture/ spallation damage.  BSE images from the center of the irradiation spot for the three respective fluences show an increase in the interstitial melt phase as well as some coarsening of the olivine as a function of fluence.  In the case of (f), the porosity has been completely infilled by the melt phase, leaving isolated islands of olivine crystals. 2490.pdf

chondrules.  The high-temperature end-members in the olivine and plagioclase system melt at 1890°C and 1550°C, respectively.  As seen in figure 1f, the temperature achieved during the 2x1016 P/cm2 irradiation surpassed the melting temperature of anorthite.  The liquid was able to flow and fill the relatively porous microstructure of the sintered pellet.  Melting of the lower temperature plagioclase phase may have resulted in the coarsening of the olivine grains through Ostwald Ripening via liquid-stage sintering.   The flux of protons used in this study was 2x1014 P/cm2-s; this value is 106 greater than the proton flux of the present-day solar wind observed at 1 AU.   However, mass loss associated with developing YSOs is considerably greater than present-day values.  Furthermore, periods of instability such as T Tauri and FU Orionis can result in mass loss 102-105 greater than expected in typical YSO development [4,5,6,].    Therefore, a source of several KeV-10 MeV protons with a flux distribution between 107-13 P/cm2-s at 1 AU may have been available to interact with early solar system solids.   The minimum energy required to heat chondrule precursor materials from 500 K to the melting point has been calculated to be 2,110 J/g; further energy may be necessary to account for vaporization and thermal losses [7].   For a given energy, a fluence can be determined which could completely melt a volume of material associated with the depth of proton penetration.  For instance, a 5 MeV proton travels ~140 µm into a typical silicate [8].  If 21,000 J/g are required to melt the mass of material associated with this irradiated volume, a proton fluence of 1.2x1015 P/cm2 is neded.  If a flux of 1.2x1015 P/cm2-s was available, this volume would be melted in 1 sec.  However, if only a 1.2x1012 P/cm2-s were available, then 1000 sec would be required to melt the volume. This assumption works only in thermally isolated systems. It may be possible to melt larger volumes of material when considering longer irradiation times, higher initial nebula temperatures, the combination of low and high-energy particles, and the contribution of electrons and photons.   The FeNi metal blebs observed in figure 2b may be the result of the reducing conditions of the vacuum during irradiation and chemical interaction with the deposited carbon. Carbon compounds in the vacuum system and from mechanical-pump oil are preferentially deposited at the beam-target interface. As hydrogen is a strong reducing agent, the implanted protons may also be responsible for the micron-sized blebs observed. Fe-Ni blebs have been associated with olivines found in a variety of meteorites, with multiple mechanisms proposed [9, 10].  In all cases heating to near-melting temperatures in reducing conditions with chemical interactions with C, S, P, H, and H2  have been suggested.   Conclusions: A series of high-energy/flux irradiation experiments were performed on sintered pellets of 80 wt.% San Carlos olivine and 20 wt.% Nain anorthosite.  Results indicate that a combination of proton flux and time can melt portions of the pellet, and that these conditions may have existed in the early solar system.  A combination of longer irradiation times, greater fluxes, or higher initial temperatures may be able to melt the olivine in addition to the plagioclase.  A chondrule melting mechanism using energetic particles as an energy source may be particularly suited to droplet coalescence models [11, 12]; smaller particles would require significantly lower energy and flux of to melt. Furthermore, the formation of Fe-Ni metallic blebs has been proposed by heating olivine near the melting temperature at reducing conditions in the presence of implanted hydrogen and deposited carbon.  Future work should investigate the minimum energy and fluxes required to melt the silicate components. References: [1] Feigelson E.D. and Montmerle T. (1999) Ann. Rev. Astron. Astrophys. 37, 363–408.
