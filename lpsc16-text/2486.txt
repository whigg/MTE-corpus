Introduction:  The origin and distribution of Earth's volatiles carbon and sulfur are of critical importance to Earth's evolution and formation of the biosphere. However, the processes of volatiles accretion into the early Earth remain poorly understood. One widely accepted model is the late veneer model [1, 2]. An opposite model assumes that Earth accreted its volatiles from volatile-depleted material as accretion progressed [3, 4, 5]. The model falling in between proposes that Earth accreted its volatiles during the last 10-20% stage of accretion [e.g., 6]. The carbon and sulfur abundances in Earth's present silicate mantle are 35 - 115 ppm and 200 ± 50 ppm, respectively, and the C/S ratio (0.2-0.6) of Earth's present mantle is well comparable to those observed for carbonaceous chondrites [7]. Therefore, any models that try to constrain the accreting process of Earth's carbon and sulfur may have to be consistent with these constraints. In this study, we investigate systematically the effects of pressure, temperature, melt composition, melt water content, and fO2 on the partitioning of carbon and sulfur between Fe-rich alloy melt and silicate melt. Using the obtained partitioning data and previous constraints, we show that the carbon abundance and C/S ratio of Earth's present mantle can potentially be established by adding highly reduced or S-rich differentiated bodies into the growing Earth during accretion and core formation.   Methods and Results: Experiments in graphite capsule have been performed at 1.5-8 GPa, 1600-2200 °C, and oxygen fugacities of IW-0.4 to IW-5.3 to determine simultaneously the partition coefficients of carbon and sulfur between Fe-Ni±S±Si alloy and silicate melt, using a piston cylinder or multi-anvil apparatus. The results show that C-solubility in Si-free or low-S alloy melt is ~5.5 wt.%, while C-solubility decreases to less than 1 wt.% with increasing Si or S content in the alloy. C-solubility in silicate melt is mainly controlled by fO2 and melt H2O content. At fO2 from IW0.6 to IW-1.5, C-solubility drops from ~90 to ~10 p.p.m. However, at fO2<IW-1.5, C-solubility increases up to 240 p.p.m  with decreasing fO2 if the melt H2O content is 0.3-0.8 wt.%; whereas C-solubility only slightly increases at fO2 below IW-3 if melt H2O <0.2 wt.%. Raman and IR spectra show that the silicate glass with fO2 around IW-0.6 contained ~10-30 p.p.m carbon as CO32-; however, at fO2<IW-1 CO32- peak was undetectable in IR-spectra, but H2 and CH4 peaks are present in    Figure 1. Experimentally measured partition coefficients of carbon and sulfur between Fe-rich alloy melt and silicate melt. The solid and dashed curves in panel A are calculated DCmetal/silicate values at 2000 °C and 6 GPa, using paramerization of all available experimentally determined  DCmetal/silicate  values, which illustrate the importance of melt water content in determing DCmetal/silicate.  the Raman-spectra. Strong correlations between Raman peak intensities of H2 and CH4 and between the non-hydroxyl hydrogen and non-carbonate carbon were found, suggesting that CO32- and CH4 are the main carbon species in this study. DCmetal/silicate  varied from 130 to 4600, and the data variation is mainly governed by fO2 and melt hydration (Fig. 1A). At fO2>IW-1.5, the increase in DCmetal/silicate  with decreas ing fO2 is mainly due to the decreased CO32- in silicate melt while the decrease in DCmetal/silicate at fO2< IW-1.5 or IW-3 is mainly due to the increased CH4 content in silicate melt.  varied from 0.4 to 38 (Fig. 1B), generally decreasing with decreasing fO2.   Discussion: Our DCmetal/silicate  and DSmetal/silicate  data indicate that if carbon and sulfur were simultaneously delivered to planetary magma oceans with a chondritic ratio, segregation of Fe-rich alloy phase from the magma ocean must have caused greater depletion of carbon relative to sulfur in the silicate mantle and, the nearly chondritic C/S ratio observed for Earth's present mantle cannot be obtained. We here explore two potential mechanisms that may have occurred during Earth's accretion but can effectively enhance Earth's mantle carbon abundance and explain C/S ratio observed for Earth's present mantle. The low carbon solubility in Si-rich alloy may result in the saturation of graphite or diamond in a highly reduced magma ocean where up to 10 wt.% Si may be in the alloy.     Figure 2. Estabilishing the carbon budget of Earth's mantle by accretion of highly reduced or S-rich rocky bodies. See text for more details.  On the other hand, in a S-rich magma ocean where the alloy can contain 15-30 wt.% S, the saturation of graphite or diamond may also be obtained. In a magma ocean saturated with graphite or diamond, the total carbon content in the mantle would be significantly higher than the carbon content constrained by the equilibrium metal-silicate partitioning. If the carbon solubility in metal is fixed to be 1 wt.%, which corresponds to a highly reduced magma ocean, or fixed to be 0.3 wt%, which corresponds to a S-rich magma ocean, and if the initial carbon content in the magma ocean is between 700 and 2000 p.p.m, the carbon content in the mantle could be between 100 and 3000 p.p.m for a highly reduced or S-rich rocky body with metal/silicate mass fraction between 0.06 and 0.24. It is worth noting that the silicate mantle may also be enriched in sulfur, with sulfur abundance varying from several hundreds to thousands p.p.m, because the DSmetal/silicate is low at reduced conditions in particular. Accordingly, adding such a highly reduced or sulfurrich body to the growing Earth should remarkably enhance the carbon abundance in Earth's mantle (Fig. 2). Mass balance calculations show that adding such a body of 5-30% of Earth's present mantle would enhance  the carbon abundance in Earth's present mantle to a few tens to hundreds p.p.m  (Fig. 2). The merger of the core of the reduced or S-rich body with Earth's core may negligibly affect the carbon content in the silicate mantle. Therefore, the carbon abundance of Earth's present mantle can well be established if a highly reduced or S-rich body was added to the growing Earth. However, since a few hundreds to thousands p.p.m  sulfur may be in the mantle of the body, and since sulfur abundance in Earth's mantle can well be established alone by Earth's core-mantle segregation [5], additional processes are needed to remove the excess sulfur after addition of the highly reduced or Srich body to the growing Earth. The fO2 of the growing Earth may be several log units higher than that of the reduced body. Consequently, sulfur from the mantle of either the reduced body or the S-rich body may form sulfide in the magma ocean and the segregation of which into Earth's core should remove the excess sulfur without affecting the carbon content in Earth's mantle because of the low carbon solubility in sulfide.
