NORTHWEST AFRICA 10414,  A PIGEONITE CUMULATE SHERGOTTITE.  R.H. Hewins1,2, B. Zanda1,2, S. Pont1, 1IMPMC, MNHN, 61 rue Buffon, 75005 Paris, FR. 2Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USA. (hewins@rci.rutgers.edu).   Introduction:  Northwest Africa 10414 is an unusual shergottite: it contains pigeonite but neither olivine, as in peridotitic and olivine-phyric shergottites, nor augite, as in most other shergottites. A shergottite with no augite crystallized along with pigeonite presents us with a paradox complementary to that of synthetic Shergotty parent liquid failing to crystallize the twopyroxene assemblage [1,2]. The study of NWA10414 may therefore clarify the evolution of shergottites. Petrography: This meteorite consists of 77% modestly zoned pigeonite prisms, up to 4x1 mm in size, resembling a crystal mush (Fig. 1). The interstices (22%) contain Si-rich mesostasis glass, as well as plagioclase/maskelynite. The euhedral pigeonite is highly fractured, and contains small feldspathic inclusions as well as ~200 nm exsolution lamellae. It is locally subophitic to plagioclase/maskelynite laths (~500 μm) on its margins. The latter have euhedral Ca-rich cores visible in enhanced BSE (Fig. 2), and zonation, though in normal contrast the feldspar appears to be unfractured maskelynite. Raman spectra show weak broad peaks near 500 and 600 cm-1 characteristic of maskelynite. Spinel (<1%) occurs mainly as inclusions in pigeonite. Accessory phases include ilmenite, merrillite, a silica phase, baddeleyite and pyrrhotite, occurring on pigeonite margins or in interstitial feldspathic patches. There are small (~200 micron) patches of heterogeneous shock melt at some pigeonite-maskelynite contacts, with interfingering or veining of this melt and maskelynite (Fig. 3). Adjacent "pigeonite" is lamellar to fibrous. Mineral compositions:  NWA10414 pyroxene data fall on and below the Fe-Mn trend line for SNC, with some excluded high Mn points apparently related to alteration. The Fe/Mn ratio (atomic) is 35.0±7.1. Pigeonite core and rim composition pairs are shown in Fig. 4, and the full range (En66-43Fs29-46Wo6-13) is given in Fig. 5. Rims are enriched in Fe, Ca and Ti. Plagioclase (maskelynite) composition is An46.4±4.1Ab51.1±3.6 Or2.5±0.7, with a range mostly An~54-36 (Fig. 6). The CrTi spinel, with 15-55 mol% Chrm, 10-48% Usp and 10-35% Mgt, is mainly intermediate between chromite and Ti-magnetite and is more ferrian than the intermediate spinels in, for example, Tissint. New shergottites:  NWA 10169, 10170 and 10171 are respectively equilibrated peridotitic shergottite, olivine-phyric shergottite and fractionated basaltic shergottite (with pigeonite Fs29-75). NWA 10170 contains olivine microphenocrysts (Fo80-58) and groundmass pigeonite ~En68Fs28Wo4 close in composition to the most magnesian cores in NWA 10414.  Discussion: Experimental crystallization of a Shergotty intercumulus melt (SILC) at 1 bar gives pigeonite only over ~100°C until 1075°C, when it is joined by augite [1]. The synthetic pigeonite compositions match those of NWA10414 (Fig. 5). SILC yields the coexisting pigeonite and augite of Shergotty with a PH2O of 2 kb, as does a more Ca-rich bulk composition at 1 bar [2].  The two-pyroxene assemblage of Shergotty was therefore explained by crystallization at depth [2]. Degassing of such a melt before pyroxene crystallization could have suppressed augite and produced the unusual pigeonite shergottite NWA10414. An alternative for NWA10414 is crystallization from a liquid with a different composition than SILC. Peridotitic shergottites like NWA10169 and many olivine-phyric shergottites like EETA 79001 lithology A have accumulated or acquired olivine, but other microporphyritic olivine shergottites like EETA 79001B and NWA 10170 are close to true liquid compositions [4]. Settling of olivine from such dry liquids [5] would have left pigeonite on the liquidus at low pressure. This is shown by a ~1 cm wide pigeonite-phyric contact facies of EETA B with A [4].  Slow cooling of EETA 79001 liquid B could have caused this pigeonite to accumulate before the appearance of augite.   Fig. 1 Cumulus pigeonite in NWA10414 (≤ 4 mm). 1898.pdf

Conclusion: NWA  10414 is a pigeonite cumulate shergottite equivalent to the contact facies between EETA 79001 A and B.   Fig. 2 Interstitial maskelynite laths and Si-rich glass.
