A keygoal  of  the  second  LRO  extended  science  mission(ESM2) is to investigate volcanic processes at differenttemporal and physical scales including the identification and characterization of ancient (>3.9 Ga) volcanicunits, with an emphasis on the ancient basalts in MareAustrale and the South Pole-Aitken basin. Mare  Australe  is  a  loosely  circular  collection  ofmare basalts (38.9°S, 93°E) where extensive volcanismhas occurred [1-6]. Previously, we reported results using  LRO  data  to  understand  the  extent  of  volcaniclandforms in the Australe region [4] and basalt composition as function of new absolute model ages (AMAs)determined using recent LRO data [6]. Here, we investigate AMA-dependent variation of surface roughnessat the scale of the Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) as anew analytical tool. Background: Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) geometricstereo  observations  used  to  produce  Digital  TerrainModels (DTMs) are uniquely useful  for  a  variety ofpurposes, including investigations of molten rock rheology [7], impact crater morphology [8], lunar volcaniclandform morphometry [9] and preparation for futureexploration [10]. Here, we use NAC DTMs to assessthe roughness properties of the lunar surface.As outlined by previous investigators [11-14] systematic  differences in  roughness  exist  between lunarterrains at a variety of scales. Lawrence et al. [9] alsodiscussed NAC-scale roughness characteristics of marevolcanic landforms. In the context of the mare, whichare flood basalts originally emplaced as level equipotential surfaces, it is reasonable to assume that the surface  roughness  of  older  surfaces  will  increase  overtime [15] due to impacts and tectonism. Here, we investigate roughness as a function of AMA to investigate whether using high-resolution topography to makepreliminary estimates of relative ages is feasible. Methods: LROC Wide Angle Camera (WAC) is apush-frame camera capturing seven color bands (321,360, 415, 604, 643, and 689 nm) with a 57-km swathwidth  in  color  mode  and  a  105-km swath  width  inmonochrome mode from a 50-km altitude [16]. WACdata products employed include WAC global morphology basemap [17] and the GLD100 global digital elevation model [18]. Individual NAC frames were usedto understand the morphology and geologic context ofDTMs.  All  LRO  data  were  map-projected  and  calibrated  using  the  USGS Integrated  Software  for  Imagers and Spectrometers (ISIS) [19]. NAC Stereo Processing: NAC DTMs require a setof NAC stereo image pairs. The resulting topographicmodels  have  pixel  scales  of  2-5  m,  depending  onspacecraft altitude, and 1-2 m vertical precision. Absolute control is obtained by registering stereo models toLOLA cross-over altimetry tracks [14]. Absolute  Model  Ages: We conducted  crater  measurements to determine crater size frequency distributions (CFSDs) for mare units in the Australe region andderived absolute model ages AMAs [6]. All craters >700m in diameter identified in the LROC WAC globalmorphology base map were included in the measurements;  obvious  secondaries  were  excluded.  CraterTools [20] was used for digitization in ArcGIS and theoutput reduced using CraterStats2 [21]. The Neukumet al. [22] production and chronology functions wereused to fit the CSFDs and derive AMAs. AMAs for regions outside of Mare Australe are from the work ofHiesinger et al. [23].DTM Selection: 21 DTMs were used as part of thisstudy (Figure  1),  each  selected  to  be  on  units  withknown AMA values,  established  through new CSFDdeterminations (in Mare Australe) or by [23]. DTM locations are shown in Figure 1. Eight of the DTMs arewithin the Australe region. 20 of the DTMs are marebasalt units; one is a smooth plains unit in Australe. Terrain Ruggedness Index: Surface roughness wasassessed  using  the  Terrain  Ruggedness  Index  (TRI)[24]. TRI is the average absolute value of the difference between a central pixel and its eight immediatelyadjacent neighbors. In each NAC DTM, homogenousstudy regions free of obvious sources of modificationFigure 1: Locations of DTMs used in this study (cyan). WAC global morphology basemap in Robinson projection. 2755.pdf

(including secondary crater chains, positive-relief volcanic landforms such as basaltic low shields, and tectonic features) with areas ≥50 km2 and regional slopes<5º were selected for TRI analysis.  Results: TRI analyses performed at 5, 10, 20, 40,and 80 m pixel scales (summarized in  Figure 2) displayed consistent patterns of TRI increase as a functionof AMA. However, the 80m NAC TRI analyses provide the most useful contrast, with the most variabilitybetween units  with different  AMAs,  for  this specificuse case. In this parameter space (Figure 3), units with lowerAMAs have lower TRI values (meaning: they are lessrough) than regions with higher AMAs. There are twoloose groupings, separated by the green line in Figure3. One group consists of units with AMAs <2.5 Ga andTRI values <1.8. Units with AMAs >3 Ga have TRIvalues >1.9.  The smooth plains unit  included in thisanalysis has a higher TRI value than the mare units. Discussion: That older units are rougher is not surprising; this result is consistent with investigations ofsurface roughness at  other  scales  [11,12].  The dominant controller of surface roughness on a level  mareplains surface should be the crater population. For Eratosthenian units, the crater equilibrium diameter is anticipated to be <100m [25], so this analysis is expectedto be sensitive to the equilibrium crater population.  The bimodal distribution of TRI values is likely influenced by a sampling effect produced by the age distribution of the DTMs analyzed in this study, as well asthe  known  variability  within  established  crater  agedate units [26, 27]. Nevertheless, the older basalt unitshave higher TRI values. Implications: Eratosthenian/Imbrian basalts in thisparameter space consistently have TRI values >2, sothis  preliminary assessment  indicates  that  NAC TRIanalysis could represent a promising method to distinguish ancient mare basalts, and possibly facilitate discrimination  of  cryptomare.  In  conjunction  with  controlled  multispectral  data  sets,  NAC  TRI  analysescould improve unit selection for crater size measurements, ultimately improving CSFD determinations.  Finally,  since Copernican and Eratosthenian maresurfaces have uniformly low TRI values, this analysisalso implies that future exploration missions to youngbasalt regions will have a generally benign landing environment.
