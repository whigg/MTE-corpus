A key goal  of  the  second  LRO  extended  science  mission (ESM2) is to investigate volcanic processes at different temporal and physical scales including the identification and characterization of ancient (>3.9 Ga) volcanic units, with an emphasis on the ancient basalts in Mare Australe and the South Pole-Aitken basin. Mare  Australe  is  a  loosely  circular  collection  of mare basalts (38.9°S, 93°E) where extensive volcanism has occurred [1-6]. Previously, we reported results using  LRO  data  to  understand  the  extent  of  volcanic landforms in the Australe region [4] and basalt composition as function of new absolute model ages (AMAs) determined using recent LRO data [6]. Here, we investigate AMA-dependent variation of surface roughness at the scale of the Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) as a new analytical tool. Background: Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) geometric stereo  observations  used  to  produce  Digital  Terrain Models (DTMs) are uniquely useful  for  a  variety of purposes, including investigations of molten rock rheology [7], impact crater morphology [8], lunar volcanic landform morphometry [9] and preparation for future exploration [10]. Here, we use NAC DTMs to assess the roughness properties of the lunar surface. As outlined by previous investigators [11-14] systematic  differences in  roughness  exist  between lunar terrains at a variety of scales. Lawrence et al. [9] also discussed NAC-scale roughness characteristics of mare volcanic landforms. In the context of the mare, which are flood basalts originally emplaced as level equipotential surfaces, it is reasonable to assume that the surface  roughness  of  older  surfaces  will  increase  over time [15] due to impacts and tectonism. Here, we investigate roughness as a function of AMA to investigate whether using high-resolution topography to make preliminary estimates of relative ages is feasible. Methods: LROC Wide Angle Camera (WAC) is a push-frame camera capturing seven color bands (321, 360, 415, 604, 643, and 689 nm) with a 57-km swath width  in  color  mode  and  a  105-km swath  width  in monochrome mode from a 50-km altitude [16]. WAC data products employed include WAC global morphology basemap [17] and the GLD100 global digital elevation model [18]. Individual NAC frames were used to understand the morphology and geologic context of DTMs.  All  LRO  data  were  map-projected  and  calibrated  using  the  USGS Integrated  Software  for  Imagers and Spectrometers (ISIS) [19]. NAC Stereo Processing: NAC DTMs require a set of NAC stereo image pairs. The resulting topographic models  have  pixel  scales  of  2-5  m,  depending  on spacecraft altitude, and 1-2 m vertical precision. Absolute control is obtained by registering stereo models to LOLA cross-over altimetry tracks [14]. Absolute  Model  Ages: We conducted  crater  measurements to determine crater size frequency distributions (CFSDs) for mare units in the Australe region and derived absolute model ages AMAs [6]. All craters > 700m in diameter identified in the LROC WAC global morphology base map were included in the measurements;  obvious  secondaries  were  excluded.  CraterTools [20] was used for digitization in ArcGIS and the output reduced using CraterStats2 [21]. The Neukum et al. [22] production and chronology functions were used to fit the CSFDs and derive AMAs. AMAs for regions outside of Mare Australe are from the work of Hiesinger et al. [23]. DTM Selection: 21 DTMs were used as part of this study (Figure  1),  each  selected  to  be  on  units  with known AMA values,  established  through new CSFD determinations (in Mare Australe) or by [23]. DTM locations are shown in Figure 1. Eight of the DTMs are within the Australe region. 20 of the DTMs are mare basalt units; one is a smooth plains unit in Australe. Terrain Ruggedness Index: Surface roughness was assessed  using  the  Terrain  Ruggedness  Index  (TRI) [24]. TRI is the average absolute value of the difference between a central pixel and its eight immediately adjacent neighbors. In each NAC DTM, homogenous study regions free of obvious sources of modification Figure 1: Locations of DTMs used in this study (cyan). WAC global morphology basemap in Robinson projection.    (including secondary crater chains, positive-relief volcanic landforms such as basaltic low shields, and tectonic features) with areas ≥50 km2 and regional slopes <5º were selected for TRI analysis.  Results: TRI analyses performed at 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 m pixel scales (summarized in  Figure 2) displayed consistent patterns of TRI increase as a function of AMA. However, the 80m NAC TRI analyses provide the most useful contrast, with the most variability between units  with different  AMAs,  for  this specific use case. In this parameter space (Figure 3), units with lower AMAs have lower TRI values (meaning: they are less rough) than regions with higher AMAs. There are two loose groupings, separated by the green line in Figure 3. One group consists of units with AMAs <2.5 Ga and TRI values <1.8. Units with AMAs >3 Ga have TRI values >1.9.  The smooth plains unit  included in this analysis has a higher TRI value than the mare units. Discussion: That older units are rougher is not surprising; this result is consistent with investigations of surface roughness at  other  scales  [11,12].  The dominant controller of surface roughness on a level  mare plains surface should be the crater population. For Eratosthenian units, the crater equilibrium diameter is anticipated to be <100m [25], so this analysis is expected to be sensitive to the equilibrium crater population.  The bimodal distribution of TRI values is likely influenced by a sampling effect produced by the age distribution of the DTMs analyzed in this study, as well as the  known  variability  within  established  crater  agedate units [26, 27]. Nevertheless, the older basalt units have higher TRI values. Implications: Eratosthenian/Imbrian basalts in this parameter space consistently have TRI values >2, so this  preliminary assessment  indicates  that  NAC TRI analysis could represent a promising method to distinguish ancient mare basalts, and possibly facilitate discrimination  of  cryptomare.  In  conjunction  with  controlled  multispectral  data  sets,  NAC  TRI  analyses could improve unit selection for crater size measurements, ultimately improving CSFD determinations.  Finally,  since Copernican and Eratosthenian mare surfaces have uniformly low TRI values, this analysis also implies that future exploration missions to young basalt regions will have a generally benign landing environment.
