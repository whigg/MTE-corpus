Introduction:  Chondritic meteorites are generally assumed to represent the building blocks of the Earth (and other terrestrial planets).  However,  which group of chondrites, or mix of chondrite groups, best represents the composition of the Earth is a matter of debate [1]. For example, while based on compositional arguments it was proposed that the Earth is best represented by carbonaceous chondrites [2],  the indistinguishable O isotopic compositions of enstatite chondrites and the Earth's mantle was used to argue for the formation of the Earth from enstatite chondrites [3]. The idea of an enstatite  chondritic  Earth  has  gained  significant  momentum in recent years, due to the discovery of planetary-scale nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies for a variety of elements (Ca, Ti,  Cr, Ni, Mo, Ru, Nd),  all of which imply a very close genetic relationships between the Earth and enstatite chondrites [4-10]. While the isotopic similarity of the Earth and enstatite  chondrites  is  undeniable,  it  is  less  clear  as  to whether  enstatite  chondrites  represent  the  building blocks of the Earth. Mass-dependent Si isotope variations as well as differences in bulk Mg/Si between enstatite chondrites and the accessible silicate Earth seem to argue against  an enstatite chondrite Earth [11-12], but these observations have less weight than the nucleosynthetic  anomalies,  which  cannot  be  modified  by secondary processes like core formation or mantle differentiation.  Thus,  definitive  evidence  against  an  enstatite chondritic Earth would come from the discovery of nucleosynthetic anomalies in enstatite chondrites relative to Earth. Hints for such anomalies can be found for Ti, where enstatite chondrites seem to show small 50Ti  deficits  compared  to  the  Earth  [13].  However, these small deficits can easily be balanced by addition of a small fraction of carbonaceous chondritic material, which is  characterized  by large  50Ti  excesses  [5,13]. Thus, the Ti isotope data would still permit the Earth to largely consist of enstatite chondritic material. Significant Mo isotope anomalies in enstatite chondrites  were  reported  by [8],  however,  this  finding is based on only two samples and contrasts with earlier work [7].  Nevertheless,  the Mo isotope anomalies in enstatite chondrites, if they exist, would effectively rule out an enstatite chondrite Earth, because all other meteorites analyzed so far are characterized by a deficit in s-process Mo relative to the modern terrestrial mantle. Thus, if enstatite chondrites also show an s-deficit, then the Earth can neither be made of enstatite chondrites nor of any combination of known chondrites.  To address this issue and test the model of an enstatite chondrite  Earth,  we obtained  high-precision  Mo  isotopic data  for  eight enstatite  chondrites and three  ordinary chondrites. Analytical methods:  Bulk pieces (>1g) of chondrites were carefully cleaned by abrasion with SiC paper  and ultrasonication in Milli-Q water,  before they were ground to fine powders in an agate mortar.  All samples were digested in Savillex beakers on a hotplate using HF-HNO3-HClO4  (180°C, 7 days). Molybdenum was separated  from the sample matrix using a threestage  ion  exchange  procedure  [8].  The  Mo  isotope measurements were performed using the ThermoScientific Neptune  Plus MC-ICP-MS at Münster,  which is equipped with a  Cetac Aridus II  desolvating system. Instrumental mass bias was corrected using the exponential law and internal normalization to  98Mo/96Mo = 1.453171 [14]. Potential isobaric interferences from Zr and Ru were quantified by monitoring  91Zr and  99Ru. Total procedural blanks were <1 ng and negligible for all samples. The Mo isotopic data are reported in εiMo as the parts per 104 deviations from terrestrial standard values and  are  calculated  relative  to  the  mean composition measured for an Alfa Aesar Mo standard during each session. The precision and accuracy of the Mo isotope measurements  was  evaluated  by  repeated  measurements of the BHVO-2 basalt standard from five different digestions. For this sample we obtained εiMo~0 for all Mo isotope ratios with the following external reproducibility (2 s.d.): ±0.38 ε92Mo, ±0.27 ε94Mo, ±0.16 ε95Mo, ±0.11 ε97Mo and ±0.20 ε100Mo. Fig.  1. εiMo vs. iMo showing the average Mo isotopic compositions  for  enstatite  and  ordinary chondrites  obtained  in this study. Dashed line represents the expected composition for an s-deficit, calculated using the stellar model of [15].  Results: Enstatite and ordinary chondrites both display well resolved positive anomalies in ε92Mo, ε94Mo and  ε95Mo, while anomalies in  ε97Mo and  ε100Mo are less well resolved (Fig.1).  The magnitude of the Mo isotope anomalies decreases in the order ε92Mo >ε94Mo >ε95Mo  >ε100Mo  >ε97Mo  and  the  resulting  w-shaped pattern is characteristic for a deficit in  s-process Mo relative to terrestrial Mo [8]. The average Mo isotope compositions of enstatite and ordinary chondrites are in excellent agreement with but more precise than previous results [8]. Discussion:  To  assess the origin of the Mo isotopic anomalies in the enstatite and ordinary chondrites it is useful to examine the data in a plot of ε95Mo vs. ε94Mo.  In  this  plot,  an  s-deficit  can  readily  be  distinguished from an r-excess [8]. Fig. 2 shows that the Mo isotopic  compositions  of  the  enstatite  and  ordinary chondrites, like those of most other meteorites, are consistent with variable deficits in s-process Mo compared to terrestrial Mo. Fig. 2. ε95Mo vs. ε94Mo plot for enstatite and ordinary chondrites, and terrestrial samples analyzed in this study. Dashed line indicates expected isotope anomalies for an excess in rprocess  Mo,  while  the  dotted  line  indicates  an  s-deficit. These two lines were calculated using the stellar model of [15]. Solid line represents mixing line between terrestrial Mo and s-process Mo as measured in SiC grains [16]. The well-resolved s-process Mo deficits of enstatite chondrites demonstrate that the Earth cannot be made of enstatite chondrites; the data also demonstrate that the Earth and enstatite  chondrites also do not  derive from a homogeneous inner disk reservoir. Instead the Earth is enriched in  s-process matter compared to  all chondrites  (Fig.  3).  Thus,  no  known group  of  chondrites,  nor  a  combination  thereof,  can  represent  the building material of the Earth, because none of these combinations would yield  the terrestrial  Mo isotopic composition [8]. In fact, all meteorite classes (except IAB iron meteorites) show variable depletions in s-process Mo compared to terrestrial Mo (Fig. 3). This suggests that the building material of the Earth mostly derived from the inner solar system, whereas the meteorite parent bodies represent objects that always were in an orbit beyond Mars and as such contributed little material to the growing Earth. However, given that the s-process  deficits  increase  in  the  order  EC<OC<CC, there might have been radial zoning in the distribution of s-process matter in the solar protoplanetary disk. In this case the Earth may have been assembled from senriched material  from the inner  solar  system mixed with chondritic material from greater heliocentric distances. Due to planetesimal scattering in the early solar system, some of this inner solar system material might have been transported into the asteroid belt; however, such material has yet  to be identified.  In  either case, due to the s-process-enriched nature of the Earth compared to all groups of chondrites, caution must be exercised  when using  the  isotopic  composition  of  chondrites as a  proxy for the isotopic composition of the Earth [10].
