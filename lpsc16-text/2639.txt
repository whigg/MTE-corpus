MOLYBDENUM ISOTOPES AND THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF THE EARTH.  J. Render, M. FischerGödde, C. Burkhardt and T. Kleine, Institut für Planetologie, University of Münster, Wilhelm-Klemm Str. 10, 48149Münster, Germany (jan.render@wwu.de).Introduction:  Chondritic meteorites are generallyassumed to represent the building blocks of the Earth(and other terrestrial planets).  However,  which groupof chondrites, or mix of chondrite groups, best represents the composition of the Earth is a matter of debate[1]. For example, while based on compositional arguments it was proposed that the Earth is best representedby carbonaceous chondrites [2],  the indistinguishableO isotopic compositions of enstatite chondrites and theEarth’s mantle was used to argue for the formation ofthe Earth from enstatite chondrites [3]. The idea of anenstatite  chondritic  Earth  has  gained  significant  momentum in recent years, due to the discovery of planetary-scale nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies for a variety of elements (Ca, Ti,  Cr, Ni, Mo, Ru, Nd),  all ofwhich imply a very close genetic relationships betweenthe Earth and enstatite chondrites [4-10].While the isotopic similarity of the Earth and enstatite  chondrites  is  undeniable,  it  is  less  clear  as  towhether  enstatite  chondrites  represent  the  buildingblocks of the Earth. Mass-dependent Si isotope variations as well as differences in bulk Mg/Si between enstatite chondrites and the accessible silicate Earth seemto argue against  an enstatite chondrite Earth [11-12],but these observations have less weight than the nucleosynthetic  anomalies,  which  cannot  be  modified  bysecondary processes like core formation or mantle differentiation.  Thus,  definitive  evidence  against  an  enstatite chondritic Earth would come from the discoveryof nucleosynthetic anomalies in enstatite chondrites relative to Earth. Hints for such anomalies can be foundfor Ti, where enstatite chondrites seem to show small50Ti  deficits  compared  to  the  Earth  [13].  However,these small deficits can easily be balanced by additionof a small fraction of carbonaceous chondritic material,which is  characterized  by large  50Ti  excesses  [5,13].Thus, the Ti isotope data would still permit the Earth tolargely consist of enstatite chondritic material. Significant Mo isotope anomalies in enstatite chondrites  were  reported  by [8],  however,  this  finding isbased on only two samples and contrasts with earlierwork [7].  Nevertheless,  the Mo isotope anomalies inenstatite chondrites, if they exist, would effectively ruleout an enstatite chondrite Earth, because all other meteorites analyzed so far are characterized by a deficit ins-process Mo relative to the modern terrestrial mantle.Thus, if enstatite chondrites also show an s-deficit, thenthe Earth can neither be made of enstatite chondritesnor of any combination of known chondrites.  To address this issue and test the model of an enstatite chondrite  Earth,  we obtained  high-precision  Mo  isotopicdata  for  eight enstatite  chondrites and three  ordinarychondrites.Analytical methods:  Bulk pieces (>1g) of chondrites were carefully cleaned by abrasion with SiC paper  and ultrasonication in Milli-Q water,  before theywere ground to fine powders in an agate mortar.  Allsamples were digested in Savillex beakers on a hotplateusing HF-HNO3-HClO4  (180°C, 7 days). Molybdenumwas separated  from the sample matrix using a threestage  ion  exchange  procedure  [8].  The  Mo  isotopemeasurements were performed using the ThermoScientific Neptune  Plus MC-ICP-MS at Münster,  which isequipped with a  Cetac Aridus II  desolvating system.Instrumental mass bias was corrected using the exponential law and internal normalization to  98Mo/96Mo =1.453171 [14]. Potential isobaric interferences from Zrand Ru were quantified by monitoring  91Zr and  99Ru.Total procedural blanks were <1 ng and negligible forall samples.The Mo isotopic data are reported in εiMo as theparts per 104 deviations from terrestrial standard valuesand  are  calculated  relative  to  the  mean compositionmeasured for an Alfa Aesar Mo standard during eachsession. The precision and accuracy of the Mo isotopemeasurements  was  evaluated  by  repeated  measurements of the BHVO-2 basalt standard from five different digestions. For this sample we obtained εiMo~0 forall Mo isotope ratios with the following external reproducibility (2 s.d.): ±0.38 ε92Mo, ±0.27 ε94Mo, ±0.16 ε95Mo, ±0.11 ε97Mo and ±0.20 ε100Mo.

Results: Enstatite and ordinary chondrites both display well resolved positive anomalies in ε92Mo, ε94Moand  ε95Mo, while anomalies in  ε97Mo and  ε100Mo areless well resolved (Fig.1).  The magnitude of the Moisotope anomalies decreases in the order ε92Mo >ε94Mo>ε95Mo  >ε100Mo  >ε97Mo  and  the  resulting  w-shapedpattern is characteristic for a deficit in  s-process Morelative to terrestrial Mo [8]. The average Mo isotopecompositions of enstatite and ordinary chondrites are inexcellent agreement with but more precise than previous results [8].Discussion:  To  assess the origin of the Mo isotopic anomalies in the enstatite and ordinary chondritesit is useful to examine the data in a plot of ε95Mo vs. ε94Mo.  In  this  plot,  an  s-deficit  can  readily  be  distinguished from an r-excess [8]. Fig. 2 shows that the Moisotopic  compositions  of  the  enstatite  and  ordinarychondrites, like those of most other meteorites, are consistent with variable deficits in s-process Mo comparedto terrestrial Mo.Fig. 2. ε95Mo vs. ε94Mo plot for enstatite and ordinary chondrites, and terrestrial samples analyzed in this study. Dashedline indicates expected isotope anomalies for an excess in rprocess  Mo,  while  the  dotted  line  indicates  an  s-deficit.These two lines were calculated using the stellar model of[15]. Solid line represents mixing line between terrestrial Moand s-process Mo as measured in SiC grains [16]. The well-resolved s-process Mo deficits of enstatitechondrites demonstrate that the Earth cannot be madeof enstatite chondrites; the data also demonstrate thatthe Earth and enstatite  chondrites also do not  derivefrom a homogeneous inner disk reservoir. Instead theEarth is enriched in  s-process matter compared to  allchondrites  (Fig.  3).  Thus,  no  known group  of  chondrites,  nor  a  combination  thereof,  can  represent  thebuilding material of the Earth, because none of thesecombinations would yield  the terrestrial  Mo isotopiccomposition [8]. In fact, all meteorite classes (exceptIAB iron meteorites) show variable depletions in s-process Mo compared to terrestrial Mo (Fig. 3). This suggests that the building material of the Earth mostly derived from the inner solar system, whereas the meteorite parent bodies represent objects that always werein an orbit beyond Mars and as such contributed littlematerial to the growing Earth. However, given that thes-process  deficits  increase  in  the  order  EC<OC<CC,there might have been radial zoning in the distributionof s-process matter in the solar protoplanetary disk. Inthis case the Earth may have been assembled from senriched material  from the inner  solar  system mixedwith chondritic material from greater heliocentric distances. Due to planetesimal scattering in the early solarsystem, some of this inner solar system material mighthave been transported into the asteroid belt; however,such material has yet  to be identified.  In  either case,due to the s-process-enriched nature of the Earth compared to all groups of chondrites, caution must be exercised  when using  the  isotopic  composition  of  chondrites as a  proxy for the isotopic composition of theEarth [10].Fig. 3. ε95Mo vs. ε94Mo plot for meteorites.
