Since its initial discovery, additional observations have also shown that the lunar atmospherevaries as a function of local time [1, 2], during passagesthrough the Earth’s magnetotail [3] and during meteorshowers [4, 5].In September 2009, Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter(LRO) entered a polar orbit around the Moon. On boardLRO is the sensitive UV-spectrograph, LAMP (LymanAlpha Mapping Project) that covers the spectral range575 to 1965 A˚. LAMP is typically oriented toward thesurface in order to map the Moon at these UV wavelengths. However, LAMP can also observe the tenuous lunar atmosphere when the surface is in darkness,and the column of atmosphere below LRO is in sunlight. These “twilight” observations occur twice per orbit, about 11-12 times per Earth day. In a typical orbit,the duration in twilight is about 600 seconds and the observations are concentrated around the north and southpoles of the Moon (latitudes > 80◦). These periods extend to about 3600 seconds, and examine all latitudes,when the angle between the orbit plane and the vectorto the Sun, β, is near 90◦. We have used such twilightobservations in the past to examine the sparse lunar atmosphere [6, 3, 7, 8].Observations: In 2013, [9] reported the detection ofH2 in the lunar atmosphere. At the time, the detectionrequired the use of most of the data in hand. Threeyears after that initial discovery, we can now divide thedata up and search for H2 variations (i) in local time,(ii) during magnetotail crossings and (iii) during meteor showers. We will also search for variations in Heabundance and the appearance of other species duringmeteor showers, such as Hg and Ca.H2 vs. Local Time: [8] shows how He varies as afunction of local time during the lunar night and examination of H2 at dawn and dusk suggests a dawn/duskasymmetry of 1.7 [10]. We now use the data on handto closely examine how H2 varies as a function of localtime in 1-hour time bins. Because the H2 spectrum ismuch weaker than He at these wavelengths, we selectspectra when the path length is the longest, i.e., whenthe spacecraft altitude >150 km and a shadow height<50 km. This selects spectra with path lengths of 100 to150 km. These binned data have total integration timesFigure 1: A series of spectra (black) from when theMoon crossed the Earth’s magnetotail and best fit models (red). From top to bottom, the spectra correspondto the data obtained from 5 to 4 days before enteringthe magnetotail to 10 to 11 days after. The spectra areoffset by 0.01 counts/s from each other for clarity. Thespectrum obtained when just entering the tail is set atthe zero level. Near 775 A˚ there is an instrumental artifact, near 975 A˚ there is a Ly-α ghost which is mostlyremoved here and near 1216 A˚ there is residual reflectedLy-α light. He is located at 584 A˚, and its 3rd order reflection is seen near 1752 A˚. Peaks seen between 1300to 1650 A˚ are attributed to H2.between 0.75 days for locals times near midnight, andclose to 4 to 5 days at dawn and dusk.Magnetotail Crossing: [3] showed that the He abundance in the lunar atmosphere decreased as the Mooncrossed the Earth’s magnetotail.

tify 53 magnetotail crossings between April 2011 toNovember 2015 each with a duration of approximately5 days. We average the LAMP data in 24 hour periodsfrom 5 days before entering the magnetotail to 11 daysafter. As with the local time observations of H2, we useobservations when the spacecraft is above 150 km, andthe lunar shadow is below 50 km. The total integrationtime for each bin is approximately 0.5 to 1 day.Meteor Showers: We examine LAMP data during meteor showers to determine how the lunar atmospherechanges, if at all. We average data in 24-hour bins centered around the peak day of activity for the Perseid,Leonid and Geminid meteor showers. We restrict thedata to when the spacecraft was >100 km from the lunar surface and the shadow height was <50 km. We useobservations from all local times. The total integrationtime for each bin is approximately 0.5 day.Analysis: We measure surface densities by fitting amodel spectrum that includes H2, He, instrument artifacts (i.e. the Ly-α ghost), and background level. Asan example, we show the spectra and best fit models inFig. 1 for spectra obtained during the magnetotail crossing. Spectral features and artifacts in the spectra areexplained in the figure caption. An error in the codeto calculate the H2 density was noted while preparingthis abstract. This error only effects the calculation ofH2 and not He. Therefore our analysis of H2 should betreated as preliminary. Final results will be presented atthe meeting.Results: Figures 2-4 show our preliminary results. Heis shown in each figure to help guide the eye. While it isclear in Fig. 2 that He increases after dusk, peaks afterlocal midnight and then decreases before dawn, the behavior of H2 is not as clear. In Fig. 3, He shows a cleardecrease from day 0 to 4, similar to what [3] observed asthe Moon passed through the Earth’s magnetotail. H2,however, does not show the same clear variation. WhileH2 does appear high just before the magnetotail crossing, the H2 abundance never appears to recover to thesame value afterward. Examination of Fig. 4 shows thatthere may be a ∼15% increase in He during a shower,but we lack sufficient signal to determine whether or notthere is any variation in H2. We searched the spectrumfor additional emission lines, like those seen after theLCROSS impact (i.e. Ca, Hg), and do not see any evidence for additional species.References: [1] Hoffman, J. H., et al.
