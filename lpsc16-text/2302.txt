ArAR — A SOFTWARE TOOL TO PROMOTE THE ROBUST COMPARISON OF K-Ar AND 40Ar/39Ar DATES PUBLISHED WITH DIFFERENT DECAY, ISOTOPIC, AND MONITOR-AGE PARAMETERS.  C. M. Mercer1,* and K. V. Hodges1, 1School of Earth and Space Exploration, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287 (*E-mail: cameron.m.mercer@asu.edu)   Introduction:  The K-Ar and 40Ar/39Ar dating techniques have been widely employed in the earth and planetary sciences to explore the ages and thermal histories of K-bearing minerals and rocks. The 40Ar/39Ar method, in particular, has proven to be a valuable tool for investigating the impact histories of lunar rocks and meteorites (e.g., [1, 2]). 40Ar/39Ar datasets have helped shape models of the putative Late Heavy Bombardment of the Moon and the collisional evolution of asteroids. In addition, 40Ar/39Ar datasets have been used to calibrate crater size-frequency distributions of of lunar surface regions to absolute time, which are then commonly used to estimate the ages of cratered planetary surfaces elsewhere in the Solar System (e.g., [3]).  However, since the inception of the K-Ar and 40Ar/39Ar methods, the accepted values for a variety of assumed parameters necessary to calculate ages have been questioned and, in some cases, fundamentally changed since the Apollo era. These include: (1) the relative abundances of the stable isotopes of K (39K, 40K, and 41K) (e.g., [4-6]); (2) the decay constants of 40K (e.g., [5, 7-9]); and (3) the ages of common minerals used to monitor 40Ar/39Ar irradiation parameters (e.g., Fish Canyon Sandadine, FCs [9-11]). As a consequence, K-Ar and 40Ar/39Ar ages that have been published at different times or by different laboratories since the 1960’s do not all assume the same values for these quantities. This makes it difficult to robustly compare K-Ar and 40Ar/39Ar datasets to one another and, especially, to other geochronological datasets (such as U/Pb zircon results [8]).  In some cases the discrepancies caused by using different proposed parameter sets can be greater than the analytical uncertainties of the published dates. For example, a 1.000 ± 0.010 Ma (1% uncertainty at 2σ) KAr date published with pre-1976 constants (e.g., with the K isotopic abundances of Nier [4] and the 40K decay constants of Aldrich and Wetherill [7]) would become 1.027 ± 0.010 Ma when recalculated with the values recommended by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) in 1976 ([5, 12]). Furthermore, such offsets are not uniform in magnitude or direction when recalculating published dates due to the non-linear nature of the K-Ar and 40Ar/39Ar age equations. While a pre-1976 date of ∼1 Ma is 2.7% ‘older’ when recalculated to the IUGS 1976 recommended values, a ∼4200 Ma date becomes ∼1.6% ‘younger’ [12]. Figure 1 is a graphical representation of Table 2 from the classical paper by Dalrymple [12] in which this problem was first noted. 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500−3−2−10123Percent Changeλ0: AW58 → λ: SJ77Ka0: N50 → Ka: SJ77λ0 → λ + Ka0 → KaKa0 → Kaλ0 → λOriginal Date (Ma)  Figure 1. An example of recalculating K-Ar dates to move from the K isotopic abundances of Nier (N50, [4]) and the 40K decay constants of Aldrich and Wetherill (AW58, [7]) to those recommended by the IUGS in 1976 (SJ77, [5]). The black dashed line represents changes due to differences in the decay constants (λo → λ), the dot-dashed line represents changes due to differences in the isotopic abundance values (Kao → Ka). The solid line (a graphical representation of Table 2 from Dalrymple’s paper [12]) illustrates changes due to differences in λo → λ and Kao → Ka. The horizontal dashed grey line, representing no change, is shown for reference.  We have generalized Dalrymple's approach and created a software tool to enable the rapid conversion of both K-Ar and 40Ar/39Ar dates from any parameter set to another, and to promote more robust comparisons between datasets published at different times or by different laboratories. We designed the Argon Age Recalculator, or ArAR, to make the process of recalculating K-Ar and 40Ar/39Ar dates as rapid and as straightforward as possible, and is intended to be used by both geochronologists and non-specialists. ArAR uses customizable libraries so that the appropriate parameter set can be quickly selected to recalculate K-Ar or 40Ar/39Ar dates. The end-user may graphically preview the effects of recalculating K-Ar and 40Ar/39Ar dates, making it easy to assess the magnitude of the discrepancies based on their current selection of con2302.pdf

stants. Finally, ArAR tracks all of the values that are used during age recalculations, allowing the end user to export a change log for easy reference. ArAR is written in JavaTM, and soon will be freely available as a platform-independent executable application.  Using the ArAR Software:  The ArAR application requires a Java Runtime Environment to operate, which can be downloaded and installed for free from http://www.oracle.com/java. After downloading and launching ArAR, the user may import data from a delimited text file (e.g., a *.csv file) or create a new dataset from scratch. Once a dataset has been imported or created, the user may select either the K-Ar or the 40Ar/39Ar correction algorithm and specify appropriate values for the K isotopic abundances, 40K decay constants, and/or monitor mineral ages. These values can be selected from fully customizable libraries, or edited directly in the main ArAR window. The user may choose whether external sources of uncertainty (e.g., from the 40K decay constants) are propagated into the recalculated dates, and whether error propagation is performed analytically or by a Monte Carlo algorithm. ArAR allows the user to preview the effects that their choice of parameters will have when recalculating KAr and 40Ar/39Ar dates, and can edit their selections or apply them. Finally, all values that are used for each set of calculations are logged and may be exported for easy reference. The default ArAR libraries contain the most commonly used 40K decay constants, K isotopic abundances, and common monitor mineral ages. They are not exhaustive, but are fully editable so the user can easily save their preferred values for later use. We recommend that all values stored in the ArAR libraries be traceable to the peer-reviewed literature.  Discussion:  In order to fully account for discrepancies between K-Ar and 40Ar/39Ar dates that were determined using different parameter sets, it is imperative that researchers explicitly state, or at least reference, which values have been used when publishing or recalculating K-Ar and 40Ar/39Ar datasets.  Following the IUGS 1976 recommendations [5], several studies have been published that proposed new values for the 40K decay constants and K isotopic abundances. In particular, there has been a movement in the geochronology community to refine the 40K decay constants (e.g., [8, 9, 13]). This is partly because the IUGS 1976 values differ from those that are in use by the nuclear physics community (e.g., [14-16]), and because uncertainties in the 40K decay constants are one of the primary limiters of the absolute precision of the 40Ar/39Ar method (e.g., [8]). However, while some lab groups have adopted newer values, others have not due to the lack of international agreement. In addition, there has been a concerted effort to refine age determinations for a variety of monitor minerals (e.g., [9, 10, 11, 13]). Unfortunately, there is no clear agreement on the ages of some monitor minerals, which can affect the ages of unknowns determined relative to those monitors. Discrepancies between 40Ar/39Ar dates determined using different monitor ages alone can be on the order of a few percent in extreme cases, much greater than the magnitude of analytical uncertainties for modern laboratories. Furthermore, if a monitor with a contested age is used as a primary or secondary standard for the intercalibration of other monitors, there is a trickle-down effect on the intercalibrated monitors and any unknown dates determined relative to those monitors. Researchers should therefore be aware of the intercalibration history of any monitors that they use, and take appropriate steps to account for any changes in the primary and secondary standards when recalculating the ages of unknowns. This can be accomplished through a multistep process using ArAR, first by recalculating the age of a monitor mineral, then using the result to recalculate the ages of unknowns. Finally, it is important to note that ArAR cannot correct for any discrepancies in K-Ar and 40Ar/39Ar dates that are caused by changes in the accepted values for the isotopic abundances of Ar. This is an issue for the 40Ar/36Ar ratio of Earth’s atmosphere in particular since this value is used to correct for the presence of an atmospheric component in K-Ar and 40Ar/39Ar geochronology. It is therefore best if geochronologists follow the data reporting guidelines of Renne et al. [17] so that corrections can be applied as the terrestrial 40Ar/36Ar ratio is refined.
