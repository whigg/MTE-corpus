RADAR SCATTERING CHARACTERISTICS OF CRATER EJECTA OBSERVED DURING THE MINIRF/AO BISTATIC CAMPAIGN.  G.W. Patterson1, A.M. Stickle1, and the Mini-RF team, 1Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Laurel, MD (Wes.Patterson@jhuapl.edu).   Introduction:  The Miniature Radio Frequency (Mini-RF) instrument on NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) is a hybrid dual-polarized synthetic aperture radar (SAR) that operated in concert with the Arecibo Observatory (AO) to collect bistatic radar data of the lunar nearside from 2012 to 2015. The purpose of this bistatic campaign was to observe the scattering characteristics of the upper meter(s) of the lunar regolith, as a function of the bistatic angle, and to search for a coherent backscatter opposition response indicative of the presence of water ice. A variety of lunar terrains were sampled over a range of incidence and bistatic angles; including mare, highland, pyroclastic, crater ejecta, and crater floor materials. Materials that showed evidence of an opposition effect were retargeted on multiple occasions in an effort to determine the character of the response. These included the ejecta of several Copernican-aged craters (i.e., Byrgius A, Kepeler, and Bouguer) and the floor of the south-polar crater Cabeus [1].	 The responses of ejecta material varied by crater in a manner that suggests a relationship with crater age.  Background:  The ejecta of young, fresh craters often stand out among other lunar terrains when observed at radar wavelengths [e.g., 2-6]. This is a result of the relatively high population of cm- to m-scale scatterers found at the surface of and mixed within the deposited ejecta. The roughness signature associated with such a population can lead to circular polarization ratios (CPRs) that exceed unity [3]. The ejecta of several Copernican-aged craters were targeted during the Mini-RF/AO bistatic campaign to search for and characterize the opposition response of this prominently observed material (e.g.,  Fig. 1). Analysis of the craters was restricted to CPR measurements of their continuous ejecta blankets to isolate the response of the ejecta from surrounding terrain - a region that typically encompasses surface material within approximately 1-2 crater radii of the crater rim [7]. Analysis: The data necessary to detect and characterize the opposition response of the crater ejecta were drawn from the S1 (equivalent to total power), CPR, and bistatic angle information of a given bistatic observation. The spatial resolution of the data varied from one observation to another, as a function of the viewing geometry, but averaged ~100 m. The continuous ejecta blanket of a given crater was sampled and its CPR response was plotted against the range of bistatic angles observed (Fig. 2). When available, multiple observations of a given crater were used and the sampled data were then combined for analysis. CPR values were binned in 0.1° bistatic angle intervals and the mean value for each bin was determined. The number of CPR measurements per bin averaged 1000. Bins with < 100 CPR measurements were excluded from consideration.  Fig. 1. Bistatic radar observations of the Copernicanaged craters Byrgius A, Kepler, and Bouguer (left to right).

Results: The craters Byrgius A, Kepler, and Bouguer are each Copernican-aged craters that were observed during the Mini-RF/AO bistatic campaign (Fig. 1). Age estimates for Byrgius A (19 km dia., 24.5°S, 63.7°W) and Kepler (32 km dia., 8.1°N, 38.0°W) craters, based on crater counting statistics, indicate that Byrgius A is younger than Kepler [8-10]. An age estimate based on crater counting statistics is not available for Bouguer (22 km dia., 52.3°N, 35.8°W) but its classification as a Copernican-aged crater [11] suggests it is younger than 1.2 Gy [12]. An opposition response was observed for the continuous ejecta of both Byrgius A and Kepler craters but was not observed for Bouguer (Fig. 2). The opposition responses of Byrgius A and Kepler ejecta lead to increases in CPR of ~30% and 15%, respectively, as bistatic angle approaches 0°. The mean CPR of Byrgius A and Kepler ejecta at bistatic angles outside of their opposition responses averages ~20% higher than surrounding materials. The mean CPR of Bouguer averages ~5% above surrounding materials.  The radar scattering characteristics of the continuous ejecta for these three craters, coupled with age estimates based on crater statistics and geologic mapping, suggest a relationship between the opposition response of the ejecta and the age of the crater (i.e., Byrgius A is the youngest of the craters observed and shows the strongest response). Such a relationship would likely be driven by progressive weathering of the ejecta shifting the particle size distribution of the material toward a size range that an S-band radar is not sensitive to. This realtionshp would then suggest that Bouguer crater is older than Kepler. References: [1] Patterson et al., Icarus, submitted; [2] Thompson et al.
