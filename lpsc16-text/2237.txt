Greenberger2 1California Institute of Technology (afraeman@caltech.edu), 2Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 3Cambridge University, 4Arizona State University  Introduction: We used visible-short wavelength infrared (VSWIR) imaging spectroscopy to survey the spectral diversity of the howardite, eucrite, and diogenite (HED) meteorite suite at 80-µm/pixel spatial scale. This group of meteorites is widely believed to originate from the asteroid Vesta. Our goal in this work is to contribute to understanding the petrologic diversity of the HED suite and the evolution of Vesta by (1) resolving spectral end members - i.e., spectra of the mineral constituents of Vesta— for use in interpretation of infrared remote sensing data from the Dawn spacecraft, (2) locating rare phases that can be examined using detailed analytical techniques, and (3) nondestructively and rapidly classifying large numbers of meteorites, including estimating their modal mineralogy within a petrographic context. Here we focus on results from (1). Methods: We analyzed 11 howardite, 8 eucrite, and 9 diogenite fragments using JPL's Ultra-Compact Imaging Spectrometer (UCIS) (Fig. 1) [1]. In microimaging mode, UCIS collects spectra from samples at 81 µm/pixel across 213 discrete wavelengths from 0.5 - 2.5 µm.  Meteorite samples were provided by the ASU Center for Meteorite Studies, the Caltech mineral collection, Y. Liu, and G. Rossman.   An initial assessment of sample spectral diversity was performed both manually and with a variety of near-automated techniques available in the ENVI software package [2]. These techniques included using a minimum-noise fraction (MNF) transformation to reduce random spectral noise, N-dimensional visualization to locate spectral endmembers within a scene, spectral angle mapping to classify an image using given endmembers, and spectral parameter mapping.  Spectral diversity: We identify four major classes of materials based on VSWIR absorptions that identify pyroxenes, olivines, Fe-bearing feldspars, and glassbearing/featureless materials (Fig. 2). These identifications were validated in select spots in samples NWA 1769 (both fragments), and NWA 6920 using SEM/EDS point analyses.   Pyroxene: Pyroxene is characterized by a pair of broad absorptions centered near 1 and 2 µm caused by Fe2+ in the M1 and M2 sites of the pyroxene crystal structure and referred to as band 1 (B1) and band 2 (BII) (Fig. 2).  Most pixels showed pyroxene spectral  Figure 1:  False color images of HEDs showing spectral diversity.  Pyroxene, defined as having bands near 1 µm and 2 µm with depths > 5%, is shown in blue and red.  Pyroxenes with BI centers near 0.9 µm are blue and band centers near 0.96 µm are red).  Olivine grains, defined as having OLINDEX [11] > 0.3 are shown in green, and other classes, including feldspar and glass-bearing, is purple.  "Ex" points to example grains identified as olivine, feldspar, and glass-bearing.

features (Fig. 1) consistent with pyroxene dominance in infrared spectra of bulk powdered HED spectra [e.g.,3] and km-scale spectra from Dawn at Vesta [e.g., 4].     Interestingly, at the microscale there is significant HED spectral diversity within the pyroxene class (Fig. 1, 3). On the whole, band centers are consistent with previous measurements of bulk HED spectra [4], although there are some intriguing trends that become apparent at this spatial resolution (Fig. 3). The positions of BI and BII centers, which are controlled primarily by Fe- and Ca-content, were calculated using the method of [5] modified to fit the bands using a 6th order polynomial.  Single pixel pyroxene spectra from eurcrites and howardites plot mostly within their two established fields, but the absorption positions differ for diogenites and there appear to be two spectral classes within this field. Future work with spatially coregistered SEM/EDS will determine whether these differences are due to compositional differences, the effects of impact shock, or sub-pixel mixtures of multiple phases. Olivine: Olivine is a rare phase in howardites and diogenites [6] but is visible in several of our samples. Olivine spectra are identifiable by a broad bands near 1 µm and 1.3 µm (Fig. 2), and in many cases appear to be mixed with pyroxene in the HEDs due to the presence of a weak 2 µm feature. A few grains are large enough, however, that they appear spectrally relatively pure.  These grains may be targets for future studies designed to understand whether they are indigenous or exogenous to Vesta [e.g. 7] and/or to test radiative transfer models for Vesta's surface [8, 9].  Feldspar: Feldspar is typically bright and spectrally featureless, although it sometimes has a weak absorption near 1.3 µm due to Fe-substitution which can be observed in the HED samples.  Although feldspar has not been observed directly in Dawn and HED spectral data, it is known to be a major phase from HED meteorite studies [6] and is undoubtedly an important component driving Vesta's bulk spectral properties.  Featureless materials - glass, impact melt, opaque phases: This class is defined by its low overall albedo and weak to non-existent absorption features.  This class represents glass-bearing materials, impact melts, or opaque phases such as troilite and/or carbonaceous materials. Future Work: Future work will include incorporating SEM/EDS results to understand sources of spectral variability at the micrometer scale and placing observations within a broader geologic framework of the differentiation and evolution of Vesta.
