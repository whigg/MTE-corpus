UFG-PUs containnanocrystalline silicates, oxides, metals and sulfides. GEMSare rounded, ≈100 nm across amorphous silicates containing embedded Fe-Ni metal grains and sulfides. GEMS areone of the most abundant constituents in some anhydrous CPIDPs, often accounting for half the material or more[1]. WhenNASA’s Stardust mission returned with samples from cometWild 2 in 2006, it was thought that UFG-PUs and GEMSwould be among the most abundant materials found. However, possibly because of heating during the capture processin aerogel[2], neither GEMS nor UFG-PUs have been clearlyfound.Experimental: Track C2086,22,191 is one of the largesttracks in the Stardust collection. As a consortium we arestudying it with optical, X-ray, electron, and ion microscopies.Andromeda is a 15 µm diameter terminal particle and consists of a large nC pyrrhotite crystal shielding fine grainedmaterial (FGM) in its wake, similar to Febo[3, 4]. However,Andromeda is >2x the diameter of Febo and some nanophasesappear intact, including an object consistent with GEMS inanhydrous IDPs.After keystoning[5], we embedded Andromeda into epoxy,microtomed, and then examined it using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) at the National Center for ElectronMicroscopy (NCEM) at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. We used an FEI Titan TEM with a 0.6 sr EDS detectorfor imaging, electron diffraction and EDS analysis. We usedbeam voltages between 80-200 keV to optimize imaging andEDS. We kept the current < 0.5 nA in STEM mode in order tominimize beam damage, and we used sequential mapping totrack the loss of volatile elements such as Na[6].Observations: Andromeda’s FGM contains sulfides, crystalline silicates and amorphous silicates. Many of the silicatesare nanocrystalline with well defined shapes, i.e. circular, euhedral, and blocky. The embedding epoxy permeated the FGMto make contact with the primary sulfide, which means theFGM is highly porous. In many regions, the silicate nanoparticles are surrounded completely by epoxy and are not connected to neighboring silicates. Often, ultramicrotomy willcut silicate material into shards which can shuffle during thesample preparation, and malleable material can have a weblike appearance after microtomy. In Andromeda, the FGMremains embedded within a sheet of epoxy, meaning that theglass objects were separated and shaped before microtomy.Some regions, especially around the periphery, have vesicularFigure 1: (A) TEM brightfield image of Daisy showing arounded morphology and embedded crystals.

GEMS and UFG-PU in Stardust: Z. Gainsforth et al.amorphous silicate typical of outgassing during hypervelocitycapture[2] and appear to be modified. Volatile elements areretained in the FGM. Assuming excess SiO2 and FeS, the elements Na, Mg, Al, P, Ca, Cr, and Ni are all chondritic withina factor of three except for K which is 5x chondritic.Figure 1A shows a TEM brightfield of a rounded object("Daisy") that contains nanocrystals similar to GEMS in anhydrous IDPs. Figure 1B is an EDS map of the object showingthat the particle is surrounded by epoxy (C, red), not aerogel.Sulfides are present in and around the object. Figure 1C showsthat the object is rich in Mg, unlike nearby silicate material.Figure 1D shows that the object contains both Ni-rich andNi-poor Fe metal grains.The same TEM section also contains an object which appears to be an ultra-fine grained polyphase unit (UFG-PU)containing Mg, Cr+Al, and Fe-Ni-S hotspots. Diffractionshows peaks consistent with spinel plus olivine and/or pyroxene. HR imaging shows lattice fringes throughout the objectso it is mostly crystalline. It is surrounded by epoxy withother silicate material nearby that is chemically distinct. TheSi-normalized bulk composition of the UFG-PU is chondriticwithin a factor of three for Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, K, Ca, Ti, Cr,and Mn. Fe and Ni are 0.2-0.3 chondritic and S is 0.05x chondritic. The compositions are consistent with compositions forUFG-PUs reported by Reitmeijer[7]. For comparison againstRietmeijer[8], we computed the pixel by pixel dispersion inMg/(Mg+Fe), or Mg#, and (Mg+Fe)/Si from the EDS mapand found that the variation in Si content is 6x the variation inMg#.Other phases include kosmochloric clinopyroxene, andnumerous objects which could be polyphase units in variousstates of preservation. Nearly all phases show excess K/Si.Preservation of material: The permeability of the Andromeda FGM to epoxy shows that it is highly porous. Theisolated nanophases encased in epoxy show that it is highlyfriable. We conclude that the FGM is not sintered except inthe altered regions. By contrast, nanophases in Febo’s FGMare embedded in an interconnected silicate web. Previous researchers have remarked that the Febo FGM is primitive, butshows some evidence of alteration or sintering[9]. For this reason, it is likely that the unaltered regions within the AndromedaFGM is more pristine than the FGM in Febo.Evidence for a GEMS: Ishii et al.[10] noted that sulfides mix with aerogel during hypervelocity capture and createGEMS-like objects. Since the mixing is between sulfide andSiO2 (aerogel), the objects produced are devoid of Mg and Fe,and have excess Si. Daisy contains chondritic Mg, no excessSi, and Fe in the same range as in IDP GEMS. It is not possibleto produce Daisy through mixing of sulfide and aerogel alone,but would have had to incorporate an Mg-, Al-, Na-, Ca-richphase as well.Figure 2 shows the measured elemental abundances ofGEMS from anhydrous IDPs by Bradley and Ireland[11].Daisy shows an excess in O and depleted Al and S as comparedwith chondritic just like GEMS in IDPs. Daisy also has Na, P,K and Ti within a factor of ≈2 of chondritic normalized to Si.Na and K are both highly volatile elements. Capture processing heats glass and releases volatile elements that recondense on surrounding material. The redeposition volume isoften larger than the source volume so the volatile concentration is often reduced. Daisy is 3x enriched in Na relative to thesurrounding material, and slightly depleted in K relative to thesurrounding material. If we assume that Daisy is an unheatedGEMS, then the chondritic Na is reasonable for primitive unaltered material. The K is 1.5x chondritic, which is perhapsalso reasonable, but significant K is seen throughout the FGMand the material within a hundred nm of Daisy is 2x chondriticin K. It is possible that a nearby K-rich phase was volatilizedand excess K diffused over the entire region including Daisy.If Daisy had been formed by capture heating then there is noobvious way to enrich the Na and surround it with euhedralsulfides. We conclude Daisy is unlikely to be a capture productbut likely native to the comet. Further, Daisy is consistent incomposition and morphology with GEMS found in CP-IDPs.Ultra-fine grained Polyphase Unit: The UFG-PU showscharacteristics typical of UFG-PUs in IDPs including morphology, composition, and crystal phases[7, 1]. Rietmeijer[8]found that UFG-PU’s show a larger dispersion in the silicacontent than in Mg# and interpreted this as evidence of closedsystem formation. This UFG-PU follows the same systematicswith the silica varying much more than the Mg#. It is thus farindistinguishable from UFG-PUs seen in CP-IDPs.Preserved FGM in general: There are now three Stardust particles that have shielded FGM in varying states ofpreservation. Febo shielded FGM which is mildly altered butmay have preserved remnants, especially of the more refractory components[3]. Iris shielded silicate material containingcontaining sulfides and an enstatite whisker[12]. Andromedaappears to have shielded a GEMS and UFG-PU. While it ispossible that IDP components differ from Comet Wild 2, itseems very likely that many of the components seen in IDPsare also present in Wild 2. For quantitative comparison, thereis still the extreme difficulty of understanding the selective destruction of delicate phases such as GEMS and presolar grainsby the aerogel capture process.Acknowledgments: NCEM is supported by the Director,Office of Energy Research, Office of Basic Energy Sciences,Materials Sciences Division of the U.S. Department of Energy,under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231.References: [1] Rietmeijer, F.
