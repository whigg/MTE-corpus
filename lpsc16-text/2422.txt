Introduction:  Enrichment of Mars' atmosphere in heavy isotopes (38Ar/36Ar, 15N/14N, 13C/12C, D/H) [1,2,3] requires that atmospheric loss to space has occurred [4,5,6]. Removal of Ar via sputtering preferentially removes light isotopes because of diffusive separation between the homopause and exobase regions [5]. That is, the scale height of 36Ar is larger than 38Ar above the homopause, so 38Ar/36Ar is lower at the exobase than in the well-mixed lower atmosphere. Species are lost to space in proportion to their abundance in the exosphere, so as more gas is removed Mars' atmospheric 38Ar/36Ar increases. This fractionation in the Ar isotopic ratio can be used to determine the fraction of Ar lost from some initial state [5,6,7,8]. A better understanding of the structure of the upper atmosphere and the differences in isotopic ratios from the homopause to the exobase are necessary for accurate estimates of the fraction of gas lost. Data:  MAVEN has been orbiting Mars for over a year now and the measurements made by the NGIMS (Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer) instrument [9] have enabled altitude profiles of number density for several neutral species to be produced for nearly every orbit (an example is shown for a few species in Fig. 1). NGIMS in-situ sampling occurs below 500 km as the spacecraft descends toward and then ascends away from periapsis (nominally, 150-170 km). To date, four deep-dip campaigns have been carried out during which periapsis was lowered to 120-135 km.  Measurements are made along the path followed by the spacecraft (across a range of latitudes and local times) in the exobase region every orbit, while occasionally the altitude is low enough that MAVEN is in the vicinity of the homopause region. This coverage allows us to investigate diffusive separation between the homopause and exobase. The precession of MAVEN's orbit changes the location of periapsis throughout the mission. During 2015, NGIMS has sampled the upper atmosphere at a variety of latitudes, local times, and solar longitudes, enabling us to observe the spatial and seasonal changes to the upper atmosphere.  Exobase and Homopause Calculations:  We used two independent methods to find exobase altitudes for every orbit. For the first, we integrate ùëõ ùëß ùúé, where ùëõ ùëß  is the number density of CO2 and O (the two most abundant species in this region) at some altitude  Figure 1: Altitude profile of 40Ar, N2, CO2, and O number densities for the inbound pass of orbit 722.   and ùúé is the collisional cross section, from a point well above the exobase to where this value is 1. Since the exobase is defined as the altitude at which  ùêª =(ùëõ(ùëß)ùúé)!!, we also calculate a scale height and mean free path for each measured density to find the altitude where this occurs (again considering only CO2 and O). A temperature is needed for each altitude in order to calculate a scale height, so we use the 40Ar scale height from fitting the 40Ar number density profile from 180250 km, assuming the temperature is isothermal over this range (shown to be the case for early deep dips [10]). These two methods give similar values for the exobase for each orbit. The atmosphere is well mixed below the homopause region and governed by diffusion above it. Here, we find homopause altitudes empirically by determining where N2 and Ar mixing ratios equal those in the lower atmosphere [1, 11]. Though N2/CO2 and Ar/CO2 will vary as the CO2 pressure changes seasonally, the N2/Ar should remain constant. We extrapolate Ar and N2 profiles down from periapsis to find the altitude where their ratio equals the lower atmospheric value.  We find that exobase altitudes range from 160 and 210 km and homopause altitudes from 100-160 km. We also find that both the exobase and homopause vary with solar zenith angle (Fig. 2) as well as season. These altitudes are highest for solar zenith angles near zero and Ls values corresponding to southern summer. 2422.pdf

These altitudes are calculated for each inbound orbit pass with profiles of the requisite species from 2/11/2015-12/25/2015.    Total Argon Loss: To quantify loss to space, one needs at minimum: the present-day and past isotope ratios and the fractionation factor driving the loss. As sputtering via pickup ions in the exosphere drives Ar loss, the ratio of 38Ar/36Ar at the exobase to 38Ar/36Ar at the homopause gives the fractionation factor applicable to loss from the top of the atmosphere. Though it would be best to use profiles of 38Ar and 36Ar or of their ratio between these altitudes to determine the fractionation, these have not been extracted from the measurements yet. Instead, we use 40Ar profiles and account for the mass difference between the isotopes. The fractionation factors calculated for orbits for the first half of 2015 are shown in Fig. 3. Then, using Rayleigh distillation, we can calculate the fraction of gas lost: ùëü/ùëü!   =   ùëÅ/ùëÅ!!!!, where ùëü and N are the presentday isotope ratio and number of molecules, respectively; r0 and N0 are the initial values; and R is the fractionation factor described above [5]. We use ùëü! = 0.19 (Earth's atmospheric 38Ar/36Ar [12]) and ùëü = 0.24 (Mars' 38Ar/36Ar as measured by SAM [3]) to calculate the fraction of gas lost, 1 ‚àí ùëÅ/ùëÅ!. Values of the fraction of 36Ar and 38Ar lost for different fractionation factors are shown in Fig. 3.  We also run fractionation factors through a more complex model for loss -- a multi-reservoir, timedependent box model that includes many exchange pathways of Ar isotopes [8]. Results of Ar lost from this method are also shown in Fig. 3 (red text). From observed separations between the homopause and exobase, which vary spatially and seasonally, we find that ~80% of total 36Ar and 38Ar was likely lost to space.  This tells us that a significant fraction of the Mars atmospheric gas has been lost to space through time. However, these results may not be representative  Figure 3: The fractionation factor for loss to space of 38Ar and 36Ar as a function of the distance between the homopause and exobase for the same orbits shown in Fig. 2. The corresponding percentages of total Ar loss from Rayleigh distillation (black) and a multi-reservoir model (red) are given.  of a full Mars year or solar cycle. A better understanding of the processes that fractionate other isotope ratios is also necessary for a complete picture of atmospheric loss, but it is clear that escape has been an important process driving Mars' evolution.
