As  such,  extensive  ground-based  and  HubbleSpace Telescope observations have provided a wealthof information [e.g. 1,2] Ceres' surface has a very lowalbedo (~9 %) [2], while the lack of significant absorptions  bands  at  visible  and  near-infrared  wavelengthspoints toward a more pristine composition [e.g., 3,4] ifcompared to many siblings in the asteroid belt (and notably to the large asteroid Vesta). A certain resemblancewith carbonaceous chondrite meteorites has also beennoted [e.g., 1,3,4]. Furthermore, the relatively low bulkdensity (~2.16 g/cm3) implies a significant fraction ofbulk water ice (20-40%). Much of this water could belocalized to a higher volume fraction in an outer icerich shell as a result of differentiation [e.g.,  5,6].  Finally, Ceres is expected to have formed at the dawn ofthe solar system, and thus its surface could potentiallyrecord vestiges of its ancient collisional evolution. Thecurrent  relatively warm surface  (at  2.86  AU the  daytime temperature is in the range 180-210 K), and theinferred ice-rich outer shell, however, have been suggested  to  result  in  widespread  topography relaxationover geological timescales hampering the potential forthe ancient  craters  to  be  retained  [7].  Thus,  prior  toDawn arrival, Ceres' surface was expected either to bealmost depleted of craters (if the prediction of an icerich shell was correct), or chock-full of craters (if theprediction of an ice-rich shell was wrong).Dawn's  observations  have  defeated  both  expectations in ways we were not able to foreseen. Here wepresent  global  cratering  data  acquired  by  the  Dawnspacecraft  and discuss the implications of these findings in terms of past collisional evolution.Global crater record: We have used Survey andHigh Altitude Mapping Orbit data (at  a resolution of400 and 140 m/px, respectively) to perform a globalcrater  mapping. Here we will focus on craters  largerthat 20 km, as shown in Figure 1. A number of intriguing features emerge (more details in [8]).A first important result is the presence of heavilycratered terrains, found predominantly in the northernhemisphere,  although heavily craters terrains are alsofound at low latitudes. This observation tells us that topographic relaxation due to the presence of an ice-richshell  has  to  be  limited.  Furthermore,  an  improvedmodel  of  topographic  relaxation  has  constrained  thefraction of ice to be <30% in the outer shell [9].A second major finding is the lack of larger craters.The largest well recognizable craters are 260-280 kmin diameter.  Although large scale  topography relaxesfaster  than  at  small  scales,  the  lack  of  large  cratersseems at odds with the presence of heavily cratered terrains and the inferred low volume fraction of ice in theouter shell. Furthermore, the smaller asteroid Vesta hastwo  craters  larger  than  400  km  (Rheasilvia  andVeneneia; [10]).Figure 1: Global distribution of craters larger than20 km in diameter. The basemap is a Mollweide projection of a Survey global mosaic. Note the concentration of craters in the northern hemisphere and close tothe equator at longitudes ~180 deg (center of the picture).Interestingly, the spatial density of craters is locallyreduced  by  the  presence  of  the  largest  well-visiblecraters, Kerwan and Yalode (Figure 2). Also, the spatialextent of these low crater density terrains seems to extend far beyond the continuous ejecta.  A preliminaryanalysis of superposed craters to these terrains result inan age younger than ~1-2 Ga. These large impact structures are remarkable in that they exhibit widely different morphologies (Figure 2), despite their similar sizes.At  face  value,  this  result  could  suggest  significantcrustal  heterogeneities  or  that  the  impact  conditionswere different (e.g., impact speed).1281.pdf

Figure 2: A close-in view (based on Survey data)of the largest craters observed on Ceres: ~280 km Kerwan (A), and ~267 km Yalode (C) craters. The latter iscut by the later formation of a large crater,  ~170 kmUrvara (B), which also exhibits a remarkable morphology although it is smaller than Kerwan and Yalode. Images are not to scale. The color map represents a Survey digital terrain model whose range is approximately[-6,+8] km with respect to the 482x482x446 referenceellipsoid.Implications  for  the  lack  of  a  Ceres  asteroidfamily: Many large  asteroids  (4  out  of  14  asteroidslarger than 250 km in diameter; [11]) have dynamicalfamilies. They are the result of either catastrophic collisions (e.g., Themis), or cratering events (e.g., Vesta). Ithas  been  a lingering puzzle  why Ceres,  whose crosssection far exceeds those of all other  large asteroids,does  not  have  a  family  [12].  Our  preliminary  collisional model predicts that under standard assumptions[13],  about  10-12  craters  larger  than 400 km shouldhave formed. These craters are potentially capable toform a significant family (as for the crater Rheasilviaon Vesta).  Earlier  investigations have speculated  thatthe lack of a Ceres family could be due to an ice-richcompositions of the ejected fragments which would notsurvive for billions of years [11,12], but this conclusionseems incompatible with the inferred relatively low icecontent of the outer shell of Ceres [9]. Thus, two scenarios  emerge.  Either  Ceres  managed  to  avoid  largecollisions  (as  perhaps  indicated  by the  lack  of  largecraters), or those collisions happened early on -possibly prior to the late heavy bombardment- and the resulting family(s) are now fully dispersed [14] and thecorresponding craters are altered beyond recognition.The first scenario seems untenable on the basis ofthe expected collisional evolution, thus we tentativelypropose the second scenario as the most likely explanation.Additional insights from Ceres' overall shape: Acloser  inspection  at  the  topography reveals  the  presence  of  a  few  large  scale  shallow  depressions,  thelargest of which measures about 700 km across. This isan  indication  that  large  collisions  might  have  takenplace.  Given  the  high  level  of  superposed  cratering,this also supports  the view that  these collisions tookplace in a remote past, thus compatible with the lack ofan obvious asteroid family. Furthermore,  an  analysis  of  the  topography"power" (topography amplitude as function of the spatial wavelength) further suggests the surface of Ceres isremarkably flat a spatial scales of ~150 km or larger[9],  compatible  with  the  lack  of  large,  deep  impactstructures. Putting the pieces of the puzzle together: Thanksto the Dawn mission we can now put into focus a number of key observations about Ceres. In summary:(i)  The  presence  of  highly  cratered  terrains  onCeres appears  to be compatible with main belt collisional models, which in turn indicates a relatively lowice content for the outer shell. (ii) The apparent lack of large craters (>300 km indiameter) is in contrast with collisional models. However, if one consider the presence of a few large subdued depressions (possible ancient impact structures),and  the  flatness  of  the  topography  at  large  spatialscales, it seems possible that these ancient craters arenow largely relaxed and partially obliterated by subsequent cratering. (iii) The fact that large collisions took place in theancient past could explain why Ceres does not exhibit awell-defined asteroid family. In fact, families older that3-4 Ga are unlikely to be detected due to the significantorbital dispersion of family members.(iv) The largest visible and young craters (Kerwan,Yalode)  are  probably too  small  to  produce  a  visiblefamily,  as  the size  of  the largest  ejected  fragment islikely below or comparable with current detection limits (~ 3 km).
