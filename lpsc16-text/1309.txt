Introduction:  Lunar eclipses, with large thermal excursions on a timescale of hours, provide unique information on the upper few millimeters of the Moon's surface [1]. This study utilizes high resolution eclipse temperature measurements from the Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment to compare the surface characteristics of the large Aristarchus pyroclastic deposit to those of a sinuous rille and mare regolith.  Eclipse:  Data were obtained from dedicated Diviner observations during the total lunar eclipse of April 14-15, 2015. The eclipse duration (entrance to exit of the Moon from Earth's penumbral shadow) was 5 hours and 44 minutes of Earth time. The duration of totality was 1 hour and 18 minutes. Aristarchus:  A pyroclastic deposit with an area of over 49,000 km2 spans most of the Aristarchus plateau [2; Fig. 1].  The deposit displays a range of basaltic pyroclastic glass concentrations and spectral signatures, possibly from mixing with underlying material. Weitz et al. [3], using Clementine data, determined that one of the highest concentrations of glass was located near Herodotus , a bright hill in the northwest region of the plateau and close to this study's pyroclastic region of interest. The plateau is cut by the large sinuous rille Schroter's valley and bordered by the Copernican age rayed crater Aristarchus. Diviner observations:  The Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment is a mapping radiometer on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft [4]. Diviner includes nine detector arrays spanning the wavelength range 0.3-400 m. At 50 km altitude Diviner has a 320 m (in track) by 160 m (cross track) detector field of view. The current study uses measurements from Diviner's band 7 (wavelength range 25-41 m), which provide high signal/noise ratios over the full range of equatorial surface temperatures [5]. T7 temperatures derived from these measurements are precise and accurate to approximately +/- 1 K. This study includes data from LRO orbits 26083, 26085, and 26087 that approximately span local lunar times 0843 to 0903. Prior to, during, and after the eclipse Diviner targeted the western Aristarchus plateau including the area near Herodotus  and Schroter's valley, as well as Aristarchus crater and nearby mare material that is partially mantled by the crater's rays (Figure 1). This study analyzed the Diviner data in two regions of interest (Fig. 1) bounded by: 24.8 N to 27.1 N and 306.6 E to 308.7 E (pyroclastic) 21.2 N to 22.531 N and 312.0 E to 313.0 E (mare)  AS Fig. 1.

[5], the mare surface temperature of 349 K (Table 1) was rising toward a daytime maximum near 380 K. The temperature of the pyroclastic deposit (357 K) was 8 K higher than the temperature of the mare regolith.  1309.pdf

The pyroclastic deposit temperature had dropped by 205 K. The temperature of the pyroclastic deposit was 9 K lower than that of the mare. The walls of Schroter's valley were as hot as 200 K, or 48 K warmer than the pyroclastic deposit mean.   Fig. 3.  Diviner T7 temperature measurements during total eclipse; orbit 26085  Post-Eclipse (orbit 26807; Figure 4): The temperatures of both regions of interest were rising toward their pre-eclipse values.  The temperature of the regolith rose by 173 K from its low during the eclipse, while the temperature of the pyroclastic deposit rose by 196 K. The temperature of the pyroclastic deposit was 14 K higher than that of the mare.      Fig. 4.  Diviner T7 temperature measurements after the eclipse; orbit 26087  Discussion:  The pyroclastic deposit was 8 K warmer than the mare prior to the eclipse. Thermal modeling and Diviner data [5] demonstrate that surface temperatures are strongly sensitive to albedo.  Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera mosaics at wavelengths of 0.566 m and 0.415 m show that the pyroclastic deposit is considerably darker than the mare region of interest, which is crossed by Aristarchus crater rays. The pyroclastic deposit surface cooled more rapidly and warmed more rapidly than the mare in response to the eclipse. The pyroclastic deposit also cooled to a lower temperature than the Schroter's valley walls and the mare during totality. These differences indicate that the thermal inertia of the pyroclastic deposit surface is lower than that of the valley walls and the mare region of interest. The pyroclastic deposit surface likely contains very few rocks. Images of the valley walls expose large expanses of rocky material. The mare region of interest may be inherently rocky, and is crossed by Aristarchus rays that may contain abundant small rocks in the upper few millimeters of the surface. Conclusions:  Temperature differences between the pyroclastic deposit and the mare before the eclipse are attributed to differences in albedo. Eclipse temperature and cooling/warming rate differences are attributed to differences in thermal inertia related to the concentrations of exposed rocks. Due to the short duration of the eclipse thermal pulse, this second result applies to the upper few millimeters of each surface. References:  [1] Hayne P.O. et al, AGU abs.
