Introduction:  Igneous clasts in ordinary chondrites are important constituents to understand early nebular and planetary process of the Solar System.  Alkali-rich igneous rock fragments have been recognized in brecciated LL-chondrites (e.g., Bhola, Krӓhenberg and Yamato (Y)-74442 [1,2]).  These igneous clasts could have formed during impact melting in an early stage of planetary formation. It suggests that the alkaline enrichment has occurred at the asteroid surface by the mixing of chondritic components and alkali-rich components, which were formed by condensation processes for the moderately volatile elements in the solar nebula [2]. To better understand precursor materials and formational processes of igneous clasts in ordinary chondrites, we have undertaken mineralogy and petrography of clasts in Northwest Africa (NWA) 1685 [3] in comparison with those of alkali-rich rock fragments in Y-74442 [2]. Sample and method:  Three slabs of NWA 1685 (M53339-1, -2, and -3) are provided from the Royal Ontario Museum.  We chipped one slab (-2) and made a polished thin section for petrological work.  The PTS was observed under an optical microscope (University of Tokyo), a scanning electron microscope (JEOL JSM6510LA; PERC, Chiba Institute of Technology) with accelerating voltage of 20 kV.  Mineral compositions were determined with an electron probe microanalyzer (JEOL JXA-8900L; University of Tokyo) using accelerating voltage of 15 kV and beam current of 12 nA (focused beam). Results:  NWA 1685 is a brecciated polymict LLchondrite recovered in hot desert [3] (Fig. 1).  Some portions show crystalline coarse-grained textures with olivine and pyroxene.  Other portion consists of fragmented olivine and pyroxene with opaque phases, Fe-Ni metals and troilite.  Chondrules are not clearly identified in the slab.  Almost 50% of the surface are covered with rust, thus we have selected a relatively unweathered region (upper left of Fig. 1) to analyze mineral compositions.  We could not identify heavily shocked features such as mosaicism, undulatory extinction, or darkening under an optical microscope.  Several equilibrated chondrite fragments are identified.  They are crystalline equilibrated chondrites but have slightly different olivine compositions: Fragment 1; Fa27.4-28.8, PMD = 1.6, Fragment 2; Fa27.5-28.9, PMD = 1.5, and Fragment 3; Fa31.0-29.9, PMD = 1.3. Igneous clasts in NWA 1685 have wide range of size up to 2 cm with light-grey color and distinct from the host.  We mainly focus on the large igneous clast (Fig. 1).  Macroscopically, the boundary between the host and the igneous clast is identical.  Under microscope, on the other hand, the boundary is interlocking.  Fine-grained olivine grains (<200 μm) are embedded in glassy matrix (Fig. 2).  Most of the olivine grains are irregular in shape.  Edge of the grain shows rounded shape and has rims of overgrown pyroxene.  Thin shock veins are identified Fig. 1.  A slab of NWA 1685 (M53339-2). We used an upper left boundary portion including the host and an igneous clast (white dotted area, ~2cm wide). Terrestrial weatherd portions are brown in color. Fig. 2.

All of the olivine grains are well fractured but most of them did not continue to the pyroxene and feldspathic glass. Fe-Ni metals are rare in the igneous clast.  Several finegrained globules (submicron in size) are embedded in interstitial pyroxene grains. Olivines in the clast have homogeneous fayalite contents of Fa27.0-28.8 (PMD = 1.7) and are indistinguishable from those in other chondritic fragments in NWA 1685 (Fig. 3).  The matrix composition of the igneous clast is estimated as a mixture of fine-grained pyroxene and feldspathic glass and is almost identical to those of igneous rock fragments in LL-chondrites except K abundances (Fig. 4). Discussion:  In ordinary chondrites, igneous textures are usually observed in impact-melt rocks [48].  Olivine grains in those lithologies are euhedral in shape and embedded in glassy matrix.  Olivine and pyroxene compositions are usually heterogeneous and are different from those in host chondrite relict materials (e.g., Fe/Mg ratios, Ca contents in olivine, and chemical zoning). Olivine compositions in the igneous clast of NWA 1685 are homogeneous and identical to those in LLchondrites.  Abundant fractures are observed in olivine grains, despite interstitial pyroxenes have less amount of fractures, indicating that olivine and pyroxene crystallized in different stages. There are two possibilities for equilibrium process; (1) olivine grains are originated from primary equilibrated chondrite, and (2) the clast formed by a large-scale impact and annealed after shock event.  In both scenarios, olivine grains might interact with secondary low-temperature melt, which destruct interstitial pyroxene and solidify feldspathic glass. Igneous clasts in the LL-chondrite Y-74442, Krӓhenberg and Bohla consist of euhedral olivine, dendritic pyroxene and interstitial glasses [1,2].  They show extremely high abundances of K (Fig. 4).  On the other hand, the igneous clast in NWA 1685 does not show an enrichment of alkaline elements, indicating precursor material of the clast was different from those of Y-74442.  Heavy alkalis (i.e., K, Rb, and possibly Cs) were selectively added as an exogeneous component to the Y-74442 parent body, which were later reworked upon impact processing of the asteroid surface.
