Introduction:  The Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity has been exploring the western rim of the 22 km diameter Endeavour crater since August, 2011 [1,2].  Recently, Opportunity has reached a break in the Endeavour rim that the rover team has named Marathon Valley. This is the site where orbital observations from the MRO CRISM imaging spectrometer indicated the presence of Fe smectites. On the outer western portion of Marathon Valley, Opportunity explored the crater-form feature dubbed Spirit of St. Louis (SoSL) crater. This presentation describes the 430 to 1009 nm (VNIR) reflectance, measured by the rover's Pancam, of rock units present both at Spirit of St. Louis and within Marathon Valley.  VNIR Spectral Processing: Full spectral coverage of rock targets consists of 13 filter (13f) data collections with 11 spectrally unique channels [3]. 55 Pancam 13f data collections in the SoSL to Marathon Valley areas were characterized in terms of spectral parameters summarized in Table 1 (discussed in more detail in [4,5]). Associations between these spectra were quantified through the use of a Kohonen-type self-organizing map (SOM) [6,7] wherein the spectral parameters listed in Table 1 from the 55 spectra were input to the SOM and organized with similar spectral features being grouped more closely on the resulting two dimensional "map" representation. The SOM consists of 5x5 nodes wherein like observations were grouped within the same, or adjacent nodes. Each node has a representative signature and data points are mapped to the appropriate node.

Influenced by width of Fe band Results:  The SOM map created using the spectral parameters (Table 1) is shown in Fig. 1 as a fan diagram, where higher values of a parameter are represented by a longer radius slice within each node. App-  Fig. 1. SOM of relative strengths of spectral parameters in each node of the 5x5 SOM.  Fig. 2. Clustering applied to SOM. Numbers represent spectrum number. lication of hierarchical clustering to the signatures associated with each node resulted in the six color-coded groupings shown in Fig. 2. As noted above the predicted signature for each node might not actually correspond to any data points (hence one blank node in Fig. 2). These six groupings are: 1) Pvt. Silas Goodrich type spectra, 2) Marathon Valley tan outcrop, 3) Athens/Thessaloniki, 4) hematitic rocks, 5) SoSL purple rocks, and 6) SoSL dark rocks. Representative spectra from these groupings are shown in Fig. 3 and images 1983.pdf

of the rocks are shown in Fig. 4. These groupings are characterized by: 1) long wavelength reflectance peak position, convex NIR shape, negative 934 to 1009 nm slope; 2) positive 601 nm band depth; 3) high 535 nm band depth, highly negative 601 nm band depth; 4) strong 904 nm band, positive 934 to 1009 nm slope; 5 and 6) relatively low 535 nm band depth and reflectance peak position.  Fig. 3. Representative spectra of groupings represented by colors on SOM in Fig. 2. Interpretations: The SoSL dark rocks, represented by the sol 4011 Roosevelt Field observation have a negative slope in the NIR and low 535 nm band depths consistent with rocks of basaltic compositions. The "SoSL purple rocks" grouping of Fig. 2 includes rocks examined in SoSL including Lambert Field, Lone Eagle and H.M. Bixby. These rocks have 904 nm bands that are potentially attributable to crystalline ferric oxides and/or low-Ca pyroxenes. The Thessaloniki RAT brush also displayed evidence of a shallow NIR absorption band and elevated 535 nm band depth indicative of the presence of crystalline ferric oxide minerals. At SoSL and on the floor of Marathon Valley curvilinear "red zones" have been observed. Closer examination in SoSL at the Pvt. William Bratton target and in Marathon Valley at the Pvt. Silas Goodrich target indicated the presence of fragmented rocks with relatively strong 535 nm band depths but with a convex shape in the NIR with a steeply negative 934 to 1009 nm slope (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4). As noted in [8], these rocks are elevated in Al and Si and depleted in Fe. The tan outcrop in Marathon Valley has a relatively flat NIR spectral shape. The "hematitic" grouping includes spectra of cobbles observed near the H.M. Bixby IDD target and also of patches within the "red zone" examined at SoSL (the Pvt. William Bratton target). These observations have red hematite-like spectra with a 864 nm band minimum and positive 754 to 1009 nm and 934 to 1009 nm slopes. No representatives of this grouping have been examined in-situ by Opportunity. Conclusions: Fractures in the rim of Endeavour have indicated chemically and spectrally distinct materials from the rest of the rim [9]. The presence of ferric oxide minerals and possible hydration in the "red zones" (indicated by the negative 934 to 1009 nm slope) is consistent with aqueous alteration in these regions including SoSL and Marathon Valley.
