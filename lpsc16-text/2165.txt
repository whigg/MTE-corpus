A distinguishing feature of all of these sites isthe access to large amounts of carbonate deposits [1]and smaller carbonate deposits have been found elsewhere on Mars [2]. Serpentinization has been proposedas a formation mechanism of the Nili Fossae carbonates, including carbonated [3-5] and low temperature,near surface serpentinization [3,6].Serpentinization: The presence of talc followingcarbonated serpentinization has been linked to Earthanalogs in terrestrial greenstone belts such as the Pilbara in Western Australia, where talc-bearing komatiitecumulate units of the Dresser Formation overlie thesiliceous, stromatolite-bearing Strelley Pool Chert unit[7]. If a similar relationships exists on Mars, investigations of rocks stratigraphically beneath the talc-bearingunits at Nili Fossae may provide the best chance to examine well preserved, siliceous organics. This hypothesis is testable at any of the remaining Nili Fossaesites, but here we examine the case of Jezero Crater.Talc-carbonate hypothesis: Two recent studieshave uncovered corroborating spectral evidence fortalc in association with the carbonate at Nili Fossae using the CRISM spectrometer on MRO. Motivated byfieldwork in the Pilbara region of Western Australia[7], Brown et al. [3] suggested talc was present insome locations at Nili Fossae. Viviano et al. [4] thenidentified a spectral signature for talc vs. saponitewhich identified the presence of a talc component andused this spectral feature to map the locations and confine the talc findings to eastern Nili Fossae.Methods: The so-called "talc-carbonate" hypothesis rests on the presence of a 2.38μm absorption bandthat is almost always present when carbonate absorp tion bands are detected. It is hypothesized that becausethe carbonate 2.54μm feature is so often accompaniedby a 2.38μm band, there must be a genetic link between the Mg-phyllosilicate causing the 2.38μm bandand the accompanying Mg-carbonate [3-4]. Figures 1and 2 show example of such spectra. These spectrahave been extracted from the CRISM MTRDR product[8]. No ratioing has been conducted on these spectra.A recent compelling study of the Jezero crater deltanetwork suggested there are large amounts of carbon ate with no accompanying 2.38μm band [9]. We havetherefore conducted a detailed search of the north andwestern delta fan deposits and parts of the northern fanwatershed to determine whether any carbonate signatures with accompanying 2.38μm band are present.Take-away message: In fact, our mapping of thewatershed region and the Jezero delta has revealed sev eral key regions (Figures 1-2) that show evidence ofstratigraphic relations between carbonate and 2.38μmbearing material.Results: We have used CRISM image browseproducts and spectral feature fitting to discriminate between 2.38μm-bearing material and Mg-carbonate thatlacks the 2.38μm band.

shows the north and western fans as mapped byGoudge et al. [9]. The CAR browse image are green inthe presence of a 2.54μm band [10]. A large expanse ofgreen is shown to the west of the western fan, andsome green appears on the western fan itself. However,there is also a region of green shown in the west part ofthe northern fan. We extracted spectra from all of theseunits (including the western fan), and a representativespectrum from Point A is shown on the right of Figure1. This demonstrates that the 2.38μm band accompanies the carbonate 2.54μm band in these regions. Thelocation with the weakest (absent?) 2.38μm band is thewestern fan outliers at Point B, but this may just be dueto the weakness of the overall spectra. Figure 2 consists of two images (FRT 23370 and FRT 97E2) fromthe watershed region for the northern fan, and a spectrum showing that they also possess an accompanying2.38μm band.Implications for Carbonate Formation conditions:  This first mapping of 2.38μm material in mostof the Jezero basin, particularly in the northern fan, iskey to linking these carbonate occurrences to the otherNili Fossae carbonates. We would hypothesize thatsince the 2.38μm material is present in both the watershed and deltaic fan of Jezero crater, these Mg-phyllosilicate-carbonate bearing materials would mostlikely have been transported to Jezero from the watershed, and thus the Jezero delta material likely shares an(carbonated serpentinization [3,4]) origin in commonwith the remainder of the Nili Fossae carbonate exposures. This hypothesis can be tested by in situ investigations by Mars2020 if it lands at Jezero crater.Testing with the Mars2020 payload. As part ofthe SETI Institute NAI team project, this summer weare conducting fieldwork in the north western Pilbararegion of Australia with a Raman SuperCam analog instrument suite in order to test the ability of theMars2020 rover suite to discriminate Mg-phyllosilicates such as saponite and talc. We will report on laboratory preparations for this fieldwork at the meeting.Astrobiological Implications: Following the overturn of their respective magma oceans and creation oftheir primordial seas [11], life began on Earth and mayhave emerged on Mars in an ocean-floor setting [12].The presence of talc-carbonate is consistent with hydrothermal alteration of ultramafic rocks in an oceanfloor setting [3] and may therefore be an indicator ofan astrobiologically-rich environment at Nili Fossae.Talc-dominated terrestrial hydrothermal system. The recent discovery of talc-dominated hydrothermal systems in a modern terrestrial seafloor setting[13] provides another potential mechanism for talc-formation that may be of relevance to early Mars. Theformation and detection of large amounts of talc in thissetting is a timely reminder that our understanding oftalc formation is still in its nascent stages [14].Acknowledgements: This work was sponsored bythe NASA Astrobiology Institute.References: [1] Ehlmann B.L. et al.
