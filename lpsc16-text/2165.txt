Introduction:  The Nili Fossae region is the site of a number of proposed Landing Sites for the Mars 2020 Rover. A distinguishing feature of all of these sites is the access to large amounts of carbonate deposits [1] and smaller carbonate deposits have been found elsewhere on Mars [2]. Serpentinization has been proposed as a formation mechanism of the Nili Fossae carbonates, including carbonated [3-5] and low temperature, near surface serpentinization [3,6]. Serpentinization: The presence of talc following carbonated serpentinization has been linked to Earth analogs in terrestrial greenstone belts such as the Pilbara in Western Australia, where talc-bearing komatiite cumulate units of the Dresser Formation overlie the siliceous, stromatolite-bearing Strelley Pool Chert unit [7]. If a similar relationships exists on Mars, investigations of rocks stratigraphically beneath the talc-bearing units at Nili Fossae may provide the best chance to examine well preserved, siliceous organics. This hypothesis is testable at any of the remaining Nili Fossae sites, but here we examine the case of Jezero Crater. Talc-carbonate hypothesis: Two recent studies have uncovered corroborating spectral evidence for talc in association with the carbonate at Nili Fossae using the CRISM spectrometer on MRO. Motivated by fieldwork in the Pilbara region of Western Australia [7], Brown et al. [3] suggested talc was present in some locations at Nili Fossae. Viviano et al. [4] then identified a spectral signature for talc vs. saponite which identified the presence of a talc component and used this spectral feature to map the locations and confine the talc findings to eastern Nili Fossae. Methods: The so-called "talc-carbonate" hypothesis rests on the presence of a 2.38μm absorption band that is almost always present when carbonate absorp tion bands are detected. It is hypothesized that because the carbonate 2.54μm feature is so often accompanied by a 2.38μm band, there must be a genetic link between the Mg-phyllosilicate causing the 2.38μm band and the accompanying Mg-carbonate [3-4]. Figures 1 and 2 show example of such spectra. These spectra have been extracted from the CRISM MTRDR product [8]. No ratioing has been conducted on these spectra. A recent compelling study of the Jezero crater delta network suggested there are large amounts of carbon ate with no accompanying 2.38μm band [9]. We have therefore conducted a detailed search of the north and western delta fan deposits and parts of the northern fan watershed to determine whether any carbonate signatures with accompanying 2.38μm band are present. Take-away message: In fact, our mapping of the watershed region and the Jezero delta has revealed sev eral key regions (Figures 1-2) that show evidence of stratigraphic relations between carbonate and 2.38μm bearing material. Results: We have used CRISM image browse products and spectral feature fitting to discriminate between 2.38μm-bearing material and Mg-carbonate that lacks the 2.38μm band. Figure 1 shows two CRISM images overlaying a CTX image of Jezero crater, and  shows the north and western fans as mapped by Goudge et al. [9]. The CAR browse image are green in the presence of a 2.54μm band [10]. A large expanse of green is shown to the west of the western fan, and some green appears on the western fan itself. However, there is also a region of green shown in the west part of the northern fan. We extracted spectra from all of these units (including the western fan), and a representative spectrum from Point A is shown on the right of Figure 1. This demonstrates that the 2.38μm band accompanies the carbonate 2.54μm band in these regions. The location with the weakest (absent?) 2.38μm band is the western fan outliers at Point B, but this may just be due to the weakness of the overall spectra. Figure 2 consists of two images (FRT 23370 and FRT 97E2) from the watershed region for the northern fan, and a spectrum showing that they also possess an accompanying 2.38μm band. Implications for Carbonate Formation conditions:  This first mapping of 2.38μm material in most of the Jezero basin, particularly in the northern fan, is key to linking these carbonate occurrences to the other Nili Fossae carbonates. We would hypothesize that since the 2.38μm material is present in both the watershed and deltaic fan of Jezero crater, these Mg-phyllosilicate-carbonate bearing materials would most likely have been transported to Jezero from the watershed, and thus the Jezero delta material likely shares an (carbonated serpentinization [3,4]) origin in common with the remainder of the Nili Fossae carbonate exposures. This hypothesis can be tested by in situ investigations by Mars2020 if it lands at Jezero crater. Testing with the Mars2020 payload. As part of the SETI Institute NAI team project, this summer we are conducting fieldwork in the north western Pilbara region of Australia with a Raman SuperCam analog instrument suite in order to test the ability of the Mars2020 rover suite to discriminate Mg-phyllosilicates such as saponite and talc. We will report on laboratory preparations for this fieldwork at the meeting. Astrobiological Implications: Following the overturn of their respective magma oceans and creation of their primordial seas [11], life began on Earth and may have emerged on Mars in an ocean-floor setting [12]. The presence of talc-carbonate is consistent with hydrothermal alteration of ultramafic rocks in an oceanfloor setting [3] and may therefore be an indicator of an astrobiologically-rich environment at Nili Fossae. Talc-dominated terrestrial hydrothermal system. The recent discovery of talc-dominated hydrothermal systems in a modern terrestrial seafloor setting [13] provides another potential mechanism for talc-formation that may be of relevance to early Mars. The formation and detection of large amounts of talc in this setting is a timely reminder that our understanding of talc formation is still in its nascent stages [14].
