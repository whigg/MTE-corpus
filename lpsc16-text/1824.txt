As  a  consequence  of  the basin-scale impacts associated with the LHB, thermal anomalies  form  in  the  mantle  that  can  modify  the convection pattern and the melt production rate [e.g., 2]. The  relatively  small  thickness  of  the  mantle  of Mercury [3,  4] and the high temperature at  the core mantle  boundary  in  the  early  phases  of  the  planet's evolution [5], imply that a large fraction of the mantle is  at  relatively  high  temperatures.  This  situation increases  tidal  dissipation,  which,  despite  Mercury's small radius, is expected to be significant because of the planet's large orbital eccentricity and small distance from the Sun. In  this  work  we  investigate  the  effects  of  large impacts and tidal energy dissipation on the convection of Mercury during the early phases of its evolution. In particular,  we  track  the  melt  production  during  the early  evolution  with  the  goal  of  identifying  the expected  eruption  locations  on  the  surface  and  the associated depth of the source regions. Impacts: We estimate the thermal anomalies in the mantle  generated  by  large  impacts  using  standard scaling laws [6]. We use impactor sizes between about 100 km and 250 km, which are compatible with basin sizes of 1550 km (corresponding to the Caloris basin) and 2300 km (corresponding to the High-Mg region, possibly the remnant of  an ancient basin,  [7]) if  the impact velocity is in between 15 km/s and 55 km/s and the impact angle is 45°, as appropriate for Mercury [8]. Rheology  for  convection  and  tides:  Extremely different timescales characterize convection and tides. To  consistently  model  the  rheological  response  of mantle materials for these two processes it is necessary to employ a timescale-dependent rheology. We adopt the  Andrade  pseudo-period  model  [9,  10]  which includes  the  rheological  effects  of  temperature, pressure,  grain  size,  and  forcing  period.  The  model parameters are obtained by fitting torsional oscillation data for olivine at forcing periods no longer than 1000 s [9]. We extrapolated the model to longer periods to test its applicability to convection and tidal problems. Figure 1 shows the dynamic viscosity as a function of Figure 1: Viscosity as a function of the forcing period for the Andrade rheological model at T =  1600 K and P = 3 GPa. The baseline model has an unrelaxed shear modulus GU = 65 GPa  and  a  grain  size  d  =  5 mm.  The  other  models  are obtained by varying a single parameter as indicated by the legend.  Additional  parameters  correspond  to  melt-free olivine [for additional details see 9 and 10]. the  period.  At  very  large  forcing  periods, corresponding  to  convective  timescales,  and  for  a reasonable range of parameters, the viscosity compares favorably  with  the  reference  viscosities  commonly adopted  in  convection  studies  [e.g.,  5,  11].  At timescales relevant to the post glacial rebound process, the  viscosity  also  matches  the  value  inferred  from geodetic  observations  [e.g.,  12].  These  findings indicate  that  the  Andrade  pseudo-period  model  is appropriate  to  consistently  evaluate  the  rheological response  of  the  mantle  for  convective  and  tidal processes.  Note  that  the  values  of  the  viscosity appropriate  for  convection  and  tides  differ  by  about three orders of magnitude (Figure 1). Convection:  We simulate  the  thermal  convection of  Mercury's  mantle  using  the  finite-volume  code GAIA  [13].  We  run  both  2D-cylindrical  and 3D-spherical  simulations  using  the  temperature-  and pressure-dependent rheology described above. Impacts are  treated  as  instantaneous  temperature  anomalies calculated using scaling laws. The contribution of tidal dissipation (below) is included as an additional source term  in  the  energy  equation.  When  the  temperature exceeds  the  solidus,  we  assume  all  the  melt  to  be instantaneously extracted to the surface and we set the   Figure 2: Histograms of the melt volume produced as a result of an impact (occurring at 0°) at two different epochs (t  indicates time after the impact). Diameter and velocity of the impactor equal to 100 km and 48 km/s, respectively. Note that  initially  the melt  comes  from the  melt  pond near  the surface (top), while later melt originates deeper in the mantle (bottom). temperature  at the local solidus. Tides: We use the temperature field computed from the  convection  code  to  calculate  the  mantle  radial temperature  profile  at  each  time-step  during  the simulation. The temperature profile is used to compute the  rheology  of  the  mantle  as  a  function  of  depth. Under  the  assumption  of  spherically  symmetric properties of the planet, we calculate the tidal potential Love  number  k2 to  estimate  the  global  energy dissipation induced by the tides, and account for this contribution when computing the temperature field in the next time-step of the convection code. We assume a fully  liquid  core,  compatible  with  the  expected  late initiation  of  the  inner  core  growth  [e.g.,  5]. Accordingly, we assume that the dissipation during the early phases of the planet's evolution occurs only in the mantle. As a first assessment of the contribution of the tides,  we  also  assume  that  tidal  energy  is  evenly dissipated in the mantle. Results and outlook: In this study we revisit the work of [2] by using the post-MESSENGER value for the thickness of the mantle of Mercury (about 400 km, instead  of  600  km),  by  considering  a  series  of basin-forming  impacts  (and  not  only  the Caloris-forming impact), and by including the tides as an additional  source of energy. In the aftermath of a basin-forming  impact,  melt  is  initially  formed  from near-surface  material,  as  expected.  However,  the thermal anomaly associated with a big impact induces melting at depth that resurfaces well after the impact happened (Figure 2). We will present results where we test  the  effect  of  impact  parameters,  amount  of radiogenic  heat  sources,  as  well  as  tidal  energy dissipation  on  the  melt  production  and  depth  of  the source region.
