As  a  consequence  of  thebasin-scale impacts associated with the LHB, thermalanomalies  form  in  the  mantle  that  can  modify  theconvection pattern and the melt production rate [e.g.,2].The  relatively  small  thickness  of  the  mantle  ofMercury [3,  4] and the high temperature at  the coremantle  boundary  in  the  early  phases  of  the  planet'sevolution [5], imply that a large fraction of the mantleis  at  relatively  high  temperatures.  This  situationincreases  tidal  dissipation,  which,  despite  Mercury'ssmall radius, is expected to be significant because ofthe planet's large orbital eccentricity and small distancefrom the Sun.In  this  work  we  investigate  the  effects  of  largeimpacts and tidal energy dissipation on the convectionof Mercury during the early phases of its evolution. Inparticular,  we  track  the  melt  production  during  theearly  evolution  with  the  goal  of  identifying  theexpected  eruption  locations  on  the  surface  and  theassociated depth of the source regions.Impacts: We estimate the thermal anomalies in themantle  generated  by  large  impacts  using  standardscaling laws [6]. We use impactor sizes between about100 km and 250 km, which are compatible with basinsizes of 1550 km (corresponding to the Caloris basin)and 2300 km (corresponding to the High-Mg region,possibly the remnant of  an ancient basin,  [7]) if  theimpact velocity is in between 15 km/s and 55 km/s andthe impact angle is 45°, as appropriate for Mercury [8].Rheology  for  convection  and  tides:  Extremelydifferent timescales characterize convection and tides.To  consistently  model  the  rheological  response  ofmantle materials for these two processes it is necessaryto employ a timescale-dependent rheology. We adoptthe  Andrade  pseudo-period  model  [9,  10]  whichincludes  the  rheological  effects  of  temperature,pressure,  grain  size,  and  forcing  period.  The  modelparameters are obtained by fitting torsional oscillationdata for olivine at forcing periods no longer than 1000s [9]. We extrapolated the model to longer periods totest its applicability to convection and tidal problems.Figure 1 shows the dynamic viscosity as a function of Figure 1: Viscosity as a function of the forcing period for theAndrade rheological model at T =  1600 K and P = 3 GPa.The baseline model has an unrelaxed shear modulus GU = 65GPa  and  a  grain  size  d  =  5 mm.  The  other  models  areobtained by varying a single parameter as indicated by thelegend.  Additional  parameters  correspond  to  melt-freeolivine [for additional details see 9 and 10]. the  period.  At  very  large  forcing  periods,corresponding  to  convective  timescales,  and  for  areasonable range of parameters, the viscosity comparesfavorably  with  the  reference  viscosities  commonlyadopted  in  convection  studies  [e.g.,  5,  11].  Attimescales relevant to the post glacial rebound process,the  viscosity  also  matches  the  value  inferred  fromgeodetic  observations  [e.g.,  12].  These  findingsindicate  that  the  Andrade  pseudo-period  model  isappropriate  to  consistently  evaluate  the  rheologicalresponse  of  the  mantle  for  convective  and  tidalprocesses.  Note  that  the  values  of  the  viscosityappropriate  for  convection  and  tides  differ  by  aboutthree orders of magnitude (Figure 1).Convection:  We simulate  the  thermal  convectionof  Mercury's  mantle  using  the  finite-volume  codeGAIA  [13].  We  run  both  2D-cylindrical  and3D-spherical  simulations  using  the  temperature-  andpressure-dependent rheology described above. Impactsare  treated  as  instantaneous  temperature  anomaliescalculated using scaling laws. The contribution of tidaldissipation (below) is included as an additional sourceterm  in  the  energy  equation.  When  the  temperatureexceeds  the  solidus,  we  assume  all  the  melt  to  beinstantaneously extracted to the surface and we set the 1824.pdf

Notethat  initially  the melt  comes  from the  melt  pond near  thesurface (top), while later melt originates deeper in the mantle(bottom).temperature  at the local solidus.Tides: We use the temperature field computed fromthe  convection  code  to  calculate  the  mantle  radialtemperature  profile  at  each  time-step  during  thesimulation. The temperature profile is used to computethe  rheology  of  the  mantle  as  a  function  of  depth.Under  the  assumption  of  spherically  symmetricproperties of the planet, we calculate the tidal potentialLove  number  k2 to  estimate  the  global  energydissipation induced by the tides, and account for thiscontribution when computing the temperature field inthe next time-step of the convection code. We assume afully  liquid  core,  compatible  with  the  expected  lateinitiation  of  the  inner  core  growth  [e.g.,  5].Accordingly, we assume that the dissipation during theearly phases of the planet's evolution occurs only in themantle. As a first assessment of the contribution of thetides,  we  also  assume  that  tidal  energy  is  evenlydissipated in the mantle.Results and outlook: In this study we revisit thework of [2] by using the post-MESSENGER value forthe thickness of the mantle of Mercury (about 400 km,instead  of  600  km),  by  considering  a  series  ofbasin-forming  impacts  (and  not  only  theCaloris-forming impact), and by including the tides asan additional  source of energy. In the aftermath of abasin-forming  impact,  melt  is  initially  formed  fromnear-surface  material,  as  expected.  However,  thethermal anomaly associated with a big impact inducesmelting at depth that resurfaces well after the impacthappened (Figure 2). We will present results where wetest  the  effect  of  impact  parameters,  amount  ofradiogenic  heat  sources,  as  well  as  tidal  energydissipation  on  the  melt  production  and  depth  of  thesource region.Acknowledgments:  S.P.  acknowledges  supportfrom  the  German  Academic  Exchange  Service(DAAD).
