Such measurements have been made for centuries [1].  Four centuries have elapsed since Galileo first observed Saturn’s rings with the telescope. His acute observational skills allowed him to pioneer fundamental remote sensing photometric techniques simply by watching the Moon rising over a sun illuminated wall in his garden. He noted the fully illuminated Moon appeared darker than the sunlit wall. He correctly inferred that the intrinsic reflectivity of the Moon’s surface was lower than the intrinsic reflectivity of his wall.  Having made this observation he is to be credited with the first reported albedo measurement of the surface of an extra terrestrial object [2]. In the modern laboratory angular reflectance measurements of candidate regolith material are made using instruments such as goniometric photoporarimeters (GPP). An instrument of this type is generally classified as a ‘polarization-sensitive wellcollimated radiometer’; particulate samples used to simulate planetary regoliths are classified as ‘discrete random media’[3]. Background: There are many reputable laboratories around the world that conduct such measurements. Slight differences in samples at various facilities can lead to uncertainty when comparing measurements between laboratories and when applying these measurements to spacecraft results. High albedo surfaces have often been simulated in the laboratory using MgO, BaSO4, or powdered, compressed Polytetrafluoroethylene (aka Teflon, PFTE, or HALON). These materials, while easily available, are not well sorted into particle sizes that are larger than, comparable to, or less than the size of the incident light  used in most GPP devices. Therefore, in 2000, we introduced powdered aluminum oxide Al2O3 as a material that might appropriate for simulating high albedo regoliths in the laboratory [4]. Powdered Al2O3  is widely used as an optical abrasive. It is available in particle sizes that are as small at 0.1 µm to several hundred microns from various commercial suppliers.    We acquired these materials in a wide range of particle sizes from Micro Abrasives Corp of Westfield Mass, USA and the Stutz Company of Chicago IL, USA. Both the GB and WCA designations were previously offered by Microabrasives Corp. These materials have since been measured at reputable GPP laboratories around the world [4- 7]. The product identifications and approximate particle sizes are shown in Table 1.  Table 1. Manufacturer’s Product Identification and approximate particle diameter Product ID Diam (µm) Product ID Diam (µm) WCA 40 30.09  GB 1200 1.5 WCA 30 22.75  GB1500 1.2 WCA 20 12.14  GB2000 1 WCA 12 7.1  GB 2500 0.5 WCA  9 5.75  GB 3000 0.1 WCA 5 4    WCA 3 3.2    WCA 1 2.1     The Al2O3 particulates are supplied in two different particle shapes. The sizes larger than 2 µm (WCA) are described by the supplier as ‘platelet shaped’; those smaller than 1.5 µm (GB) are described as ‘equant’. These morphology differences should be apparent with analysis of  particle packing density and in photomicrographs.     The Particle packing density: We used 13 separate particle sizes 0.1 <d <30 1.5 µm. Five of these were 1.5 µm or smaller. The samples were poured into sample cups of known height and diameter. The cup was gently shaken to flatten the surface and permit settling so as the surface might best replicate a powdered surface of a planetary regolith as viewed by a remote observer. The mass of the material was measured. The void space was calculated based on the density of Al2O3.     The results, shown in Fig. 1, are consistent with the manufacturer’s description. The particle sizes <~1.5 µm (shown as ‘Equant’ in Figure 1 and designated GB) pack together with much larger void space than the particles of size >~2.1 µm (Shown as ‘Platelet’ in 1695.pdf

Figure 1 and designated WCA). This is consistent with the statements  of the manufacturer as reported in [4].           Atomic Force Microscopy: In order to further address questions of the morphology one of us (KV) acquired Atomic Force Photomicrograpic (AFM) images of the samples.  The AFM images were obtained in air in intermittent contact mode using a Quesant Instruments Universal Scanning Probe Microscope housed in the Physics and Astronomy department at the California  State Polytechnic  University at Pomona, CA.  Commercial silicon cantilevers from MikroMaschTM were employed.  Images consisted of 500 lines of 500 points per line for a total of 250,000 pixels of data.  The Al2O3 samples were deposited on glass slides, previously cleaned and coated with poly-l-lysine to assure surface adhesion of the particles to the glass.  Typical results are shown in Figures 2 and 3.    Figure 2 is an AFM image of three typical particles that are identified by the supplier as D=~ 1.0 µm (GB 2000). The three particles also show a range of size about the mean particle size. It is clear that they are equant in character as described by the manufacturer.  Conclusion: This work clarifies any ambituity that may have arisen regarding the morphology of these Al2O3 materials that have been used widely since we first introduced them as high albedo particulate planetary surface analogues [4]. We encourage other laboratory investigators to acquire these materials and measure them for the purpose of inter-comparison of data sets acquired by various instruments around the world. In a companion paper (Nelson et al this meeting) we use these materials to infer important properties of the regolith of Jupiter’s satellite Europa.
