Therefore the Moon affords us a unique opportunity to validate remote sensing datasets. Here we present preliminary results of a comprehensive study to best replicate a simulated lunar environment, evaluate the most appropriate sample and measurement conditions, collect thermal infrared spectra of a representative suite of Apollo soils, and correlate them with thermal infrared observations of the lunar surface. An initial objective of this study is to use Simulated Lunar Environment Chamber (SLEC) measurements of returned lunar soils to "ground truth" Diviner Lunar Radiometer (Diviner) compositional and thermophysical data.   SLEC: It has been established that thermal infrared spectra measured in a simulated lunar environment (SLE) are significantly altered from spectra measured under terrestrial conditions [e.g. 1, 2]. The data for this study were collected in the SLEC at University of Oxford [3]. In SLEC, the lunar environment is simulated by: (1) pumping the chamber to vacuum pressures (<10-4 mbar), which is sufficient to simulate lunar heat transport processes within the sample, (2) cooling the chamber (<100K) with liquid nitrogen to simulate a surface radiating into a cold space environment, and (3) heating the samples from below with heaters and from above with a lamp to set-up thermal gradients similar to those experienced in the upper hundreds of microns of the lunar surface.  We conducted a comprehensive suite of experiments on Apollo soils 15071 (maria) and 67701 (highland) using different sample preparation methods and heating conditions to vary sample surface texture and thermal environment [4]. We compared the results of this broad suite of experiments to Diviner noontime data to validate optimal SLEC experimental conditions used for the remaining measurements. Lunar Soils: Our reference sample suite is composed of bulk lunar soils from two NASA Curation and Analysis Planning Team for Extraterrestrial Materials (CAPTEM) requests: (1) the UCLA Bi-Directional Reflectance Function (UCLA-BDRF; 5 g mass; PI Paige) and (2) Thermal Infrared Emissions Studies Lunar Soil Compositions Consortium (TIRES-LSCC; 3.5 g mass; PI Pieters) shown in Table 1. Diviner: NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Diviner instrument has produced the first global, high resolution, multispectral thermal infrared observations of an airless body. Diviner is a nine-channel, pushbroom mapping radiometer that measures broadband reflected solar radiation with two channels, and emitted thermal infrared radiation with seven infrared channels [5]. The three shortest wavelength thermal infrared channels near 8 Âµm were specifically designed to characterize the mid-infrared "Christiansen Feature" emissivity maximum, which is sensitive to silicate composition [6,1]. The Diviner dataset includes all six Apollo sites at approximately 200 m spatial resolution.  Conclusions: We find that analyses of Diviner observations for individual sampling stations and SLEC measurements of the returned Apollo soils in a relevant environment show good agreement. Similar comparisons between Diviner observations and thermal infrared reflectance measurements under terrestrial conditions do not agree well. These analyses underscore the need for SLE measurements to validate the Diviner compositional and thermophysical datasets.  Table 2: Apollo soils available for this study.
