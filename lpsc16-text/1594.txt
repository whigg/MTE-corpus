LUNAR H2O/OH-  DISTRIBUTIONS: REVISED INFRARED SPECTRA FROM IMPROVED THERMALCORRECTIONS.  J.  L. Bandfield1,  C. S. Edwards2,  M. J.  Poston3,  and R. L. Klima4,  1Space Science Institute(jbandfield@spacescience.org),  2U.S. Geological Survey Flagstaff Field Center, 3California Institute of Technology,4Applied Physics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University.Introduction: There has been considerable interestin the spectral response of the lunar surface near 2.8and  2.95  μm,  where  OH- and  H2O  have  strongabsorptions.  Previous  studies  have  identified  theseabsorptions  with  variable  strengths  across  the  lunarsurface [1-7]. In particular, the absorptions have beenfound to be most prominent at higher latitudes and atearly  and  late  local  times  (e.g.,  [1-2]),  leadinginvestigators to consider a dynamic environment wheremuch of  the OH-/H2O migrates  around the Moon ondiurnal timescales (e.g., [1,4,8-10]).The accuracy of these results are highly dependenton  the  accounting  and  removal  of  emitted  radiancefrom  the  measured  spectra  beyond  ~2  μm.  Currentemitted  radiance  corrections  for  lunar  spectral  dataassume  an  isothermal  surface  and/or  a  predictivespectral  continuum (e.g.,  [11-12]).  These  correctionshave  an  advantage  of  being  relatively  simple  toimplement,  without  additional  models  or  datasets.However, the assumptions inherent in these correctionscan lead to a significant mis-estimation of the emittedradiance.  For  example,  surface  temperatures  andemitted radiance are systematically underestimated inthe  thermally  corrected  Chandrayaan-1  MoonMineralogy Mapper (M3) Level 2 radiance data.To  understand  and  accurately  model  thermalemission from the lunar surface,  we must understandthe  thermophysical  properties  of  the  surface.  Thespatial, angular, and temporal variations of temperaturereflect  regolith  properties,  such  as  particle  sizedistribution and density. These properties  represent  adelicate balance of lunar surface processes that producea highly structured regolith over time (e.g., [13-16]).In  particular,  the  effects  of  surface  roughness  onthermal emission have been recognized as a dominantfactor  in  the  thermal  emission  of  airless  bodies,including the Moon [17-18].  This understanding hascome  with  the  collection  of  more  precise  andsystematic  datasets,  and  the  development  ofincreasingly sophisticated models. The current thermalcorrections applied to these data are insufficient in partbecause they do not account for these effects.As  a  result  of  surface  roughness,  lunar  surfacetemperatures  derived  from  NIR  measurements  willcommonly show brightness temperatures that are muchhigher  than  the  average  surface  temperature  in  themeasurement  field  of  view (Fig.  1).  In  addition,  thebrightness    temperature  will  not  be  constant  withrespect  to  wavelength,  even  within  limited  spectralranges.  Properly  accounting  for  anisothermality  andcorrecting for  this emitted radiance is crucial  for thecharacterization of the 3 μm OH- and H2O absorptions.Methods and Data: For this work, we use a simpleradiative equilibrium model to predict the temperatureof each surface facet [19]. To model roughness, we usea Gaussian distribution of slopes similar to that of [20].This reduces the surface slopes/roughness to a singleparameter (RMS slope distribution), while maintainingreasonable  fidelity  to  natural  surfaces.  Using  themodeled  temperatures  for  each  slope/azimuthcombination  and  slope  distribution,  the  mixture  ofPlanck radiances are calculated in proportion to theircontribution  to  the  measurement  field  of  view.  Theresulting modeled spectral radiance has been comparedwith  Lunar  Reconnaissance  Orbiter  (LRO)  DivinerRadiometer measurements. These results indicate thattypical lunar regolith surfaces are consistent with a mmto cm-scale RMS slope distribution of 20-25° [19].The correction of M3 data using the output of theroughness  thermophysical  model  (radiance  as  afunction  of  wavelength)  is  relatively straightforward.We assume a  Lambertian surface  and  that  Kirchoff'sLaw applies  (ε  = 1 - R).  The examples  shown hereassume  a  surface  slope  distribution  of  20°  RMS,similar to typical lunar regolith [19].Results: The  initial  application  of  the  roughnessmodel for the removal of thermal contributions fromM3 data has a dramatic effect on the resulting spectra(Fig.  2).

corrected I/F spectra show a prominent negative slopewith  increasing  wavelength.  Even  assuming  anisothermal  surface  at  typical  lunar  surfacetemperatures,  the  strong  downturn  is  present.  Bycomparison, the M3 Level 2 thermally corrected dataappear  to  be  severely  under-corrected.  The  modeledbrightness  temperatures  are  significantly  higher  thanthe M3 Level 2 derived surface temperature (Fig.  2),resulting in a much higher estimated thermal emissioncontribution and, consequently, lower I/F values in theisothermal and rough surface corrected data.Diviner  measurements  collected  over  the  samesurface at similar solar incidence and emission anglesare in good agreement with the brightness temperaturespredicted by the roughness model at 3 μm, with a trendof increasing brightness temperatures  towards shorterwavelengths.  The  newly  corrected  data  have  aprominent downturn in the spectral data at wavelengthsgreater than ~2.7-2.8 μm that is not apparent in the M3Level 2 thermally corrected data.A similar pattern is present at a variety of latitudesand solar  incidence  angles (Fig.  3).  The M3 Level  2thermally corrected data show increasingly prominent2.8-3.0  μm  absorptions  at  high  angles  of  solarincidence.  By  contrast,  the  rough  surface  thermalcorrection  predicts  much  higher  brightnesstemperatures  and  the  corrected  spectra  show  aprominent downturn in reflectance beyond 2.7 μm atall angles of solar incidence. This downturn appears atall latitudes, including near midday at the equator.Conclusions: The  initial  results  described  hereshow  that  the  incorporation  of  thermal  roughnessmodeling  can  cause  a  dramatic  change  in  both  theshape and distribution of the ~3 μm absorption acrossthe  lunar  surface.  This  is  likely  to  result  in  asignificantly revised interpretation of its source and theprocesses that lead to its occurrence. For instance,  6,21-22 have identified OH-, with evidence supporting amagmatic source.  Concentrations of OH- and H2O inminerals and fluid inclusions can be high enough to bedetectable via spectroscopic measurements (e.g.,  [8]).Some of these forms of bound H2O may not be nearlyas temperature dependent as adsorbed H2O. The lack ofvariation  in  the  newly  corrected  spectral  data  maynegate  the  need  to  identify a  temperature  dependentformation mechanism for lunar H2O.References: [1] Pieters C.M. et al.
