Introduction: There has been considerable interest in the spectral response of the lunar surface near 2.8 and  2.95  μm,  where  OH- and  H2O  have  strong absorptions.  Previous  studies  have  identified  these absorptions  with  variable  strengths  across  the  lunar surface [1-7]. In particular, the absorptions have been found to be most prominent at higher latitudes and at early  and  late  local  times  (e.g.,  [1-2]),  leading investigators to consider a dynamic environment where much of  the OH-/H2O migrates  around the Moon on diurnal timescales (e.g., [1,4,8-10]). The accuracy of these results are highly dependent on  the  accounting  and  removal  of  emitted  radiance from  the  measured  spectra  beyond  ~2  μm.  Current emitted  radiance  corrections  for  lunar  spectral  data assume  an  isothermal  surface  and/or  a  predictive spectral  continuum (e.g.,  [11-12]).  These  corrections have  an  advantage  of  being  relatively  simple  to implement,  without  additional  models  or  datasets. However, the assumptions inherent in these corrections can lead to a significant mis-estimation of the emitted radiance.  For  example,  surface  temperatures  and emitted radiance are systematically underestimated in the  thermally  corrected  Chandrayaan-1  Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) Level 2 radiance data. To  understand  and  accurately  model  thermal emission from the lunar surface,  we must understand the  thermophysical  properties  of  the  surface.  The spatial, angular, and temporal variations of temperature reflect  regolith  properties,  such  as  particle  size distribution and density. These properties  represent  a delicate balance of lunar surface processes that produce a highly structured regolith over time (e.g., [13-16]). In  particular,  the  effects  of  surface  roughness  on thermal emission have been recognized as a dominant factor  in  the  thermal  emission  of  airless  bodies, including the Moon [17-18].  This understanding has come  with  the  collection  of  more  precise  and systematic  datasets,  and  the  development  of increasingly sophisticated models. The current thermal corrections applied to these data are insufficient in part because they do not account for these effects. As  a  result  of  surface  roughness,  lunar  surface temperatures  derived  from  NIR  measurements  will commonly show brightness temperatures that are much higher  than  the  average  surface  temperature  in  the measurement  field  of  view (Fig.  1).  In  addition,  the brightness    temperature  will  not  be  constant  with respect  to  wavelength,  even  within  limited  spectral ranges.  Properly  accounting  for  anisothermality  and correcting for  this emitted radiance is crucial  for the characterization of the 3 μm OH- and H2O absorptions. Methods and Data: For this work, we use a simple radiative equilibrium model to predict the temperature of each surface facet [19]. To model roughness, we use a Gaussian distribution of slopes similar to that of [20]. This reduces the surface slopes/roughness to a single parameter (RMS slope distribution), while maintaining reasonable  fidelity  to  natural  surfaces.  Using  the modeled  temperatures  for  each  slope/azimuth combination  and  slope  distribution,  the  mixture  of Planck radiances are calculated in proportion to their contribution  to  the  measurement  field  of  view.  The resulting modeled spectral radiance has been compared with  Lunar  Reconnaissance  Orbiter  (LRO)  Diviner Radiometer measurements. These results indicate that typical lunar regolith surfaces are consistent with a mm to cm-scale RMS slope distribution of 20-25° [19]. The correction of M3 data using the output of the roughness  thermophysical  model  (radiance  as  a function  of  wavelength)  is  relatively straightforward. We assume a  Lambertian surface  and  that  Kirchoff's Law applies  (ε  = 1 - R).  The examples  shown here assume  a  surface  slope  distribution  of  20°  RMS, similar to typical lunar regolith [19]. Results: The  initial  application  of  the  roughness model for the removal of thermal contributions from M3 data has a dramatic effect on the resulting spectra (Fig.  2).  At  wavelengths  greater  than  ~2.5  μm,  the Fig. 1. Lunar brightness temperatures as a function of wavelength  for  a  typical  regolith  surface  (Albedo  = 0.10,  RMS slopes  =  20°).  Anisothermality  increases with  increasing  angles  of  solar  incidence  (i).

Even  assuming  an isothermal  surface  at  typical  lunar  surface temperatures,  the  strong  downturn  is  present.  By comparison, the M3 Level 2 thermally corrected data appear  to  be  severely  under-corrected.  The  modeled brightness  temperatures  are  significantly  higher  than the M3 Level 2 derived surface temperature (Fig.  2), resulting in a much higher estimated thermal emission contribution and, consequently, lower I/F values in the isothermal and rough surface corrected data. Diviner  measurements  collected  over  the  same surface at similar solar incidence and emission angles are in good agreement with the brightness temperatures predicted by the roughness model at 3 μm, with a trend of increasing brightness temperatures  towards shorter wavelengths.  The  newly  corrected  data  have  a prominent downturn in the spectral data at wavelengths greater than ~2.7-2.8 μm that is not apparent in the M3 Level 2 thermally corrected data. A similar pattern is present at a variety of latitudes and solar  incidence  angles (Fig.  3).  The M3 Level  2 thermally corrected data show increasingly prominent 2.8-3.0  μm  absorptions  at  high  angles  of  solar incidence.  By  contrast,  the  rough  surface  thermal correction  predicts  much  higher  brightness temperatures  and  the  corrected  spectra  show  a prominent downturn in reflectance beyond 2.7 μm at all angles of solar incidence. This downturn appears at all latitudes, including near midday at the equator. Conclusions: The  initial  results  described  here show  that  the  incorporation  of  thermal  roughness modeling  can  cause  a  dramatic  change  in  both  the shape and distribution of the ~3 μm absorption across the  lunar  surface.  This  is  likely  to  result  in  a significantly revised interpretation of its source and the processes that lead to its occurrence. For instance,  6, 21-22 have identified OH-, with evidence supporting a magmatic source.  Concentrations of OH- and H2O in minerals and fluid inclusions can be high enough to be detectable via spectroscopic measurements (e.g.,  [8]). Some of these forms of bound H2O may not be nearly as temperature dependent as adsorbed H2O. The lack of variation  in  the  newly  corrected  spectral  data  may negate  the  need  to  identify a  temperature  dependent formation mechanism for lunar H2O. References: [1] Pieters C.M. et al.
