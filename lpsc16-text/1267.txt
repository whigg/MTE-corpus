Overview:  Prior to the Dawn mission [1], Ceres’ low density and shape suggested that its interior was differentiated into a rock core and outer ice-rich shell [e.g., 2], which is concealed below a relatively thin rocky surface layer. The presence of substantial nearsurface ice has profound implications for the maintenance of topography, as the low-viscosity of water ice at Ceres’ surface temperatures permits rapid viscous relaxation (flattening) of craters [3].  Dawn Framing Camera (FC) images of Ceres have revealed a highly cratered surface, with many craters that are several kilometers deep. The existence of these deep craters suggests that only limited ice (< 40% by volume) can be present in the subsurface. However, a few of Ceres’ craters are unusually shallow and may imply lateral variability in the iciness of the subsurface. Paradoxically, while the lack of viscous relaxation argues for little water ice, Ceres’ crater morphology (e.g., the simple to complex transition) is otherwise consistent with impact into an ice-rich surface [4].      Ceres’ Deep Craters:  Figure 1 shows the apparent depth (da) of 17 large cerean craters (diameter D > 80 km). We measure da (depth relative to the surrounding terrain) rather than rim depth (d) because viscous relaxation can flatten a crater while preserving its rim (i.e., da =0 but d ≠0). Depths are measured in ArcGIS from the Dawn Survey stereo-photoclinometric (SPC) shape model (horizontal resolution of up to ~500 m/pixel) using a combination of manual profiling and semi-automated areal averaging. The points shown are the characteristic value for the depth of each crater. The large error bars on some measurements realistically reflect the actual uncertainty (which far exceeds the formal uncertainty) in some craters depths, usually due to the highly variable elevation of the surrounding terrain from one side of the crater to another.  Nearly all of Ceres’ large craters (16 of the 17 measured) have depths of at least 2 km. Even accepting the large uncertainty on some measurement, only three craters would have depths of less than 1 km. Four of the craters (Urvara, Yalode, Vinotonus, and Ezinu) have da ≥ 5 km. The crater depths are generally consistent with those observed on the Saturnian satellites [5].  Modification of Ceres’ Craters by Viscous Relaxation: If Ceres’ interior is pure ice, impact crater topography should viscously relax on short timescales (~1 Ma) [3], even if covered by a consolidated rocky layer several kilometers thick. Figure 2 shows the expected present-day apparent depth of 100-km diameter craters with different formation ages as a function of latitude (i.e., surface temperature) on Ceres (solid lines). Depths were calculated from finite element simulations. The craters were initially 4.5 km deep and the simulations were viscoelastic and included all flow mechanisms for ice and time-dependent radiogenic heating [see 3]. For a nominal ice grain size of 1 mm (the grain-boundary-sliding and diffusion flow mechanisms are grain size sensitive [8]) we expect a 100-kmdiameter crater to have da < 400 m within 50˚ of the equator, even if the crater formed within the last 100 Ma. Larger and older craters would have smaller da: less than 150 m for a 1 Ga old crater. Even if we assume an improbably large ice grain size (10 mm), we expect 100-km-diameter craters to have da ~ 100 m within 30˚ of the equator. These predicted depths can be compared to the actual depths of Ceres’ largest craters (colored dots in Fig. 2), many of which are substantially deeper than predicted for a pure ice layer.

(2008) [7], and Tethys data are a fit to White and Schenk (2011) [5].   The Physical Composition of Ceres’ Outer Layer: In contrast to the simple-complex transition diameter on Ceres, which indicates an ice-rich target [5], the preservation of substantial crater depth is inconsistent 1267.pdf

with a pure ice near-surface layer (top ~30-50 km). The viscosity of water ice is simply too low at Ceres’ temperatures. Figure 3 shows the viscosity increase required to maintain crater topography at high latitudes (50˚ ~ 140 K surface temperature) and at the equator (160 K surface temperature). An increase of >100x is required to maintain the topography of a 100-km diameter crater for 1 Ga. This inference is consistent with models of Ceres’ shape, which also require a viscosity substantially greater than pure water ice [9].   Fig 2: Expected present-day apparent depth of a 100-km crater for a pure-ice subsurface composition (solid curves) compared to the measured depth of Ceres craters as a function of latitude (points). Curves are for different crater age and ice grain size (red: 100 Ma, 10 mm; green: 1 Ga, 10mm; light blue: 100 Ma, 1 mm; dark blue: 1 Ga, 1mm). Point colors correspond to diameter range (red: > 250 km; orange: 150-200 km; green: 100-150 km; blue: 80-99 km). Note that because the craters have a range of diameters, they are expected to have a range of depth (see Fig. 1).  Fig 3: The present-day apparent depth of a 100-km diameter crater (initially 4.5 km deep – dotted line) after 1 Ga of viscous relaxation as a function of effective viscosity (viscosity relative to pure water ice).  Increasing the viscosity of the ice layer by two orders of magnitude or more requires the addition of substantial amounts (>60% by volume) of particulate material [10, 11]: either rock (sand/dust) or salts.  Thus while water ice may be present on Ceres, the outer layer must contain more rock/salt than ice.  But It’s Not That Simple! Despite the fact that many of Ceres’ craters are deep (requiring substantial non-ice material to prevent relaxation), Figs 1 and 2 illustrate that a few craters are unusually shallow. The 131-km diameter crater Coniraya has da ~ 500 m (and could be consistent with da = 0). The crater is especially notable because the deep crater Vinotonus (da ~ 5 km) is just 200 km to its east (Fig 4). Both craters qualitatively appear similar in age.  The substantial difference in crater depth indicates either a different formation process or different modification history, both of which could be consistent with lateral variations in material properties (although different impact energies may also play a role). Notably, [11] has shown that relatively small differences in the particulate content of ice/sand mixtures can cause profound differences in rheological behavior near the transition between “jammed” behavior and regular viscous flow. Thus a 5-10% decrease in particulate content (i.e., an increase in ice) might lead to viscous relaxation of Coniraya, while Vinotonus’ topography is maintained. Lateral heterogeneity in composition may also explain several other indications (the crater Kerwan) that viscous relaxation has, in fact, occurred on Ceres.
