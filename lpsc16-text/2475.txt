Introduction:  Meteorites falling in Antarctica are captured in ice and stored until the glacial flow transports them to the surface where they can be collected.  Prior to collection, they are altered during interactions between the rock, the cryosphere, and the hydrosphere.  The purpose of this study is to characterize the stable isotope values of terrestrial, secondary carbonate minerals from Ordinary Chondrite (OC) meteorites collected in Antarctica.  This facilitates better understanding of terrestrial weathering in martian meteorites as well as mechanisms for weathering in cold, arid enivronments as an analog to Mars.  OC samples were selected for analysis based upon size and collection proximity to known martian meteorites. They were also selected based on petrologic type (3+) such that they were likely to be carbonate-free before falling to Earth [1] Methodology: Four (4) different OCs were analyzed from two Antarctic collection regions. The meteorites analyzed were RBT 04149, RBT 04298,  ALH77214, and ALH 77299. The samples were gently crushed to a size < 750 µm.  Each sample of ~0.5g was reacted with 1.5-2.0 ml of H3PO4 at 30°C and 150°C. CO2 was extracted at three different steps: 1) Rx0 after 1 hr. at 30°C; 2) Rx1 after 18 hrs. at 30°C, and 3) Rx2 after 3 hrs. at 150°C.  This follows prior stepped extraction techniques [2, 3] but applied to Antarctic OCs. The extracted CO2 was then purified using a TRACE GC with a Restek HayeSep Q 80/100 6' 2mm stainless column. Figure 1 demonstrates that substantial other gases were successfully separated from the CO2 during the GC purification process.   Figure 1: Separation of CO2 (3.77 min) from other gasses (13.45 min), using GC The extraction process was validated using calcite standards of known δ13C and δ18O values in 20 test runs reacted at 30°C.  All of the calcite standards demonstrated 100% yield following the 18 hours extraction.  The CO2 isotopic values were then measured using a Thermo MAT 253 IRMS in Dual Inlet mode.  The extraction process was next performed on a Greenland IV siderite reacted at 150°C in 12 test runs to determine its δ13C and δ18O values.  With the known isotopic values of both a calcite and a siderite, specific amounts of each carbonate standard were added to a carbonate-free terrestrial Hawaiian Island Basalt (HIB) to test the stepped extraction technique with a mixed carbonate/silicate sample.  Upon completion of 40 test runs the results indicated a 2σ error for δ13C = ±0.694‰ and δ18O = ±0.738‰. Results: The OC analyses yielded CO2 that was released in each reaction step at both temperatures.  A clear difference in δ18O could be observed between CO2  released at 30°C (1 hour and 18 hour reaction time), and CO2 released at 150°C (3 hour reaction time).  The overall range in δ13C values is small (+2 to +8‰), but δ18O values range from +4‰ to +32‰ with the CO2  released in the 150°C step (Rx2) consistently having the lowest δ18O values.  Discussion: Results for each Ca-rich extraction (30°C) vary by region in Antarctica where the OC is collected.  The RBT site (Roberts Massif) is located at W177°06' S85°32'6" near the Queen Maud range of the Transantarctic Mountains inland towards the South Pole.  Figure 2 reflects the δ13C and δ18O values for CO2 extracted from two OCs collected at RBT.  Figure 2: Results for OC collected from RBT The ALH (Allan Hills) site is located approximately 650 miles southeast of the RBT site, near the Scott coast, the Odell Glacier, and the Prince Albert Mountains at aprroximately E159°06' S76°38'.  Figure 3 reflects the δ13C and δ18O values for CO2 extracted from two OCs collected at ALH. 2475.pdf

 Figure 3: Results for OC collected from ALH   If the results are averaged and graphed by collection site, then regional differences can be observed.  The RBT Ca-rich values are heavier in δ18O than the ALH samples, but it is unclear if there is a regional variability in Ca-rich δ13C due to the large error bars.  The Fe-rich/Mg-rich carbonate releases CO2 (at 150°C) that is lighter in both δ13C and δ18O than the CO2 from the Ca-rich carbonate, and it does not seem to vary based on collection location (Fig 4).  Figure 4: Results for OC collected at ALH  & RBT Prior studies and the data collected in this study show that calcite reaction kinetics will yield 100% of sample CO2 after 18 hr at 30°C, however Fe-rich and Mg-rich carbonates will largely not react [2]. It is thus expected that the the first two reaction steps (Rx0, Rx1) at 30°C release CO2  from Ca-rich carbonates, while the final step (Rx2) would release CO2  from either Fe-rich or Mg-rich carbonates.  Future analysis of these OC samples using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and/or Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) will attempt to identify the specific carbonate phases present.  The isotope values measured in this study indicate that two chemically and isotopically distinct secondary carbonate populations exist in these samples. This is a new observation enabled by the use of the stepped analysis technique, performed here for the first time on these samples. The data are consistent with most of the previously reported data  and may now explain some of the variation observed between the studies [4-6]. The carbon isotope values in both populations are consistent with carbonate formation at -10°C in equilibrium with atmospheric CO2 of δ13C= -7‰ [7], but the δ18O values indicate that the OC carbonate species formed under a wide range of temperatures. All carbonate δ18O values are consistently heavier than what would be expected if formed in equilibrium with melted ice in Antarctica of δ18O<-40‰ [7].  One possible explanation is that the secondary carbonates (especially the Ca-rich carbonates) are not formed in equilibrium with Antartic melt water, but from atmospheric CO2 (with δ18O ≈ +41‰ [8] with seasonal and geographic variability of < 4‰ [9]). The possibility that these terrestrial, secondary carbonates are atmospherically dominated in both δ13C and δ18O suggest that they formed from very small volumes of liquid water, possibly small water films.  Atmospheric CO2  raises the δ18O of the water film  through equilibration. This may be a good analog for carbonate formation on Mars where Δ17O values  indicate that the carbonates are atmospherically dominated [10] and where it is likely that liquid water may only exist in small films. Thus, martian carbonates in the martian meteorites may have been formed in a low water-rock ratio formation environment similar to the one experienced by the OCs collected in Antarctica. Conclusions: This data demonstrates that two distinct species (Ca-rich and Fe-rich/Mg-rich) of terrestrial carbonates form on OC meteorites collected in Antarctica, with a regional variation in δ18O.  Both the δ13C and δ18O values suggest atmospheric CO2 dominates this carbonate formation, and these Antarctic formation processes could be an analog for carbonate formation on Mars.
