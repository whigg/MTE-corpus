In Situ Sr Isotope Analyses of Plagioclase: An Effective Tool in Undertsanding Lunar Magmatic Evolution.  A. Simonetti1 and C. R. Neal1, 1Dept. Civil & Env. Eng. & Earth Sciences, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556, USA (Antonio.Simonetti.3@nd.edu; neal.1@nd.edu)  Introduction:  A laser ablation (LA)-MC-ICP-MS method was first developed for in situ 87Sr/86Sr determinations in plagioclase with <1000 ppm Sr [1,2], and later refined and applied to other magmatic minerals, such as apatite and carbonate [3], clinopyroxenes from mantle peridotites [4], and plagioclase with <1000 ppm Sr (e.g., [5]). The University of Notre Dame hosts the Midwest Isotope and Trace Element Research Analytical Center (MITERAC), which houses a Nu Plasma II multicollector (MC)-ICP-MS coupled with a NWR193 Excimer laser ablation (LA) unit. The versatile detector array of the Nu Plasma II allows for in situ 87Sr/86Sr ratios to be determined as all the significant interferences can be measured and corrected for [3-8]. Table 1 shows all potential interferences in determining 87Sr/86Sr isotopic ratios via LA-MC-ICP-MS (adapted from [3,6-8]). Here, we focus on determining Sr isotopic compositions from plagioclase, which contains low abundances of Fe, Zn, REE, and Hf, meaning that interferences reported for these elements will be negligible, although the invariant ratios need to be constantly monitored to insure this is the case (cf. [3]). In fact, Vroon et al. [8] concluded that plagioclase represents a reliable material for Sr isotope analysis by LA-MCICP-MS because Rb levels are usually low (<0.5 ppm) and Sr abundances are relatively high (>150 ppm), which results in low Rb/Sr ratios (<0.05).  The major interferences that could affect Sr isotopic determinations in plagioclase by MC-LA-ICP-MS are highlighted in red in Table 1. These are isobaric interferences from Kr (contamination in the Ar gas) and Rb, possibly from doubly charged REE, and CaCa dimers. Oxide, doubly charged ion, and dimer interferences can be minimized through careful tuning of the machine prior to analysis, as well as through analysis of known reference materials; the only potential major oxide interference could be ArO3 (Table 1). Argide interferences have proven to be negligible because, if present, they involve only the minor Ca isotopes. For this method, the corrections include: the monitoring of 85Rb ion signal in order to correct for the 87Rb; any interferences from 84Kr, 86Kr and ArO3 can be eliminated with a 30 s on-peak baseline measurement prior to ablation, and monitoring of doubly charged REE ion signals at half-mass positions with additional Faraday detectors (e.g., [6,8,9]). In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the LA-MC-ICP-MS method employed in this study for determining the Sr isotopic compositions in plagioclase, a pilot study was conducted using terrestrial plagioclases from the Detroit Seamount (HawaiianEmperor Seamount chain, NW Pacific). These plagioclases are similar in composition to those in lunar samples (e.g., Detroit plagioclases = An89-82 compared to An95-80 in the most lunar samples), Rb and Sr contents are ≤ 0.5 ppm and ≤ 300 ppm, respectively (both being similar to lunar plagioclases). Preliminary Terrestrial Plagioclase Data: We report the in-situ Sr isotope ratios for plagioclase phenocrysts from various basaltic units at Detroit Seamount Site 1203 (Ocean Drilling Program). Optical and ompositional zonation is seen in most of the phenocrysts (Fig. 1). The plagioclases exhibit a limited variation in An (0.81-0.88). Whole-rock (87Sr/86Sr)I for the ~76 Ma Site 1203 basalts range from 0.703025 to 0.703204 [10]. Many of the plagioclase crystals analyzed via LA-MC-ICP-MS show isotopic disequilibri Table 1: List of potential interferences when determining Sr isotopes in plagioclase by LA-MC-ICP-MS. Those highlighted in red are the most serious interferences that must be monitored and corrected for (if needed).  Fig. 1.

um with the whole rock from the two flow units analyzed (Fig. 2). From Unit 3 at Site 1203, all analyzed plagioclase crystals have more radiogenic 87Sr/86Sr signatures than the whole-rock (Fig. 2a) - obviously more crystals need to be analyzed to reveal the full range of 87Sr/86Sr compositions. Plagioclases from Unit 11 are both more and less radiogenic that the wholerock composition (Fig. 2b). Lunar Plagioclase Sr Isotope Data - 12038. Apollo 12 basalts 12038 is a 746 g aluminous mare basalt (~12.5 wt.% Al2O3, e.g., [11,12]) with abundant plagioclase crystals (~44 modal% [13,14]). Plagioclases reach several mm in length with an average grain size of 0.6 mm [13]. Nine plagioclase crystals were analyzed from sample 12038 using a specially prepared to be 100 µm thick thin section (,254). A spot size of 150 µm, an energy density of ~11 mJ, and a repetition rate of 10 Hz were employed. The carrier gas was He that was mixed with Ar via a DSN-100 desolvating system before entering the torch. Results of the analyses are presented in Fig 3 and age corrected to 3.35 Ga [16] using a decay constant of 1.3968 ×	 10-11 Ga-1 [17]. The LA-MC-ICP-MS I(Sr) data presented here are compared with the ID-TIMS data from 12038 plagioclases [12,16]. Eight out of the nine LAMC-ICP-MS analyses are within error of the ID-TIMS data (Fig. 3). Corrections for 87Rb on 87Sr are only significant for one analysis and the corrections have been made on the basis of  85Rb/87Rb ratios measured on the Nu Plasma II MC-ICP-MS. Summary. The data presented here demonstrated that in situ Sr isotope determination in plagioclase is a valid tool for exploring the petrogenesis of both terrestrial and lunar igneous rocks. The 12038 data still contain relatively large errors, but slight modifications to the sampling protocol will be made to reduce these. Errors on the Detroit Seamount data are smaller because crystals were large and specific zones could be manually ratsered with the laser. Variations in Sr isotopes ratios across and between plagioclase crystals from lunar samples can now be explored using the method described here.  References: [1] Davidson J.P. et al.
