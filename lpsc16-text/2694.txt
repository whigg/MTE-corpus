Introduction: The surface of Titan records the influence of external and internal forces from the thick and dynamic atmosphere, impactors, rainfall and erosion and internal heat transport. The effects of the last are masked by extensive erosion and movement of sands and other particulates, but some evidence is present in the form of possible cryovolcanoes [1,2], variations in the global shape from ellipsoidal [3,4] and the many mountains found across the globe [5]. Mountains on Titan are features of significant topographic relief that rise above the adjacent base level and occur in a variety of morphologies [5]. While impact crater rims are from external processes [6], other mountains exist because internal forces helped liberate them from base level through uplift, downdropping or volcanic extrusion, exposing them to subsequent erosion [7]. Sharp peaks with steep slopes and significant relief are present in the dominantly water ice (with organics) mountains of Titan [5,8,9]. Such landforms can indicate the presence of resistant materials exposed to erosion through tectonism. When paired with longwavelength topographic rises, this may reveal zones of active tectonism. We seek to find the highest point on Titan through a combined study of the tallest peaks with the highest regional base level from a global topographic map [4] to reveal active lithospheric zones on Titan. Radarclinometry for height: Water ice (plus organics) is weak when present as broad and extensive loads, flowing and deforming [2]. However, smaller features are able to support steep slopes and high peaks [5]. Peaks are visible to Cassini SAR as bright when facing the instrument and dark on the away-facing slopes, enabling use of radarclinometry, or shapefrom-shading, to find peak heights (Fig. 1). A slope is assumed from the expected SAR return for mountain materials and a resultant height calculated [5]. A cosine relationship is used for all mountains with a correction for resolution-related underestimation of bright slopes (causing the “lean” in Fig. 1); the dark slope is applied to both slopes, assuming symmetry. This method is preferred for finding short-wavelength (<25 km) peak heights because of the superiority of coverage, compared with DEMs, and resolution, compared with altimetry and SARTopo, a means of obtaining elevation from overlapping SAR beams [10]. SARTopo has high utility, especially over long distances, but it has limited coverage and does not have the resolution (170 m) of radarclinometry that is critical to assessing short, small peaks. While just over 200 features have been measured so far on Titan, high elevations were targeted by searching for the widest bright/dark pairs, indicative of high elevations (a strategy corroborated by measurements). We compare these measurements with the global topographic map created from Cassini SAR altimetry and SARTopo, corrected to reference the geoid [3] rather than the 2575 km spheroid [4].   Fig. 1. Profile of Ridge 2 from T43, right “lean” from underestimating bright slopes.  Peak Heights:  From SAR swaths at a range of locations across Titan (<50% global coverage), 216 mountain peaks were measured using radarclinometry. These (targeted high) peaks, measured from local base level at mountain margins, range in height from 325 m to 3313 m, with a mean of 1224 m and a SD of 622 m. Local 90th percentile slopes reach 30°. These features are distributed across Titan (Plate 1) and are found in a variety of settings. Many of the highest peaks are found at the equatorial ridge belts, where long, arcuate mountain chains are theorized to have formed by contractional tectonism (Fig. 2) [11,12]. These sit generally above the geoid on a global topographic high [7] (Plate 1). This in addition to the arcuate morphology and steep, high peaks argue for formation by recent contractional tectonism centered at the sub-Saturnian equatorial point [7,11,12].  Fig. 2. Mountain ridge belts centered on 10°S, 210°W.   High peaks are also found in Xanadu, where erosion has significantly degraded the region. This area is proposed to have undergone mountain-forming contraction followed by extension and valley formation 2694.pdf

[13]. As revealed by global topography, Xanadu currently resides in a global low [14] (Plate 1). Contraction has been replaced by extension or regional downsagging, perhaps from basal crustal flow [13,2].  The Highest Point: The highest point on Titan found so far is not in the equatorial mountain ridge belts (Fig. 2), though some are close; a peak with relief of 2808 m is added to the local base level, which is 238 m above the geoid [3] to attain an elevation of 3176 m. Nor is it in Xanadu – peaks have significant relief but are lower than base level [13]; one with relief of 3068 m is found at an elevation of 3009 m. It is not at Doom Mons, a postulated cryovolcano with a relief of 1450 m that has an elevation of 1360 m. Rather, the highest elevation is found at one of three contiguous ridges, the Mithrim Montes, in the T43 swath NW of Xanadu at 2°S 127°W (Fig. 3; Plate 1). They are modeled as long-wavelength folds [15] and reside just above the geoid; one peak with relief of 3313 m has an elevation of 3337 m.  Discussion: The highest point known so far on Titan is on a peak that is on a slight global topographic high and it bears evidence of originating by tectonism [15]. Additionally, the significant heights and continuity and preservation of the ridges argue for relative youth; the same is true for the equatorial ridge belts. Though there are many differences between Mithrim Montes, the ridge belts and Xanadu mountains, the highest peak elevations are all quite close to 3000 m, which may evidence deformational constraints on the lithosphere. Further measurements of peaks will be done, especially where the global topography compels.  Fig. 3. Mithrim Montes on Titan, w/elevations a.b.l.   References: [1] Lopes et al.
