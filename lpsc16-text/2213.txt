 SHARAD Reflectors And Marker Beds: Unlocking The Climate Record Of The North Polar Layered Deposits, Mars.  D. Lalich1 and J. W. Holt1, 1University of Texas Institute for Geophysics, del729@austin.utexas.edu   Introduction:  The North Polar Layered Deposits (NPLD) are a formation of nearly pure water ice [1] up to 2 km thick and roughly centered on the north pole, in the Planum Boreum region of Mars. The Shallow Radar (SHARAD) instrument on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) has detected many sub-parallel reflectors within the NPLD [2]. The exact cause of these reflecors is a matter of debate, but they are thought to result from variations in dust content with depth [2]. This variation has been linked to orbital and insolation cycles, implying that the NPLD could be used as a climate record for the late Amazonian [3, 4, 5]. In general, radar reflections are caused by abrupt changes in permittivity. However, the exact nature of these changes in the NPLD remains unclear. Without detailed knowledge of the layer structure responsible for reflectors, the climate record of the NPLD is difficult to utilize. One hypothesis for the source of reflectors involves the so-called "marker beds" identified in outcrop stratigraphy [5, 6]. Marker beds are thin layers characterized primarily by their resistance to erosion, which implies that they have a different composition than the surrounding ice. Previous research has failed to conclusively link marker beds to radar reflectors, but has shown that such a link is plausible [6]. In this work, we test the hypothesis that marker beds can produce reflections as observed by SHARAD. We have measured and mapped the reflectivity of three subsurface reflectors, and compared the results to a thin layer reflection model that approximates marker beds within the NPLD. We find that the model is able to reproduce measured reflectivities, but due to non-unique solutions we can not place strict contstraints on layer properties. However, with additional constraints, these results could allow us to track relative changes in layer thickness or dust content within and between reflectors.   Figure 1: Expanded portion of SHARAD radargram FPA_1716901000, located in the saddle region of the NPLD, with the analyzed reflectors shown in color. Data: Radar data were acquired using the SHARAD instrument on MRO. SHARAD is an orbital radar sounder that uses an 85 Œºs chirped pulse centered at 20 MHz with a 10 MHz bandwidth. It has a crosstrack resolution of 3-6 km and an along-track resolution of 0.3-1 km achieved using synthetic aperture processing [7]. It has a nominal vertical resolution of 8.4 m in water ice.  Three reflectors were mapped near the surface in the "saddle region" of the NPLD connecting Gemina Lingula to the main lobe (Fig. 1). Between ~15,000 and 40,000 radar traces were mapped for each reflector. Measuring Reflectivity:  Reflectivity for each reflector was measured using a method similar to that of Lauro et al. [8]. By assuming a lossless medium, equal surface and subsurface roughness, and zero degree slopes, reflectivity can be calculated using the ratio of the power reflected by a subsurface reflector to the power reflected at the surface. The total power reflectivity of the surface is calculated assuming a surface of pure water ice. Surface reflectivity (Rs) is inserted into Equation 1 below, along with the reflected power at the surface (Ps) and subsurface (Pss) to calculate the reflectivity of the subsurface reflector (Rss).  ùëÖ!! = !!! !! !! !!!! !                               (1)  Marker Bed Model: Marker beds are thinner than SHARAD's vertical resolution, and thus can not be modeled as simple interfaces [9]. Instead, we use a model from MacGregor et al. [10] to approximate a thin layer reflection.   ùëÖ = ùëü!" + ùë°!"ùëü!"ùë°!" !!!!!!! !!!!"!!"!!!!!!! !         (2)  Here, r and t are the complex Fresnel amplitude reflection coefficients at each interface, k1 is the propagation constant in the thin layer, and Œ¥ is the thickness of that layer. The first subscript of r and t refers to the medium through which the wave is currently travelling, while the second subscript denotes the medium the wave is travelling into. While in principal the materials surrounding the thin layer do not have to be the same, we assume a dust-ice mixture between two layers of nearly pure ice. Using this model, we can determine reflectivity for the full parameter space of layer thickness and dust content.  Results: Mapped reflectivities for a single subsurface reflector are shown in Figure 2. SHARAD reflectivity is not homogeneous within individual reflectors, and patterns do not repeat between reflectors, implying that local climate conditions play an important role in reflectivity. This could impact the NPLD's usefulness as a global climate record. It also hints that reflectors could be used to investigate not only large scale processes but also how localized polar processes have evolved over time.   Model results are heavily dependent on the assumed dust permittivity. Figure 3 shows results for one reasonable value. Measured reflectivities fall within the values predicted by the model for a wide range of dust permittivities, implying that marker beds are a plausible source for SHARAD reflections. However, due to destructive interference resulting from the thin layer boundaries, the modeled reflectivities take on a lobed structure, making it impossible to uniquely identify thickness or dust content for any individual reflector. While this approach can not place absolute constraints on these values, it can provide a set of probable thicknesses that are well within the resolution of HiRISE to discern at outcrops, and could also be used to track relative changes within individual reflectors.

Future Work: Unifying SHARAD data and optical stratigraphy could improve our ability to connect radar results to physical properties, and provide better constraints on our model. Correlating SHARAD reflectors to high resolution digital elevation models of NPLD outcrops is a potential step in this direction. A better understanding of the dielectric properties of NPLD dust would also allow us to focus our modeling efforts. Further mapping both spatially and with depth could also allow us to identify patterns within the data and possibly begin to track changes in layer thickness or composition throughout the NPLD's history. Finally, more investigation into local depositional and erotional processes is necessary to explain the regional variation observed in SHARAD reflectors.
