It provides heat to liberate water from surface and subsurface ice, changes the physics and chemistry of Martian rocks, and delivers volatiles from the Martian surface into the rocks. It has been demonstrated that impact melts in Martian meteorites can record volatiles from different sources [1-3]. In this study, we conducted shock experiments on analogous Earth rocks to investigate the effect of impact on the volatile signatures in Martian meteorites, in order to better interpret the past Martian environment using meteorite data. Samples and Methods: Samples used in the experiments are dredged back-arc basin basalts from the Lau Basin [4,5]. The basalt samples (DR02-3 and DR10-2) have similar major-element compositions but different textures. DR02-3 has a glomeroporphyritic texture with phenocrysts (15 vol% olivine, 3% plagioclase, 2 vol% pyroxene) surrounded by microlites in a glassy matrix (GM). DR10-2 contains fewer phenocrysts (1% olivine and 1% plagioclase) in a devitrified matrix. DR02-3 and DR10-2 contain 10% and 8% vesicles, respectively. The vesicles are uniformly distributed. Shock recovery experiments were performed using a 20 mm propellant gun in the Lindhurst Laboratory at Caltech, similar to [6]. In each experiment, a basalt disc 5 mm in diameter and 1 mm thick (some vesicles may have been filled with a small amount of residual wax from sample preparation) was installed in a stainless steel recovery chamber and impacted at a velocity of 1.32 ±0.01 km/s by a tantalum plate. The impact direction was normal to the disc surface. During shock, sample DR02-3 was under vacuum but DR10-2 was in atmosphere. The front half of the sample experienced a single shock to an estimated pressure of 17 GPa for a duration of ~400 ns. The back half of the sample was reshocked by reflection from the back of the chamber to a peak pressure of ~28 GPa for a duration of ~300 ns. After experiments, the recovery chamber was cut open at the center along the impact direction, and the exposed surface was polished for electron microscopy and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) analyses.  The volatile concentrations (C reported as CO2, OH reported as H2O, P reported as P2O5, F, Cl, and S) were analyzed using SIMS. Natural and synthetic glasses were used as standards. The 2σ errors based on the reproducibility of the standards are 20% relative for H2O, Cl, P2O5, and S, and 4% relative for F. The backgrounds are 10 ppm for CO2, 12 ppm for H2O, 1 ppm for F, 0.3 ppm for Cl and P2O5, and 0.2 ppm for S. These backgrounds have been subtracted from the data. Hydrogen and deuterium were analyzed in a separated SIMS session and reported as δD values relative to the Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water. The measured D/H values were corrected for instrument mass fractionation and background with a natural basaltic glass standard. The 2σ errors for the δD values are 38-145 ‰.   Figure 1.

Results: After shock, original large vesicles in both samples were annihilated. Clusters of vesicles (<3-10 µm in diameter) are found in confined regions near the rim of the discs or in zones cross-cutting the samples. The plagioclase phenocrysts are broken or bent, but contain no bubbles (e.g., Fig. 1). Despite the deformation, they preserve compositional zoning. Raman analysis showed that the predominant plagioclase shifts at ~500 Pl Pl GM M 1777.pdf

cm-1 are broadened in width and diminished in intensity. These features suggest that the plagioclases were in transit to maskelynite due to shock metamorphism, but did not melt. Both experiments generated impact melts as rounded pockets (up to about 50 µm in maximum dimension) or thin veins. They are more common near the rim of the basalt discs than in the center. There is no apparent correlation with locations of original glassy matrix or vesicles. The interiors of the pockets are heterogeneous and are distinguishable from the original glass (e.g., Fig 1). Major-element compositions of the impact melts from SEM-EDS analysis are close to those of the original matrix, suggesting that the matrix was the main source material for the major elements. The volatile concentrations in impact melts show large variations (e.g., Fig. 2, 130–230 ppm F in DR102 and 125-176 ppm F in DR02-3, 645-731 ppm S in DR10-2 and 548–767 ppm S in DR02-3). Different volatiles are positively correlated (Fig 2).  The impact melts in DR02-3 (more phenocrysts, glassy matrix) contain lower H2O, but higher CO2 and Cl than the original glass (Fig. 2). F and S contents in the impact melts are comparable to the original glassy matrix. The glass matrix in the shocked sample has lower H2O and CO2 than the original glass. The impact melts of DR10-2 (devitrified matrix, less phenocrysts) contain more volatiles than the original devitrified matrix (Fig. 2).   The δD values in the glass matrix in the shocked sample and impact melts are -18 – -109 ‰, similar to original samples within analytical uncertainties (Fig 2).  Discussion: Impact-induced degassing and changes in D/H values are not discernable in the preliminary data. The slightly lower H2O and CO2 contents of the shocked glass matrix in DR02-3 compared to the original matrix could indicate volatile degassing during shock and subsequent cooling. Alternatively it could be a sampling bias due to our limited data. Further analysis is needed to resolve this potential effect. The high CO2 and Cl contents in impact melts of both samples require a source other than the original basalts (low in both). The most likely sources are the residual mounting wax from sample preparation for C and chloride salts in the pore space introduced by sea water when the samples were dredged. The wax was largely present close to the outside surface of the disc. The diffusion distance of H2O in basaltic melt in the ~100’s ns duration of high-temperature in the shock experiment is estimated to be ~1 µm, which is significantly shorter than the dimension of the sample disc and the impact melts (~50 µm). The diffusion of CO2 and Cl is expected to be slower than H2O. Thus the volatiles in the impact melts cannot be introduced via diffusion; turbulent flow and mixing are necessary. Our experiments demonstrate that impact melts can assimilate and retain volatiles during the impact process, which is not limited by diffusion. Compared to the original samples, the contrasting behavior of H2O in impact melts between DR10-2 and DR02-3 can be explained by mixing of different magmatic sources with the C and Cl source.  The magmatic H2O content of DR02-3 is higher than the C and Cl source, while the magmatic H2O of DR10-2 is lower than the C and Cl source. The correlations between H2O, Cl and CO2 are consistent with two component mixing: an ‘alteration’ source (possibly wax and salt) and a magmatic source.   Figure 2.
