It is composed of isolated topographically high features [1, 2] and a unit interpreted to be portions of the ancient Dorsa Argentea ice sheet [3, 4]. Initially, 17 high and rugged mountainous structures [5] were mapped within the Dorsa Argentea Formation. [1] expanded the number of these structures to 21 and indicated the nature of these structures to be volcanic and possibly subglacial. The volcano count was later expanded to >40 features [6], classifying the structures by their proximity to Sisyphi Planum and their isolated peaks. While the isolated edifices are thought to be volcanic in nature, it is only recently that their origin has been confirmed by mineralogic studies to be subglacial [7]. Here, we again expand the number of edifices to >100 (123 to date; Figure 1) and examine the edifices in detail to verify their volcanic nature and origin.  Methods:  Subglacial volcanoes, also known as tuyas, exhibit distinctive steep slopes and flat tops resulting from ice confinement during eruption and interactions between magma and water [8]. On Earth, there are four major types of tuyas: 1) flat-topped, 2) conical, 3) linear, and 4) complex, not taking into account post-eruption morphologic changes [8]. While flat-topped and conical tuyas are self explanatory, linear tuyas have a length to width ratio of 2:1 and complex tuyas have components of multiple other classes [8].   To catalogue the topographically high features on Mars, we acquired one to three topographic profiles from the Mars Orbital Laser Altimeter (MOLA) [9] over each edifice. We also utilized data from the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) [10] to examine regional context and other features associated with the edifices. The edifices were then categorized by their peak structures and analyzed to look for trends in the data (size, shape, clustering, etc.). The shapes and sizes of the peaks were categorized into 5 groups: 1) flat, 2) rounded, 3) sharp, 4) crater-like, and 5) small-sized - a "catch-all" category for all features with a height of <300 meters, which exhibit less distinctive morphologies in MOLA topography (Figure 2). The last category was included to look for trends within the smaller features in the region. Results:  Thus far, we have identified and analyzed 41 features in the Sisyphi Montes region. Of those, 32% have flat peaks, 17% have rounded peaks, 20% have sharp peaks, 7% have crater-like depressions and 24% are small-sized. Based on this preliminary data set, the majority of the edifices in the region are flattopped, consistent with the morphologies of tuyas on Earth. The large population of smaller edifices is primarily composed of the new edifices that we have identified, as shown in Figure 1.  In addition, we have observed moat-like depressions around 38% of the edifices. [1] also observed shallow, circular depressions around the edifices that extended roughly one diameter of the mountain in each direction but did not speculate on their origin. [6] suggested that these moats are either the rims of degraded craters or tectonic structures made by impact craters. We propose that these moats are not made by impactrelated processes but instead could be due to the response of the lithosphere to the emplacement of the volcano, as the Sisyphi moats are similar in shape to terrestrial volcanic flexural moats [11-13]. Conclusion and Future Work: Based on our preliminary results, the morphology of the edifices in the Sisyphi Montes region is similar to the morphology of terrestrial tuyas, supporting a subglacial origin for these features. Our future work will consist of analyzing the rest of the 123 features in the region, taking a closer look at the small features, and exploring the origin of the surrounding moats.
