Introduction:  The existence of liquid water on past and probably current Mars has been almost conclusive by recent intensive studies (e.g. [1]). Since water plays key roles in the near-surface environmental evolutions of terrestrial planets, it is important to elucidate the potential sources, the amounts and behaviors of water at past and current Mars. Lithium is one of the light lithophile elements and may be a useful tracer for hydrous activities. It is known that Li isotopes are not significantly fractionated by simple magmatic differentiations. On the other hand, large fractionation of δ7Li can be occurred by H2O-degassing from magma, subsolidus diffusion in minerals or secondary processes such as weathering (e.g. [2]).  Previous studies of shergottites reported core-torim variations of δ7Li and Li concentrations (hereafter [Li]) in large olivine and pyroxene crystals, which are associated with H2O-degassing from the shergottites parental magma [3][4]. Diffusions in silicates were also reported for shergottites and nakhlites [4][5]. While those studies concern magmatic Li isotopes and their fractionation processes, late-stage minerals, such as phosphates (as well as impact-induced glasses) might have incorporated additional Li from the martian crust. Mixing of additional components, presumably the crustal materials, to the shergottite magma has also been indicated from Pb isotopic systematics [6]. If such components had been incorporated into the phosphates before their crystallization, their δ7Li and [Li] might reflect water-mineral interactions at the martian near-surface system. In order to understand the near-surface hydrous environments on Mars, we focus on the isotopic signatures of Li and U-Pb system recorded in shergottites phosphates. Here, we present our preliminary reports of Tissint.  Sample:  Tissint is the fall, depleted olivine-phyric shergottite. It has numerous glassy components enclosing bubbles. These glasses showed LREE-enrichment, indicating the contaminations of martian crustal materials [7]. The U-Th-Pb systems of acid leaching were well documented [6].  Analytical Conditions:  Small bulk sample of Tissint was embedded in epoxy resin, polished and cleaned using ultrasonic bath with ethanol, and goldcoated after ~100 ˚C baking overnight. The section was then observed by SEM-EDS to identify phosphate with enough size (>20µm in diameter; Fig. 1). The isotopic analyses of Li and U-Pb were conducted in different sessions using a NanoSIMS at AORI, University of Tokyo. For Li analyses, a primary 1nA O- ion with beam size of ~7µm was scanned over 10µm square area. Secondary ions of 6Li+, 7Li+, 29Si+, 31P+ were collected with multi-collectors and peak-jumping. The sensitivity of 7Li+ and the instrumental mass fractionation factor of 7Li+/6Li+ for apatite are determined with standard as 230 cps/nA/ppm and (7Li+/6Li+)meas/ (7Li+/6Li+)ref  =1.005, respectively. A Natural apatite from Morocco ([Li]=3.1 ppm, δ7Li=6.8±0.3 ‰) was used as standard. The bulk [Li] and δ7Li of the standard were analyzed by MC-ICP-MS at Kochi Institute for Core Sample Research, JAMSTEC. For U-Pb, a 5nA O- ion beam with ~15µm in diameter was focused. Both 238U-206Pb and 207Pb-206Pb were obtained on the same spots. Detailed analytical protocols were shown in elsewhere [8].   20µmplgcpxphs Fig. 1.  SEM image of a phosphate (Phs-5) in Tissint.

Results and Discussion: Five phosphate grains were analyzed for Li and U-Pb. Additional 3 grains were analyzed for U-Pb only.  The concentrations and the isotopic ratios of Li are shown in Table 1. and Fig. 2 (All errors are 1-sigma)., The δ7Li range from -5.1‰ to +8.3‰. Although errors are relatively large, these values are slightly higher than the pyroxene range of -7.1‰ to +5.1‰ [3]. The [Li] of the phosphates (11.2 - 16.2 ppm) are significantly higher than those of the silicates of < 2 ppm [3]. Since Li is moderately incompatible, the higher δ7Li and [Li] can be explained by (a) magmatic differentiation (increase [Li]) along with H2O-degassing (increase δ7Li and decrease [Li]), or by (b) incorporation of additional high-δ7Li components (crustal materials) at the late stage crystallization. Due to the large uncertainties and limited data, we cannot distinguish above possibilities at this time.    Fig. 2. δ7Li and [Li] of Tissint phosophates.    The 238U-206Pb analyses of Tissint phosphates did not provide significant age, because of the quite low 238U/206Pb ratios and the small variations. On the other hand, 207Pb-206Pb age was unrealistically old as 4820±330Ma. Our Pb isotopic data are similar to the leachates data of the previous acid leaching study [5], suggesting that the phosphates have the most radiogenic Pb in this meteorite. The obtained 207Pb-206Pb 'age' may be because of the mixing of 2 or more components, possibly martian crustal material. Fig 3 plot our 207Pb-206Pb results with other literature data of shergottites phosphates (QUE94201, Zagami, LAR06319 and Shergotty). Tissint and QUE94201 are quite similar. While 207Pb-206Pb age of all shergottites cannot be determined, they might be on the same line. Meanwhile, these shergottites have 238U-206Pb age as 476±72Ma, although Zagami, Shergotty and LAR06319 may be younger. There is a possibility that this shows mixing between unradiogenic Pb in the shergottite magma and radiogenic Pb in the martian crust.  In summary, both Li isotopes and U-Pb system in shergottites phosphates indicate the possible incorporation of martian crustal components. For their interpretations and applications to the martian sub-surface hydrous activities, however, further investigations are required.   0.0  0.5  1.0  1.5  2.0  2.5  0.00  0.02  0.04  0.06  0.08  0.10  0.12  0.14  0.16  0.18  207 Pb/206 Pb204Pb/206PbTissintLAR06319ShergottyZagamiQUE94201 Fig. 3. 207Pb-206Pb of Tissint and literature values.
