They have investigated the elemental compositions of their landing sites in more details, and obtained new “ground truth” which were not provided by any returned samples. The elemental compositions (e.g., Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Fe) of landing site give us very important information to reveal the petrogenesis of silicate rocks located there. One of the most useful elemental analyzers which have been used in previous planetary landing missions is X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRS) with active X-ray generator (XRG). The XRS in previous landing missions used radioactive sources as active excitation source: alpha particle X-ray generator in Mars landing missions [e.g., 3]; radioactive sources as 55Fe and 109Cd in Chinese lunar landing mission [4]. We have been developing the active X-ray spectrometer (AXS) for future landing mission to the Moon/Mars/Asteroids without such radioactive sources [e.g., 5,6]. Our AXS consists of four active X-ray generators with pyroelectric crystal (LiTaO3), and a silicon drift detector (SDD). Features of pyroelectric X-ray generator (PXG) are light weight, compact package, low-power consumption, no high voltage power supply, and could reduce the risk of exposure by on-off swithing of the X-ray emission as necessary. In this paper, we report the present model of AXS, and the specification. We discuss the observation targets of AXS on the assumption that lunar landing mission is performed.  The specification of AXS: AXS consists of four PXGs, SDD, and electronics. The PXG is excitation source, and consists of a small pyroelectric crystal (LiTaO3), a peltier device, and a thin metallic target film (Cu or Mo) [e.g., 5]. Fluorescent X-rays of light major elements as Mg, Al, Si could be clearly identified thanks to the excellent energy resolution (<130 eV (FWHM) @6.4keV Fe) of thermoelectrically-cooled SDD. For PXG, two kinds of metallic target as Cu and Mo are used in order to measure many elements from Na to Ni. Lα X-ray line (2.29 keV) from Mo target and bremsstrahlung is used for exciting X-rays of light elements as Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, and Kα X-ray line (8.04 keV) from Cu target and bremsstrahlung is used for exciting X-rays of relatively heavy elements as Si, P, S, K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni [e.g., 5]. Lunar rock, regolith and soil mainly consist of four minerals and glass derived from melting of the following minerals, olivine ([Mg,Fe]2SiO4), pyroxene ([Mg,Fe,Ca]2Si2O6), anorthite (CaAl2Si2O8), and ilmenite (FeTiO3) [e.g., 7]. Therefore, the elements as O, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, and Fe are called as major elements. Furthermore, KREEP materials which are enriched in incompatible elements such as K, rare earth element (REE), and P, have been returned within/around Procellarum KREEP Terrane (PKT) on the nearside of the Moon [e.g., 7]. The AXS aims to determine the elemental abundances (Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ti, and Fe) of lunar rock samples, regolith and soils.    In order to evaluate the specification of AXS, both numerical and experimental studies have been performed as shown follows. 1) Effects by the geometry of X-ray incidence, emission and energy were investigated [8]. Appropriate angle geometry by that study are applied to the design of AXS.       2) Effects of X-ray fluorescence by the surface roughness of rock samples were also investigated. The details are summarized in [8]. Furthermore, the effect of the surface roughness of soils is under investigation.  Numerical simulation study:  A simulation tool which is PENELOPE (version 2008) [9] is used in order to investigate observation time and uncertainty of each element. X-rays of Cu Kα (8.04 keV) and Mo Lα (2.293 keV) were used as excitation source. Sample was irradiated with conical beam from  a point source. SDD detects characteristic X-rays passing through Be window from the sample. SDD is set at 30 degree between the detector and excitation source (Fig. 1). We used the elemental compositions of Apollo 11 soils and Apollo 16 soils in this simulation study (Table 1). Apollo 11 soils represent High-Ti basaltic composition, while Apollo 16 soils (typical mature) represent feldspathic composition [10]. Relationship between observation time and uncertainty was determined based on X-ray intensity from our experimental results with pyroelectric crystals. Results of numerical simulation. Figures 2 and 3 show the comparison with observation time and uncertainty of each element in Apollo 11 and 16 soils. For 1837.pdf

determination of Si content, the usage of Mo target is more effective. In both operations in mare region as Apollo 11 site and highland as Apollo 16 site, the measurement of Mg content requires 300 minutes with <10% uncertainty, that of other elements (Al, Si, Ca, Fe) could require shorter times (~60 min. in mare; ~30 min. in highland) with <10% uncertainty. Uncertainty of Fe is ~1% in 30-minutes observation. In order to reduce the observation time for Mg, the developing PXG with higher intensity is under consideration. When major elemental compositions in landing site could be obtained with high precisions, the geochemical characteristics there could be evaluated [e.g., 11]   Figure 1.
