Observation made on surface of them revealed existenceof nano craters and adhered objects, demonstratingongoing impact process on surface of asteroids [3].Shock metamorphism preserved on chondrites has beenused to estimate impact conditions on asteroids basedon results of shock-recovery experiments [4]. Meltinduced by impact were investigated by shock-recoveryexperiments using ordinary chondrites [5] and, mixtureof silicates and metals [6]. Besides these shockrecovery experiments, shock metamorphism of ejectaand projectile in cratering processes has been examinedby impact experiment. Quartz in ejecta was fractured(<0.9 GPa), lithified with shock effect (diaplectic glassand planar deformation feature, 5.5-13 GPa), and melt(>13 GPa) [7, 8]. Interaction between projectile andtarget was examined by impact experiments of Al-alloyprojectile into quartz sand [9, 10] and that of steelprojectile into sandstone and quartzite [11]. Redoxreaction between Al-alloy and quartz, that forms Al2O3and Si crystals [10], and incorporation of minor elementof steel (Cr, V) into silicate melt [11] were observed.Although these results provide us an insight of physicaland chemical interaction between two materials, theycannot be readily applicable to shock metamorphismof ordinary chondrite, since ordinary chondrites aremainly composed of olivine. In order to examinephysical and chemical interaction on asteroids, wecarried out impact experiments of steel projectile intoolivine with zero and 43% porosity to simulate target ofmonolith and regolith.Experiments: Impact experiments on monolith andregolith targets were carried out by horizontal two-stagelight-gas-gun at Institute of Space and AstronauticalScience, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. Weused dunite (82% olivine (fo95), 8% orthopyroxene,4% diopside, 3% plagioclase, and 1% spinel in volume fraction) as zero porosity olivine monolith, andcrushed olivine (fo90) with size ranging 300-700 µmas 43% porosity one regolith. The regolith was filledin 10-cm cylindrical container that has 2-cm hole forprojectile entry. The hole was sealed by 20-µm nylonmesh to prevent from landslide of regolith before impact. Monolith or the container was put in 30-cm transparent box to recover ejecta fragments. The box wasplaced in a chamber that was vacuumed to 2-6 Pa before impact. The 1.6- and 3.2-mm stainless-steel projectiles were accelerated using nylon sabot to velocitiesfrom 1.7 to 5.0 km/s, corresponding to peak-shock pressures of 17-101 GPa estimated by impedance matchingmethod [12, 13] (Table 1). The steel is composed of Fe,Cr, and Ni. Trajectories of projectile and ejecta fragments were recorded by high-speed camera with backlight illumination. Crater on each target was solidifiedby epoxy resin and thin and thick sections that containimpact point were created. Distribution of fragmentswithin crater and major element abundances were determined by JEOL JSM-7001F FE-SEM equipped withOxford AZtec EDS with 15 kV acceleration voltage and3 nA beam current. Raman micro-spectroscopy using aThermo Scientific DXR system with 532 nm Nd-YVO4laser was applied to identify polymorph of olivine. Raman spectra were collected using 10 mW laser, 25 mpinhole aperture in auto exposure mode with a signal-tonoise ratio of 100, and baseline correction by the OMNIC software suite.Results and Discussion: Degree of fracturing wascharacterized by volumes of crater in monolith or fractured domain in regolith. Volumes of crater on monolith were estimated by laser altimeter equipped on twodimensional stage system, and the volume (V , m−3) increased with kinetic energy of projectile (E, J), yieldingV = 10−8.6±0.3E1.1±0.2 (Fig. 1). Application of Piscaling law on crater volume in strength regime [14] onmonolith yields πV = 10−1.7±0.5π−1.1±0.2Y, consistentwith that on basalt [15]. The fractured domain was defined by presence of disrupted fragments, and volumesof the domain were estimated from its mean radius (r)and assumption of spherical distribution (V = 43πr3).The volume increased with energy (Fig. 1). In thedomain, grains smaller than 300 µm were dominant,and the slope of cumulative size distribution in a 3 × 3mm2 area was −1.6, consistent with that of fragmentsof sandstone in crater floor [16] and ejecta of basalt [17].Porosity of the domain was estimated by image analysisand to be 60% irrespective of velocity.Table 1: Experimental conditions.

Melt was observed at 5 km/s in both monolith and regolith and we present petrographic and geochemical observations at the velocity.In monolith planar deformation feature and undulatory extinction of olivine were observed on crater floor.No polymorph of olivine was observed on both craterfloor and ejecta fragments. In regolith, steel fragmentswith size up to 2 mm were found within the fractureddomain. They show molten texture and enclose olivine.Lihtified olivine assemblages with size up to severalmm, which composed of fractured olivine with fine andmolten olivine at grain boundary, were found in the fractured domain. Melt of olivine and steel was found inejecta in monolith (Fig. 2a) and aggregate in regolith(Fig. 2b). Both melt include steel spherule, and in caseof regolith, it fills boundary of olivine grains (Fig. 2a).Major-element abundance of melt was enriched in element Fe and Cr, which are major constituent of the projectile. Melt of steel suggests that temperature raised tomelting point of 1400 ◦C.Summary: To examine impact-induced physicaland chemical interaction of ordinary chondrite, impactexperiments of steel projectile into olivine monolithand regolith were conducted. Crater volumes formedin monolith were consistent with that expected by Piscaling law [14]. Porosity of fractured domain in regolith increased from to 60%, and the slope of cumulative size distribution in the region is consistent with thatof impact fragments [17, 16]. Silicate melts enclosingsteel spherules were found in ejecta in monolith and aggregates in regolith. The melt was enriched in Fe andCr incorporated from projectile, similar to steel-quartzmixing [11]. Existence of mechanical mixture of projectile and target in regolith indicates that porosity playsan important role in generation and preservation of melt.Energy (J)Volume (m3 )●●monolithregolith10 100 100010−710−610−5●●●●●Figure 1: Volume of crater and fractured domain as afunction of kinetic energy of projectile.References: [1] T.
