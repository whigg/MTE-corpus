Introduction: Itokawa particles sampled by Hayabusa spacecraft demonstrated connection between S-type asteroid and ordinary chondrite [1, 2]. Observation made on surface of them revealed existence of nano craters and adhered objects, demonstrating ongoing impact process on surface of asteroids [3]. Shock metamorphism preserved on chondrites has been used to estimate impact conditions on asteroids based on results of shock-recovery experiments [4]. Melt induced by impact were investigated by shock-recovery experiments using ordinary chondrites [5] and, mixture of silicates and metals [6]. Besides these shockrecovery experiments, shock metamorphism of ejecta and projectile in cratering processes has been examined by impact experiment. Quartz in ejecta was fractured (<0.9 GPa), lithified with shock effect (diaplectic glass and planar deformation feature, 5.5-13 GPa), and melt (>13 GPa) [7, 8]. Interaction between projectile and target was examined by impact experiments of Al-alloy projectile into quartz sand [9, 10] and that of steel projectile into sandstone and quartzite [11]. Redox reaction between Al-alloy and quartz, that forms Al2O3 and Si crystals [10], and incorporation of minor element of steel (Cr, V) into silicate melt [11] were observed. Although these results provide us an insight of physical and chemical interaction between two materials, they cannot be readily applicable to shock metamorphism of ordinary chondrite, since ordinary chondrites are mainly composed of olivine. In order to examine physical and chemical interaction on asteroids, we carried out impact experiments of steel projectile into olivine with zero and 43% porosity to simulate target of monolith and regolith. Experiments: Impact experiments on monolith and regolith targets were carried out by horizontal two-stage light-gas-gun at Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. We used dunite (82% olivine (fo95), 8% orthopyroxene, 4% diopside, 3% plagioclase, and 1% spinel in volume fraction) as zero porosity olivine monolith, and crushed olivine (fo90) with size ranging 300-700 µm as 43% porosity one regolith. The regolith was filled in 10-cm cylindrical container that has 2-cm hole for projectile entry. The hole was sealed by 20-µm nylon mesh to prevent from landslide of regolith before impact. Monolith or the container was put in 30-cm transparent box to recover ejecta fragments. The box was placed in a chamber that was vacuumed to 2-6 Pa before impact. The 1.6- and 3.2-mm stainless-steel projectiles were accelerated using nylon sabot to velocities from 1.7 to 5.0 km/s, corresponding to peak-shock pressures of 17-101 GPa estimated by impedance matching method [12, 13] (Table 1). The steel is composed of Fe, Cr, and Ni. Trajectories of projectile and ejecta fragments were recorded by high-speed camera with backlight illumination. Crater on each target was solidified by epoxy resin and thin and thick sections that contain impact point were created. Distribution of fragments within crater and major element abundances were determined by JEOL JSM-7001F FE-SEM equipped with Oxford AZtec EDS with 15 kV acceleration voltage and 3 nA beam current. Raman micro-spectroscopy using a Thermo Scientific DXR system with 532 nm Nd-YVO4 laser was applied to identify polymorph of olivine. Raman spectra were collected using 10 mW laser, 25 m pinhole aperture in auto exposure mode with a signal-tonoise ratio of 100, and baseline correction by the OMNIC software suite. Results and Discussion: Degree of fracturing was characterized by volumes of crater in monolith or fractured domain in regolith. Volumes of crater on monolith were estimated by laser altimeter equipped on two dimensional stage system, and the volume (V , m−3) increased with kinetic energy of projectile (E, J), yielding V = 10−8.6±0.3E1.1±0.2 (Fig. 1). Application of Piscaling law on crater volume in strength regime [14] on monolith yields πV = 10 −1.7±0.5π−1.1±0.2 Y, consistent with that on basalt [15]. The fractured domain was defined by presence of disrupted fragments, and volumes of the domain were estimated from its mean radius (r) and assumption of spherical distribution (V = 4 3πr3). The volume increased with energy (Fig. 1). In the domain, grains smaller than 300 µm were dominant, and the slope of cumulative size distribution in a 3 × 3 mm2 area was −1.6, consistent with that of fragments of sandstone in crater floor [16] and ejecta of basalt [17]. Porosity of the domain was estimated by image analysis and to be 60% irrespective of velocity. Table 1: Experimental conditions.

In monolith planar deformation feature and undulatory extinction of olivine were observed on crater floor. No polymorph of olivine was observed on both crater floor and ejecta fragments. In regolith, steel fragments with size up to 2 mm were found within the fractured domain. They show molten texture and enclose olivine. Lihtified olivine assemblages with size up to several mm, which composed of fractured olivine with fine and molten olivine at grain boundary, were found in the fractured domain. Melt of olivine and steel was found in ejecta in monolith (Fig. 2a) and aggregate in regolith (Fig. 2b). Both melt include steel spherule, and in case of regolith, it fills boundary of olivine grains (Fig. 2a). Major-element abundance of melt was enriched in element Fe and Cr, which are major constituent of the projectile. Melt of steel suggests that temperature raised to melting point of 1400 ◦C. Summary: To examine impact-induced physical and chemical interaction of ordinary chondrite, impact experiments of steel projectile into olivine monolith and regolith were conducted. Crater volumes formed in monolith were consistent with that expected by Piscaling law [14]. Porosity of fractured domain in regolith increased from to 60%, and the slope of cumulative size distribution in the region is consistent with that of impact fragments [17, 16]. Silicate melts enclosing steel spherules were found in ejecta in monolith and aggregates in regolith. The melt was enriched in Fe and Cr incorporated from projectile, similar to steel-quartz mixing [11]. Existence of mechanical mixture of projectile and target in regolith indicates that porosity plays an important role in generation and preservation of melt.
