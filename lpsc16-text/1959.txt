Introduction: Lunar  swirls  are  enigmatic  highreflectance  meandering  surface  patterns  associatedwith positive magnetic anomalies [1]. Their origin hasbeen debated since the late 1960s based on their uniquespectral and photometric characteristics as well as theirstrong  correlation  with  crustal  magnetic  anomalies[1,2,3].  Although  several models  were  proposed(cometary impacts [2,4], magnetic shielding [5,3], andelectrostatic levitation [6,7]), there are still unresolvedquestions on their formation mechanisms. The  Lunar  Reconnaissance  Orbiter  Camera(LROC) Wide Angle Camera (WAC) has acquired 72near-global 7-band (321-689 nm) monthly observationsets of the Moon. Each of these datasets was acquiredwith different lighting conditions and due to the widefield-of-view  of  the  WAC,  the  combined  datasetsprovide  a  rich  spectral-photometric  picture  of  theMoon. The near-global Hapke parameter maps derivedfrom  a  portion  (21  months)  of  this  dataset  [8]demonstrated  the  utility  of  Hapke  parameters  tocharacterize the properties of lunar regolith. Since thephotometric  anomalies  on  the  swirls  (e.g.,  forwardscattering  property [9,10])  have  been  suggested  byseveral workers, analyses using Hapke parameters withWAC  data  could  give  new  insight  into  theunderstanding of the materials on the swirl. Here  we  present  a  result  of  Hapke  parametricanalysis  of  Reiner  Gamma.  Since  the  existing WACparameter map scale (1° longitude by 1° latitude) is toocoarse to extract the accurate properties of the swirls[8], we derived new Hapke parameters from the WACat specifically selected regions to accurately examinethe  Reiner  Gamma  in  comparison  to  three  differentgeologic sites. Methodology:  About 39 months of WAC repeatedobservations were used. The EDR 8-bit DN values ofall the images were radiometrically calibrated [11] to32-bit  radiance  factor  (I/F)  [12].  The  latitude,longitude,  incidence  (i),  emission  (e),  and  phase  (g)angles were computed using the WAC GLD100 stereoDTM [13] for each image pixel. To keep similar pixelscale  across  the  wavelengths  (~400  m/pixel  in  UVbands, 321 and 360 nm; ~100 m/pixel in visible bands415, 566, 604, 643, and 689 nm), we down-sampledvisible bands to match the pixel scale of the UV bands.Four sampling sites were selected (Fig.  1):  ReinerGamma  (RG),  the  mare  near  Reiner  Gamma  (MR),highland terrain (HL), and the rays from Kepler crater(EJ). Using the characteristics of low 321/415 nm ratiovalues  of  the  swirls  [14],  we  extracted  the  highreflectance  portions  of  RG  by  selecting  areas  with321/415 less than 0.66. The other three sites (MR, HL,and  EJ)  were  selected  from relatively  homogeneousareas.  To  avoid  different  fitting  results  due  to  thedifferent ranges of  i,  e, and  g, we cut off each anglerange to make consistent for all sampling sites. We employed the parameter calculation proceduredeveloped  by  [8],  including  albedo  filtering,  anglebinning,  and  Hapke  model  simplifications.  Wecalculated  three  free  parameters,  single  scatteringalbedo  (w),  Henyey-Greenstein  double-lobed  (HG2)single  particle  phase  function  parameter  (b),  andangular  width  of  Shadow  Hiding  Opposition-surgeEffect  (SHOE)  (hs)  for  each  wavelength.  We  alsocalculated the roughness parameter (θ) in addition tothe  three  free  parameters,  as  a  separate  analysis  toexamine the relation of photometric roughness to thefour sampling sites. We note that θ was set to constantvalue  (23.6)  for  other  parameter  analyses  [8]  tominimize  the  effect  of  wavelength  variation  in  θ(theoretically  constant  across  the wavelength)  on theother parameters. Result and Discussion:  The derived values of  w(Fig. 2) indicate high albedo at the swirl (RG), as highas the highland (HL), relative to the mare covered byejecta (EJ) and the ejecta-free mare (MR). The phase function parameter  c is derived by thefunction of b (hockey-stick relation [15]). An increasein c indicates more backscattering, and an increase in bindicates a steeper phase curve. For b and c the RG andHL have a smaller dependence on wavelength (±0.005in b, ±0.05 in c) relative to the two other sites. The RGgenerally  has  the  smallest  c across  all  wavelengths,indicating less backscattering than the other sites.  Inthe  MR  and  EJ,  c decreases  toward  longerFigure 1.

wavelengths, which is also observed as a typical trendof  mare  [8].  Previous  studies  [9,10]  have  suggestedrelatively  forward  scattering  property  in  the  swirlscompared to the surrounding mare, which is consistentwith  our  result  (although it  is  still  in  backscatteringregime:  c>0)  for  the  shorter  wavelength  but  lessprominent in >600 nm.The  amplitude  of  SHOE  (Bso)  generally  showsinverted trend of  w because of the empirical functionusing w, b, and c to derive Bso [8]. Derived values arelarger  than  the  theoretical  limit  (1.0)  due  to  thesimplification of CBOE term. Employing both CBOEand SHOE results in both  Bco and  Bso less than 1.0,but  the  derived  other  parameters  often  show  noconsistent  trend  probably  due  to  the  mathematicalcoupling [8].The hs is theoretically related to porosity and grainsize distribution [12]. The HL and MR are in similarvalues that are constantly higher relative to the EJ andRG.  In  near-global  parameter  map [8],  typically  thehighlands have higher hs relative to the mare, and thehighest  hs is  observed  in  highland's  immature  craterejecta. Meanwhile the ejecta on the mare have slightlylower  hs than  the  surrounding  mare,  which  isconsistent with the lower  hs in the EJ relative to theMR  and  HL.  The  RG  has  lowest  hs across  thewavelengths, possibly suggesting a soil property withporosity  between EJ and  MR ([12] Fig.  9.9)  at  RG.Comprehensive  laboratory  experiments  on  hs isnecessary  to  understand  the  link  between  the  soilproperties and the parameter hs. In the analyses of roughness parameter (θ) (Fig. 3),the  derived  θ varied  from  22.0°  to  25.3°.  We tookmedian  of  θ across  the  wavelength  and  comparedbetween the sampling sites. Compared to the equatorialhistograms of  θ in [8] ranging from about 20° to 28°,the  derived  θ in  this  study  have  relatively  smallvariation,  suggesting  small  difference  in  the  submillimeter  scale  roughness [16].  The  HL  is  atopographically  rough  area.  Small  topographicundulations  unresolved  by  GLD100  increase  thescatter  at  high  incidence  angles,  which  possiblyresulted in slightly increased θ of HL.Conclusion: The  comparisons  of  four  geologicsites  using  Hapke  parameters  revealed  the  differentphotometric characteristics of each site. Reiner Gammahas  relatively  similar  photometric  properties  to  theimmature ejecta, but still a subtle difference remains,such as the small wavelength dependence of b and c.
