Introduction: Lunar  swirls  are  enigmatic  high reflectance  meandering  surface  patterns  associated with positive magnetic anomalies [1]. Their origin has been debated since the late 1960s based on their unique spectral and photometric characteristics as well as their strong  correlation  with  crustal  magnetic  anomalies [1,2,3].  Although  several models  were  proposed (cometary impacts [2,4], magnetic shielding [5,3], and electrostatic levitation [6,7]), there are still unresolved questions on their formation mechanisms. The  Lunar  Reconnaissance  Orbiter  Camera (LROC) Wide Angle Camera (WAC) has acquired 72 near-global 7-band (321-689 nm) monthly observation sets of the Moon. Each of these datasets was acquired with different lighting conditions and due to the wide field-of-view  of  the  WAC,  the  combined  datasets provide  a  rich  spectral-photometric  picture  of  the Moon. The near-global Hapke parameter maps derived from  a  portion  (21  months)  of  this  dataset  [8] demonstrated  the  utility  of  Hapke  parameters  to characterize the properties of lunar regolith. Since the photometric  anomalies  on  the  swirls  (e.g.,  forward scattering  property [9,10])  have  been  suggested  by several workers, analyses using Hapke parameters with WAC  data  could  give  new  insight  into  the understanding of the materials on the swirl. Here  we  present  a  result  of  Hapke  parametric analysis  of  Reiner  Gamma.  Since  the  existing WAC parameter map scale (1° longitude by 1° latitude) is too coarse to extract the accurate properties of the swirls [8], we derived new Hapke parameters from the WAC at specifically selected regions to accurately examine the  Reiner  Gamma  in  comparison  to  three  different geologic sites. Methodology:  About 39 months of WAC repeated observations were used. The EDR 8-bit DN values of all the images were radiometrically calibrated [11] to 32-bit  radiance  factor  (I/F)  [12].  The  latitude, longitude,  incidence  (i),  emission  (e),  and  phase  (g) angles were computed using the WAC GLD100 stereo DTM [13] for each image pixel. To keep similar pixel scale  across  the  wavelengths  (~400  m/pixel  in  UV bands, 321 and 360 nm; ~100 m/pixel in visible bands 415, 566, 604, 643, and 689 nm), we down-sampled visible bands to match the pixel scale of the UV bands. Four sampling sites were selected (Fig.  1):  Reiner Gamma  (RG),  the  mare  near  Reiner  Gamma  (MR), highland terrain (HL), and the rays from Kepler crater (EJ). Using the characteristics of low 321/415 nm ratio values  of  the  swirls  [14],  we  extracted  the  high reflectance  portions  of  RG  by  selecting  areas  with 321/415 less than 0.66. The other three sites (MR, HL, and  EJ)  were  selected  from relatively  homogeneous areas.  To  avoid  different  fitting  results  due  to  the different ranges of  i,  e, and  g, we cut off each angle range to make consistent for all sampling sites. We employed the parameter calculation procedure developed  by  [8],  including  albedo  filtering,  angle binning,  and  Hapke  model  simplifications.  We calculated  three  free  parameters,  single  scattering albedo  (w),  Henyey-Greenstein  double-lobed  (HG2) single  particle  phase  function  parameter  (b),  and angular  width  of  Shadow  Hiding  Opposition-surge Effect  (SHOE)  (hs)  for  each  wavelength.  We  also calculated the roughness parameter (θ) in addition to the  three  free  parameters,  as  a  separate  analysis  to examine the relation of photometric roughness to the four sampling sites. We note that θ was set to constant value  (23.6)  for  other  parameter  analyses  [8]  to minimize  the  effect  of  wavelength  variation  in  θ (theoretically  constant  across  the wavelength)  on the other parameters. Result and Discussion:  The derived values of  w (Fig. 2) indicate high albedo at the swirl (RG), as high as the highland (HL), relative to the mare covered by ejecta (EJ) and the ejecta-free mare (MR). The phase function parameter  c is derived by the function of b (hockey-stick relation [15]). An increase in c indicates more backscattering, and an increase in b indicates a steeper phase curve. For b and c the RG and HL have a smaller dependence on wavelength (±0.005 in b, ±0.05 in c) relative to the two other sites. The RG generally  has  the  smallest  c across  all  wavelengths, indicating less backscattering than the other sites.  In the  MR  and  EJ,  c decreases  toward  longer Figure 1. Four sample sites near Reiner Gamma.  wavelengths, which is also observed as a typical trend of  mare  [8].  Previous  studies  [9,10]  have  suggested relatively  forward  scattering  property  in  the  swirls compared to the surrounding mare, which is consistent with  our  result  (although it  is  still  in  backscattering regime:  c>0)  for  the  shorter  wavelength  but  less prominent in >600 nm. The  amplitude  of  SHOE  (Bso)  generally  shows inverted trend of  w because of the empirical function using w, b, and c to derive Bso [8]. Derived values are larger  than  the  theoretical  limit  (1.0)  due  to  the simplification of CBOE term. Employing both CBOE and SHOE results in both  Bco and  Bso less than 1.0, but  the  derived  other  parameters  often  show  no consistent  trend  probably  due  to  the  mathematical coupling [8]. The hs is theoretically related to porosity and grain size distribution [12]. The HL and MR are in similar values that are constantly higher relative to the EJ and RG.  In  near-global  parameter  map [8],  typically  the highlands have higher hs relative to the mare, and the highest  hs is  observed  in  highland's  immature  crater ejecta. Meanwhile the ejecta on the mare have slightly lower  hs than  the  surrounding  mare,  which  is consistent with the lower  hs in the EJ relative to the MR  and  HL.  The  RG  has  lowest  hs across  the wavelengths, possibly suggesting a soil property with porosity  between EJ and  MR ([12] Fig.  9.9)  at  RG. Comprehensive  laboratory  experiments  on  hs is necessary  to  understand  the  link  between  the  soil properties and the parameter hs. In the analyses of roughness parameter (θ) (Fig. 3), the  derived  θ varied  from  22.0°  to  25.3°.  We took median  of  θ across  the  wavelength  and  compared between the sampling sites. Compared to the equatorial histograms of  θ in [8] ranging from about 20° to 28°, the  derived  θ in  this  study  have  relatively  small variation,  suggesting  small  difference  in  the  submillimeter  scale  roughness [16].  The  HL  is  a topographically  rough  area.  Small  topographic undulations  unresolved  by  GLD100  increase  the scatter  at  high  incidence  angles,  which  possibly resulted in slightly increased θ of HL. Conclusion: The  comparisons  of  four  geologic sites  using  Hapke  parameters  revealed  the  different photometric characteristics of each site. Reiner Gamma has  relatively  similar  photometric  properties  to  the immature ejecta, but still a subtle difference remains, such as the small wavelength dependence of b and c.
