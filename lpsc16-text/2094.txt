Introduction:  Aim of this contribution is to present results of reanalysis of the first bistatic radar investigations of the Venus equatorial and polar regions provided using Venera-9, 10 and 15, 16 satellites. Bistatic radar results are compared with the first monostatic radio images obtained by the Venera 15,16 and Magellan orbiters [1-5]. Bistatic and monostatic radar studying the physical properties of Venus surface, subsurface structures, and atmosphere in the different wavelength band (from 3 cm up to several tens of meters) is important direction in the future radio science of Venus research [6,7].   Experimental results: Below are shown radio images and results of bistatic measurements of reflectivity and roughness in two equatorial and four polar regions.   Figure 1. Monostatic SAR Magellan (top) and bistatic monochromatic  Venera-10 (bottom) radio images of  equatorial plain  obtained at wavelengthes 12.4  cm and 32 cm, respectively. Bistatic and monostatic radars used specular and diffuse part of reflections.  Figure 2. Bistatic monochromatic reflection coefficienr in the equatorial area (Venera-10). Curve 1 and 2 corrrespond to measurements in Ussuriisk and Evpatoria, respectively.    Figure 3. The same as in Figure 1 for the second equatorial region.   Figure 4. Bistatic monochromatic reflection coefficient in the second equatorial region. Venera 10 data, measurements have been provided in  Ussuriisk, on November 25, 1975.  Figure 5. Bistatic (left) and monostatic SAR (right) Venera-15 radio images of the North polar plain  obtained at wavelengthes 32 cm and 8 cm, respectively. Dashed lines indicates the trajectory of specular point during bistatic radar investigation.        The first bistatic radar measurements with spatial resolution 10-20 km have been carried out during autumn of 1975 year in the Venus equatorial regions using the Venera-9 and 10 satellites (Figures 1-4).  Small roughness and, in general, plain character of relief in the investigated regions have been revealed. In 1983, the satellites Venera 15 and 16 have carried out new bistatic radar experiments with spatial resolution in the interval 5 - 10 km (Figures 5-9). New information on the large-scale topography and roughness of small-scale relief has been obtained in two Northern polar areas of the planet. Some features have been detected. 1. The significant variations of the reflectivity  2-4 times were found in the first region (Figure 5). The second area of reflectivity magnitude was far below (by three - four times) the previously measured values in the equatorial regions of Venus. These significant reflectivity variations may be related to changes in the conductivity of the ground. 2. Extremely small values roughness parameter with rms of slopes  equal to  0.15 were recorded in the Northern area centered at coordinates 73.4 N and longitude 228E.  Figure 6. Left. Bistatic reflection coefficient  in the first region. Curves 1 and 2 correspond to the experimental data and reflectivity calculated under assumption of homogeneous ground with dielecric constant 5.1. Curve 2 is reduced to 4 times for convenience of comparison. Right. Surface roughness in  the first (bottom) and second (top) North polar regions.   Figure 7. Bottom. Monostatic SAR Venera-15 radio images of the second North polar region. Top. Experimental and theoretical dependence of the reflection coefficient along the trajectory of speculat point (continous and dashed curves, respectively. Dashed curve  is reduced to 4 times for convenience of comparison).    Figure 8. Bistatic surface roughness obtained during radio occultation experiments in  the first (left) and second (right) South polar regions (Venera-15, 1983).   Figure 9. Bistatic monochromatic reflection coefficienr in the South polar  areas (Venera-16, 1983). Curve 1 and 2 corrrespond to experimental and theoretical dependence, respectively.      According to Figure 8, roughness in the investigated Sourth plain regions is higher by the factor 1.5 -2 than in the North plains.  The changes in the reflectivity in the investigated South regions correspond to expected values of the diectric constant and conductivity of the Venus sureface.      Conclusions: To obtain the information on the Venus subsurface structure up to depth 1 km it is necessary to use radio waves in the Medium Frequency (MF), or High Frequency (HF) bands with wavelength from 1 m up 30 m.       For investigations of the layered structures of the Venus atmosphere a new eikonal acceleration/intensity technique is proposed [7]. This technique allows: (1) one frequency high-precision measuring the total absorption of radio waves in the atmosphere; (2) estimating vertical gradients of the refractivity, and determining the height, slope, and horizontal displacement of the atmospheric and ionospheric layers.
