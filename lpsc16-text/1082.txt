EMISSION SPECTRA OF POORLY KNOWN METEOROID STREAMS. D. Marín1, J.M. Madiedo1,2. 1Facultad de Ciencias Experimentales, Universidad de Huelva, Huelva, Spain. 2Departamento de Fisica Atomica, Molecular y Nuclear. Universidad de Sevilla. 41012 Sevilla, Spain. madiedo@uhu.es  Introduction: Emission spectroscopy plays a fundamental role in meteor science, since this technique provides information about the chemical nature of meteoroids ablating in the atmosphere, and also about the mechanisms that control this ablation process [1, 2, 3, 4]. For this reason, an array of spectrographs has been deployed at several meteor observing stations operated by the University of Huelva in Spain. These stations work in the framework of the SPanish Meteor Network (SPMN). The first of these devices, which were based on low-lux CCD video cameras endowed with holographic diffraction gratings, started operation in 2006 at the station in Sevilla and also at the Cerro Negro mobile station [5]. Later on, slow-scan CCD spectrographs were also employed at both locations. Nowadays, these spectral cameras operate in a fully autonomous way at 9 meteor stations in the framework of the SMART project, which is the acronym for Spectroscopy of Meteoroids in the Atmosphere by means of Robotic Technologies. Favorable weather conditions in Spain play a key role in the successful development of this systematic spectroscopic campaign. The spectra of meteor events associated to poorly-known and recently discovered meteoroid streams are of special interest, since these can provide new clues to improve our knowledge about these swarms. Instrumentation: The spectrographs operating in the framework of the SMART Project work in a fully autonomous way thanks to the MetControl software, which was developed by the second author [6]. Some or these systems are based on low-lux monochrome CCD video cameras (models Watec 902H and 902H Ultimate). These employ aspherical fast lenses (f1.0 to f1.2) covering fixed fields of view ranging from about 90ºx60º to 8ºx5º. To disperse light emitted by bright meteors, a holographic transmission diffraction grating is attached to the objective lens. Emission spectra produced by events brighter than mag. -4/-5 can be obtained by these video spectrographs. On the other hand, five slow-scan CCD cameras manufactured by ATIK and SBIG are also employed as imaging devices. These cover a field of view of ~50ºx50º and are placed on automated alt-az mounts. In this way, they can be pointed to an arbitrary region of the sky. They can image emission spectra for fireballs brighter than mag. -6/-7. Emission spectra: Over 200 emission spectra of meteor events belonging to recently discovered or poorly known showers have been recorded in the framework of the SMART Project. As a sample, Figure 1 to 3 show the calibrated signals (integrated along the atmospheric path and corrected for the instrumental efficiency) obtained for a December ε-Eridanid, a σHydrid, and a λ-Ophiuchid meteor, respectively.  The atmospheric path and radiant of these events and the orbital data of the parent meteoroids were calculated in the usual way [6]. The association with the abovementioned showers was performed by employing the Southworth and Hawkins dissimilarity criterion [7], with DSH<0.15.   020406080100120140160180200300 400 500 600 700 800Wavelength (nm)Intensity (arbitrary units) Na I-1Mg I-2Fe I318Fe I-4Fe I42N2Fe I15Fe I41Fe I43 Figure 1.

Emission spectrum produced by a λOphiuchid meteor recorded on 22 June 2014 at 3h19m59s UT.  The main emission lines identified in these spectra have been highlighted in Figures 1 to 3. Most of these correspond to Fe I. The detailed conditions in the meteor plasma are currently under analysis. This will provide an insight into the chemical nature of the parent meteoroids.   In the December ε-Eridanid spectrum (Figure 1) the most important contributions correspond to Fe I-4, the Na I-1 doublet (588.9 nm) and the Mg I-2 triplet (516.7 nm). In the red region of the spectrum we have also identified the typical bands of atmospheric N2.  For the σ-Hydrid spectrum (Figure 2), the contributions of atmospheric N2, N I and O I are more important due to the high geocentric velocity of the meteor (about 58 km/s). In particular, the emission of the O I triplet at 777.4 nm is very relevant. The emission from calcium is also observed, although the H and K lines of Ca II are blended with the contribution of Fe I4. The λ-Ophiuchid spectrum in Figure 3 shows an important contribution of Fe I-4, Fe I-41, Fe I-15 and the Mg I-2 triplet. However, the emission of the Na I-1 doublet is not very significant. Conclusions: The SMART project is providing meteor spectra by means of automated video and slowscan CCD spectrographs deployed in 9 meteor stations along Spain. The first of these systems started operation in 2006, and our main effort focuses on the analysis of spectra of meteor events associated with poorlyknown and recently discovered meteoroid streams. In this context, we have presented here the spectrum of a December ε-Eridanid, a σ-Hydrid, and a λ-Ophiuchid meteor. The analysis of these signals will provide valuable information about the chemical nature of the parent meteoroids. Acknowledgements: The SMART project was funded by J.M. Madiedo.
