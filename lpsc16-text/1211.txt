Very High Potassium (VHK) Basalt Petrogenesis at Fra Mauro (Apollo 14). K. Cronberger, C. R. Neal, and S. E. Roberts, Dept. of Civil & Env. Eng. and Earth Sciences, University of Notre Dame, IN, 46556 USA (Kcronber@nd.edu, Neal.1@nd.edu)  Introduction. Apollo 14 returned 42.3 kg of samples, among them were the notable very high Potassium (VHK) basalts. Similar to the high-Al (HA) basalts, the VHK basalts were enriched in Potassium (K2O > 0.5 wt%) with ratios of K2O/Na2O > 1, and K/La >500 to 1300 [1].  VHK basalts were identified in breccias by [1] who hypothesized using whole rock data that they formed by assimilation of lunar granite by a HA magma.  Textural and K/La variations among the VHK basalts were explained by differing cooling rates from the same lava flow [1], and by having modal heterogeneity within the flow [2]. Goodrich et al. [2] also proposed VHK formation by a HA source having been metasomatized and enriched in K, Rb and Ba. Neal et al. [3,4,5] proposed that at least three separate HA basalt flows were represented by the samples, and each flow assimilated varying amounts of lunar granite and KREEP during crystallization. Textural relationships in some VHK basalts suggested the K enrichment could be an impact process [6,7]. This conclusion was reached using mineral compositions and detailed textural and element maps, information that is lost in whole rock data. Here, we report a new VHK basalt represented in thin section 14181,8, and test the hypothesis of assimilation and fractional crystallization generation as a method for the formation of the VHK basalts.  Methods & Petrography: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was conducted at the University of Notre Dame's Advanced imaging Center on a Magellan 400. SEM images were used to identify EPMA locations, and identify interesting textural features. Minerals and mesostasis glass compositions were quantified by Electron Probe Micro Analysis (EPMA). Analyses were carried out using a Cameca SX-50 also at the University of Notre Dame.  Analytical conditions for pyroxene ilmenite and olivine were 15kv and 25nA with a spot size of 1µm. When analyzing feldspars a diffuse beam with a spot size of 3µm was used to decrease the volatilization of Na and K. To analyze the inclusions found in Fig. 1 operational settings on the Microprobe were 15kv and 15nA, this was done to decrease the chance of damaging the inclusions, and for increased spatial resolution. Element maps were made with a Cameca SX50. Element maps were combined to make multielement maps using ImageJ (Fig. 2a,b). 14181,8 is displays a subophitic texture and is  predominantly comprised of pyroxene and plagioclase [8] (Fig.1).  Pyroxenes are subhedral pigeonite to augite ranging in size from 0.1-1mm and are intergrown with plagioclase. Pyroxene rims are occasionally present around olivine. Interestingly, there are rare occurrences of pyroxene containing olivine overgrowths (Fig. 2). Some olivines display resorption and pyroxene overgrowths while others do not. Plagioclase is typically euhedral to subhedral and is up to 0.5 mm. Olivine is uncommon, euhedral to anhedral, and <0.25mm. K-feldspar is typically found within the mesostasis between larger crystals, (some larger K-feldspars are ≤0.15mm) and euhedral to anhedral. Ilmenite chromite, Fe-Ni metal and a lone spinel (Mg(Cr,Al)2O4) are minor phases (<.01mm).  Figure 1: Photomosaic of 14181,8 in XP. Red outline = Fig 2a.  Blue outline = Fig 2b. Scale bar is 0.5mm.   Figure 2: (a) Element Map of a pyroxene rimmed by olivine with inclusions. Cyan = Ca, Magenta = Mg, Yellow = Al.  (Pyroxene - Olivine boundary in white). (b) Element map of pigeonite overgrown by fayalitic olivine. Al = red; Fe = blue; K = Yellow. Results: Pyroxene compositions range from pigeonite to augite (Fig. 3). Cores of pyroxenes typically consist of pigeonite (Mg# of 60 to 70), and an average Ti/Al ratio of 0.27 (1σ=0.09) (Fig. 4). Rims of larger pyroxenes, and all of some smaller ones, are made up of augite (Mg# 55-35), an average Ti/Al 1211.pdf

ratio of 0.49 (1σ=0.6). These observations of pyroxenes in 14181,8 are consistent with those of other VHKs [1-7]. Several exsolution features found in 14181,8 (Fig. 2a) have pyroxene compositions that vary from pigeonite to augite (see Fig. 3). Exsolved pyroxenes exhibit a range of Mg# of 60-70.   Figure 3: Pyroxene quadrilateral for 14181,8.  Figure 4: 14181,8 Pyroxene Mg# vs Ti/Al. Pigeonite = blue. Augite = Red. Olivine compositions are bimodal in composition being Fayalitic (Fo36-50) and Forsteritic (Fo60-73), consistent with the observations of [1]. Olivine is commonly rimed by pyroxene. As noted above, olivine, both Fo and Fa, form overgrowths on pyroxene (Fig. 2). Fayalitic olivine is consistently surrounded by Krich mesostasis (e.g., Fig. 2b), while the Forsteritic olivine is not.  Figure 5: Symplectite found in 14181,8 in-between a olivine and pyroxene. Subhedral to euhedral plagioclase crystals are present as part of the groundmass (≤0.1 mm) and as phenocrysts (~0.5 mm) and as a (0.5mm to <0.1mm). Compositions range from An85 to An95. K-feldspar is typically found within the groundmass (<0.1 mm); however larger (~0.15 mm) euhedral K-feldspars surrounded by K-rich glass are present.  Upon close inspection using SEM symplectites can be found between olivine (Mg# 65) and a pigeonite (En58-59). The largest symplectite (Fig. 5) is 22 m and the intergrowing crystals are too small to get reliable compositional data.  Discussion: The presence of exolution lamellae within pyroxene indicates relatively slow cooling of the magma, requiring 14181 to be intrusive (hypabyssal?) rather than a surface lava flow. Pyroxene with olivine overgrowths are an atypical feature (Fig. 2). While pyroxene overgrowing and resorbing olivine is typical in evolving lunar basalts as silica activity increases, in 14181,8 the reverse is seen (Fig. 2). The composition of olivine forming these overgrowths is variable: in some cases it is Forich (Fig. 2a), but in others it is Fo-poor (Fig. 2b). For Fo-rich olivine to form around pyroxene a decrease in silica activity is required. This could be facilitated by an influx of more primitive parental melt after the initial magma has started to crystallize.  A recharge event can account for forming Fo-rich olivine, but not Fo-poor. Fayalite is stable and can form in alkali and relatively silica–rich conditions (see Lc-Fa-SiO2 system) [9,10]. Fo-poor olivine in 14181 is accompanied by K-rich mesostasis and Kfeldspar (Fig. 2b) suggesting that it formed once Krich liquid infiltrated the basalt. The K-rich liquid would have been formed by the assimilation of granite, possibly through selective dissolution of feldspars rather than bulk granite assimilation. Interpretation: 14181,8 is a VHK basalt and is consistent with the findings of [1]. Initial crystallization was in a slow-cooling crystal magma chamber that resulted in pyroxene with exsolution features. Influx of hot, parental magma promoted overgrowth of Fo-rich olivine on pyroxene. This influx also could have resulted in selective granite assimilation that resulted in the stabilization of Fo-poor olivine that also formed overgrowths on pyroxene. This study demonstrates the need for detailed mineraological and textural examination of lunar samples in order to fully understand the petrogenesis of such samples. References.
