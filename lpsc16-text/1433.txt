(isabel.haase@tu-berlin.de)Introduction: The Apollo 17 mission is characterized by the  longest  traverse  path,  the  largest  samplemass returned and the largest number of recorded images.  To improve the cartographic  and geologic context  of  the  returned  samples  and  the  invaluable  "onsite"  imagery  we  determined  and  mapped  astronautand  hardware  positions  along  the  crew's  30 km longtraverse  path.  For  this,  historic  surface  images  andNarrow Angle Camera (NAC) images of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) [1] were jointlyanalyzed by applying network adjustments to angularmeasurements made in the surface images. Accurate  maps  of  the  landing  sites  and  the  Extravehicular  Activities  (EVAs)  routes  and  way-pointswill not only improve interpretation and reanalysis ofthe unique  Apollo observations,  but  also support  potential  future  landings  within  that  area,  e.g.  as  proposed by the so-called "Part Time Scientists" group ofthe Google Lunar X-PRIZE competition.LROC  NAC  DTM  and  Orthomosaic: LROCNAC stereo image pairs of the Taurus-Littrow Valleywith resolutions of 0.5 to 1.3 m/pixel were used to produce  a  1.5 m gridded  Digital  Terrain  Model  (DTM).The DTM consists of five stereo models and was generated  using  an  adapted  version  of  the  DLR  StereoPhotogrammetric Processing System [2], originally developed and  routinely  used  for  Mars  Express  HRSCimage  processing.  The  most  recent  SPICE  kernelswere integrated to account for lunar gravity models recovered by GRAIL [3], [4] and temperature dependentinfluences on the pointing of the camera [5]. The DTMwas used to ortho-rectify ten LROC NAC images  ofthat area, which were combined to a 0.5 m/pixel orthomosaic.  Coordinates  of  the  central  station  of  theApollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP)[6], which can be identified in one of the images, wereused for lateral reference. For vertical control we coregistered the NAC DTM to the cross-over improvedLOLA tracks available in that area [7].Determination of Astronaut and Equipment Positions: Ground based images taken by the astronautswere  used in combination  with orbital  images of thecurrent Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) missionto determine accurate positions of the astronauts at themoment  of  image  acquisition.  These  determinationswere  achieved  by  applying  the  geodetic  resectionmethod, where angular measurements made in the surface  images  are  accurately  tied  to  reference  pointsidentified in controlled LROC NAC orthoimages.  Bymeans  of  a  2D least-squares  network  adjustment  weassessed the position and pointing (azimuth angle) ofthe astronaut's camera. Individual camera locations ofat  least  four single frames per panorama  were  determined  with  accuracies  of  2 m and  better  (< 1 m formost cases), depending on the number of angular measurements  made in these frames and the distances  tothe observed features. If possible, single frames takenin all four directions were chosen and the mean of theadjusted camera positions was defined to be the finalpanorama station. Stereo views from two different locations provided by certain panoramic frames allowedmapping features which are not resolved in the LROCNAC images,  e.g.  small  ALSEP instruments,  the  remotely detonated Explosive Packages (EPs) or the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) in various positions.Traverse Station Maps (1:1,000): We determinedcamera  positions  for  all  of  the  station  panoramas,which were routinely taken at  each major  stop alongthe traverse (18 panoramas from 9 stations). Using calibrated  Hasselblad  cameras,  the  astronauts  usuallytook  two  panoramic  image  sequences  per  station,mainly for positioning and illustrative purposes. Basedon  our  determined  camera  locations,  the  respectiveparking position of the rover and EP positions were derived by triangulation. Scanned Hasselblad frames anddetailed descriptions of the three EVAs are available atwww.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17, for example.Station maps at a scale of 1:1,000 covering an areaof 70 m x 80 m on average were created based on the0.5 m-scale  LROC  NAC  orthomosaic.  For  example,Figure 1 shows the map of station 9, the only stationwhere three panoramas  were taken.  Although following  the  overall  design  of  the  planimetric  maps  published in 1973 by [8], we chose to only include details,for  which  locations  were  secured  by  our  analysis.Hence the sample sites were not incorporated. In addition to the station maps as shown in Figure 1, we prepared orthophotomaps  about  twice as large (145 m x170 m) to supply more details and a wider context tothe smaller area maps.ALSEP Maps  (1:1,000  and  1:3,000): Geolocations of the two (full) panoramas taken at the ALSEP1433.pdf

site were determined and, based on that, coordinates ofall of the ALSEP instruments were derived by applying triangulation.  Depending on the dimension of theparticular object, the determined geolocations of someof the instruments  could be visually affirmed by features imaged in the LROC NAC image. Here, an image taken from a low orbit altitude was used providinga pixel scale of 25 cm/pixel. With the primary focus being on the ALSEP instruments we created a map at a scale of 1:1,000 that covers an area of about 120 m x 110 m around the "Geophone  Rock",  including  the array of four Geophoneslocated south of the ALSEP central station. A secondorthophotomap at a somewhat  lower scale of 1:3,000covering  an  area  of  500 m x 770 m,  additionally  includes the region near the descent stage of the LunarModule (LM) standing about 196 m east of the ALSEPsite. This map gives a good overview of the extravehicular  activities  of  the  astronauts  close  to  the  LM,with their tracks visible in the image. It also includesthe final parking position of the LRV and the locationsof the four (out of eight) EPs which were deployed relatively close to the immediate landing site.Traverse Map (1:15,000): The determined coordinates were also integrated into a new Apollo 17 Traverse Map, covering an area of about 14 km x 12 kmof  the  Taurus-Littrow  Valley,  from  30.4294°  to30.9162° in longitude and from 19.9771° to 20.3639°in latitude. According to LRO project standards, planetocentric coordinates are related to the Mean Earth/Polar Axis (ME) lunar reference system. As the tracks ofthe Apollo rovers are mostly not detectable in  LROCNAC images and therefore cannot be traced, the routeof the astronauts between stations were reconstructedby  adapting  the  traverses  taken  from  the  NASAApollo 17 Traverse Map (sheet 43D1S2(25)) publishedin 1975 by the Defense Mapping Agency TopographicCenter (DMA TC).To serve as base of the map, the controlled LROCNAC orthomosaic was projected in a Transverse Mercator  Projection  with  true  scale  at  30.7°E  (= centralmeridian) using a sphere with R=1737.4 km as reference shape. The printed map has a scale of 1:15,000and  includes  a  graticule,  contour  lines  with  equidistances of 50 m and the astronauts' traverses and roverstops. Craters, massifs, and mountains are labeled withIAU-approved names  where  available  and with commonly  used  feature  names  elsewhere.  Center  coordinates  and  diameters  of  named  craters  were  re-measured for mapping purposes and are provided as supplementary information.Outlook: Currently we are preparing a comprehensive  report  on this  cartographic  study—starting  fromphotogrammetric  stereo  processing  to  the  final  mapproducts, including catalogs of the determined featurecoordinates. The Apollo 17 traverse map 1:15,000 andthe large scale station maps will be published via thePlanetary Data System (PDS). In addition to the printable PDF version, geospatial data file formats will bereleased, e.g. shapefile and .kml, for Geographic Information System (GIS) and Google Moon applications.References: [1] Robinson,  M.S.,  et  al.
