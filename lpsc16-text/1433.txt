(isabel.haase@tu-berlin.de) Introduction: The Apollo 17 mission is characterized by the  longest  traverse  path,  the  largest  sample mass returned and the largest number of recorded images.  To improve the cartographic  and geologic context  of  the  returned  samples  and  the  invaluable  "on site"  imagery  we  determined  and  mapped  astronaut and  hardware  positions  along  the  crew's  30 km long traverse  path.  For  this,  historic  surface  images  and Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) images of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) [1] were jointly analyzed by applying network adjustments to angular measurements made in the surface images. Accurate  maps  of  the  landing  sites  and  the  Extravehicular  Activities  (EVAs)  routes  and  way-points will not only improve interpretation and reanalysis of the unique  Apollo observations,  but  also support  potential  future  landings  within  that  area,  e.g.  as  proposed by the so-called "Part Time Scientists" group of the Google Lunar X-PRIZE competition. LROC  NAC  DTM  and  Orthomosaic: LROC NAC stereo image pairs of the Taurus-Littrow Valley with resolutions of 0.5 to 1.3 m/pixel were used to produce  a  1.5 m gridded  Digital  Terrain  Model  (DTM). The DTM consists of five stereo models and was generated  using  an  adapted  version  of  the  DLR  Stereo Photogrammetric Processing System [2], originally developed and  routinely  used  for  Mars  Express  HRSC image  processing.  The  most  recent  SPICE  kernels were integrated to account for lunar gravity models recovered by GRAIL [3], [4] and temperature dependent influences on the pointing of the camera [5]. The DTM was used to ortho-rectify ten LROC NAC images  of that area, which were combined to a 0.5 m/pixel orthomosaic.  Coordinates  of  the  central  station  of  the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP) [6], which can be identified in one of the images, were used for lateral reference. For vertical control we coregistered the NAC DTM to the cross-over improved LOLA tracks available in that area [7]. Determination of Astronaut and Equipment Positions: Ground based images taken by the astronauts were  used in combination  with orbital  images of the current Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) mission to determine accurate positions of the astronauts at the moment  of  image  acquisition.  These  determinations were  achieved  by  applying  the  geodetic  resection method, where angular measurements made in the surface  images  are  accurately  tied  to  reference  points identified in controlled LROC NAC orthoimages.  By means  of  a  2D least-squares  network  adjustment  we assessed the position and pointing (azimuth angle) of the astronaut's camera. Individual camera locations of at  least  four single frames per panorama  were  determined  with  accuracies  of  2 m and  better  (< 1 m for most cases), depending on the number of angular measurements  made in these frames and the distances  to the observed features. If possible, single frames taken in all four directions were chosen and the mean of the adjusted camera positions was defined to be the final panorama station. Stereo views from two different locations provided by certain panoramic frames allowed mapping features which are not resolved in the LROC NAC images,  e.g.  small  ALSEP instruments,  the  remotely detonated Explosive Packages (EPs) or the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) in various positions. Traverse Station Maps (1:1,000): We determined camera  positions  for  all  of  the  station  panoramas, which were routinely taken at  each major  stop along the traverse (18 panoramas from 9 stations). Using calibrated  Hasselblad  cameras,  the  astronauts  usually took  two  panoramic  image  sequences  per  station, mainly for positioning and illustrative purposes. Based on  our  determined  camera  locations,  the  respective parking position of the rover and EP positions were derived by triangulation. Scanned Hasselblad frames and detailed descriptions of the three EVAs are available at www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17, for example. Station maps at a scale of 1:1,000 covering an area of 70 m x 80 m on average were created based on the 0.5 m-scale  LROC  NAC  orthomosaic.  For  example, Figure 1 shows the map of station 9, the only station where three panoramas  were taken.  Although following  the  overall  design  of  the  planimetric  maps  published in 1973 by [8], we chose to only include details, for  which  locations  were  secured  by  our  analysis. Hence the sample sites were not incorporated. In addition to the station maps as shown in Figure 1, we prepared orthophotomaps  about  twice as large (145 m x 170 m) to supply more details and a wider context to the smaller area maps. ALSEP Maps  (1:1,000  and  1:3,000): Geolocations of the two (full) panoramas taken at the ALSEP  site were determined and, based on that, coordinates of all of the ALSEP instruments were derived by applying triangulation.  Depending on the dimension of the particular object, the determined geolocations of some of the instruments  could be visually affirmed by features imaged in the LROC NAC image. Here, an image taken from a low orbit altitude was used providing a pixel scale of 25 cm/pixel. With the primary focus being on the ALSEP instruments we created a map at a scale of 1:1,000 that covers an area of about 120 m x 110 m around the "Geophone  Rock",  including  the array of four Geophones located south of the ALSEP central station. A second orthophotomap at a somewhat  lower scale of 1:3,000 covering  an  area  of  500 m x 770 m,  additionally  includes the region near the descent stage of the Lunar Module (LM) standing about 196 m east of the ALSEP site. This map gives a good overview of the extravehicular  activities  of  the  astronauts  close  to  the  LM, with their tracks visible in the image. It also includes the final parking position of the LRV and the locations of the four (out of eight) EPs which were deployed relatively close to the immediate landing site. Traverse Map (1:15,000): The determined coordinates were also integrated into a new Apollo 17 Traverse Map, covering an area of about 14 km x 12 km of  the  Taurus-Littrow  Valley,  from  30.4294°  to 30.9162° in longitude and from 19.9771° to 20.3639° in latitude. According to LRO project standards, planetocentric coordinates are related to the Mean Earth/Polar Axis (ME) lunar reference system. As the tracks of the Apollo rovers are mostly not detectable in  LROC NAC images and therefore cannot be traced, the route of the astronauts between stations were reconstructed by  adapting  the  traverses  taken  from  the  NASA Apollo 17 Traverse Map (sheet 43D1S2(25)) published in 1975 by the Defense Mapping Agency Topographic Center (DMA TC). To serve as base of the map, the controlled LROC NAC orthomosaic was projected in a Transverse Mercator  Projection  with  true  scale  at  30.7°E  (= central meridian) using a sphere with R=1737.4 km as reference shape. The printed map has a scale of 1:15,000 and  includes  a  graticule,  contour  lines  with  equidistances of 50 m and the astronauts' traverses and rover stops. Craters, massifs, and mountains are labeled with IAU-approved names  where  available  and with commonly  used  feature  names  elsewhere.  Center  coordinates  and  diameters  of  named  craters  were  re-measured for mapping purposes and are provided as supplementary information. Outlook: Currently we are preparing a comprehensive  report  on this  cartographic  study—starting  from photogrammetric  stereo  processing  to  the  final  map products, including catalogs of the determined feature coordinates. The Apollo 17 traverse map 1:15,000 and the large scale station maps will be published via the Planetary Data System (PDS). In addition to the printable PDF version, geospatial data file formats will be released, e.g. shapefile and .kml, for Geographic Information System (GIS) and Google Moon applications.
