E-mail: perov@yarplaneta.ru.     Introduction: The successful forecasting of the appearance near the Earth of the hazardous bodies is an actual problem of the modern astronomy [1]. Below, in according with the work [1], we more carefully investigate the keyholes and jabbas [2] in the frame of the celestial mechanical system: the Sun with mass m1 - the perturbed body with mass m2 - the body with negligible small mass m3. For unperturbed motion bodies with mass of m2 and m3 moves along Keplerian's orbits in Oort's or Hill's clouds. We denote φ is an angle with vertex in the Sun between the direction opposite the direction at the perihelion of the body with mass m2 and the direction at the initial position of body with mass m3. For this value of φ the bodies of m2 and m3 are collided in unperturbed motion.   We find the value dvc (measured in radians) which should add to φ.  For  the new meaning of φ'= φ± dvc  the body m3, which in the initial moment of time moves along the circle orbit, last of all crosses the Earth's orbits in perturbed motion. m2 is varied between the limits from 10-9m1 to 10-8 m1.      Fundamental Equations:  Let's consider in the model of the planar restricted three body problem (masses of the bodies equal  m1, m2, m3) heliocentric Keplerian's motion of body with mass m2. Assume, the orbital eccentricity of this body is equal to e2, the corresponding perihelion's distance equals rp2.  The initial heliocentric distance of the body with mass m2 equals r20  and the orbit of the m3 is the circle of the radius of a30 (in initial moment of time). The differential equations of motion of bodies with mass of m2 and m3, in the system of reference with the origin in the center of the Sun, we present in the form [3]. ;)22rr 3221rmG(m            (1) .)(32332223331rrGmrmmG2333rrrr                (2) .2222cosve1pr               (3) Here, r2 and r3 are the heliocentrically radii-vectors of the bodies with mass m2 and m3. The point, placed under symbol, means differentiating in respect of Newtonian's time t, G is the gravitational constant, p2 is the orbital parameter of the second body (m2), v2 is the true anomaly of the m2, determined from the direction opposite the perihelion direction of the body with mass m2. r23 is a distance between m2 and m3.We  use the equation (4)      .221222pmmGdtdvr             (4) We receive the equation (5) instead of the equation (2)  222223223212cosvesinvedvddvd rr  42232333211cosve1prmmm r 2222222212)cosve(1sinvpcosvpmmm JI    .vcos))))(()))(222/32222223222232322232222322e-1psinvpcosve(1(ycosvpcosve1x)/sinvpcosve(1(ycosvpcosve1xJI                       (5)      Examples:  We put  e2=1, r2p=10000 AU, r20=60000 AU, a30=50000AU, G=1. m1=1(m1 is mass of the Sun) and find such n= m1/m2 and dvc that the condition r3 =r13<1 AU will be true. The unit of length is equal to 10000 AU. The results, in according with equation (5), are presented in figures (1) - (4).      Conclusion:  1. For m1/m2 =108  the corresponding interval of the "keyholes" (7.97.10-9<dvc<8.2.10-9 rad) is greater of the 2nd orders in respect of the interval of the "keyholes" (-5.2815.10-9 <dvc< -5.280001.10-9 rad) for m1/m2=1218740881.84.  2. So, we suppose  for the definite minimal  value of m2 - is less one thousandth mass of the Moon - in the considered model the body with mass of m3 does not cross the Earth's  orbit  (r13>1 AU)  for the arbitrary value of dvc. 3. For the given model of m2 and m3 motion the interval of 0<t<∞ 1010.pdf

(Equations (1) and (2)) turns into the interval of 0<v2 <2.π (The equation (5)). 4. The negligible variations of dvc for  m2 orbit facilitate the noticeable variations of semimajor axis and eccentricity of m3 orbit. 5. This celestial-mechanical model partially answers the questions:  a) what are originated some hazardous meteoroids?  b) what is a reason of appearance near the Sun of comets with the large semimajor axes and eccentricities of theirs orbits?
