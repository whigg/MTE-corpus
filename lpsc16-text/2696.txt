SPECTRAL CHARACTERISTICS OF DARK SLOPE STREAKS ON MARS: A GLOBAL SURVEY WITH CRISM.  E. S. Amador1, A. Mushkin1,2, and A. Gillespie1. 1University of Washington, Department of Earth and Space Sciences, 2Geological Survey of Israel.  Introduction: The formation and fading of low-albedo slope streaks have been observed across the midtropical latitudes of Mars since the Viking orbiters [1]. Two explanations have been established for slope streak formation: dust avalanches [2], and surface "staining" associated with transient brine seeps [3]. The latter formation model was adopted by [4] for a class of slope streak termed recurring slope lineae (RSL) [5]. Spectral data from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM; [6]) for RSL suggest in some cases spectrally featureless darkening [7] similar to that found for slope streaks in the Olympus Mons Aureole [3], and most recently, in four instances, CRISM revealed transient spectral signatures consistent with hydrated salts in association with surfaces with active RSL, thus supporting the "wet" formation mechanism [8]. Here, we examine the variability and evolution through time of CRISM spectra of fully resolved slope streaks across Mars and how they may relate to the reported variability of RSL spectra. We 1) conducted a comprehensive survey of the near-infrared (~1-3.5µm) spectral characteristics of slope streaks across the planet, and 2) examined the spectral changes associated with slope streaks fading over time. Care was taken to specifically look for spectral evidence of hydration (i.e., absorptions at ~ 1.4, 1.9 and 2.9 µm). Data and Methods: This study relied upon full resolution targeted (FRT; ~ 18 m/pixel) and half-resolution long (HRL; ~40 m/pixel) hyperspectral images from CRISM. The images were atmospherically corrected using standard volcano-scan techniques described in [9] and through additional techniques adapted from the current CRISM Analysis Tool (CAT) v.7.2.1. Spectral indices were produced similar to [10], specifically to look at the BD1900 index for evidence of hydration. CRISM images were spatially coregistered with Context Camera (CTX; ~6m/pixel) and/or High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE; >30 cm/pixel) images in JMARS. Alltogether, 51 CRISM images were analyzed in the Arabia, Amazonis, Olympus Mons, and northern Terra Sirenum regions (Fig. 1).  Spectral characteristics were determined by spectral ratios, with the dark slope streak as the numerator and an adjacent non-streaked sunlit slope, typically within the same image column, as the denominator.  Results: Global Survey. Slope streaks in Arabia tend to be the largest, up to several hundred m across and several km long, but spatially sparse. Slope streaks in Olympus Mons and Terra Sirenum are typically smaller (up to tens of m across) but more frequent [11, 12]. Slope streaks in Amazonis tend to be somewhere in between and more dynamic, recurring and fading within timescales of several years [13]. Regardless of the variability in their size-frequency distribution and activity time-scales, slope streaks in all CRISM images analyzed display flat spectral ratios from ~1.1-2.6 µm (Fig. 2), consistent with previous CRISM analyses of slope streaks in Olympus Mons [3] and RSL at several locations [7]. Observations at longer wavelengths (> 2.7 µm) were more variable and showed low signal:noise, decreasing our confidence in apparent absorptions.   Time series. We found ~25 slope streak sites with  multiple CRISM coverage, however it was rare to find a time series that included long-wavelength detector data (~1.-3.5µm). We looked at three such cases in detail. Here we present a time series in Naktong Valles, Arabia, centered around ~36.8 E, 0N (Fig. 3). We focus on three fully resolved slope streaks on the same slope, each on the order of 100 m in width and ~1 km in length Figure 1.

(~ 5x50 CRISM pixels). The streaks characteristic for this scene and remain stable, with no evidence of dynamic change during the 2007-2010 time period. Fig. 4 demonstrates that while the spectral ratios remain consistently flat/featureless, their offset and slope vary considerably over time. Because these three streaks appear visibly stable during this period, we attribute the variability in spectral offset to atmosphere. Interestingly, the variability in offset, due to atmosphere, for three adjacent streaks in this single location in Arabia, is comparable to the variability found in slope streak spectra across the planet (Fig. 2). Thus, while the offset of the ratio spectra appears to be governed by residual atmospheric effects, the lack of absorption feautres is robust spectral characteristic. Discussion/Conclusions: The remarkably constant flat/featureless near-IR spectra observed for fully resolved slope streaks across Mars indicate that these rdarkened surfaces are "dry", having no excess water/hydration in them with respect to their unaffected adjacent slopes. Similarly flat/featureless near-IR spectral ratios were also reported for RSL [7], which in some cases appear to show transient spectral absorptions consistent with hydration, strongly arguing in favor of the brine-seepage formation model [8]. The transient nature of these hydration features and the flat/featureless spectral ratios otherwise observed for RSL [7] suggest that within the seasonal timescale of their persistence, RSL may transition to a "dry" phase, in which they remain dark and are spectrally comparable to slope streaks.  Recognizing the "dry" phase in the post-formation evolution of RSL may have a significant impact on the calculated volumes of liquids involved with RSL. In addition, while some argue that spectral detection of transient surface hydration in RSL implies a genetic distinction from slope streaks, we argue that: 1) The spectral similarity between slope streaks and RSL during their "dry" phase suggests the opposite, and 2) The chances to capture the implied "wet" phase of slope streak formation are significantly lower given their longer annualdecadal timescales for recurrence on a given slope. Amazonis Planitia would likely be a favorable target for CRISM targeting to capture the transient "wet" phase of brine extrusion during slope streak formation, given the relatively short annual timescales of streak activity in that region.

From west to east, the streaks are represented by red, blue, and magenta spectra over the course of three years. Data from 2007, 2008, and 2010 come from image ID HRL00004A85_07, FRT0000AD74_07, and HRL00018612_07, respectively. For spectra from 2010, any apparent deviation from the typical flat (featureless) spectrum is very likely related primarily to noise/atmosphere/illumination and not to something real in the streak.  2696.pdf
