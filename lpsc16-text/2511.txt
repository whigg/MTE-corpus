Introduction: Wrinkle ridges are compressional tectonic features that are often utilized in geodynamic studies of the terrestrial worlds, including Mars where they are one of the most common features on the planet's surface [1]. They are up to 100's of km long, 10's of km wide, and 100's of m in relief with a quasi-linear trace in map view. They exhibit an asymmetric profile which consists of a narrow, sinuous ridge up to 10 km wide superimposed onto a broad arch 10's of km wide. Based on terrestrial analogs, wrinkle ridges are thought to form when layered volcanic sequences are deformed by folding above a blind (not-surface breaking) thrust fault which propagates into basement material and may become listric at depth [2,3]. Mechanical studies of martian wrinkle ridges have used elastic dislocation models, where material properties and fault geometry are varied in an attempt to match model results to observed topographic profiles [2,4,5]. These studies commonly assume a thrust fault dip of 30°. However, in recent work we analyzed a wrinkle ridge thrust fault exposed in the walls of Valles Marineris, finding a much lower dip, of ~15° [6]. This study builds on that previous work, using a Monte Carlo approach to constrain both the best-fit dip and the uncertainty.  Target: The feature considered in this study is a large ridge in Melas Chasma in central Valles Marineris, that extends ~70 km and descends ~5 km from the southern wall of the trough (Figs. 1 and 2). The ridge morphology differs from the rest of the trough walls in this part of Valles Marineris. We interpret the ridge to be the manifestation of an erosionally resistant fault plane associated with a prominent wrinkle ridge on the adjacent plateau [6]. A possible scenario for its formation is that the wrinkle ridge thrust fault acted as a conduit for the intrusion of magma, resulting in an erosion resistant fracture zone along the fault. The fault was then left as a high-standing ridge when the southern wall of Melas was eroded back during the enlargement of the trough. We observe that the Melas ridge crest profile has a distinct central section with shallow slope that is likely present where the erosion resistant material of the fault plane is exposed (Figure 3).  Methods: If the Melas ridge crest is controlled by erosion resistant material emplaced along a fault surface, then the best-fit plane to the ridge should describe the geometry of the fault. We used HRSC topography to generate a set of 664 points describing the ridge Figure 1. MOLA topography map of Valles Marineris with the target area (Figure 2) highlighted in red.  Figure 2.

We then used a Metropolis-Hastings Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm [7] to identify the best-fit and most probable fault planes, and to quantify the uncertainty in the solution. The inversion treated the fault dip and strike as free parameters and evaluated the models using the RMS misfit between the fault plane and the points along the ridge crest.   Figure 4.

Results: After 100,000 iterations, the best-fit plane has a strike of N21.6°E and a dip of 12.2° to the NW, with an RMS misfit of 269 m. These values are in agreement with results of the analytic solution in the previous study [6]. The low RMS misfit relative to the 2.5 km relief of the truncated section suggests that the fault surface is well approximated by a plane, meaning that significant listric structure is not observed up to 4.5 km below the plateau surface. This inferred planar character of the fault is in agreement with our earlier analysis in which we calculated the dip as a function of distance along the ridge and did not observe a decrease in dip as would be expected if the fault were listric [6].  The model strike is aligned with the measured wrinkle ridge orientation of N18°E. The 1σ range for the dip included values from 6.5° to 20.6°.  The most commonly assumed dip angle of 30° can be excluded at the 2 confidence level. Discussion: The results of this analysis quantify the best-fit solution and uncertainty in the fault plane orientation derived from the exposure of erosion resistant material emplaced along a thrust fault associated with a wrinkle ridge. The result is a fault geometry with a dip of ~12° to the NW, in agreement with the dip direction inferred from topographic profile asymmetry [2,4,8]. However, the dip of this thrust fault is more shallow than the 30° dip that is typically assumed in many models [2,4,8,9,10]. These results could be used to more accurately constrain models specific to the region and may be generally applicable to wrinkle ridges in other regions or planets as well. We conclude that the dips of wrinkle-ridge-associated thrust faults can be much shallower than expected in some cases. If this shallow dip is characteristic of martian wrinkle ridges, there are broad implications for geodynamic studies. For example, horizontal strain may be a factor of 1.82.5 greater than current estimates based on surface relief or a factor of 1.1 greater than estimates based on displacement-length relationships [10]. Applying these results to analyses of global contraction from cooling would predict that Mars has experienced a greater decrease in planetary radius than previously thought.
