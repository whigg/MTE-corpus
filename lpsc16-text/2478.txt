Over the past 20 years, rover missions have demonstrated successful deployment of scientific payloads for robotic field geology on both of these bodies [Chhaniyara, et al., 2012]. These payloads include instruments to identify the mineralogy and elemental chemistry of in-situ soils.  However, these measurements do not tell the entire story.  Mechanical properties (i.e., geotechnical studies) proved essential to support hardware development for human presence on the Moon. Still, instruments for geotechnical properties have been underrepresented since the conclusion of Apollo and have been largely absent from our explorations of other worlds beyond the Moon.    SPARTTA is a low cost, low mass (< 1 kg), and low power (< 5 watt) deployable rover-arm mounted contact instrument that will provide a new capability for measurements of the physical properties of in-situ soils on a planetary surface. SPARTTA is focused on providing these geotechnical analyses by directly measuring the physical properties of in-situ soils. SPARTTA is able to characterize the mechanical (shear and compressive strength), thermal (conductivity), and electrical (dielectric spectroscopy and triboelectric charging) properties of soils through the integration of five specialized tools into a small, portable instrument, analogous to the Swiss army knife. All of the SPARTTA components are based on classical terrestrial soil analytical tools. Each component will be used to measure a specific physical property of a planetary regolith and will be easily adaptable to a wide range of surface environments for any future planetary robotic surface mission.    Why is characterizing the physical properties of soils important?  Understanding the geologic history of soil formation is severely limited without basic geotechnical information. Presentday lander technology relies heavily on models to predict hardware/soil interactions during the final stages of descent and touchdown, for robotic arm manipulations of surface materials, and for rover wheel/soil trafficability. Many of these models rely on low-resolution orbital remote sensing observations.  In addition, existing plans and mobility control algorithms use these models to estimate the physical characteristics of the surface and its environment, which limits their predictive capability in complex terrains. SPARTTA will provide much-needed data with comprehensive measurements of the physical properties of planetary soils. The knowledge acquired from SPARTTA will provide data that can be used to refine and enhance these models.

SPARTTA is a rover arm-mounted planetary soil instrument that will be comprised of multiple tools in a compact package. The size is 16 cm from the top to the tip, with a chassis diameter of 10 cm at its widest point. The CST component is not shown in this image. 2478.pdf

 will in turn allow improved prediction for landing safely, and effective surface operations involving robotic arm activities and human systems in complex terrains. Our data will also have the potential to contribute to the design of future robotic hardware development, mobility systems, and mission architectures, as well as human exploration activities where surface materials will be excavated and processed.   The objective of the proposed instrument is to demonstrate a new, miniaturized soil probe (SPARTTA) capable of measuring the following:  Geo-Mechanical Properties (Shear Strength, Compressive Strength)  Acquiring a direct measurement of the shear strength of soil (Vane Shear Strength tester - VSS) is important for defining the magnitude of the shear stress (e.g. load bearing capacity and internal shear) for determining the stability of slopes on crater rims, stratigraphic layers, and dunes.  Acquiring compressive strength (Compressive Strength Tester - CST) of undisturbed soils is important for identifying their pedogenesis and determine their behavior under loads.  Geo-Electrical Properties (Dielectric Spectroscopy)  Acquiring a low frequency dielectric constant measurement of a planetary soil offers a powerful and unambiguous technique to quantify the water/ice content (Soil Moisture Probe - SMP), as well as characterizing the physiochemical properties associated with past or present geological processes.  Geo-Thermal Properties (Thermal Conductivity)  Acquire an in-situ measurement of the thermal properties of regolith (Thermal Conductivity Probe - TCP) is important for understand the diurnal temperature cycle and the physical weathering properties affecting modern soils.   Electrostatics (Triboelectric Charging)  Acquiring a direct measurement of how the individual fine-grained particles charge is important because induced charging of materials controls particle transport in much the same way it affects particle movement in terrestrial dry environments (ELectrostatic Sensor Array - ELSA).  Relevance to NASA and Science Community: It is believed that future robotic and human missions will emphasize in-situ exploration in a variety of planetary environments, such as the surfaces of Mercury, Venus, Mars, Moon, planetary satellites (e.g. Phobos, Deimos, Europa, Titan, etc.), comets and asteroids. But NASA's vision for exploration goes beyond visiting these planetary bodies remotely. Instead their main goal is to have astronauts land and set foot on some of these planetary soils. Understanding these foreign materials is crucial for the success of these future planetary missions.  A key innovation of SPARTTA is its state-of-theart miniature packaging approach which enables in-situ comprehensive analysis of the physical properties of soils on any planetary body (e.g. asteroids, comets, etc.) with a single compact instrument. SPARTTA will specifically address several high-priority science goals identified in the Decadal Study regarding the physical properties of planetary soils, liquid water/waterice detection, and electrostatics for bodies as diverse as comets, Trojan asteroids, Mars and the Moon [Planetary Science Decadal Study, 2013]. Additionally, it will provide valuable data to assist engineers in designing landing, drilling, coring, and sample acquisition systems for future Discovery, New Frontiers missions, or flagship landed missions. 2478.pdf
