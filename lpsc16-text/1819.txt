Introduction: Accurate lunar elevation data are necessary to understand the origin and evolution of the Moon and to plan lunar exploration and development. "DEM_TCOrtho", an elevation data set produced from observation data captured by SELENE (KAGUYA) Terrain Camera (TC), has been released. Here we report validation results for DEM_TCOrtho where Lunar laser Ranging Retro Reflectors (LRRR) were delivered by Apollo missions. SELENE TC DTM and DEM: The SELENE (KAGUYA) Terrain Camera (TC) acquired stereo-pair data [1], from which a set of lunar global digital terrain models (DTMs) was produced and archived with corresponding image data as DTM_TCOrtho [2,3]. The products are being release from the SELENE (Kaguya) data archive site (LINK1). The DTMs were mosaicked to produce "DTM_MAP"[2,3]. TC DTMs that are sources of DTM_MAP have deficits for dark shadows and too bright locations where proper images were not obtained.  A global digital elevation model (DEM) was released in 2013 as "SLDEM 2013"[3], a revised globally mosaicked elevation data map based on TC DTMs and supplemented by DTMs from SELENE MI data and elevation data from LRO LOLA data for deficits of TC DTMs. The DTM_MAP product currently (January 2016) being released is a one-generation older DTM_TCOrtho product (ver. 2). SLDELM 2013 was based on the latest DTM_TCOrtho product (ver. 3).  SELENE TC performed both stereoscopic and monoscopic observations. Monoscopic observation data don't have stereo pairs. They thus do not yield an elevation model and is not ortho-rectified. However, even monoscopic image data could be ortho-rectified by applying elevation data independently. All monoscopic data were ortho-rectified by using the corresponding SLDEM 2013 data and are being released as DEM_TCOrtho. TC DTMs from the data acquired by stereoscopic observation were also revised using SLDEM 2013. A corresponding area of the SLDEM 2013 was adjusted for each TC DTM and supplemented with elevation data of the SLDEM 2013 product for portions that were too dark or too bright. Such supplemented elevation data and their corresponding ortho-rectified image data based on stereoscopic observation have been archived as DEM_TCOrtho, together with the set of DTMs and image data based on monoscopic observation. Validation of SELENE DEM ortho product for Apollo LRRR locations: We validated elevation data of DEM_TCOrtho where Lunar laser Ranging Retro Reflectors (LRRRs) were installed by Apollo 11, 14, and 15 missions. Ranges to the LRRRs have been measured by shooting laser beams at the reflector and measuring the round-trip time of the beam since the early 1970s [4].  We compare the elevation data of DEM_TCOrtho with those published in Williams et al. (2008) [5] (Table 1) for the Apollo LRRRs. TC image resolution is originally10m/pixel from the SELENE nominal altitude of 100km. Therefore, it is a little difficult to clearly identify the Apollo LRRR locations in the TC images. We determine the locations in the TC DEM by superposing the corresponding ortho-rectified images with Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) images of the LRRR locations (e.g. Fig. 1).  Validation results at the Apollo 11 LRRR location are in Table 2. There are several DEM_TCOrtho data for the location, based on TC monoscopic and stereoscopic observations. The differences of elevation are within 11m.  Elevation data in DEM_TCOrtho based on monoscopic observation from SLDEM 2013; if the locations are the same, their elevations should be the same. However, elevation differences occur in orthorectification. Summary: We validated DEM_TCOrtho at the Apollo 11. (The validation for other LRRR locations are on going). The elevation differences between the data from the laser-beam measurement and the DEM_TCOrtho products are within 11m (tentative) for the location. Possible errors are perhaps in orthorectification and difficulties in identifying the LRRR locations on the TC ortho image corresponding to the DTMs.   Table 1. Apollo LRRR locations.
