MODELLING THE THERMAL SIGNATURE OF LARGE ERUPTIONS ON IO.  A. G. Davies1, I. de Pater2, K. de Kleer2, L. Wilson3, J. W. Head4.  1Jet Propulsion Laboratory-California Institute of Technology, 4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena, CA 91109, USA (Ashley.Davies@jpl.nasa.gov), 2University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. 3Lancaster University, Lancaster, Lancs., UK. 4Brown University, Providence, RI, USA.  Introduction: Massive, voluminous, low-silica content basalt lava flows played a major role in shaping the surfaces of the terrestrial planets and the Moon [1,2] but the mechanisms of eruption, including effusion rate profiles and flow regime, are often obscure. However, eruptions of large volumes of lava and the emplacement of thick, areally extensive silicate lava flows are extant on the volcanic jovian moon Io [3], thus providing a template for understanding how these processes behaved elsewhere in the Solar System.   We have modelled data of the largest of these eruptions to constrain eruption processes from the evolution of the wavelength variation of the resulting thermal emission [4]. We continue to refine our models to further constrain eruption parameters. We focus on large “outburst” eruptions, large lava fountains which feed lava flows [5] which have been directly observed on Io from the Galileo spacecraft [6,7].  Outburst data continue to be collected by large ground-based telescopes [8-10]. These data have been fitted with a sophisticated thermal emission model to derive eruption parameters such as areal coverage and effusion rates. Io Flow Model: Multispectral near-infrared data of volcanic thermal emission from Io’s largest eruptions have been fitted with “single-temperature, single area” and “dual-temperature, dual-area” models (e.g. [3]), and the more sophisticated numerical Io Flow Model (IFM) [5]. The IFM incorporates the cooling behaviour of exposed basalt or komatiite on Io to derive the expected thermal emission spectrum and power output for an evolving outburst eruption [e.g., 5,8-11].  The IFM outputs desired eruption parameters: the range of temperatures and areas present, and the areal coverage rate. If a flow thickness is applied, then an effusion rate can be calculated. A dual-component IFM originally developed to fit Galileo Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer data of the 1997 Pillan eruption [11] has been used to fit ground-based data of eruptions at Tupan and Sui Jen Paterae [10] (e.g., Figure 1). The use of a dual-IFM component model is justified in these cases as (1) there is sufficient improvement in the model fit to the data, and (2) this arrangement more accurately reflects the likely temperature and area distrubution of the ongoing eruption. The most active phase of an outburst eruption is likely to have an active vent, dominated by lava fountains and a roiling, rapidly overturning lava cauldron (Figure 2). For this IFM component, the lava surface temperature is restricted to a narrow high temperature range. The second IFM component represents the enlarging lava flow field. There is a much greater range of lava surface temperatures here, a function of the duration of emplacement. This model is particularly useful for interpreting infrared data on Io’s largest eruptions. As the eruption evolves, and the areas of both IFM components change (the vent component decreasing with time, the flow component increasing with time), so does the integrated thermal emission spectrum.

Variable effusion rate:  Wadge (1981) [12] proposed an exponential decay in effusion rate for certain eruptions based on the relaxation of stress on a magma chamber. While this function is applicable to many basaltic effusive eruptions on Earth, it is certainly not universal [13].  However, many of the largest eruptions on Io do appear to follow a Wadge-like effusion rate 1575.pdf

decay [8,11].  With this in mind, recent work incorporated a variable effusion rate profile to determine the likely peak eruption rates for the August 2013 eruptions at Heno and Rarog Paterae [8] and to re-examine the Pillan 1997 NIMS data with the improved model.   Rarog and Heno Paterae. Time-series data are suggestive of an exponential Wadge-like decrease in effusion rate from the observed peak value. Assuming a flow thickness of 10 m [7], peak effusion rates were estimated to be 5 x 104 m3/s at Heno P. and 105 m3/s at Rarog P. [8].  In a few days, flows covered 600 km2 at Rarog P. and 1300 km2 at Heno P.   Pillan 1997.  A re-examination of the 1997 June 28 Pillan NIMS data using the variable effusion rate model yields a new constraint on the duration of the eruption, suggesting a peak effusion rate of 1.3 x 104 m3/s on day 5 of a 130-day eruption. When observed by NIMS in June 1997, this episode had been erupting for ~33 days (Figure 3).   Figure 3.  Pillan, Io, 1997. Thermal emission spectrum on Day 33 of a 130-day eruption, with peak effusion rate of 1.26 x 104 m3/s on day 5.  Vent area (dash-dot line) is 23 km2 at 1400 K. Flows (dashed line) include a small crack fraction at lava eruption temperature.    Dual-IFM fit to outburst 201308C:  Figure 4 shows a dual IFM fit to the outburst data from 2013 August 29 [9].  Unlike the fits to the Rarog P. and Heno P. data, this fit uses an ultramafic lava model with an eruption temperature of 1900 K. The dual IFM yields a high-temperature component (probably the active vent) covering 23 km2 at temperatures very close to the eruption temperature of 1900 K.  The oldest surface temperature is ≈1800 K.  The second component, interpreted as lava flows, has a surface temperature range from 1900 K down to 485 K, an area of 1425 km2, and a maximum  eruption duration of 6 days.  Any longer than this and the eruption, if wellestablished, would have been detected on 2013 August 23. These numbers imply a time-averaged effusion rate (for 10-m thick flows) of ≈2.8 x 104 m3/s.  The peak effusion rate was almostly certainly much higher.  Figure 4. 201308C outburst [9] dual-IFM fit.  Total emitted power from this model fit is 23 TW.  Work in progress:  We have now created a number of tools for investigating and constraining effusion rate for Io’s largest eruptions.  It remains for all of the components to be integrated into a single model with rheological properties dependent on flow regime and the effects of heat loss. The crucial advance on previous estimates of lava flow emplacement on Io [e.g., 6] is that, by keeping track of the temperature distribution on the surface of the lava flows (a function of flow regime and varying effusion rate) the integrated thermal emission spectrum can be synthesized.  As new large telescopes come on line, the temporal resolution of Io observations continues to improve.  There is also the prospect of multiple spacecraft in the jovian system in the 2020s. Thus, model output can be further constrained by comparison with multi-spectral observations of the eruptions as they wax and wane.
