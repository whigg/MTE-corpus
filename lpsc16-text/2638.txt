Introduction: Enceladus’ water vapor and ice particle plume [1,2,3] is a key source of information for deciphering the nature and properties of the moon’s interior, including its subsurface ocean. The extensive remote sensing observations of the plumes using multiple sensors onboard the Cassini spacecraft have provided numerous insights, including the presence of water vapor and ice particles, organics [4] and nano silica [5]. The observations have also revealed the modulation of plume brightness by the orbital position of Enceladus around Saturn [6,7].  The near-infrared observations of Enceladus’ plume represent an important dataset for constraining the properties of the plumes’ water-ice particles. Earlier studies have determined the particle size and velocity distributions in the plume [8] which are important for understanding the plausible formation mechanism of the plume particles. More recently, high spatial resolution observations of the plume have enabled the characterization of individual fissure eruptions [9]. The near-infrared data, however, has not yet been utilized to its full potential.   Here, we probe the spectral diversity of the plume water-ice particles in the near infrared region and gather the insights this diversity can provide about the plume’s formation conditions in Enceladus’ interior. Dataset and Methodology: We use infrared observations of Enceladus’ plume made by Cassini Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS), which covers the wavelength range from 0.35 µm to 5.2 µm in 352 spectral channels [10]. Here, we have focused our investigations between 0.88 µm - 4 µm, guided by the presence of diagnostic water-ice absorption band around 3 µm as well as signal to noise considerations. VIMS observations of the plume have been taken at many different viewing geometries, spatial resolutions and orbital positions. We are systematically analyzing and comparing these observations in order to document variations and identify trends. An important aspect of the analysis is effective background removal. Due to the faint character of the plume, the signal is quite weak (I/F ~ 0.001). At the same time, the instrumental background and E-ring material (which is sourced from the plume itself) provide significant background which needs to be removed before any interpretations of the plume signal can be made. The background has been removed from each of the observation by subtracting the spectral average of a region that is located away from the plume. Subsequently, spectral signatures of the plume have been obtained by sampling the plume region close to its origin near the surface. The plume signatures fade away rapidly with increasing altitude and therefore it is important to sample as close to the surface as possible. Results:  We observe several interesting variations in the spectral character of the plume based on different VIMS observations. In view of number of variables (phase angle, orbital position, spatial resolution) associated with the observations, we have sub-divided the spectral data into different categories based on specific criteria: we have considered phase angles around 160, orbital phases between 90-130 and spacecraft-Enceladus distances less than 200,000 km. Several other criteria have been defined to group observations with similar observational conditions. There are at least four parameters that have been observed to vary in the plume spectra (Figure 1) based on the analysis so far: (A) 1-2 µm Spectral Slope: There are subtle variations in the spectral slope between 1-2 µm that can be observed across different observations. These range from relatively flat spectra (Figure 1, #a) to slightlty redder spectra (Figure 1, #d). Our preliminary observations seem to indicate that observations taken at apocenter (when the moon is farthest from Saturn) have a redder slope compared to the the observations taken when Enceladus was closer to Saturn. (B) 2-2.6 µm Spectral Slope: The slope in this region sometimes just follows the trend of the preceding spectral region (1-2 µm) but also can be more negative (bluer). The trend in this region affects the shape of the 3µm water-ice absorption band leading to either a smoothly changing slope while transitioning into the absorption band (Figure 1, #c) or a sudden change in the slope between inside and outside of the absorption band (Figure 1, #a, #b).       (C) 3 µm Water-ice Band Shape: There are many components of the absorption band that exhibit observable differences between the various datasets. The absorption band generally has a ‘V-shape’ but often this symmetry is complicated by a distortion in the band shape around 3.2 µm (Figure 1, #c). We have also reported the presence of the 3.2 µm asymmetry earlier based on the analysis of very high spatial resolution VIMS observations of the individual fissures [9]. A related observation is the variability in the width of the absorption band on either side of the band minimum. 2638.pdf

While in certain cases, it is distinctively narrow (Figure 1, #d), in other cases, the shape of the band around the band minimum is broad.     Figure 1: Example spectra highlighting the spectral diversity of the plume based on the analysis so far. Note the variation in spectral slope, band width and band shape. The source spectral cubes from bottom (magenta) to top (red) are V1635817250, V1635815493, V1635816274 and V1511802247 respectively.   (D) Continuum brightness variations across the absorption band: The brightness at the two ends of the 3 µm absorption band varies among the observations. In some cases, both ends have comparable brightnesses (Figure 1, #a, #b) while in other cases, the long wavelength end of the absorption band is distinctively lower in brightness compared to the short-wavelength end (Figure 1, #c, #d). This observation is also partly complicated by the slope trend between 2-2.6 µm, since it affects the identification of the short-wavelength end of the 3µm water-ice absorption band. Discussion: The observed spectral diversity represents important information that can be translated into physical properties of the water-ice particles. This information could then be used to understand the conditions under which the water-ice particles are forming and the plausible formation and acceleration processes. Since plume brightness is known to be modulated by the orbital position of Enceladus around Saturn, the temporal record of the spectral properties would lend further insights into the dominant controlling factors. Our preliminary interpretations of the observed spectral variability are: i) The observed slope variations between 1-2 µm and 2-2.6 µm indicate differences in the particle size distributions being produced in the plume. Since the wavelength range of the observations is comparable to the particle sizes, the spectral slope is a direct indicator of the particle size trends. The observed slope variations may therefore be indicating small-scale variations in the relative production rates of water-ice particles of different sizes at different times. It is plausible to have such variations because significant variations in the plume’s brightness have been observed as Enceladus comes close to and goes further away from Saturn.  ii) The variations in band shape are also likely linked to the particle size distribution. We have recently shown through Mie-theory-based spectral modeling [11] that the 3.2 µm asymmetry can be produced by the presence of particle sizes > 5µm. The presence of such large particles also widens the region around the band minimum, increasing the band width. Conversely, the absence of large particles would narrow the band.  Implications: The information about water-ice particle sizes, their distribution and variation through time represents an important input in understanding the functioning of Enceladus’ plume and may help in the development of more informed models. Enceladus’ plume studies are also important in view of potential detection of plumes on Europa and Ceres [12, 13] and may provide the much needed knowledge to plan and analyze future observations at these planetary bodies.
