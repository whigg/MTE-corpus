All SAMevolved gas analyses have yielded a multitude of volatiles (e.g, H2O, SO2, H2S, CO2, CO, NO, O2, HCl) [1,2,3,4,5]. The objectives of this work are to 1) Characterize the evolved H2O, SO2, CO2, and O2 gas traces of sediments analyzed by SAM through sol 1178, 2) Constrain sediment mineralogy/composition based on SAM evolved gas analysis (SAM-EGA), and 3) Discuss the implications of these results releative to understanding the geochemical history of Gale Crater. Materials & Methods: Rocknest (RN) is an eolian drift material that occurs 50 m from the John Klein (JK) and Cumberland (CB) lacustrine mudstones.  Windjana (WJ) is a fluvial sandstone stratigraphically higher and located 4 km to the SW of  JK and CB. The Confidence Hills (CH), Mojave (MJ), Telegraph Peak (TP), and Buckskin (BK) fluvial/lacustrine mudstones occur above WJ near the base of Mt. Sharp. The unaltered Big Sky (BY) and altered Greenhorn (GH) materials are eolian sandstones that are above BK (Fig. 1). Rocknest was acquired with a scoop while the other samples were drilled (1.6 cm diameter x 6 cm deep) from sedimentary rock. All analyzed samples were sieved to less than 150 µm. Samples delivered to the SAM oven were heated (~35 ˚C min-1) from ambient to ~860˚C. The evolved gases were swept from the oven by a He stream (~0.8 sccm; 25 mbar) to a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) for identification. Evolved gases (e.g., H2O, CO2, etc.) released at characteristic temperatures from volatile bearing phases were used to identify mineral or organic phases. Results/Discussion: Water - All samples contain H2O (~1-2 wt.%, Fig. 1) and have releases <~450oC that can be attributed to atmospherically adsorbed water, structural water in amorphous phases, phyllosilicate interlayer H2O, hydrated salts (e.g. bassanite, perchlorate, chlorate,), and/or akaganeite dehydroxylation [1]. The 450-500oC peaks in the CH, MJ, and TP traces can be attributed to H2O from dehyroxylation of jarosite detected by CHEMIN [7]. The 750-800oC peaks in CB, JK, and MJ traces result from smectite dehydroxylation [2]. The wide >~500oC peak in BK, BY, and GH can be attributed to glass matrix, vesicle, and/or trapped magmatic water in x-ray amorphous phases (e.g., volcanic  Figure 1.

SO2 - Sulfur dioxide was mostly released above 500°C (Fig. 2). More SO2 evolved from WJ, Murray Formation (CH, MJ, TP, BK), and altered Stimson (GH) (2.6 to 6.5 wt.% SO3) than Sheepbed Mudstone (CB, JK) and less altered Stimson (BY) (0.2-0.7 wt.% SO3) samples.. The SO2 release temperatrures are consistent with Fe- or Al-sulfates but the non-detection of Fe or Al sulfates by CheMin in  RN, WJ, BY, and GH suggest that these sediments contain  amorphous or trace crystalline Fe and/or Al sulfate or adsorbed sulfate [3,9,10]. CheMin detection of sulfides in JK and CB suggest that partial Fe-sulfide oxidation to Fe-sulfate may have released SO2. Some SO2 evolved from in CH, MJ, and TP is attributed to the thermal decomposition of jarosite detected by CheMin [7]. Jarosite cannot account for all of the evolved SO2; thus some SO2 could be derived from amorphous Fe/Al sulfates. CB exhibited a low SO2 release at ~300oC (Fig. 2), which is coincident with O2 evolution from oxychlorine thermal decomposition (not shown) and likely resulted from sulfide oxidation directly to SO2. Another possible source of evolved SO2 in some sediments (e.g., RN, JK, CB, GH) could be 8 40x 10 4 800600400200 Temperature (ºC) 1.0 0.0 x1 05 6 0x 10 4 5 0x 10 4 2.0 1.0 0.0 x1 05 1.0 0.0x 10 5 8 40x 10 4 4 20 x1 04 6 0x 10 4 3 0x 10 4 TP MJ CH WJ CB JK RN BK BY GH -4520m -4520m -4478m -4461m -4453m -4460m -4447m -4434m -4434m -4518m ST M K SH   Fig. 2.

CO2 -  CO2 releases have been detected over the entire SAM temperature range (Fig. 3). Atmospherically adsorbed CO2 and SAM background decomposition products are candidates for CO2 evolved at <200°C.  All samples exhibit CO2 releases between 200 and 450°C which could be contributions from SAM background and/or martian organics. However, oxalate derived from meteoritic sources could also evolve CO2 between 200 and 700°C [12]. CO2 releases between 500 and 700°C are also consistent with carbonates in RN, TP, and GH. Subtle CO2 releases >700°C are candidates for a refractory organic source in RN, CH, MJ, BK, BY, and GH [13]. O2 - All samples evolve O2 below 550°C with three sediments (CH, MJ, BK) yielding O2 releases above 600°C (Fig.4). All O2 releases below 550°C are attributed to oxychlorine (e.g., chlorate/perchlorate) decomposition while sulfate thermal decomposition is likely providing O2 above 600°C. The variation of O2 release termperaures below 500°C is likely caused by variation in oxychlorine cations and/or variation in mineral species that catalyzed oxychlorine thermal decomposition.   Conclusions: SAM-EGA results demonstrate that Gale Crater sediments have been exposed to alkaline (phyllosilicates, carbonates) and acidic solutions (Fe/Al-sulfate). Despite the presence of highly oxidized minerals (chlorates/perchlorates), CO2 evolution temperatures are consistent with the persistence of  carbon oxidation states ranging from reduced carbon in Gale Crater sediments though oxidized C (oxalates, carbonates). These results demonstrate that despite oxidizing/acidic geochemistry, the preservation of reduced organic biosignatures on Mars is possible.     Fig. 3. Evolved CO2 detected by SAM-EGA.    Fig. 4.
