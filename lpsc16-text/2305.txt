Introduction:  Dhofar 309 and 730 are minor to moderately weathered anorthositic impact-melt breccias [1]. They are considered to be related to a large pairing group comprising fifteen meteorites relatively Mg-rich and with lower Th and REE contents compared to most lunar feldspathic meteorites [2,3]. Dhofar 309 is the only partly fusion crusted meteorite of this clan, in which other members lack fusion crust. It is different in texture and mineral chemistry to the other paired meteorites [4]. Here we report preliminary data of an 40 Ar39 Ar study of Dhofar 309 and 730. The high-resolution stepwise heating analyses were performed on whole rock samples weighing 23.6  mg and 22.6 mg, respectively. Results: 40 Ar39 Ar chronology. The release patterns of Dhofar 309 and 730 show two major distinct reservoirs - low temperature (˂900°C) and high temperature (>1100°C)  - similar to other lunar impact melt breccias. The high temperature release is typical of strongly shocked or melt rocks [5]. The K/Ca spectra of these meteorites are indistinguishable. K concentrations of 109 and 142 ppm are typical of lunar feldspathic rocks. The age spectra of the samples corrected for trapped primordial argon with ( 40 Ar/ 36 Ar)trap=1±1 are saddle-shaped with  excess ages up to ~7 Ga at low temperatures (common for desert meteorites contaminated by terrestrial atmospheric argon) and increasing  ages from 3.5 to 4.5 Ga at the last ~50% of the fractional 39 Ar release (Fig. 1).   Fig. 1 K/Ca and age spectra of Dhofar 309. А trapped argon component of air-like composition is identified in a three isotope correlation plot for temperature fractions up to 1060°C of Dhofar 309. The temperature fractions of 1180-1600°C contain trapped argon with 40Ar/36Ar ratio of 313±20 (2). The correction for trapped argon composition results in rather flat stepwise increasing age spectrum of Dhofar 309 with the last total reset age of ~3.8 Ga and secondary 40Ar loss of ~3 Ga (Fig. 1).  The inverse isochron plot of  Dhofar 730 displays arrays indicating the presence of trapped argon with air-like composition for 400-1080°C and with ratios of ( 40 Ar/ 36 Ar)trap = 92 ± 4 (2) for 1140-1600°C (Fig. 2).  The age spectrum corrected for these trapped components shows apparent ages ranging from ~1.5 Ga (first 50% of the fractional 39 Ar release) to ~3 Ga at high temperatures.    Fig. 2.

The concentration of 38 Arcos is 22.0 and 19.6 ×10 -9 cm 3 STP/g in Dhofar 309 and 730, comprising 80% and 59% of 38 Artotal, respectively. The CRE age spectra of both meteorites demonstrate broad age plateaus extending over ~80% of the total 37 Ar release, the ages of which depend on the value of the production rate. Using the production rate of 38 Arcos (P38) for 4π irradiation determined according to the method of [6] and chemical composition reported by [3], the CRE ages of Dhofar 309 and 730 are ~12 and ~8 Ma, respectively. As generally the transit time of lunar meteorites is less than 1 Ma [7], Dhofar 309 and 730 had likely complex CRE histories and were irradiated by GCRs on the lunar surface. In addition the short transition time of 6±2 kyr was determined for one of the meteorites of this pair-3 -2 0 20 40 60 80 100 1,0 2,0 3,0 4,0 5,0 6,0 7,0 lo g K /C a [ g/g ] Fractional 39 Ar release ( 40 Ar/ 36 Ar) tr =1±1 ( 40 Ar/ 36 Ar) tr =295.5±0.5 ( 40 Ar/ 36 Ar) tr =313±20 Ap pa re nt A ge [ Ga ]Dhofar 309 0.0000 0.0002 0.0004 0.0006 0.0008 0.0010 0.0012 0.0014 0.002 0.004 0.006 0.008 0.010 0.012 (40 Ar/ 36 Ar) trap =92±4 400-1080°C 1140-1600°C (besides 1320°C) 1320°C 3 6A r/ 40 Ar 39 Ar/ 40 Ar (40 Ar/ 36 Ar) trap =317±6 Dhofar 730   ing clan - for Dhofar 489 [8]. The minimum irradiation time on the Moon of ~19 Ma for Dhofar 309 and ~13 Ma for Dhofar 730 (Fig. 3) can be calculated from the mахimum P38 for the shielding depth of 65g/cm 2 by the model of [9] for 2π irradiation.  Discussion: Four meteorites of this pairing group (Dhofar 303, 489, 908 and 911) were previously investigated by 40 Ar39 Ar dating [10-13]. The low temperature age of 0.73-1.3 Ga was obtained for a Dhofar 303 clast by stepped-heating laser method [10]. In other cases the ages for the samples of the group are older. Cohen [11] reported the ages ranging from 2.7 to 3.7 Ga for Dhofar 911 feldspathic clast and groundmass determined by the same technique and similar to our data. Because of strong atmospheric contamination Nyquist et al. [12] considered the part of the age spectrum of Dhofar 908 clast released at the last 35% of fractional 39 Ar with a minimum age of ~3.95 Ga, concluding the best value of 4.42±0.04 Ga for the formation age of the anorthositic white clast. The old age of 4.23±0.03 Ga was also measured for Dhofar 489 feldspathic clast [13]. Dhofar 309 and 730 also demonstrate such high apparent ages with correction for trapped primordial argon. Apart from the usual presence of terrestrial argon in desert meteorites, most lunar samples contain argon trapped on their parent body [e.g., 14] that results in the overestimation of 40 Ar39 Ar apparent ages. The composition of trapped argon in Dhofar 908 and 489 was not identified properly in previous studies [12,13] although it is crucial for 40 Ar39 Ar chronology. The high temperature fractions of Dhofar 730 contain excess argon with ( 40 Ar/ 36 Ar)trap ratio of ~92 (Fig. 2), atypical of lunar orphan argon composition and, hence, inconsistent with the antiquity model [14]. But the origin of this component in impact melt brecсias may be related to impact events [15]. In this case the amount and the composition of trapped component does not depend on time of breccia formation but on argon interchange between surrounding rocks containing the certain amount of  radiogenic, solar and cosmogenic Ar mobilised during thermal event.This group of meteorites was ejected from a significant depth of more than 1100 g/cm 2 (determined for Dhofar 489; [8]). Relatively deep-buried origin of this clan may assume the less contribution of redistributed solar 36 Ar to the composition of its trapped component and greater value of ( 40 Ar/ 36 Ar)trap ratio than in the case of surface impact melt breccias.  The time of the Dhofar 309 last total reset of ~3.8 Ga is coeval with the late lunar cratering period, while the total reset age of Dhofar 730 is younger. The first meteorite shows older 40 Ar39 Ar apparent ages on the whole and was likely irradiated by GCRs on the Moon longer than Dhofar 730. However, different irradiation and thermal histories of lunar brecciated meteorites without the knowledge of their transit time and terrestrial residence do not exclude their pairing. Summary: Dhofar 309 and 730 have distinct thermal and irradiation histories. The last total reset of meteorites are ~3.8 and ~3 Ga, respectively. Comparing age spectra, Dhofar 730 experienced more intense partial 40 Ar loss caused by the secondary event(s). The upper limits of the late thermal events inducing secondary 40 Ar loss are ~3 Ga for Dhofar 309 and ~1.5 Ga for Dhofar 730. The trapped argon composition of high temperature fractions of these samples are much higher than usually ascribed to lunar orphan argon. Dhofar 309 and 730 have complex CRE histories. The irradiation time of these meteorites on the Moon is more than 19 and 13 Ma, respectively.   Fig. 3. CRE age spectra of Dhofar 309 and 730.
