Introduction:  The Earth atmosphere shields efficiently human beings from meter-sized meteoroids that disrupt efficiently in the atmosphere [1]. Despite of this, some ordinary chondrites are quite large, but rarely with terminal masses over 10 kg [2]. The finding of Claromecó in Argentina indicates that interesting exceptions exist [3-4]. Two reddish brown meteoritic stones weighing 13 kg each were found in 1963 by Mr. Fermín Massigogge leaning against a windmill on his farm located in the Argentine Pampas. Some years ago, this finding was reported to the geologist Rogelio D. Acevedo. The owner knew well the exact location where he found the stones: Longitude: 60.1231º W and Latitude: 38.8044º S. No other specimens have been found to our knowledge. The two specimens have a rusty appearance that is indicative of having experienced significant terrestrial weathering  (Fig. 1). Once cut the metal grains are barely oxidized by terrestrial alteration, but the matrix is colored by iron staining.    Figure 1. The two specimens as exhibited at Museo Regional de Claromecó.  Methods: Several thin sections were studied using a Zeiss Scope petrographic microscope (Figs. 2-4).  SEM-EDS techniques. We used a Evo Zeiss SEM working at 20 kV. The sample was not coated and analyzed in the low vacuum BSED mode. The EDS detector used to perform elemental analyses is an Inca 250 SSD XMax20 with Peltier cooling with an active area of 20 mm2. Some selected areas were explored at different magnification, and SEM elemental mapping together with EDS spectra were obtained.  Gamma-ray spectrometry. A 19.7 g specimen was analyzed using ultra-low background gamma-ray spectrometry with a high purity Germanium detector.        Results and Conclusions: Based on the composition of olivine and low-Ca pyroxene it is an L5/6 chondrite (Table 1). The sample is equilibrated and recrystallized. In parts it looks like being a Type 6, but chondrules can be frequently encountered (Fig. 2). We suggest a Type 5/6. The studied thin sections also contain a huge BO-macrochondrule (Fig. 5; [5]). The olivines show planar fractures (Fig. 3), clearly indicating a S3 shock degree classification after Stöffler et al. [6]. The sample is moderately weathered and about half of the metals have been destroyed (W2-3). The degree of weathering is variable on the cm-scale of the thin section, but being in general consistent with a weathering degree: W2-3 (Fig. 2). The Ni content from FeNi metal varies between 7.7 and 14.3 wt%. On the other hand, chromite grains are placed throughout chondrule rims or associated with troilite grains.    Figure 2.

The results of gamma-ray spectrometry show that the content in uranium, thorium and potassium is within the levels reported in [7] for L chondrites. The only cosmogenic radionuclide that was positively identified is 26Al (T1/2=7.17×105 a) with a specific activity of 44.6±3.7 dpm kg-1.
