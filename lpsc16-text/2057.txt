Introduction:  Dozens of landforms on Mars have been interpreted as alluvial fans and deltas [e.g., 1-6]. These sedimentary fans formed as a result of fluvial erosion, transport, and then deposition of sediment. However, questions remain regarding the extent to which such deposits have been subsequently modified following deposition [e.g., 7, 8, 9]. The goal of this study is to quantify the preservation of these sedimentary fans through a simple mass balance approach; by calculating present volumes of the fans, and the volumes of the valleys feeding them, we can determine the percentage of eroded valley sediment that has remained within the fan deposits, excluding valley sediments that did not accumulate within the fan, e.g., material diffusely transported into the catchment center. Previous workers have employed a similar approach for mass balance studies of individual martian sedimentary fans [e.g., 10, 11], and here we build on this earlier work by applying this methodology to a larger, more global catalog of deposits (Fig. 1).    Figure 1: Fans analyzed to date (yellow stars), compared with a catalog of 107 fan deposits compiled from previously published results [1-6,12]. Purple dots show fans with available stereo coverage that are subject to ongoing investigation, and red squares show fans with insufficient stereo coverage for mass balance analyses.   Methodology:  We used Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Context Camera (CTX) [13] stereo-derived digital elevation models (DEMs) to constrain the volumes of the fans and the valleys that feed them (Fig. 2). DEMs were produced using the NASA Ames Stereo Pipeline [14-17], and were tied to MOLA [17] point shot data to correct for error in regional slope. We use a suite of four methods to calculate the volume of the fans and feeding valleys (Fig. 2), all of which involve calculating the volume contained between a reference surface and the fan surface or the valley floor.    Figure 2: Two- and three-dimensional schematic illustrations of the four methods used for volume estimation of the fan. The four methods involve calculation of the volume between the fan and: (a) a flat plane, (b) a dipping plane, (c) a segmented, dipping plane, and (d) a 2nd-order polynomial.  The primary difference between each of the four methods is the way in which we calculate the reference surface. The first method uses a flat reference plane at the average elevation of the valley rim or the crater floor as measured at the fan toe (Fig. 2a). The second method uses a reference surface of a dipping plane fit 2057.pdf

to the elevation values at the edge of the fan or the valley rim (Fig. 2b). The third method uses a reference surface of a segmented, dipping plane fit from contours at 50 m intervals (Fig. 2c). The fourth method was completed only for the fan volume, and uses a reference surface defined by a second-order polynomial fit to the elevation values at the edge of the fan (Fig. 2d). Some of these methods will tend to overestimate volumes (e.g., Fig. 2a), while some will tend to underestimate volumes (e.g., Fig. 2b), so we feel it is prudent to look at the range of values from all four methods.    Figure 3: (a) Example sedimentary fan fed by a short valley at -6.53° N, 141.14° E. The mapped outlines of the fan and the valley are shown in blue and red respectively. Figure is a portion of CTX image B01_009874_1735.  (b) Example sedimentary fan fed by a long valley at 8.5° N, -48.0° E. Figure is a portion of CTX image P12_005820_1873.  Results and Discussion:  Preliminary results indicate that fans fed by short, poorly integrated valleys (e.g., Fig. 3a), have valley volumes that are slightly larger than, although the same order of magnitude as, fan volumes (Fig. 4). Alternatively, for the one measured fan fed by an extensive valley network system (Fig. 3b), the eroded sediment volume of the valley is much larger than the volume of the fan.  Although our results are from a small catalog, the fact that fans fed by short valleys have similar volumes of eroded valley sediment and deposited fan sediment suggests that little landscape erosion has occurred during fan emplacement, for at least these systems. Rather, nearly all of the sediment in these fans seem to have been derived from the erosion of the valley itself.  In contrast, the fan systems where there exists a volume imbalance that is unlikely to be explained by post-depositional erosion (i.e., volume valley >> volume fan), may require an additional distal sediment sink(s) for the eroded valley sediment, such as the northern hemisphere basin. Ongoing work involves analysis of a more extensive set of deposits (Fig. 1), which will be used to test whether the trends from our preliminary results hold for a larger, more robust dataset.   Figure 4: Average results for the four different volume calculation methods (Fig. 2). The blue dots represent fans fed by short valleys, and the red dot depicts the fan fed by an extensive valley network system. Error bars indicate mean ± 1σ, and the plotted line shows a 1:1 slope.
