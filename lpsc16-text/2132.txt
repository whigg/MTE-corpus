 HIGH-PRECISION 182W MEASUREMENTS ON MARE BASALTS: CONSTRAINTS ON THE ORIGIN AND DIFFERENTIATION OF THE MOON. T.S. Kruijer & T. Kleine. Institut für Planetologie, University of Münster, Wilhelm-Klemm-Str. 10, 48149 Münster, Germany (thomas.kruijer@wwu.de).  Introduction: The Moon likely formed from hot debris produced in a giant impact on the proto-Earth [e.g., 1]. After this event, the Moon underwent largescale differentiation, which probably involved the crystallisation of a lunar magma ocean [e.g., 2,3]. These processes can be very well studied using the shortlived 182Hf-182W system (t1/2= 8.9 Myr), because (i) the Moon may exhibit an 182W anomaly inherited from the impactor, and (ii) and early crystallisation of the lunar magma ocean would have led to 182W heterogeneities within the Moon [e.g., 5-8]. However, precisely determining 182W compositions of lunar samples is severely complicated by cosmic ray-induced neutron capture on Ta, leading to the production of 182W and large cosmogenic 182W variations among lunar samples [e.g., 9]. Two recent studies have precisely determined the preexposure 182W value of KREEP-rich samples by analysing specimens devoid of neutron capture effects. These studies have shown that KREEP has a 27±4 ppm 182W excess over the modern bulk silicate Earth (BSE) [7,8]. This finding raises the question as to whether other lunar reservoirs—such as the mare basalt sources—exhibit similar or larger 182W excesses. Addressing this question is important not only for deducing the timescales of lunar differentiation but also for precisely determining the 182W value of the bulk Moon.  Determining the 182W signatures of mare basalts is challenging, because due to their high Ta/W, neutron capture effects may be significant even for weakly irradiated samples. One way to overcome this problem would be to analyse metal samples [5,6], but given the low abundance of metals in mare basalts, very large sample masses must be processed to obtain sufficient W for precise isotope analysis. Here we use a different approach and utilize high-precision Hf isotope and Ta/W ratio measurements to empirically quantify the effects of secondary neutron capture on measured 182W compositions. We report results for low-Ti mare basalt 12004, high-Ti mare basalt 74255, and lunar meteorite Kalahari 009; the analyses of additional mare basalts and determination of the Ta/W ratios are underway. Methods: After digestion of the lunar samples (~0.5 g) in HF-HNO3 (2:1), and taking aliquots determining Ta/W ratios, Hf and W were separated by ion exchange chromatography [7]. The Hf and W isotope compositions were measured on a ThermoScientific Neptune Plus MC-ICPMS at Münster [7], and reported in ε-units as the parts per 104 deviation from terrestrial standard values. For quantifying the neutron fluence of samples with high Ta/W, obtaining precise Hf isotope data (~5 ppm, 95% conf.) was essential. This was achieved using longer measurements (200 cycles of 4.2s) and by measuring each sample ≥5 times.  Results: All investigated samples exhibit ε182W distinctly higher than the terrestrial value (Fig. 1,2), consistent with [7,8]. In agreement with its very low exposure age (~230 yr) [10], Kalahari 009 shows no resolvable Hf isotope anomaly, and its ε182W is in excellent agreement with the value previously obtained for KREEP [7,8]. The low- (12004) and high-Ti (74255) mare basalts both have slightly elevated ε182W (Fig. 1), but also show small Hf isotope anomalies, indicative of small neutron capture effects (Fig. 2).  Discussion: Homogeneous ε182W in the bulk silicate Moon. As a result of neutron capture, lunar samples exhibit a positive correlation between ε182W and ε180Hf × (Ta/W). Samples having the same preexposure ε182W should then plot on one single correlation line, whose intercept defines the pre-exposure ε182W of this suite of samples. Fig. 2 shows that all investigated samples—including KREEP-rich samples, mare basalts and lunar meteorite Kalahari 009—plot on a single, well-defined ε182W and ε180Hf × (Ta/W) correlation.

Data for KREEP are from [7].  by a common pre-exposure ε182W of +0.25±0.04 (95% conf.) as obtained from the intercept of the correlation line. Thus, our data do not reveal a resolvable 182W difference between lunar basalts and KREEP, suggesting that the ε182W value of +0.25±0.04 is representative for the bulk silicate Moon.    Timing of lunar magma ocean differentiation. Crystallisation of the lunar magma ocean generated mantle reservoirs with markedly distinct Hf/W [5,6,11-13]. Hence, if magma ocean crystallisation occurred within the lifetime of 182Hf, then these reservoirs should have evolved to distinct ε182W over time. However, our results demonstrate that, despite the variable Hf/W inferred for their sources [5,6,10-12], low-Ti and high-Ti mare basalts as well as KREEP have a homogeneous ε182W (Fig. 3). Constraining the source Hf/W of Kalahari 009 is not straightforward, but its radiogenic initial Hf isotopic composition and old age of ~4.2 Ga [14] point to a mantle source that had undergone strong incompatible element depletion early in lunar history. Such a mantle source would likely have had a high Hf/W, but the ε182W of Kalahari 009 is indistinguishable from KREEP, which is characterised by the lowest Hf/W among the lunar sample suite. Our results, therefore, demonstrate that the sources of KREEP, the mare basalts and Kalahari 009 must have been established after 182Hf extinction, most likely later than ~70 Myr after solar system formation (Fig. 3). Such a 'late' time of magma ocean differentiation is consistent with the 'young' ages of ~4.4 Ga inferred for lunar mantle sources using other isotope systems [e.g., 15].  Constraints on the origin of the Moon. Our results demonstrate that the Moon shows an excess in ε182W of ~25±4 ppm over the modern BSE. This excess agrees with the predicted 182W change resulting from disproportional late accretion to the Earth and Moon after Earth's core had fully formed [7,8]. Hence, the pre-late-veneer BSE and the Moon were indistinguishable in 182W. However, the giant impact itself should have caused a notable Earth-Moon 182W difference by (1) changing the ε182W of the proto-Earth mantle by adding impactor mantle and (partially) equilibrating impactor core material (Fig. 4), both carrying distinct ε182W anomalies, and (2) by supplying W-rich but 182W-depleted impactor core material into the lunar accretion disk. Thus, the Earth-Moon 182W homogeneity is an unexpected outcome of the giant impact. Unlike for Ti and O isotopes, the ε182W homogeneity is difficult to explain by accretion of impactor and protoEarth from a homogeneous inner disk reservoir [16] or by making the Moon fully from proto-Earth mantle [17,18]. Thus, the 182W results require a post-giant impact state that facilitated efficient isotopic equilibration of the BSE and the Moon.
