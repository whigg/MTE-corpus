Hypervelocity cometary particles capturedin aerogel created different types of tracks. The “TypeB” tracks [1] have an initial bulbous cavity tapering intoa long, narrow stylus (or several). In these tracks, theimpacting cometary particle was an aggregate of finegrained material (<2 µm) which ended up in the bulb ofthe track, and coarse-grained terminal particles (>2 µm)at the ends of the track.The fine-grained material in track C2052,2,74 (a large,8 mm long, type B track) showed a very broad range ofO isotopic compositions (−70h < Δ17O < +60h)compared to the terminal particles from track 74 andseveral other tracks [2]. This implies that comet Wild2 fines are either primitive outer-nebula dust or a verydiverse sampling of inner Solar System compositionalreservoirs that accreted along with a large number ofinner-Solar-System rocks to form comet Wild 2.Stardust cometary tracks show significant track-totrack heterogeneity [3]. It is possible that large tracksmay be compositionally different than small tracks. Additionally, fines in small tracks may be better preserved(less mixing with aerogel) than fines in large tracks. Forthese reasons, we measured the O isotopic composition of bulb material in Stardust track C2086,20,184,0,0(“Track 184”), a 0.3 mm type B track (Figure 1).Methods: We compressed the bulb portion of Track184 into indium using a Teflon-coated anvil and plungerpress (Figure 2). The aerogel porosity was sufficientlyreduced to allow a conductive ∼20 nm C coat to be applied. The samples were then mounted under an Aucoated Si3N4 window with a ∼300 µm ion-milled hole,to create a flat, conducting surface for SIMS analysis[4].Figure 1: Optical image of Track 184 before compression into indium.We acquired 35×35 µm, 128×128 pixel scanning ionimages using the Cameca ims 1280 ion microprobe atFigure 2: Secondary electron image of Track 184pressed into indium.the University of Hawai‘i. We used a <3 pA Cs+ primary beam focused to ∼250 nm. An electron flood gunwas used for charge compensation. We simultaneouslycollected 16O– , 17O– , and 18O– on electron multipliers. We used a mass-resolving power of 5500 on 17O–to minimize the interference from 16OH– . We usedmagnetic-field peak-jumping to collect 16OH– (to quantify any contribution to 17O– ), 24Mg16O– , 27Al16O– ,and 56Fe16O– (to distinguish cometary material frombackground aerogel). We collected 5000 total frames(88 hours of measurement). We monitored O isotope ratios of cometary particles during the analysis to identifyany isotopically anomalous presolar grains, in whichcase the measurement would have been stopped so wewould not sputter through these grainsData Analysis: We registered each of the 5000frames using the 16O− map to account for drift duringthe long measurement. We also registered the 17O– and18O– total map to the 16O– total map. Counts for allspecies were corrected for electron-multiplier deadtime.We used the 24Mg16O– and 56Fe16O– maps to identifyparticles (Figure 3). Most particles were entirely sputtered away during the long measurement, so we identified the frames and pixels in each frame where eachparticle was present.We summed the counts of 16O, 17O, 18O for each particle as well as the aerogel (pixels in the map that lackAlO, MgO, and FeO). We used the aerogel as our O isotope standard (δ18O ≈−1.1h and δ17O ≈−0.5h [5]),which was measured in the same frame and at approx1721.pdf

Themap is 35×35 µm.imately the same 16O count rate as the cometary particles. We used a Monte Carlo method to calculate the uncertainties for O isotope ratios of the cometary particles(described in detail in [2]). This method accounts forthe variation in measured isotope ratios of the aerogel,which may arise from topography created in the sampleby sputtering. Uncertainties calculated by this methodwere about 1.4× larger than statistical uncertainties forboth δ18O and δ17O . Additionally, the MgO/FeO ratiowere calculated for each particle. This ratio is qualitative because of unknown sensitivity factors for thesespecies in the measured phases.Results: We measured the O isotope ratios for 47particles, 1–4 µm in size, in the bulb region of Track184 (Figure 4).Discussion: The range of δ18O values in the Track184 bulb material is smaller than that in the Track 74bulb material. Track 184 lacks the 16O-poor, Fe-richmaterial found in Track 74 [2]. Track 184 contains a3–4 µm, high-Mg, 16O-rich grain that may be similarto Mn-rich forsterite grains found in the comet Wild 2samples [6]. This grain has not been sputtered entirelyaway and can be extracted by FIB for TEM analysis.None of the 47 particles we measured in the Track184 bulb had a significant O isotope anomaly. Combining this with the zero presolar grain detections in theTrack 74 bulb material (63 particles), we calculate a95%-confidence, single-sided upper bound of 2.7% forδ18O-100 -80 -60 -40 -20 0 20 40 60 80 100δ17O-100-80-60-40-20020406080100MgO / FeOHighLowFigure 4: Oxygen 3-isotope plot of the 20 largest particles measured in the bulb of Track 184.

With this method we are ableto measure a large number of grains at once, but compromise with larger uncertainties (20–40h vs. ∼2h,2σ) and less is known of each particle’s mineralogy.With this lower precision data, we are able to estimatethe spread of O isotopes in Stardust cometary fines, aswell as identify interesting particles (16O-poor, 16Orich, presolar grains) for further analysis.References: [1] M.
