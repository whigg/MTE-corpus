The impactor is20 m in diameter and of basaltic composition, impacting at19.03 km s−1. For the second and third simulation, the initialposition of impactor is displaced by half a grid cell (0.63 m)from the fi rst calculation.Impacts into planetary atmospheres are an important aspectof impact phenomena in general. Planetary atmospheres canserve as shields that absorb the kinetic energy of a bolide,preventing it from striking the surface and depositing the energyhere. In the case of the Earth, the atmosphere will (up to a point)prevent casualties and damage to human property.In recent decades, we have had spectacular opportunitiesto study a few atmospheric impacts in great detail. Two eventsstand out: 1) the series of impacts of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9(SL9) into Jupiter in 1994 and 2) the airburst over Chelyabinsk,Russia in February 2013. The amount of detailed informationgathered about both these events makes it possible to comparetheories and modeling to observations. In particular, veri fi cation and validation of hydrodynamic modeling can be performed.Hydrodynamic modelingThis work presents some results from hydrodynamic modeling of the Chelyabinsk and SL9 impacts.

If thisholds true in general, it would have signi fi cant implications forpredictions of the effects of hazardous impacts on the Earth.Assessments of hazards would have to take the additional uncertainty of the profi le into account.The previous calculations of SL9 impacts used theZEUSMPcode[2]. Most of the calculations presented here were donewith a different and independently formulatedhydrocode, CTH.Developed at Sandia National Laboratory, CTH[3] is a highlyadvanced code widely used in the planetary science community. It makes use of material strength models and advancedtabular equations of state such as ANEOS and the SESAMElibrary from Los Alamos National Laboratory. We also present1388.pdf

some new ZEUSMP SL9 calculations for comparison.One difference between the older ZEUSMP calculationsand the CTH calculations presented here is the analysis of kinetic energy profi le. The ZEUSMP SL9 calculations presenteda “past-the-post” profi le in which the amount of mass, momentum, and kinetic energy that passed a given height z wasmonitored and used as the basis for the calculation of E(z).In contrast, at the present writing, analysis for E(z) for CTHcalculations is done by integrating all mass, momentum, andkinetic energy in the computational domain. Depending on thedomain size, this amounts to integrating the energy profi le E(z)over the computational domain, leading to a convolution of theprofi le with a smoothing function whose characteristic scaleis the domain size. A processing method that reproduces thepast-the-post analysis is being developed at the time of writing.An additional difference between the old ZEUSMP SL9calculations and the ones reported here (both ZEUSMP andCTH) is that the new calculations were conducted in a referenceframe moving at a constant velocity equal to the initial impactvelocity (19.03 km s−1 for Chelyabinsk, 61.46 km s−1 for SL9).The older calculations were carried out in a variable-velocityframe of reference, in which the computational domain trackedthe front end of the impactor material, and thus decelerated intandem with the impactor.Chelyabinsk resultsFigure 1 shows the results from three sample calculations ofthe Chelyabinsk impact done with the CTH code. The domain was 1×0.2×0.2 km in size, and the spherical 20-meterdiameter impactor was assumed to have a modest amount ofstrength (Ymax = 107 cm2 s−1) and basaltic composition. Gridresolution was eight elements per impactor radius (“R8”) Calculationswere donewith slight (0.63m) displacements in initialpositions, corresponding to half a grid-cell. While the energydeposition curves are consistent with the observations of thelight curve [4], sensitivity to initial conditions is also evident,suggesting that the phenomenon applies to other cases in addition to the SL9 environment.SL9 resultsFigure 2 shows results from sample SL9 calculations usingCTH (left) and ZEUSMP (right). The impactor is an ice spheremoving at 61.46 km s−1 through the Jovian atmosphere startingat a height of 100 km above the 1-bar level of the atmosphere.The computational domains are 105× 10× 10 km in size forthe CTH calculations and 105×10×10 km for the ZEUSMPcalculation. For both sets of simulations a non-uniform gridwas used, with a maximum resolution of 6.25 m (R8). Forthe two ZEUSMP calculations the energy deposition curveswere calculated in two different fashions: the “past-the-post”method (solid curves) and “box integration” (dotted curves).As might be expected the box-integration yields a smoothedcurve and one that is displaced to slightly lower altitudes. Incontrast to the Chelyabinsk calculations, the computational domain now extends over a large fraction of the region in whichenergy is deposited, so the smoothing effects of a box integration are apparent. The CTH curves are calculated with abox-integration method. Even after taking into account the differences in energy-deposition calculation methods, differencesbetween the CTH and ZEUSMP simulations are evident. Ingeneral the CTH calculations apparently show a broader anddeeper energy deposition curve, with signi fi cant amounts ofenergy being deposited below 200 km below the 1-bar level ofthe Jovian atmosphere. This may be due to effects of using different equations of state for the calculations (ANEOSwater-icefor CTH vs. Tillotson for ZEUSMP).AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by NASA Planetary AtmospheresProgram award NNX11AD87G.
