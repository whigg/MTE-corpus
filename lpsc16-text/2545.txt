First ground truth after Apollo and Luna missions: China's Chang'e-3 conducted the first lunar surface landing and roving mission after some forty years.  Based on the returned wealth of data from four payloads aboard Yutu rover, i.e., Panoramic Camera (Pancam), Lunar penetrating radar (LPR), Active Particle-induced X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) and Visible and Near-IR Imaging Spectrometer (VNIS), researchers have advanced our knowledge of the structural, composition, and mineralogy of specific lunar young volcanism [1-6]. Recently, we combined APXS and VNIS data of Yutu rover, derived self-consistent and well-correlated compositional and mineralogical information of the lunar regolith derived from rocks freshly excavated by Zi Wei crater, and discovered a new type of lunar basaltic rock that differs from basalts returned by the Apollo and Luna missions as well as lunar meteorites [7]. Elemental concentrations, mineral modes and mineral chemistries of the Chang'e-3 landing site are consistent with remote sensing, but more accurate with high spectral and spatial resolution, thus making this landing site a good calibration site for the lunar remote sensing studies.   Figure 1. Locations of three small craters (M3 2497nm image) In a previous study [7], we found two types of rock, one is light-toned, the other, dark-toned. The chemistries of these two kinds of rocks may be related to the two groups of Yutu measurements (i.e., CE3-0005 and -0008, CE3-0006 and -0007), but do not totally account for difference in these measurements. The origins of these two types of rock still need further investigation. Here we employ orbital hyperspectral imaging data from Chandrayaan-1's Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) to evaluate the spectral and compositional variations of the two basaltic units (I5 and I22, shown in Fig. 1), near the Chang'e-3 landing site, to determine whether the two types of rock originate from a physical mineral mixture or chemical differentiation mechanism. We also use the in-situ Pancam color images (with RGB bands) from the Yutu rover to further investigate these two rock types. Figure 2. Visible-near-infrared spectra of three craters	  Orbital observed spectral properties of two basaltic units.  In order to decrease space weathering effects on the spectral data, we extract spectra of the small, young craters of similar sizes to Zi Wei crater (~450 m). Fig.1 shows the locations of three small craters for which we selected representative spectra of the two basaltic units (i.e., I22 and I5). The spectra are given in Fig. 2. The typical M3 data of young basaltic unit I22 (i.e., 2.96 Ga, M3_I22-162-155) is very similar to the ground truth spectra (CE3-0005) taken by the visible near-infrared imaging spectrometer (VNIS) aboard Yutu rover. However, the spectra taken from the older I5 unit (i.e.,  3.52 Ga, M3_I5-550-52) show distinct features from the other two, i.e., 1- and 2-µm features are shifted to lower wavelengths, implying its pyroxene is lower in Fe and Ca, and enriched in Mg. The ~1.25 µm spectral feature (in Fig. 2b) of the I5 unit is negligible, suggesting it has little or no olivine.  Modified Gaussian Modeling (MGM) deconvolution is conducted for the M3 spectral data [7]. The derived peak positions of High-Ca (HCP) and Low-Ca (LCP) pyroxenes of I5 units (M3_I5-550-52) are: HCP (1.0 µm, 2.2 µm) and LCP (0.89 µm, 1.9 µm), and the volume ratio (HCP/LCP) is 1.7. The pyroxene and olivine chemistries derived from M3_I22-162-155 are very similar to the mineral chemistries measured by Yutu rover (see [7]). The derived olivine peak positions (0.87 µm, 1.0 µm, 1.25 µm) of M3_I22-162-155 yield Fo ~50 and the volume ratio (HCP/LCP) is 1.9.   In-situ observations of the two types of rock:	  Here	  we	  consider	  the	  images	  taken	  by	  Pancam	  on	  the	  Yutu	  rover.	   The	   Pancam	   has	   three	   filters	   (RGB)	   to	   take	  color	   images	   along	   the	   traverse	   route.	   Fig.	   3	   shows	  the	   Pancam	   view	   at	   the	   CE3-­-0008	   site,	   observing	  across	   the	   Zi	  Wei	   crater.	   As	   indicated	  by	  decorrela-­tion	  stretched	  (DS)	  images,	  the	  two	  types	  of	  rock	  are	  more	   easily	   discriminated.	   One	   comprises	   bluish	  rocks/boulders	   (the	   dark-­-colored	   rock),	   the	   other	  comprises	  the	  light-­-toned	  boulders.	  As	  shown	  in	  Fig.	  3,	  we	  find	  that	  there	  are	  many	  bluish	  boulders	  on	  the	  inner	   rim	   of	   Zi	  Wei	   crater.	   Considering	   their	   lower	  abundance	   appearance	   on	   the	   ground	   traversed	   by	  Yutu	  (e.g.,	  the	  four	  detection	  sites),	  we	  infer	  that	  this	  bluish	   rock	   likely	   comes	   from	   a	   deeper	   part	   of	   the	  basaltic	  unit	  at	  the	  Chang'e-­-3	  landing	  site	  (I22).	   	   	  Although	   the	   three	   bands	   of	   Pancam	   have	   not	  been	  calibrated	  to	  the	  radiance	  values,	  their	  DN	  val-­ues	  could	  be	  used	  as	  guide	  for	  their	  spectral	  variance.	  We	   find	   that	   the	   three	   bands	   of	   the	   bluish	   rock	  are	   flat	   in	   the	   360-­-780	   nm	   spectral	   range.	   Ac-­cording	   to	   experimental	   results	   on	   olivine	   and	  pyroxene,	   considering	   the	   ilmenite	   proportions	  are	   similar	   among	   the	   four	   sites	   investigated	   by	  Yutu	   [7],	   the	   flat	   spectral	   slope	   in	   the	   visible	   re-­gion	   for	   the	   fresh	   exposed	   rocks	   would	   indicate	  higher	  Mg#	  for	  the	  mafic	  minerals.	  Thus	  we	  think	  that	   the	   dark-­-toned	   rock	   tends	   to	   be	   more	  Mg-­-rich.	   	  Referring to the origin of these two types of rock, we need to determine if the cause is mineral mixing (upper unit and lower unit) or differentiation of the proto-lava of the basalt at the Chang'e-3 landing site. We	   can	   exclude	   the	   mineral	   mixing	   mechanism	  for	  the	  following	  three	  reasons:	  1.	  The	  dark-­-toned	  rock	  has	  a	  high	  Mg#	  with	  higher	  olivine	  content;	  2.	   The	   light-­-toned	   rock	   is	   lower	   in	   Mg#	   with	   a	  lower	  olivine	  content;	  3.	  The	  northern	  I5	  unit	  rock	  is	  higher	  in	  Mg#	  but	  poorer	  in	  (or	  lacks)	  olivine.	  We	  prefer	  the	  explanation	  that	  these	  two	  types	  of	  rock	   result	   from	  differentiation	   (fractional	   crystalli-­zation)	  of	  the	  basaltic	  lava.	  We	  reason	  that	  the	  lower	  part	  of	   the	  basaltic	  unit	   is	  more	  Mg-­-rich	  and	  earlier	  crystallized.	   In	   addition,	   we	   find	   that	   most	   of	   the	  bluish	  rock	  around	  or	  inside	  the	  crater	  are	  columnar	  jointed	   (with	   elongate	   sharp	   edges).	   Temperature	  gradients	  and	  compositional	  differences	  between	  the	  upper	   layer	   and	   lower	   layer	   may	   lead	   to	   the	   for-­mation	  of	  columnar	  jointing	  for	  this	  type	  of	  basalt.	  Conclusions and future work:	   Although	   orbital	  observations	  of	   the	  young	   lunar	  basalt	  unit	   (I22)	   at	  the	   Chang'e-­-3	   landing	   site	   appear	   homogenous,	  in-­-situ	   detection	   by	   Yutu	   suggests	   that	   the	   basaltic	  lavas	   experienced	   chemical	   differentiation.	   In-­-situ	  measurements	  by	  Yutu	  provide	  new	  insights	  for	  the	  crystallization	   processes	   of	   these	   rocks.	   For	   future	  study,	  we	  will	  concentrate	  on	  the	  chemical	  variations	  and	   distributions,	   with	   intent	   to	   better	   understand	  the	  record	  of	  late-­-stage	  volcanism	  on	  the	  Moon.
