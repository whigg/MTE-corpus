Introduction: In 2012, the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Curiosity rover landed successfully in Gale crater, Mars. Gale presents clear evidence of an aqueous and depositional history, from alluvial depositions to ancient habitable fluvio-lacustrine environments [1]. Evidence of mineralogical alteration, combined with stratigraphic sequences of sedimentary rock found on the crater, suggests active hydrology in Gale’s geologic past [2, 3]. Although there are no clear indications of liquid water flowing today at Gale, recent studies suggest that deliquescence, the transition from a solid crystalline salt to an aqueous solution under the proper environmental conditions, may be possible [4].  Among MSL’s mission prerogatives are to assess Gale crater's biological potential and investigate processes that influence habitability [5]. The Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group (MEPAG) Special Regions Science Analysis Group (SR-SAG2) has worked to define the conditions under which a martian terrain can be classified as potentially important for the search for life [6]. The committee defines a Special Region in the subsurface, where the regolith can protect from UV radiation, as one where the temperature T>255 K, the lowest temperature a terrestrial organism has been found to be stable (implicating DNA replication and total enzymatic functionality) and a water activity aw at or above 0.60 [6]. There are also regions that biological replication may be possible, but uncertain. These Uncertain Regions have a temperature limit of 250 K and a water activity limit of 0.5 [6].  Earth analog studies conducted at the Atacama Desert suggest microbial communities can be sustained by deliquescence [7,8]; therefore, deliquescence at Gale crater is an astrobiologically intriguing process. Here we study the biological potential as defined by SR-SAG2 within the subsurface of Gale crater, Mars by uniting surface measurements made by MSL’s Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS) with a one-dimensional heat and mass transfer model [9].  Thermal Inertia: The REMS sensors are designed to record ground and air temperature, and relative humidity [10]. In order to calculate subsurface temperatures, we solve the one-dimensional thermal diffusion equation using an Euler forward element procedure as a function of thermal parameters such as surface albedo, emissivity, solar heat flux, thermal inertia, and atmospheric opacity. The model simulates temperatures to a depth of 4 m, which is several times the annual skin depth, with an element thickness of 0.01 cm and time step of 370 s.  The Curiosity rover has traversed various terrains with varying thermal properties. Therefore, we first investigate the thermal inertia (Γ) and albedo of each terrain. There are a variety of geomorphologies in the soil across the rover’s route, from rocky regions like Yellowknife bay (presenting higher thermal inertias) to ones with less consolidated material like the sand dunes in Rocknest and Dingo Gap (with lower thermal inertias). By modeling ground temperatures and comparing with REMS measurements of surface temperatures, keeping albedo and thermal inertia as free parameters, we found four regions with different thermal properties throughout sols 10 - 602 (Fig. 1): Γ = 350 J m-2 K-1 s-1/2 with an albedo of 0.20 for the first 120 sols, Γ = 550 J m-2 K-1 s-1/2 with an albedo of 0.28 for sols 120 through 200, Γ = 350 J m-2 K-1 s-1/2 with an albedo of 0.28 for the sols 201 through 450 and Γ = 302 J m-2 K-1 s-1/2 with an albedo of 0.18 for the final sols. Our results agree well with the previous study of [11].   Fig. 1. Simulated maximum, minimum, and average ground temperature plotted with REMS measurements, demonstrating the four different thermal regions.   Deliquescence: We study the deliquescence of calcium perchlorate (Ca(ClO4)2), using the experimental constrains from [12]. This salt will deliquesce when the ambient temperature is at or above the eutectic temperature (Te = 196 K) and the relative humidity (RH) is at or above the deliquescent relative humidity  (DRH) [12]. We united in-situ humidity measurements from REMS with the heat and mass transfer model previously describe [9] to study the behavior of this salt system in the subsurface of Gale crater.  2026.pdf

   Fig. 2: Simulated behavior of Ca(ClO4)2 in the subsurface of Gale crater. The points represent when an aqueous solution is present, where red indicates aw consistent with Uncertain Regions and green with Special Regions.   Our results suggest that nearly 65% of the time an aqueous solution is present, aw meets the requirements for Uncertain Regions; however, the conditions for Special Regions are only met 0.7% of the time, as seen in Fig. 2. Activities at or above 0.6 are only met below 5 cm, and are confined to brief windows during the martian year. On the other hand, Uncertain Regions dominate the subsurface terrain during autumn and winter. However, the maximum temperature at any depth during deliquescence is 220 K. This implies that the requirements for Special Regions, both aw and T, are not met simultaneously in the martian subsurface and temperature is the limiting factor. Conclusions: We assess the biological potential of Gale crater’s subsurface, an MSL mission prerogative, by simulating the behavior of calcium perchlorate, a highly deliquescent salt [12]. Specifically, we investigate the temperature and relative humidity conditions when an aqueous solution is present and compare these values to the definitions of Special and Uncertain Regions developed by SR-SAG2 [6].  Our results suggest that the top most portion of the regolith does not abide by the Special Regions requirements for water activity; however, the conditions are met below 5 cm, though only occurring 0.7% of the time. On the other hand, Uncertain Regions, as defined by aw, are nearly ubiquitous in depth and confined to southern autumn and winter.  However, the maximum temperature during deliquescence is only ~220 K, which is well below the requirements for life as we know it. Thus, although there can be regions with the appropriate aw, the combined requirements for these regions of biological interest are not met simultaneously in the subsurface. We find that temperature is the limiting factor for life in the subsurface of Gale crater, Mars. Our definitions for Special and Uncertain Regions may change with new biological discoveries. Indeed, there exists strong evidence for certain metabolic processes below 255 K, but propagation by DNA replication has not yet been documented. Life as we currently know it may not persist at Gale crater due to the low temperature conditions, but our simulations suggest that liquid water, via deliquescence, with tolerable water activity is possible. This opens new possibilities for martian life.
