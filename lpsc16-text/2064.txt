These objectives as well as EDL requirements translate into stringent constraints for finding suitable landing sites, which are potentially met at only four locations, recently downselected to 3 [2]. Along with the SE Mawrth Vallis Plateaus [3] and the Aram Dorsum plains [4], Oxia Planum was selected as a final candidate for a 2020 launch and is the prime target for the 2018 launch window. Here, we report the discovery of this site and describe its aqueous mineralogy. Several plausible aqueous alteration scenarios are proposed and their accordance with mission goals will be discussed. The definite discrimination between these aqueous formation scenarios will require in-situ measurements, and several observables to achieve this on the ground will be proposed.  General description: The proposed landing site at Oxia Planum is located over the lower part of an extensive clay flat, nearly 300 km across, straddling the crustal dichotomy on the margins of Chryse Planitia. This large phyllosilicate-bearing unit is Noachian in age (Late to Middle), it was overlain by presumably Hesperian-aged alluvial or deltaic sediments to the east (at an outlet of Cogoon Vallis), and then later capped by Amazonian lava flows. The site is under erosion and relatively fresh clays-bearing material is accessible where the overlying units have been recently eroded away. A companion paper by [Quantin et al., this conference] provides a comprehensive view of the geological history and fluvio-lacustrine morphologies of the site as deciphered to-date.   Aqueous mineralogy: the clay unit at Oxia is one of the largest on Mars and was originally detected in OMEGA data at kilometric resolution. Further analysis using all available multi-spectral CRISM data (100-200 m/pix) and targeted high-resolution observations (< 40 m/pix) have further refined the unit contacts and mineralogy (Figure 1). It exhibits remarkably uniform spectral features consistent with a type of Fe/Mg-rich phyllosilicate. Band positions and shapes are best matched by smectite clays (Fe-Mg-rich saponite) or smectite/mica (e.g. vermiculite), but not by nontronite (Al-Fe smectite). The latter is found instead on the SE ridge outside of the Oxia Planum lower unit, and further east at Mawrth Vallis. To the limit of sensitivity provided by orbital instruments, the clays at Oxia are the most representative of Mars in terms of geographic distribution [5] but many large clay units are found to be more nontronite-rich instead (Mawrth Vallis, Nili Fossae, Meridiani Planum [6,7,8]). The spectral uniformity, seldom observed elsewhere at similar resolution, likely indicates that a single formation or transformation process is responsible, independently of the duration and intensity of water-rock interactions. Punctures by small impact craters observed with HiRISE reveal the clay unit to be >10 meters thick with (sub-) meter scale layering. Mineral variability is only observed on the Eastern part of the lower clay unit, within the delta-fan deposits. There, signatures of Fe 2+ smectites have possibly been found, as well as confirmed localized Al-phyllosilicate outcrops and an extensive hydrated silica (opal?) stratum. Hydrated silica at the Oxia fan is diagnostic of low/short-term water activity and is likely genetically linked to deltaic depositional events as observed at most similar morphologies on Mars [9]. Recently exposed clays elsewhere in the unit exhibit variations in their spectral shape compared to more eroded clays, possibly tracing the effect of Amazonian to present-day exposure to the surface environment.             Clay accessibility: Oxia offers the possibility of placing the large landing ellipse (120x20 km 2) over a mostly flat and smooth-textured terrain, dominantly covered in clays. Regions devoid of alteration signatures are the localized Amazonian lava flow remnants and the distal part of the delta-fan which we interpret as alluvial sediments. The preliminary EDL analysis carried out does not foresee major landing safety concerns [2]. Due to limited traverse capability (around 4 km) for the nominal mission, the short term accessibility of high science return targets (clays) is a potential major issue which was addressed by optimizing the ellipse center for a range of azimuth (imposed by the launch window). Assuming a Gaussian density function, the center position was fine tuned in order to maximize on-site (e.g. negligible roving) clay accessibility whilst minimizing „no-go zones‟ (defined as scientifically less interesting and/or poorly traversable units such as lava flows). Figure 1 shows that, assuming a 2020 launch window, a land-on-clay encounter is probable (>60%) and almost certain along any 4 km trav erse (>98%). A similar result is found for a 2018 launch. While this will guarantee high science return upon landing, conversely the unit uniformity may prove troublesome for short traverses. The uniformity observed with CRISM may not be valid at the cm scale however and past experience with previous rovers shows that aqueous minerals and morphologies may exist that are unresolvable from orbit (e.g. diagenetic veins at Gale). New simulations will be conducted to quantify this issue by weighing in the probability of encountering the hydrated silica deltaic stratum and proposed distal alluvial sediments.  Formation scenarios: We focus on 5 major formation scenarios for the clay unit: pedogenic, lacustrine, sub-surface (closed system), deep/metamorphic, glacial (basal melting). Based on rationale summarized in table 1, we favor a surface/near surface formation process either in the form of abiotic pedogenesis or lacustrine/palustrine neoformation. These scenarios are based on preliminary analysis and will be further discussed, and debated. Testable hypothesis with the rover payload will also be discussed. These include the presence and degree of burial diagenesis of the clay sediments, soil horizons in the case of pedogenic clays or distinctive microscale textures for lacustrine deposits.
