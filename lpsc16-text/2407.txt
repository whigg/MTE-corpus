Introduction:  Sublimation of the seasonal CO2 ice has been proposed to be an active and dynamic driver of present-day surface change on Mars. Events such as the spectacular avalanches of snow and dust from the North Polar residual ice cap cliffs [1] the cascading supra-ice dark sediment flows on polar dunes [2]; or the dark spots and fans emanating from the southern hemisphere araneiform, have all been proposed to be related to energy from sublimating seasonal CO2 [3]. Diniega et al [4] proposed that a discrete type of Martian gully, found on southern hemisphere dunes, were formed by the movement of CO2 seasonal ice blocks. These 'Linear Gullies' consist primarily of long (100 m - 2.5 km) grooves with near-uniform width (few-10 m wide, sometimes with slight narrowing downslope) and typical depth of <2 m. They are nearlinear throughout most of their length but sometimes contains zones of low-to-high sinuosity. They are commonly bounded by levées. The groove is generally prefaced by a small alcove and/or converging small grooves that originate at the dune brink. Downslope, the groove abruptly ends and lacks a debris apron. It sometimes ends with a terminal pit, sometimes in a chain of pits or a series of divergent small grooves, each with a terminal pit. The pit diameter is typically 14x the groove width.  A series of pilot field experiments demonstrated that features similar to linear gullies could be eroded by the movement of sublimating CO2 ice blocks over sandy dune slopes [4]. Here we present results from a series of field experiments that quantify the granular bed response, on the dune's lee slope, to the movement of the sublimating block. The focus of this presentation is the block dynamics and the variable slope response. Field site and experiments:The experiments were undertaken on an active 5 m high barchan dune with an 8 m long lee slope (31.4°) in the Grand Falls Dune field, Arizona during August 2015. The ambient air temperature during the experiments was 36°C and the sand surface temperature was 47°C.  A CO2 ice block (20x105x210 mm) was placed at the dune brink and with a gentle nudge it moved downslope. The dynamics of the block movement were recorded using a pair of high resolution video cameras. Geomorphological observations were noted and topographic change was quantified using a Leica P20 terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) with a resolution of 0.8 mm at 10 m, and change detection limits less than 3 mm [5]. The block run was repeated a total of 32 times down the same slope path to examine the change to track morphology. The experiment ran for 75 minutes. The block size was reduced to (8x96x196 m) by the end of the run series.   Results: We can confirm that the CO2 blocks moved independently downslope in the track area for the entire slope length.  Block dynamics: Three distinct modes of block movement were observed. 1. Slope normal flow where  Figure. 1 View looking upslope on Grand Falls dune.The ripples in the upper and mid track location are flattened. The lower slope shows a central channel with levees, created by a sliding CO2 block.   2407.pdf

the long axis of the block followed the downslope direction (Fig. 1). 2. Swivel; where the block turned on it central axis as it moved downslope. 3. Bouncing. Where the block became repeatedly airborn as it went down the lee slope, then reconnected to the granular surface This occurred over significant length portions of the slope.  Geomorphic features: The CO2 blocks adjusted the lee slope topography from the first slide. Figure 1 is a view taken from the base of the lee slope. It shows how the block moved over some ripples flattening the ripple crests in the upslope location. Lower down the slope, distinct levees are visible. As successive block runs passed over thes topography the alcove and track evolved to the form shown in Figure 2.  Topographic response: Figure 2 shows that resultant topography following a series of 32 block runs. Several features are worthy of note.  An alcove developed at the dune brink from the initial block movement. Immediately downslope from the alcove is a topographic depositional lobe, formed from material eroded from the alcove. Downslope of the depositional lobe are a series of tracks that terminate in the interdune. These distinctive tracks are visible and measurable. The sediment budget estimates (Table 1) show that upslope area is dominated by an initial zone of net erosion (alcove). This is followed by a distinct depositional lobe that enlarged following each successive block run. At times the lobe was breached by an advancing block, but then continued to aggrade during successive runs. The lobe also diverted block flow paths of successive runs.   The track is dominated by alternating pockets of localised erosion and deposition. This local topography is initiated by the bouncing motion of the block that locally compacted, displaced and triggered a localised (short) grainflow downslope of the impact site. This topography is visible in the DTM (to the right in Fig. 2a). The data show that there is net sediment erosion along the track as well as sediment compaction that was qualitatively observed.  Sediment transport: We extracted the volume of sediment moved from the DTM (Table 1). The data represent sand that was  1. eroded directly by CO2 blocks and 2. Grain flow that was triggered by the CO2 block movement.  Summary of findings: Our field data show that CO2 blocks: 1.Are mobile on sloped dune surfaces. 2. Mobilise sediment, leading to erosion and deposition. 3. Form alcove -track systems with levees. 4. Motion (specifically) generates signature morphologies and locally destabilises lee slopes triggering avalanches. 5. Distinctive 'kinks' form along tracks. These may be a precursor to sinuosity.
