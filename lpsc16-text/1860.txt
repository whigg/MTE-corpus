Kornienko, Institute of Radiophysics and Electronics, NAS of Ukraine, 12 Ak.Proskury, Kharkov, 61085, Ukraine (nbondar@ucsc.edu).  Introduction:  Images taken by LROC NA camera onboard LRO spacecraft have high spatial resolution up to 0.5 m per pixel [1]. They can be used for the purposes of the detailed topography reconstruction with resolution close to that of the source images.  The procedure to recalculate images into surface topography is based on a priori known dependence of the surface facet brightness on its orientation. This approach originally proposed by Van Diggelen [2] solves a mathematically incorrectly posed problem (as shown in [3]). Practical application of this approach leads to different kinds of difficulties and requires development of specific algorithms adopted for particular initial sets of images (see, for example, [4]).  In the present work we use the method of improved photoclinometry [3] to estimate topographic details of small craters on lunar surface. This method is the most mathematically rigorous. The improved photoclinometry allows calculation of the most probable surface height variations according to available images. The method:  The method of improved photoclinometry [3] is based on the statistical approach. The accuracy of calculated heights depends on the noise level of image data recording.  As a first step, the method includes calculation of topography slope fields from available images. After that [3] the solution of the problem leads to the Poisson equation with the boundary conditions stated that at the area boundary the normal component of calculated heights gradient should to be equal to the normal component of slopes derived from initial image (Von Neumann condition). We applied the finite difference method to solve the Poisson equation.  Source data:  We studied surface area having size of 2.55 × 1.24 km located in Mare Imbrium. The center of the area has coordinates: 32.56ºN, 340.17ºE. We processed four images which were fragments of LROC images M107005988LE, M183661434LE, M186020337RE, and M188379229LE [5]. These images were taken when solar azimuths АS were equal to -57.01º (see Fig. 1), 38.27º, 35.19º, and 72.87º, respectively. Differences between solar azimuths for two pairs of images are 95.28º и 92.2º and are consistent with optimal observational conditions for the purposes of relief reconstruction. Incidence angles of illumination θ for images used vary between 32º and 46º; the image spatial resolution is 0.75-0.63 m/pixel. These images have high quality: their signal-to-noise-ratio SNR varies between 37 and 64. Images were coregistered with each other and transformed to common resolution of 1.5 m/pixel.    Fig. 1. Lunar surface area under study (2.55 × 1.24 km): the portion of LROC NA image M188379229LE, АS = -57.01º (marked with white arrow), θ = 35.11 º, SNR = 37.    Fig. 2. Relief calculated based on four source images with improved photoclinometry.   Fig. 3. Small-scale topography. Heights vary within ±1.65 m range. Darker shades correspond to lower heights.  For calculations of surface heights gradient we adopted Lambert law as an a priori known photometric function of the surface. The surface albedo was considered to be constant over the surface and equal to 0.719.  1860.pdf

Results:  The resulting topography of the area under study obtained using four source images is presented in Fig. 2. These calculations required ~ 11000 iterations during application of the finite difference method. Calculations were stopped when maximum difference in height values between two consequent iterations did not exceed value of 3⋅10-8.  The large-scale topography in Fig. 2 allows distinguishing only rather large craters. Heights in this area vary within 14.2 m with standard deviation of 2.8 m. Small-scale topography of the area under study is shown in Fig. 3. This relief distribution corresponds to results of the reconstruction procedure after only 1000 iterations.  There are a lot of small shallow craters in the area. Many craters in Fig. 3 including those as small as ~8 m in diameter exhibit circular rims. Sometimes craters rims look rather degraded that points to the longer presence of these craters on the lunar surface. Enlarged views of small-scale topography for three areas outlined in Fig. 1 are shown in Fig. 4. Topography details of five craters marked in Fig.4 are presented in the table. Craters depths and rim heights were calculated in relation to adjoined surface. Craters 2 and 3 (Fig. 4B) seem to be shallower in comparison with craters 4 and 5 (Fig. 4C). This could occur due to different underlying surface structure or different age. Craters 2 and 3 in Fig. 4B could also experience additional filling due to, for example, close impact.  Table 1. Topography details for selected craters. Crater Diameter, m Depth, m Rim height, m 1 192 -1.57 1.63 2 37 -0.23 0.15 3 40 -0.23 0.19 4 40 -0.8 0.11 - 0.19 5 30 -0.4 0.11 - 0.15   Conclusions:  The improved photoclinometry method for relief reconstruction from images allows calculation of the most probable surface topography based on available images. The use of several source images of the surface taken at different and optimal illumination azimuths made possible topography reconstruction for small craters.  References:  [1] Robinson M. S et al.
