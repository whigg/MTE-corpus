Introduction: The Mount Sharp group is the     stratigraphic succession of hydrated sedimentary rocks at the base of Aeolis Mons, a 5-km-high mound in Gale crater. This sequence of rocks records major global environmental transitions in its layers [1].    Recent mapping has shown that the Mount Sharp group was truncated during exhumation to form Aeolis Mons, and unconformably overlain by a younger   sequence of rocks informally designated “draping  strata” [2] (see Fig. 1). These draping strata were   studied by the Curiosity rover, and informally named the Stimson formation, comprised dominantly of crossbedded eolian strata [3] (Fig. 2). The hypothesis of a             significant unconformity, involving denudation of the Mount Sharp group, predicts local paleotopographic variability along the base of the Stimson formation.                 Here, we characterize lateral variations in elevation and geologic expression of the contact between the aeolian Stimson formation sandstone and the           underlying Murray formation in the region between the Amargosa Valley and the Bridger basin (Fig. 3). Rover-scale investigation is coupled with geologic mapping and topographic analysis of high-resolution orbital data in order to quantitatively reconstruct the           topography associated with the unconformity. This analysis will provide boundary conditions on the                         paleoenvironments of initial Stimson sedimentation, which may have reflected topographic variability.  Figure 3.

Data and Methods: Mastcam image data between sols 955 and 1170, including mosaics, were analyzed for the study. We mapped the Murray-Stimson contact using rover data based on several defining physical characteristics for each unit: the Stimson formation is a darker toned, resistant, ridge- and talus slope-forming, platy-weathering, coarse grained, crossbedded Figure 1.

sandstone that often contains joints with alteration  halos and minor to rare Ca-sulfate veins; in contrast, the Murray formation is a lighter toned, commonly  recessive-weathering lithology that does not produce large talus blocks (Fig. 4). The Murray is fine-grained mudstone that is thinly to thickly laminated, with rare interstratified sandstone lenses, and abundant Casulfate-filled veins along distinct fractures. The Murray-Stimson contact was also analyzed in High Resolution Science Imaging Experiment (HiRISE, [4]) image data. Color stretches were applied to highlight distinguishing properties and differentiate the two formations. The fields of view of Mastcam mosaics of interest were automatically plotted onto the HiRISE image based on their azimuth range and    location by sol. For outcrops for which Mastcam data coverage was available, the contact mapped in the Mastcam images was traced onto the HiRISE image and a high resolution DTM created from HiRISE   stereo pair and MOLA elevation data. Where no  Mastcam data coverage was available, the trace of the contact was interpolated, enabling topographic      analysis along the regionally continuous contact. Results: The elevation of the Murray-Stimson   contact (Fig. 2) shows almost 10 m of local relief across 230 m laterally as mapped in the 9 Mastcam mosaics covering it in the Logan Pass and Marias Pass area, and 25 m of variability in relief along ~1 km of           continuously exposed contact in HiRISE data of Logan and Marias Pass (green in Figs. 3 and 4). In Bridger Basin, across a lateral distance of 80 m, almost 5 m of relief was observed along the contact mapped in the 5  Mastcam mosaics (red, dark purple, dark blue in Figs. 3 and 5); 10 m of variability was seen along ~600 m of              continuous contact mapped in HiRISE data between  Bridger Basin and Brandberg (light purple, light blue in Figs. 3 and 5). Across the two regions, over 20 m of net elevation change is expressed along the interpreted regional contact (Figs. 2 and 5).  Topographic analysis at a regional scale based on HiRISE image data reveals that the contact                systematically increases in elevation to the south,    toward Mt. Sharp. On top of this regional trend there are significant deviations. In particular, outliers were    identified near Marias Pass, Big Hole Peak, and in the Pahrump Hills. The undulatory nature of this contact paleosurface as observed regionally, is consistent with Figure 5.

Finally, the regional northern slope of the unconformity ~trends with the modern slope in this region, based on comparison with a representative plane within the regional DTM.  Discussion: The significant variability in relief    observed along the Murray-Stimson contact supports the interpretation of an erosional unconformity at the base of the Stimson formation. Though the mechanism of erosion is not yet known confidently, overlying   sedimentary deposits of the Stimson formation suggest eolian or fluvial processes may have operated to create “superscoops” analogous to wind-deflated or waterscoured surfaces observed in ancient rocks on Earth [5]. The rise in elevation of the unconformable contact toward the south is consistent with exhumation of Mt. Sharp to produce a surface slope that predates        deposition of the Stimson formation, and other     “draping” units that overlie truncated Mount Sharp group rocks [2]. The similarity between the slope of the unconformity and the modern regional slope     indicates that only thin remnants are preserved of the Stimson formation, which once was likely a laterally extensive, and possibly thick, succession of strata. Outlier deviations from the regional dip of the contact may represent local effects such as impact craters,          “superscoop” topography, or fluvial incised valleys. References: [1] Milliken R.
