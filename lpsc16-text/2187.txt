THE FORMATION OF Q-TYPE ASTEROIDS FROM YORP SPIN-UP AND FISSION K. J. Graves,D. A. Minton, and M. Hirabayashi, Purdue University 550 Stadium Mall Dr., West Lafayette, IN,(graves24@purdue.edu)Introduction Q-type asteroids are the best spectralmatch to many ordinary chondrites and have very similarspectra to S-type asteroids. The difference between theS-type and Q-type spectra is that S-types have a darker,redder spectra with shallower absorption bands. Thesedifferences are believed to be formed by space weathering, in which solar wind and micrometeorites interactwith the asteroid's surface [1]. Since any space weathering would only affect the surface grains, any near globaloverturn or removal of the surface material of an S-typeasteroid would turn it into a Q-type. Additionally, spaceweathering will work to steadily change any Q-typesback to S-types over a certain timescale. Thus, theremust be some "resetting" mechanism acting in the NEAregion that competes against space weathering to createthe approximate 4:1 ratio of S-types to Q-types.There have been a number of Q-type formationmechanisms proposed [2-5]. It has been shown that impacts between asteroids are not frequent enough to explain the number of Q-types observed, except for smallasteroids in closely packed asteroid clusters and familiesin the main belt [6]. YORP induced spin-up and fissionhas been suggested as a formation mechanism for fewQ-type asteroids that have been found in newly formedasteroid pairs in the main belt [7]. The favored formationmechanism for the large number of Q-types found in theNEA region is that tides raised during close encounterswith the terrestrial planets cause landslides that can overturn the surface of the asteroid [4, 8].Recently, DeMeo et al. [8] conducted a large numberof observations and discovered many new Q-type asteroids in the NEA region, shown in Figure 1. They concluded that the tidal mechanism could still explain all Qtypes in the NEA region if close encounters with Marswere considered. We used these new data, but insteadused a different method, very similar to Nesvorny´ et al.[4], to analyze the past histories of these asteroids. Wefound that there were ∼15 Q-type asteroids that have avery low probability of ever having had a close encounterwith any planet in the last million years.In addition, we note that there are at least 7 identifiedbinary Q-type asteroids in the NEA region, suggestingthat they have had a fissioning event prior to the last closeplanetary encounter. Thus, there are some asteroids inthe NEA region that were most likely formed by YORPspin-up and fission. We built a Monte Carlo simulationto test if most or all Q-type NEAs could be created byYORP spin-up and fission. 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0  0.5  1  1.5  2  2.5  3EccentricitySemi-major Axis (AU)S-complexQ-typesSq/Q-typesFigure 1: The orbits of all identified S-complex asteroidsin the NEA region. Q-types and those with spectra on theboundary between Q-types and Sq-types, called Sq/Qtypes, are highlighted.Orbital Histories We investigated the past orbitalpositions of these objects using the SWIFTER rmvs integrator [9], and recorded any encounters with a terrestrialplanet within 50 planetary radii. We created 100 clonesof each asteroid by spreading out their orbital elementsin a normal distribution with the covariances taken fromthe matrices on the JPL Small Body Database [10], andintegrated every clone backwards in time for 1 Myr.In Figure 2, we show examples of 4 Q-type asteroids who have a very low percentage of clones havingan encounter with any planet in the last million years.Most of these Q-types with low encounter probabilitiesare from newer observations, and were classified as thosethat could only have encounters with Mars [8]. While itcould be argued that the limitations of the backwards integrations could account for a few of these asteroids, thelarger number are at odds with the explanation that theywere created by close encounters with planets.Binary Populations Using the JPL Small BodyDatabase and the database, "Binary NEAs Detected byRadar" [11], maintained by Lance Benner, we find that7 out of 23 (30%) S-complex binary asteroids are positively identified as Q-types. While still affected by smallnumber statistics, it is clear that Q-types are present inthe binary population with a fraction that is at least similar, if not greater, than the 20% of Q-types in overallNEA S-complex population [8]. Since any close encounter with a planet would much more readily disruptthe binary than reset the surface of either asteroid, wecan conclude that the last major event that occurred to2187.pdf

Also, Polishooket al. [7] showed that pair formation can form Q-types,the most reasonable mechanism to create these binary Qtypes asteroids is YORP fission.YORPFissionModel Using a Monte Carlo model,we explored the hypothesis that all Q-types, not just binaries, could be formed from YORP spin-up and fission. We began with a population of 104 asteroids with aMaxwellian spin distribution centered on 4.82 rev/day,and with a size frequency distribution matching thatof the NEA population [13, 14]. We selected a nondimensional YORP coefficient from a flat distributionof reasonable values [15], and fixed a 15 Myr, replacing removed asteroids with new ones. We also chose atimescale (TSW ) at 1 AU for the space weathering to takea fresh Q-type and make it no longer a Q-type. There area range of values for this timescale calculated both fromobservations and experiments (e.g. [16]), but we settledon 30 kyr as a best estimate. This is shorter compared tomany other estimates because TSW is often chosen to bethe timescale to take a fresh Q-type and weather it completely, rather than simply move out of the Q-type class.In each step of our model, we accelerate the spin rateby YORP [13, 15], and weather each asteroid. Both processes scale with the amount of solar irradiance the asteroids experience at their current orbit [5]. Thus, weshould not expect an orbital dependence in our data. Finally, if the asteroid is at or above the spin barrier, wereverse the YORP acceleration and reset the weathering.With these assumptions, this model predicts that themajority of the asteroids in the NEA population shouldbe Q-types. Figure 3 shows the fraction of Q-types inthe population vs the Absolute Magnitude. The modelmatches well at lower magnitudes, but grossly overpredicts the number of Q-types at high magnitudes. Thisover-prediction may be due to the lack of "StochasticYORP" in our model, in which the spin rates of bodiesare not uniformly changed, but can vary stochasticallydue to the large effect of small topography changes on theYORP parameter [17]. Stochastic YORP can potentiallyhave a size dependence because of the difference in therelative size of the asteroid and the boulders that couldmove around and change the YORP parameter, meaningthat small asteroids would take longer to spin-up to disruption than you would otherwise predict.References [1] Chapman C.
