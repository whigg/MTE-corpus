Soderblom2, 1Purdue University, West Lafayette,IN 47907-2051, USA, (thirabayashi@purdue.edu), 2Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139,USA.Introduction: The heavily cratered highlands of theMoon are commonly considered to have formed duringthe early history bombardment in the inner Solar System[1]. The lunar crater distribution provides a record forabsolute-age crater chronology systems.Recent studies have shown that cratering plays a significant role in the evolution of porosity in a surface.Impacts are capable of both increasing and decreasingcrustal porosity [2], leading to an equilibrium state inimpact-generated porosity [3]. Porosity also affects thecratering process, resulting in changes in the impactcrater to size scaling relationships [4].Here, we use the CTEM code [1, 5] to model the evolution of impact-generated porosity in the lunar surface.Using the results by Collins [6], we implement a newmodel for generating porosity in CTEM. We will thenuse GRAIL observations of the lunar gravity field toconstrain our porosity model [2, 3].Modeling of porous regions in CTEM: The formation of a crater starts from the contact between a projectile and a target surface, leading to strong compression.During the excavation stage, the shock wave and the following rarefaction cause the target material to be in motion, which leads to excavation flows [7]. Once slopefailure occurs, the transient cavity is filled with mixedbreccias and clastic debris (the final stage) [8].x [m]y [m]  −400 −200 0 200 400 600−400−2000200400600Thickness of the porous region [m]0.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.9x [m]y [m]  −400 −200 0 200 400 600−400−2000200400600Thickness of the porous region [m]05101520253035(a) (b) Figure 1: The thickness of the porous surface made after animpact. The impact velocity and size of the impactor are 15km/s and 10 m, respectively. The rim diameter is 220 m. Panels a and b show the original code and the new code, respectively. The color bar of Panel a ranges from 0 to 0.9 meters,while that of Panel b does from 0 to 40 meters.During such a process, dilatancy plays a significantrole in the formation of porosity. Collins [6] reportedthat little dilation occurs during the excavation phase,but it becomes crucial during the final stage, leading toa dramatic change in porosity. Therefore, in CTEM,we consider material filled in the transient crater afterthe excavation stage to be more porous than the preimpact target. Note that in this study, we do not analyzea detailed distribution of porosity, but consider impactgenerated porosity in contrast to nonporous regions. Todetermine the shape of the transient crater, we computethe transient crater depth, ht, from the rim-to-rim diameter, Dt, as ht = 0.3Dt [7]. The shape is then assumed to follow a simple parabolic profile. Because ofthis implementation, an impact-induced porous regionobtained in the new model differs from that in the original model, which only considers excavated materialsto compute the thickness of that region. In the originalmodel, porous regolith was generated only by ejecta accumulation. In Figure 1, we contrast the old and newmodels. While the porosity depth is only up to 0.9 maround the rim and is zero inside the crater in the original model, it reaches up to 40 m at the center of thecrater in the new model.Also, CTEM uses a crater size scaling relationshipto determine the size of an impact crater from the impactor, size, velocity, and angle [1]. The current version is capable of computing both porous and nonporouscases in the gravity regime. We show the size scalingrelationship for these cases in CTEM. Figure 2 indicates the porous and nonporous scaling relationships byWu¨nnemann [4]. Using the form piD = Cgpi−βg2 [4], wefixCg and βg at 1.34 and 0.170 for the porous cases, andat 1.32 and 0.216 for the nonporous cases, respectively(Figure 2).Red dots: loose dry sandSolid line: porous caseDotted line: nonporous case10-11 10-9 10-7 10-551050100Gravity-scaled size π2Scaledcraterdiameterπ DFigure 2: Crater-scaling relationships for porous and nonporous cases.

In CTEM, the dotted line is implementedfor the nonporous cases, while the solid line is done for theporous cases.The scaling parameters obtained allow CTEM to control the size of a transient crater.

the surface is nonporous. Then, if this depth is largerthan the thickness of the porous layer, the program callsa routine for using the scaling law for the porosity cases.Results: We first introduce the simulation settings.The impact velocity and size distribution profiles usedare the same as used by Minton et al. [1]. We use a 720m by 720-m square area as a test region. The side ofeach pixel is 3.6 meters. Initially, the surface in the testarea is nonporous. To study 2 Ga evolution of a poroussurface on the Moon, we conduct 200 iterations, eachof which is 10 Ma. The maximum size of the crater is720 m while the minimum size of it is 3.6 m. We donot consider the crust thickness in this study. With thesesettings, each case generates ∼ 1× 107 impact craters.Figure 3 describes the thickness of porous regions onthe test area. While porous regions produced by largerimpacts are obviously visible, the distribution of thethickness is quite random. The growth rate of porosityaround larger craters tends to become smaller than thataround smaller ones because after a large impact develops a porous region, small impacts cannot increase theporosity any further.x [m]y [m]  0 200 400 6000100200300400500600700Thickness of the porous region [m]510152025Figure 3: Thickness of the regolith layer in the test regionafter 2.0 Ga. The contour color ranges from 0 m to 30 m.Figure 4 plots time-variation in the averaged thicknessof the porous region over the test area. While the thickness only reaches up to 0.1 m in the original model (thered line), it increases up to 9 m in the new one (the blueline). The averaged thickness in the new model linearlyincreases until 1.5 Ga. However, after this period, itsgrowth rate decreases substantially. This growth decayresults from the fact that the porosity growth is in equilibrium for smaller craters, meaning that while the testarea reached equilibrium for smaller impact craters, ithas not yet reached equilibrium for larger impacts. Theshallower slope after 1.5 Ga implies that the equilibrium point gradually shifts upward in crater diameterwith time.The slopes of the porosity growth before andafter 1.5 Ga are 6.4 m/Ga and 1.3 m/Ga, respectively.0 0.5 1 1.5 202468101214Time [Ga]Averaged porous surface thickness [m]Figure 4: Variation in the average thickness of the poroussurface for 2.0 Ga. This is obtained by averaging the thicknessover the test area. The blue line gives the newly developedmodel, while the red line is for the original model. The dashedline indicates the slope for the porosity growth before 1.5 Ga,while the dot-dashed line describes that after that period. Theslope is 6.4 m/Ga for the first 1.5 Ga and then decreases to 1.3m/Ga.The present study shows that the saturation limit of thethickness is about 9 m, consistent with earlier studies,which showed that the thickness of a regolith surfaceranges from 3 m to 20 m on the Moon [9, 10]. On theother hand, if impact craters are directly responsible forthe formation of porosity, the porosity layer in the lunar highland crust is no more than ∼ 8 km in depth [3],consistent with estimates of the thickness of the lunarmegaregolith [11]. To investigate the evolution of sucha thick porous region, we will run simulations for thelate heavy bombardment crater distribution. Note thatas discussed by Soderblom et al. [3], the thick porouscrust might have formed due to impact-generated fracturing. Further study is necessary to understand thismechanism. Also, we have not yet incorporated the detailed distribution of porosity in CTEM. As discussedby Collins [1], porosity depends on the size and impactvelocity of an impactor. Implementation of this effectwill be our future work.References: [1] D. A. Minton, et al. (2015) Icarus247:172. [2] C. Milbury, et al. (2015) GRL. [3] J. M.Soderblom, et al. (2015) GRL 42(17):6939.
