Introduction: Although porosities have only been inferred for a few dozen asteroids, most porosities range from 20% to >50%, with a mean porosity of ~30% [1]. Meteorites, which sample the asteroids, have a similar range of porosities, from nearly 0 to >40%.	  Porous targets react significantly differently to impact cratering and disruption than non-porous targets. Because the physical properties of the meteorites vary from one to another meteorite, we have begun a series of hypervelocity impact cratering and disruption experiments, focusing on a specific meteorite. Our initial effort is directed at Northwest Africa 869 (NWA 869), an L3-L6 ordinary chondrite with a weathering state W1 and a shock state S3. NWA 869 is a chondritic breccia consisting of ~75% matrix (by volume) with unequilibrated and equilibrated L-chondrite clasts up to 5.5 cm in size, some of which display shock darkening [2]. Over 2 tons of NWA 869 stones were recovered from  a large strewn field. Macke (pers. comm.) measured porosities of 6 of these NWA 869 samples, finding values ranging from 2.7 to 10.2% with a mean of 6.4%.  This work focuses on determining the threshold collisional specific energy, Q*D, and the momentum transfer by crater ejecta. Momentum Transfer by Crater Ejecta:  The momentum change of an asteroid in response to an impact cratering event has two components: 1) the direct transfer of momentum by the impacting projectile, and, 2) the recoil of the asteroid in response to the crater ejecta. Although the efecta direction is effected by local topography, it is generally directed opposite the direction of the impactor, resulting in a momentum transfer that is approximately the same direction as thje direct momentum transferred by the projectile. Hypervelocity impact cratering into an asteroid can produce a significant mass of moderate speed ejecta, compared to the mass of the impactor. Thus, even for low ejecta speed, crater ejecta can produce a significant change in asteroid momentum.      The total momentum gain of the target can be characterized by the momentum multiplication factor β:           β =  (mpvp + pe)/mpvp  =   MtVt/mpvp where pe is the momentum of the ejecta,  mp and vp are the mass and velocity of the impactor, and Mt and Vt are the mass and gain in velocity of the target. The mpvp term is the direct momentum transfer and the pe term is the momentum provided by the crater ejecta. Thus, if the only contribution to the momentum gain of the target is the direct momentum transfer due to projectile capture, β will equal 1. Any additional momentum transfer from the crater ejecta increases the β value.       Modeling suggests that momentum added by the crater ejecta can exceed that from direct momentum transfer by a factor of ten or more in non-porous targets [3]. In a hypervelocity impact experiment, Housen and Holsapple [4] measured a β = 5 for river rock impacted at ~5.5 km/s. They found progressively lower values of β for impactors having lower speeds, and β is also modeled to decrease with increasing target porosity.      To quantitatively determine the momentum transfer in a hypervelocity cratering event we suspended each NWA 869 target in front of a large rectangular grid in the vacuum chamber at the NASA Ames Vertical Gun Range, as shown in Figure 1. To minimize the effect on the target of the gas emitted by the gun, a mylar disk was located downstream from the sabot stripper, and a paper disk was placed over the entry port of the gun chamber. Both are easily penetrated by the hypervelocity Al projectile, but tend to diffuse the gas emitted by the gun. To validate this, Shot 150613 was a 'blank,' in which the gun was fired, with the normal powder load for a 5 km/sec shot with a 1/16" Al projectile, at the same 135 g NWA 869 target later used in Shot 150614, but no projectile was loaded. Analysis of the high-speed video showed no detectable recoil of the target.       We conducted 7 cratering shots (Table 1). For the 2014 shots the recoil speed was determined using a single high-speed camera, which gives only the component of the recoil velocity perpendicular to the line connecting the camera to the target. As a result the β values are lower limits. For the 2015 shots, two highspeed cameras were used to determine β, one parallel to the floor and one looking down on the target.  Both results, which are similar, are given in Table 1.

We performed 10 disruption experiments of NWA 869 targets spanning a wide range of impactor kinetic energies (Table 2). The results, in Figure 2, are consistent with a Q*D value of ~1795 J/kg, higher than the 1419 J/kg reported on 9 H, L, and LL ordinary chondrites [5], and more than double the value for terrestrial basalt. Conclusions: NWA 869, and presumably its parent asteroid, behave significantly differently than compact terrestrial rocks. It requires more than twice the impactor energy per unit target mass (Q*D) compared to terrestrial basalt to produce the same fragmentation. While the momentum enhancement by cratering (β-1) for NWA 869 is half that of river rocks, it is large enough to produce more deflection of the path of an asteroid than results from direct momentum transfer.
