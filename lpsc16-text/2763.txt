Evidence for superaparamagnetic nanoparticles in limestones from Chiemgau crater field, SE Germany.  V. Procházka1, G. Kletetschka1, 1Institute of Hydrogeology, Engineering Geology and Applied Geophysics, Charles Univ., Albertov 6, CZ-12843  Praha 2, Czech Republic (vprochaska@seznam.cz),     Introduction:  Magnetic susceptibility (MS) has been measured at various frequencies and magnetic fields in rocks from craters of the Chiemgau strewn field. These usually small crater-like structures are developed in Quaternary terraces (formed by pebbles of various rocks from Alps) and characterized by disequilibrium very-high temperature and sometimes highpressure metamorphism along with structural pebble deformation [1]. Anthropogenic origin of the observed phenomena is improbable, out of geological interpretations the role of a Holocene impact event is most cited [1,2,3].  Relatively very high magnetic susceptibility of soils and pebbles in craters, especially limestones, had been documented, as well as anomalously high remanent magnetizations and Koenigsberger ratios [3]. These magnetic properties are incomparable to those of the same rocks far from the craters [3].  The goal of our measurements was detection of superparamagnetic particles, whose formation can be another result of extreme p,T,t paths.   Measurement: MS in specimens from 7 pebbles was obtained on the SM-100 (ZH Instruments, Brno, Czech Republic) at frequencies 0.5 – 8 kHz and fields 10 – 320 A/m.  Results: The XFD parameter of silicate rocks is mostly between 1.0 and 2.0 % (3 pebbles with glass coatings and ocassionally veinlets). Quartzite sample with very low MS was penetrated and coated by three types of glass. For this sample XFD reached 12 %.  XFD of limestones from the craters reached up to 16 % (Tab. 1). Both MS (not in silicate rocks) and XFD are generally higher in weathering crusts than inside, however weathering obviously explains neither the high MS, nor high XFD. Discussion and conclusion:  The detection of frequency-dependence of MS in limestones is due to presence of superparamagnetic nanoparticles, which can be made of magnetite or maghemite. The fact that they formed in limestones rather than in crystalline silicate rocks indicates their origin mainly from Fe-hydroxides, not from silicates. The HT- and HP-event caused dehydration and only short-term heating, mosty insufficient for growth of larger crystals. Acknowledgements:  We thank to B. and M. Rappenglück as well as to P.
