Haider 2,  1 C.U.Shah Science college, Ahmedabad, India (physics_bmp@yahoo.com); 2 Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad, India   Introduction:  Oort Cloud Comet C/2013 A1 Siding Spring (C/2013) moving in hyperbolic retrograde orbit with velocity ~56 km/sec crossed the orbit of Mars on 19 October 2014 at 18:35 UT. The metallic ions and neutral atoms are deposited due to ablation of meteoroids whose count rate has been measured. Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS) on board MAVEN have observed eight metallic species (Mg, Fe, Na, K, Mn, Ni, Cr, and Zn) during the close encounter. Imaging Ultraviolet spectrograph (IUVS) on board MAVEN has recorded intensity of emission with large number of pulse peaks between 200 nm to 300 nm with highest peak at 280 nm wavelength, which confirms a large impact of metallic species Mg and Fe during close approach [mars.nasa.gov/comets/sidingspring] [1]. At close approach, Shallow Radar (SHARAD) on board Reconnaissance Orbiter also observed ionized layer to predict intense meteor showers and reported 5-10 times enhancement in TEC that is in accordance with predicted enhancement of 5-7 times by Pandya and Haider [2] due to close approach of comets to produce meteor showers. We have estimated and integrated production rate of six metallic ions Mg +, Fe +, Na +, Mn +, K + and Ni + ions due to impact of micro meteoroids (masses â‰¤ 10 -4 g) and meteoroids (mass > 10 -4 g) with velocities 10 km/sec, 18 km/sec and 30 km/sec.  Model Calculation: We have used Chondrite compositions in the cometary meteoroids in which metallic elements are fractioned given in the Table-1. In the Chondrite composition over 50% atoms are Oxygen and other gases and species which are less abundant to produce ionization in the Martian ionosphere [3], [4]. The flux ranging from 1.47 x 10 -9 gm cm -2 sec -1 to 2.0 x 10 -13 gm cm -2 sec -1 for micro meteoroids and 1.43 x 10 -14 gm cm -2 sec -1 to 4.23 x 10 -21 gm cm -2 sec -1 for meteoroids is used in the present calculations. The coupled equations of motion, ablation and energy are integrated to calculate variations in mass temperature and velocity of meteoroids at different altitude during the night time of Mars. Janches et al. [5] and Jones [4] explored the ionization probability which is used to calculate production rate in the present work.  Result Discussion: The meteoroids penetrate deep to produce peak in the production rate of abundant metallic ions ~10 -1 to 10 -5 cm -3 sec -1 and neutrals ~10 -1 to 10 +1 cm -3   sec -1 at altitude range of 60 km to 90 km. The micro meteoroids ablate slowly in the ionosphere of Mars with broad peak at altitude range of 90 km to 116 km and result in to peak production rate of abundant ions from ~10 -3 cm -3   sec -1 to 10 +3 cm -3  sec -1 and neutral atoms from ~10 +1 cm -3 sec -1 to 10 +4 cm -3 sec -1 for three different speed of meteoroids (Table-1). Production rate of six abundant metallic ions are shown in the Figure-1 for meteoroids and Micro meteoroids with velocity ~18 km/sec.

The production rate of Mg + ion is calculated in the present work is ~8 cm -3 sec -1 which is one order lower than the predicted values of Withers [6]. If ionization threshold and ionization potential are greater than the total energy of the colliding atoms in the centre of mass frame, no ionization of individual meteor atoms can be observed. Therefore the threshold velocity for a metallic meteor atoms are considered lower in order ~8 km/sec to ~11 km/sec for different species compare to the meteoroid speed [4], [5], [7]. The production rate decreases with decreasing velocity of the impacting meteoroids.  Conclusion: The production of ions reveals the fact that the air density of Martian atmosphere provides enough drag to ablate the meteoroids deep  in the atmosphere. The fast reacting abundant amount of ions are produced due to direct meteoric ablation and probably react with CO2 and O2 by three body reaction to results into neutrals of these ions and other metallic compounds. Future scope of the present work is to model the chemistry of the Martian ionosphere due to encounter of the Comet C/2013 and reveal the change in the present atmospheric chemistry of the Mars.
