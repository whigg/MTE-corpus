Introduction: Prior to MESSENGER, only parts of Mercury's surface were known. The new data received by MESSENGER in 2011-2015 offered the opportunity to the scientific community to explore Mercury's surface in more detail. For example, study of multi-ring basins shows that their frequency is greater in the western hemisphere [1]; study of kilometer-scale topographic roughness of Mercury demonstrates the dichotomy between the smooth northern plains and heavily cratered southern terrains [2]; analysis of smooth plains, the majority of which are interpreted to be volcanic in origin [3]; morphometric analysis of small craters proves that the regolith on Mercury is significantly thicker than on the Moon [4]. We used the results of research, mentioned above, for new mapping of Mercury at global level. Data: Results of MESSENGER data processing provided various types of topographic information, but the spacecraft orbit was highly eccentric, therefore available digital elevation models (DEMs) have different resolutions in different areas of the planet:  DEMs [5] from data obtained by MESSENGER laser altimetry (MLA) covering areas:  from 55°N to 90°N (500 m/pixel); all the northern hemisphere, including small part of southern from 4° S to 90° N (1000 m/pixel); above 75° N (1000 m/pixel); from 55°N to 90°N (2000 m/pixel);  DEMs [6] from stereo images obtained by MDIS (Mercury Dual Imaging System) via Wide Angle camera (WAC) that the following areas: 65°N - 11°S, 263°W - 168°W; 66°N - 8°S, 81°W - 1°W; 65°N - 54°S, 302°W - 273°W (1000 m/pixel);  Additionally, new global DEM (resolution 22 000 m/pixel) derived from limb measurements of MESSENGER WAC images, that fully covers Mercury's surface, has been produced recently [7]. Also DEMs with resolution 2000 m/pixel from Mariner-10 data that cover only parts of the Mercury surface (50°N - 90°N; 5°N - 65°S, 200°E - 0°E) are available [8]. Mapping: Now, with new MESSENGER data full global maps became possible. Besides global DEM for mapping we used results of the Mercury studies, especially analysis of Mercurian multi-ring objects [1] and plains [3] as well as crater catalogue [9]. Multi-ring basin and ray systems were identified using Mercury's global mosaic (resolution 220 m/pixel) produced from MESSENGER images [10]. We have compiled topographic maps (Fig. 1) for producing new hypsometric Mercury globe, that continues a series (initiated by Sternberg Astronomical Institute), which now includes globes of Venus, Mars and the Moon [11].   a  b Fig. 1.

Hypsometric maps have been compiled in azimuthal equidistant projection with scale 1:51 000 000, which takes into account the law of deformation occurring in process of transform of the plane cartographic image to 3D-hemispheres in proportion 1:1,5. Mercury topography is shown by contours in 500 m and the hypsometric scale in 16 intervals. The elevations are referenced to a sphere with radius 2 439 700 m recommended by the International Astronomical Union. All objects of interest, such as Caloris Montes, the longest scarp Enterprise (822 km) and large craters (> 100 km in diameter), are identified using official planetary nomenclature [12].  As Mercury is the planet closest to the Sun the "warm" color design was chosen according to previously published Russian maps [13]. The globe's diameter is 15 cm, scale - 1:32 500 000. Meridians and parallels are depicted every 10 degrees (Fig.2). New cartography project: With the coming launch of the European mission BepiColombo in 2017, there is sustained great interest in Mercury cartography. Besides a globe, we are going to produce a Mercury wall map to update of terrestrial planets maps' series [14] using newest results of MESSENGER processing of stereo images obtained by MDIS.  The map will show not only the global view, as the Mercury globe, but will demonstrate the results of our geomorphologic study more detailed, based on new high resolution DEMs (50-200 m/pixel) produced for surface analysis [15] from images obtained by MDIS Narrow angle camera (NAC). Small interesting features of the Mercurian relief, for example, flat-floored craters and hollows, will be presented for studied area at large scale.  Conclusions: For the first time Mercury hypsometric globe was developed (Fig. 2), which based not only on orthomosaic, unlike the recently released first globe of Mercury [16], but also on global DEM, obtained from limb measurements of MESSENGER WAC images.  In frame of the International Map Year [17], which is held since 2015 until end of 2016, we are going to update the Terrestrial maps series and to create a wall map based on result of our geomorphological study of Mercury surface using global and local DEMs from new MESSENGER WAC and NAC images stereoprocessing.
