Cold formation of small impact craters: Formation of large impact craters such as ~200 km Chicxulub 65 Ma ago [1] is associated with release of significant amount of thermal energy [2,3,4,5]. In case of Chicxulub, it was sufficient to start wildfires that had either regional [6], or global [7] range.  The evidence for wildfires caused by impacts smaller than Chicxulub is inconclusive. On one hand, no signs of fires are associated with the formation of 24 km in diameter Ries crater [8]. On the other hand, it is clear that the Tunguska site was burned after the impact, moreover, the numerical models of the bolide-produced thermal radiation suggest that the Tunguska-like event would produce a thermal flux to the surface that is sufficient to ignite pine needles [9]. However, the only proof for the bolide starting the fire comes from an eyewitness description collected many years after the event. Some authors [10] suggest that this fire might have been caused "normaly" later during the same year, induced on dead trees killed by the Tunguska fall. More recently it was observed that the Chelyabinsk meteor [11] - smaller than Tunguska event - did not produced a fire. To summarize, previously published data suggest that formation of 100s meters in diameter impact craters is not associated with wildfires (despite the picturesque visions presented in the documentary and entertainment movies).  In order to explore this apparent relationship in more detail, we have studied the proximal ejecta from a small 100-m in diameter Kaali crater (Estonia) within which we find pieces of charred organic material. Those pieces appear to have been produced during the impact, according to their stratigraphic location and following 14C analysis as opposed to pre or post-impact forest fires. The aim of this project is to determine the mechanism by which this material was charred with the aim to broaden our understanding of fires generated by extraterrestrial events.   Kaali Crater: The Kaali impact field consists of nine identified craters located on the Saaremaa Island in Estonia. The largest crater is 110 m in diameter (centered around 58°22'21.94"N, 22°40'09.91" E). It was formed by impact of an IAB iron meteoroid [12] with entry mass between 800 and 3000 tons according to the similarity to the Morasko strewn field [13] into Silurian dolomite target rocks, covered by ~3 meters of glacial till [14]. Age of the Kaali crater is a matter of heated debate: the estimates provided by different authors vary considerably between ~6400 BCE [15, 16] and ~400 BCE [17,18]. A recent 14C dating of charred organic material found within proximal ejecta of Kaali Main Crater showed that this structure was formed shortly after 1530 - 1450 BCE (3237±10 14C yr BP) [19]. This age is largely consistent with a few previous age estimates [20,21,22].  Samples: Samples (used also for dating Kaali: [19]) were collected from a 5 m long and up to 1.7 m deep trench located within the proximal ejecta of Kaali Main. Two types of ejected material was found (Fig. 1A, 1B, 1F): 1) dolomiterich ejecta (mostly angular dolomite fragments from <1 mm up to boulders ~80 cm in diameter) and 2) underlaying tillrich ejecta (locally with rounded glacial boulders) that indistinguishably turns into target material (glacial till).   Figure 1. A) A cross-section through the proximal ejecta blanket. Each segment of the yellow ruler is 20 cm long. B) A boundary between the till-rich layer (brown at the top) and the dolomiterich layer (beige) of the ejected material. C) Charcoal fragments within dolomite-rich ejecta layer.

The location of the dolomite clast within the outcrop is indicated with a black rectangle on image 1C. E) and F) Charcoal fragments embedded within dolomite-rich layer characterized by a thin (~1mm) and long (~1cm) outline. Shape of those fragments suggests that this charcoal was not formed during an earlier forest fire because such charcoal is very delicate and would not survive the ejecta emplacement process in a form in which it was found. Figure from [19]. All fragments of charcoal [19] were found within approximately 10 cm from the contact between dolomite-rich and till-rich ejecta, occurring most abundantly within the top 5 cm of the till-rich ejecta layer (Fig. 1B). Most charcoal fragments were <1 mm in diameter, but a few were >1 cm in 1467.pdf

  length (and up to few mm in width and thickness: Fig. 1C, E, F). A nearly continuous layer containing small fragments of charcoal was found ~14 m from the crater rim and continued for two meters until the proximal end of the trench (i.e., on the side of the trench nearest the crater, extending 2 m and probably continuing beyond the edge of the trench). The charcoal within the till-rich layer was best preserved behind interlocked boulders that "shielded" charcoal-rich ejecta (one of those rocks: an 80 cm in diameter angular dolomite is visible on image 1A). A few charcoal pieces were also found within the dolomite-rich ejecta layer (Fig. 1C). Some of those fragments were strongly adhering to the surface of angular dolomite fragments located within the ejecta layer (Fig. 1D).  The formation mechanism of the charred organic material found within Kaali proximal ejecta is not clear. The small pieces of charcoal within till-rich ejecta (Fig. 1B) could have been formed in a pre-impact forest fire, and intermixed with the ejecta during the impact. However, the existence of charcoal fragments adhering to an angular dolomite fragment (Fig. 1D) can only be explained by formation during the impact event by contact of organic matter with fresh clasts of dolomite, which were moved from several meters depth to the near-surface. The fact that they are strongly adhering to each other may suggest that they were deposited warm.  It is possible that charred organic matter found within Kaali proximal ejecta was formed by more than one mechanism. However, the fact that all of the studied charcoal fragments have the same age within error [19], suggests that they were formed from organic material growing around the same time and killed at the same moment: that they are the result of a single process. Methods and initial results: In order to determine the most probable formation mechanism of the charred organic material found within Kaali proximal ejecta blanket, we:  1) Analyzed charcoal under the scanning electron microscope (SEM) in order to identify the charred plants [23] and determine properties of the charcoal related to the temperature of its formation [24]. Initial SEM analysis suggest that wood structure is well preserved, allowing identification of the type of the plant material. Additionally, homogenization of cell walls suggests that at least some pieces of charcoal were formed at >300 °C [24].  2) Analyzed the reflectance properties of the charred particles  in order to determine the intensity with which pyrolysis occurred [25,26]. Here our aim is to use the reflectance properties of the char to determine the likely amount of heat received by the vegetation in order to assess whether the brief thermal pulse associated with this impact is responsible. Initial mesurements suggest that the reflectance of the particles is consistent with them being only partially charred which may be consistent with a relatively short thermal exposure.  3) We will present numerical estimates of entry parameters and thermal radiation from the bolide that reaches the surface of the impact site.  4) Finally we aim to perform numerical modeling using iSALE shock physics code of the Kaali crater formation and ejecta distribution, especially in terms of the temperature of the ejected particles [27].   Figure 2. Fragments of charred organic matter found in the tillrich section of the Kaali proximal ejecta (sample 3.5 [19], 14C dated 1600 BCE (0.9%) 1580 BCE & 1540 BCE (94.5%) 1410 BCE (3210 ± 30 14C yr BP)). Sections A, B and C show the same grain with increasing magnification (bars are 100 µm, 20 µm and 5 µm respectively). Section D shows another grain (bar is 100 µm). Wood structure is well preserved and walls between adjacent cells are homogenized, indicating pyrolysis at temperatures higher than 300 °C [24].
