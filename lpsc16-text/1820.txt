Introduction:  Ceres is the largest object of the asteroid belt (945 km in diameter), with a near spherical body shape (and is now classified as a dwarf planet). H2O may have played a fundamental role its geological evolution [ 1-3], therefore the detection of exposed water-bearing materials have been an important quest  from Earth-based observations and by the Dawn space mission [4]. Near-infrared reflectance spectra acquired by telescope revealed a surface rich in hydroxylated materials [ 5- 12]  (such as phyllosilicates and carbonates)  that may have resulted of acqueous alteration of silicates. Its distance to the sun (between 2.56 and 2.98 Astronomical Units) and shape are consistent with a differentiated interior that is rich in H2O ice [ 1- 3]. In addition, possible releases of OH [ 13] and H2O molecules [ 14] have been reported. Reflectance spectra obtained by the Visible and InfraRed Mapping Spectrometer (VIR-MS) [15] during the Survey orbit of the Dawn spacecraft revealed the presence of exposed surficial H2O on Ceres [ 16]. The shape of spectra may be due to H2O ice or mineral hydrates. Further analysis now focuses on determining the nature of the detected compounds. The geological context of the H2O-rich unit in crater Oxo (Fig. 1) will also be investigated in order to understand its origin. Hypotheses by order of likelihood are 1) release of subsurface materials by eruptions due to hydrothermal activity, 2) exposition of subsurface materials by a meteorite impact or a landslide, 3) deposition of H2Orich materials by collision with a comet and 4) formation at the surface by chemical reaction of charged particles from the solar wind and the surface regolith   Fig. 1:Crater Oxo observed by the Dawn spacecraft Framing Camera during the Low altitude Mapping Orbit. The white arrow indicates the location of the H2O detection by VIR.   Fig. 2: I/F image at 1.1 µm that shows the first observation of crater Oxo by the VIR imaging spectromter during Dawn's Survey orbit around Ceres. The red lines cross at the location of the H2O detection (only two pixels in this image).    Fig. 3: Color composite of VIR normalized data (Red: 1.86 µm ; Green: 2.00 µm ; Blue: 2.18 µm). The blue unit illustrates the negative spectral slope of highalbedo materials within crater Oxo. H2O-rich materials are only two pixels within this blue unit.   Fig. 4. Example of VIR infrared spectra divided by the average spectrum of Ceres. Colored spectra show absorptions at 2.0 µm and 1.55 µm that are diagnostic of H2O-rich materials. The relatively negative spectral slope in the infrared may characterize geologically fresh materials. The black curve is a spectrum of materials outside the blue area in Fig. 3, which have a less negative spectral slope. Grey areas define rangs of wavelength where instrument artifacts may affect the data.  Absorption band of H2O at 2.0 µm in VIR spectra:  The Visible and InfraRed Mapping Spectrometer (VIR-MS) [15] onboard the Dawn spacecraft . [ 4] is sensitive to radiance scattered by the surface of Ceres over two wavelength ranges 0.25-1µm and 0.95-5.1µm with separate detectors. VIR data cover most of the surface of Ceres at low resolution. Spectra acquired during the Survey orbit at 4400 km altitude, with spatial resolution of  approximately 1.1 km/pixel indicate that a high albedo unit within Oxo (Fig. 2) with a relatively negative spectral slope (Fig. 3) exhibits absorption bands of the H2O molecule stretching mode overtone [ 17, 18] at 2.0 and 1.55 µm (Fig. 4) [ 16]. Three observations of the same area acquired within 72 hours (nine Cererean days) confirmed the findings. A small (a few square kilometers) high-albedo spot near the southern rim of Oxo seem to correspond to the location of the detection. At the time of VIR observations (near summer solstice and noon local time), the area was illuminated, however the location is likely shaded most of the time because of the proximity of a sharp crater rim. Candidate H2O-rich materials:  H2O ice and mineral hydrates such as chlorides, sulfates, and carbonates have spectra shapes that could fit VIR spectra. In order to further constrain the composition, the thermophysical stability of exposed H2O-rich compounds on Ceres and results from chemical models of Ceres interior are being investigated. H2O ice.  Pure water ice exposed at the surface may be due to contemporary formation or deposition ; an icecemented regolith could have been recently exposed by an impact or a landslide. However, H2O ice would sublime rapidly enough to disappear in a time very short (a few years) compared to geological timescale  19, 20]. Temporal variations  in the abundance of H2Orich materials would be consistent with H2O ice. Future observations by VIR are planned for this purpose. Mineral hydrates.  Near-infrared reflectance spectra of H2O-rich materials show similar absorption bands at 1.55 and 2.0 µm for both pure water ice and various types of mineral hydrates such as chlorides, sodium carbonates, magnesium sulfates, sodium sulfates and ammonium sulfates. Polyhydrated salts are thermodynamically more stable than pure H2O ice in the conditions of Ceres' surface over geological timescales. Implication of the presence of H2O on Ceres: The detection of exposed H2O ice would likely indicate contemporary hydrothermal activity, and therefore that internal heating due to radionucleide disintegration is strong enough to trigger eruptions. That would also reinforce the conclusions made earlier about observed releases of water vapor [ 14 ] and haze [ 21 ].  On the other hand, if absorption bands of H2O on Ceres are due to polyhydrated minerals, then it would favor a more ancient formation and possible exposure from an impact or a landslide.
