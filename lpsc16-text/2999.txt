Introduction: Simulations of the Moon-forming giant impact generate a circumterrestrial melt-vapor disk from which the Moon is thought to form [e.g. 1]. Passage of the proto-lunar material through such a melt-vapor disk has been invoked to explain the nearzero inclination of the lunar orbit [2,3], the isotopic homogeneity of the Earth-Moon system [4], and the depletion of volatile elements from the proto-lunar material [5]. Despite playing such a central role in the giant impact scenario for the origin of the Moon, the thermochemical evolution of the proto-lunar disk is not well understood. Here, we propose to couple models of proto-lunar disk evolution [e.g. 6] with calculations of liquid-vapor stable isotope fractionation [7] in order to develop new constraints on evolutionary scenarios of the disk via a comparison with isotopic measurements on lunar and terrestrial samples [8,9]. Previous Models: Since the inception of the giant impact hypothesis [10,11], it has been recognized that the high surface densities in the proto-lunar disk will make the disk material susceptible to gravitational instabilities. An early analysis of a particulate disk concluded that the viscous evolutionary timescale may be as short as a few years [12]. It was subsequently realized that such rapid evolutionary timescales would lead to liberation of enough gravitational energy to completely vaporize the proto-lunar material, violating the original assumption of a particulate disk. Hence, the concept of a thermally-regulated proto-lunar disk evolution emerged [13], whereby the evolutionary timescale of the proto-lunar disk is determined via radiation from a photosphere to be ~102-103 years. It has recently been suggested that this radiative timescale can also be reconciled with the timescale for viscous evolution and concomitant gravitational energy release if the liquid settles to the mid-plane and forms a gravitationally unstable layer surrounded by a vapor-rich atmosphere that is gravitationally stable [6]. Disk Model: Here, we aim to articulate the constraints provided by the stable isotopic data on previously described disk evolutionary scenarios. Vertical structure: We assume that the disk undergoes vertical phase separation into a liquid-rich midplane layer and separately convecting overlying atmosphere. Moreover, we assume that the disk achieves hydrostatic equilibrium and that its vertical structure can be described via central planetary gravity:  1/ρ dP/dz = Ω2z   [1] where ρ is the density, P is the pressure, z is the vertical distance, and Ω is the Keplerain orbital velocity. Moreover, we assume that the convecting liquid layer and the overlying atmosphere are in local thermodynamic equilibrium. This is expected because the turnover timescales are short [4] and the liquid-vapor interface will be characterized by bubbles (e.g., due to boiling), a phenomenon that is known on the modern Earth to facilitate ocean-atmosphere exchange [14]. Radial structure: The radial mass distribution is adopted from outputs of smooth-particle hydrodynamic (SPH) models. However, in the adopted model, because the liquid settles to the mid-plane and undergoes gravitational instability, it is decoupled from the overlying atmosphere. Hence, the radial mass structure will evolve according to the effective viscosity of the liquid layer. For a layer undergoing gravitational instability, following [6], we have:  ν ∼ π2G2σ2/Ω3  [2]  where ν is the effective viscosity, G is the gravitational constant, σ is the liquid surface density, and Ω is the Keplerian orbital velocity. Viscous evolution of the liquid layer can transport disk materials beyond the Roche radius (at ~2.9 Earth radii) where gravitational instability can proceed to collapse, generating moonlets that are subsequently involved in lunar accretion [15]. Here, we assume that any material that radially evolves past the Roche radius is incorporated into the accreting Moon. Thermodynamic Model: Prior models of the protolunar disk have utilized either a 1-component 2-phase thermodynamics [6,13] to capture the basic physics in the problem or a many-component 2-phase thermodynamic model appropriate for detailed equilibrium calculations [5]. Here, we adopt a thermodynamic model of intermediate complexity: a 2-component 2-phase binary olivine [(Mg,Fe)2SiO4] model recently developed to study the behavior of the silicate vapor atmosphere on the post giant impact Earth [7]. This model can more accurately capture the behavior of the multicomponent silicate material composing the melt-vapor disk than 1-component models, but is also sufficiently complex to permit calculations of vapor phase speciation and isotopic fractionation for the major elemens. Isotopic Fractionation: It is well-known that isotopic differences among differing phases in equilibrium approach zero at sufficiently high temperatures  [16]. However, magmatic and proto-lunar temperatures may be considered "low" in this context if the bonding environment for the element in question is distinct among the different phases. This is generally the case for the vaporization of silicates, which involves decomposition reactions. For the element silicon, which exists as SiO4-4 in a silicate liquid and primarily as SiO in the co-existing vapor, large equilibrium isotopic differences are expected (~1‰ at 2,000 K) [7]. Importantly, such equilibrium fractionation is not only large in magnitude but temperature-dependent (∆~1/T2) [16] (see Turbulent Transpot section below). By comparison, any silicate Earth-Moon offset is now constrained to a precision of 0.03‰. Due to their high sensitivity to liquid-vapor fractionation and the high precision of the measurements now attained, we use silicon isotopes as tracers to follow the evolution in post-processing fashion and permit comparison of the outcomes of model liquid-vapor scenarios with isotopic observations. Turbulent Transport: The proto-lunar disk is characterized by radial gradients in its physical properties, such as surface density, pressure and temperature. Because equilibrium thermodynamic partitioning depends on these quanties, equilibriation of a liquid-rich midplane layer with an overlying atmosphere will translate such radial gradients in physical properties into radial gradients in the chemical and isotopic composition of a liquid layer and the overlying atmosphere. To model the radial transport of chemical/isotopic species, we consider that transport will be dominated by the convective motions in the atmosphere rather than in the thin underlying liquid-layer [e.g. 4]. We assume that turbulent motions can be characterized by a turbulent diffusivity, D, and parameterize the turbulence in terms of an α model:  D = α cs H   [3]  where cs is the isothermal sound speed and H is the pressure scale height. Note that α is often discussed in the context of viscous evolution but we are here using it to describe turbulent diffusivity (mixing). We adopt values of α that have previously been proposed, e.g. for equilibriation of the proto-lunar disk with the postimpact terrestrial magma ocean [4]. Hence, the modeling here presented can be viewed as an isotopic test of the equilibration hypothesis. Initial Conditions: All Moon-forming giant impacts currently under consideration generate melt-vapor disks rather than intact Moons [20]. Importantly, the initial thermal states of such disks vary widely, ranging from mostly liquid (~80%) in the Mars-mass ("standard") model [1] to mostly vapor (50-90%) in the more energetic collisions recently proposed [17,18]. Hence, determining the initial thermal state of the proto-lunar disk has the potential to discriminate between the proposed models of the giant impact. In our models, the initial thermal state is treated as a free parameter and varied to test the sensitivity of the outcomes to the initial conditions. Conclusions: The evolution of the proto-lunar disk plays a central role in all proposed giant impact scenarios for lunar origin. New theoretical insights coupled with new high-precision stable-isotope measurements on lunar and terrestrial samples permit new interrogation of the proto-lunar disk evolution. Given that various giant impact scenarios either require proto-lunar disk processes (e.g. turbulent mixing) to operate to be reconciled with the isotopic homogeneity of the EarthMoon system [1,4] or generate proto-lunar disks that are distinct (e.g. mostly vapor) [17,18], insight into the evolution of the proto-lunar disk has the potential to resolve the controversy regarding the nature of the Moon-forming giant impact and the operative processes in its energetic aftermath. We will present results that illustrate the extent to which existing isotopic observations can be used to place constraints on the evolution of the proto-lunar disk. References: [1] Canup R.
