There are two main sources of comet material: direct sampling by spacecraft, like the Stardust mission, and sampling of interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) collected by aircraft in the Earth's stratosphere, which are believed to be mainly of cometary origin [1,2]. In order to explore the link between the IDPs and comet Wild 2 and their possible link with meteorite groups, seven particles from Wild 2 and three particles from the Giant Cluster (GC) IDP have been analysed for their oxygen isotope ratios. Preliminary results are reported in [3]. Experimental: Five Wild 2 particles come from Track 149 while two come from Track 172. T149-A and T149-G is mono-crystalline olivine grains. T149E, T172-B and T172-C are mono-crystalline pyroxenes. T149-M is a poly-crystalline grain containing a pyroxene grain. T149-P is an Enstatite-like glass. Among the GC-IDP, LT4 and LT5 are large pyroxene grains, and LT35 contains an olivine within a polycrystalline particle. All particles are 5 to 15 μm in diameter, with Mg# varying from 84.6 to 99.5. Particles were mounted in 100 μm wide acrylic cubes. Each cube was then pressed into a 1.4 mm diameter indium metal substrate at the center of 8 mm aluminum disk along with a San Carlos olivine standard [4]. To minimize the topography effects caused by the sample holder edges, we used sample holders made of three 8 mm holes [5], particles and standards being positioned within 0.7 mm of the center of the mount. We used a Zeiss focused ion beam (FIB) field emission (FE)-SEM Auriga (UW-Madison) to mark the SIMS analysis positions by removing a 1 μm x 1 μm square of the carbon coating. The focused Ga+ beam with an accelerating voltage of -30 keV was set to 5 pA, for a dose of 0.4 nC/ μm2 [3]. Oxygen three-isotope ratios were acquired with the Cameca IMS 1280 ion microprobe at the WiscSIMS laboratory of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  Prior to each unknown sample analysis, secondary 16O- ion images were obtained by 10 μm x 10 μm primary beam rastering, in order to identify FIB marks . Due to the absence of coating, FIB marks appear as bright spots. With the recent addition of a NanoDeflector to the WiscSIMS IMS 1280, primary beam adjustment was greatly improved and the ion image was centered with a precision of 0.1 µm [4]. The analytical conditions were similar to those detailed in [6]. The primary Cs+ beam was set at an intensity of 3 pA, for a beam size of ~1.5 μm in diameter. The conditions remain the same for ion imaging as for isotope analyses. Secondary ions 16O-, 17O-, 18O- were detected simultaneously on the multicollection system; 16O- by a Faraday cup and 17O- and 18O- by electron multipliers. The mass resolving power (MRP at 10 % peak height) was set at ~ 6000. The contribution of the tailing of 16O1H- ion on 17O- was estimated by the method described in [7] though the correction (< 0.1 ‰) was negligible. Each analysis lasts 20 minutes, giving a typical internal precisions of 1.2‰, 2.5‰ and 2.6‰ (2σ) for δ18O, δ17O, Δ17O, respectively. One to six analyses were performed on each particle, bracketed by eight analyses performed on San Carlos olivine (Fo89) grains mounted in the same disks, within 500 μm of the sample particle. The external reproducibility of the running standards was 1.4‰, 2.2‰, and 2.2‰ for δ18O, δ17O, Δ17O, respectively, which were assigned as analytical uncertainties to unknown samples [8]. Instrumental biases of all silicates were corrected from the calibration using multiple standards with known oxygen isotope ratios that cover the range of compositions of the unknowns: additional olivines (Fo60, Fo100), two low-Ca pyroxene (En97, En85) and a diopside standard.  Results: Oxygen isotope ratios were obtained in two sessions. 110 analyses (98 on standards and 12 on samples) during the first session, while 95 analyses were acquired during the second session (81 on standards and 14 on samples). For particles with more than one measurement the data agree within uncertainties. We thus calculated averages for each of them, with uncertainties on the average calculated conservatively as 2SD. SEM imaging after the SIMS sessions confirmed accurate aiming, with SIMS pits located within < 0.2 μm of  FIB-marks. Results are shown in Fig. 1. Oxygen isotope ratios range from -52.5‰ to +6.6‰ in δ18O for Wild 2 particles and are distributed along the slope 1 PCM line [9]. The particles extracted from Track 149 all show 16O-poor compositions, with δ18O varying from -8.1 ± 1.2‰ (T149-E) to +6.6 ± 1.5‰  (T149-G), while Δ17O varies from -6.9 ±4.2‰ (T149E) to +0.6 ± 2.4‰ (T149-G). In contrast, the pyroxene grains from track 172 shows a clear enrichment in 16O, with a δ18O of -51.2 ± 1.5‰ and a Δ17O of -22.3 ± 1.9‰ for T172-B and a δ18O of -43.0 ± 1.3‰ and a Δ17O of -21.3 ± 2.3‰ for T172-C. This enrichment is of the same order as other 16O-rich particles found in Wild 2 particles [5, 10, 11].  The Giant Cluster IDP particles are within the same range as the 16O-poor Wild 2 particles, with δ18O varying from from -6.1 ± 0.9‰ to -2.5 ± 1.3‰ and Δ17O between -3.2 ± 1.5‰ and -0.4 ± 1.5‰  and also plot on the slope 1 PCM line.

TF and PCM represent the terrestrial fractionation line and the primitive chondrule line (~ slope 1 line), respectively. Literature data from [5, 10-14]. Discussion: Fig. 2 shows that, among Wild 2 particles, Δ17O values increase with decreasing Mg#, over a large range of Δ17O. The 16O-poor Wild 2 data trend is most similarly to chondrule data from carbonaceous chondrites. T-149-E's Δ17O of -6.9 ±4.2‰ helps to confirm that trend. In particular, with FeO-poor particles (Mg# >97) clustering around Δ17O ~ -2‰ and FeO-rich particles (Mg# <97) showing Δ17O varying between -2‰ and +2‰, the Wild 2 data are most like the range and variations among CR chondrite chondrules, which suggests a link between ferromagnesian particles in Wild 2 and CR chondrites. However, in contrast to CR chondrites, which are dominated by FeO-poor chondrules (Mg#>95), the Wild 2 particles with Mg# > 90 only represent a minor component of the total silicate grains [16]. This implies Stardust grains formed in an environment generally more oxidized than the CR chondrite chondrules. The two particles from track 172 are the first 16Orich pyroxenes found among Wild 2 particles. Their minor element composition is very similar to the compostion of AOAs, where pyroxenes have previously been found [17], and suggests a condensation origin.  The Mg# - Δ17O relationship (Fig. 2) of the GCIDP particles shows a range similar to Wild 2 particles, which may suggest a similar origin, though more analyses are required to confirm their possible link.
