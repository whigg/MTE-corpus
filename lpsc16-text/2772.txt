Gordon Telescope in Puerto Rico and the GoldstoneSolar System Radar complex (X band: 8.56 GHz, 3.5cm, 450 kW on the DSS-14 70-m antenna; C band: 7.19GHz, 4.2 cm, 80 kW on the DSS-13 34-m antenna) inCalifornia are the most active planetary radar facilitiesin the world. Radar observations are critical for identifying those objects that may present a hazard to Earth andproviding detailed physical characterizations in termsof size, shape, spin, and surface-property (reflectivity,polarization, geologic features and sometimes composition and density) information. In fact, radar investigations of many near-Earth objects are roughly equivalent,in their science content, to space flyby missions, but ata cost orders of magnitude less.Technical Capabilities: While Arecibo is moresensitive partly due to its sheer size, the Goldstone telescopes are more maneuverable and can achieve finerspatial resolution for objects that come close enough toEarth, as fine as 3.75 m (testing at 1.875 m is underway)compared to 7.5 m at Arecibo. Range-Doppler radarmeasurements provide line-of-sight positional astrometry, orthogonal and complementary to optical planeof-sky astrometry, with precision as fine as ∼10 m inrange and ∼1 mm/s in velocity with a fractional precision 100 to 1000 times finer than that of typical optical measurements. Radar astrometry routinely extendsour ability to accurately predict the trajectories of asteroids for decades or centuries into the future, oftenpreventing newly discovered objects from being lost.Two-dimensional range-Doppler images that resolve thetarget spatially along the line of sight and in frequency(velocity) space reveal its basic shape and surface features that, given sufficient orientational coverage, maybe inverted to provide a full three-dimensional shapemodel and complete spin-state description. Collaborations with the 100-m Green Bank Telescope and elements of the Very Long Baseline Array maximize thescientific return on observing campaigns by providingadditional sensitivity and resolution for imaging andconstraining spin states, respectively.Current Research: In 2015, Arecibo and Goldstone combined to detect 108 near-Earth asteroids (95at Arecibo, 39 at Goldstone, and 26 with both facilities), one-third of which are designated as potentiallyhazardous to Earth. Additionally, about one in four asteroids detected are of interest to NASA as dynamicallyaccessible for future missions, the so-called NHATScompliant objects. Put in perspective, the 108 asteroidsdetected in 2015 were 15% of all asteroids detected withradar since 1968; 50% of all radar detections have occurred since 2012.We will present a sampling of the asteroid zoo collected by radar over the past calendar year. The immense variety in the near-Earth asteroid population isclear, from the ∼2-meter 2015 TC25 that rotates in∼2 minutes to the elongated, multi-kilometer (163899)2003 SD220 that rotates once every ∼12 days. Shapesvary from spheroids, such as the pareidolia-inspired"skull" 2015 TB145, to the unexpectedly irregular, epitomized by (436724) 2011 UW158, reminiscent of an unshelled walnut. Binaries, such as (357439) 2004 BL86,occur in about one in six near-Earth asteroids over 200meters in diameter, while peanut-shaped bodies, such as(85989) 1999 JD6, occur just as often.Acknowledgments: The Arecibo Observatory isoperated by SRI International under a cooperativeagreement with the National Science Foundation(AST-1100968) and in alliance with Ana G.
