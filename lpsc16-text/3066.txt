NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA 94035.    Introduction:  Since 2006, the Mars Society has sponsored the Unvirersity Rover Challenge at MDRS in Utah. Each year undergraduate university teams  design and build the next generation of Mars Rovers to compete in both science and engineering tasks by remotely operating a rover across the desert terrain. In the nine years the competition has grown from 3 teams in the United States to more than 60 applicants from over 10 countries.    In this presentation we provide an overview of the evolution of the competition, the application process, most common mistakes teams make as well as the demographics of the teams.
