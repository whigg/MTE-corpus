IRON MICRO-XANES ANALYSIS OF COLORED OLIVINE IN MARTIAN METEORITES.  A. Takenouchi, T. Mikouchi, 1Department of Earth and Planetary Science, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan, E-mail: a.takenouchi@eps.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp.  Introduction:  It is known that there are various colored olivine in Martian meteorites. In particular, darkened olivine, so-called “brown olivine”, is characteristic in many Martian meteorites. According to previous studies [1, 2], brown olivine is considered to be formed by a shock event and their coloration is induced by iron nano-particles formed in olivine. Their TEM observations show that there are no Si-rich phases around iron nano-particles which may need to be formed during precipitation of metallic iron by olivine reduction. In their and our previous studies [3, 4], brown olivine shows several characteristic features such as brighter contrast in BSE images, lower crystallinity and the presence of extra peaks in Raman analysis. And often they are accompanied with melt glass indicating that they underwent high temperature. Sometimes brown olivine shows lamellar textures and these lamellae may be evidence of transformation of olivine to some polymorphs. Even in Martian meteorites without brown olivine, partly darkened (brownish) olivine is present around shock melt and they show the same features to those of brown olivine. These olivines may have experienced similar formation processes and there is a possibility that these olivine grains showing such features were formed by olivine reduction and transformation of olivine to their high-pressure and high-temperature phases. On the other hand, there is yellowish olivine in some Martian meteorites. However, such olivine does not show the features of brown olivine and their coloration may be derived from weathering on the Earth (this is still unclear).  Treiman et al. [1] analyzed Fe3+ ratios in brown olivine of NWA 2737 chassignite by synchrotron radiation micro-XANES spectroscopy (SR-XANES) and they concluded that they contain 14±12 % of Fe3+ although they considered this result is imprecise and contradictory. The presence of Fe3+ is important to reveal the formation processes (in particular reduction processes) of brown olivine because Fe3+ may be formed during the formation of iron nano-particles by olivine self- oxidation and reduction (3Fe2+ -> Fe0 + 2Fe3+). Therefore, in this study, we analyzed Fe valence of various colored olivine (brown ~ yellowish olivine) in ten Martian meteorites by SR-XANES and considered the formation processes of each colored olivine. Samples and Methods:  In this study, nine shergottites and one chassignite have been analyzed so far. Five shergottites (NWA 1950, LAR 06319, Y984028, LEW 88516 and ALH 77005) and one chassignite (NWA 2737) clearly contain brown olivine while other three shergottites (NWA 1068, LAR 12095 and RBT 04261) have yellowish olivine and locally darkened (brownish) olivine around shock melt. In the other shergottite (SaU 005) all olivine grains are yellowish. SR-XANES analyses were performed at BL-4A, Photon Factory, KEK, Tsukuba, Japan and SR beam size was about 5 x 6 µm. Fe standards for SR-XANES analyses are kaersutites with known Fe3+/ΣFe from Kaersut (now Qaersut), Umanq District, Greenland and Iki Island, Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan as determined by wet chemical analysis. Pre-edge data obtained by SR-XANES are deconvoluted into two peaks and centroid peak positions of the pre-edges are calculated in the same way as reported in [5] and we obtained the semi-quantitative data of Fe3+/ΣFe in various colored olivine.  Results and Discussion:  Brown olivine in five shergottites and one chassignite is heterogeneously darkened, and so we analyzed both brown and colorless areas in the same grain in each sample except LEW 88516 (the data were obtained from different grains in LEW 88516) (Fig. 1a). Regarding locally darkened (brownish) areas around shock melt in three shergottites, colorless and brown areas were analyzed in the same grains (Fig. 1b) although yellowish areas were analyzed in different grains. In SaU 005, yellowish areas from two grains were analyzed (one grain is shown in Fig. 1c). Obtained pre-edge peaks and deconvoluted peaks are shown in Fig. 2 and processed results are summarized in Table 1. Our results show high Fe3+ ratios or contradictory values maybe due to unrepresentative standard data or data processing, which is similar to [1]. However, we consider that it is at least possible to compare these    Fig. 1. Photomicrographs of brown, brownish and yellowish olivine (example).

ratios between colored and colorless areas in the same grain and our discussion is based on them.  In most brown areas in Martian meteorites with brown olivine except ALH 77005 and LEW 88516, there are clearly higher Fe3+ ratios compared to colorless areas. Because the reason why ALH 77005 and LEW 88516 show different results is unclear, it is needed to reanalyze the same grain in LEW 88516. Locally darkened (brownish) areas around shock melt in Martian meteorites without brown olivine also contain higher Fe3+ ratios than those in colorless areas. Therefore, both brown olivine and brownish olivine around shock melt contain higher Fe3+ ratios compared to colorless areas. Moreover, they show the same mineralogical features and this indicates that they may have similar formation processes as reported in [3, 4]. On the other hand, yellowish olivine in NWA 1068 and SaU 005 shows much higher Fe3+ ratios than brown olivine and one possibility is that there occurs oxide minerals formed by terrestrial weathering and such oxide induces high Fe3+ values and yellowish coloration. Higher Fe3+ ratios in brown olivine than those in colorless olivine suggest that iron nano-particles are formed by olivine self- oxidation and reduction reaction. This is consistent with the absence of silica-rich phases around iron nano-particles. Because highpressure and high-temperature polymorphs of olivine (e.g., ringwoodite, wadsleyite) could contain much higher Fe3+ than olivine [2] and locally brownish areas are located around shock melt, brown and brownish olivine are formed with transformation of olivine to their high-pressure and high-temperature polymorphs.  Conclusion:  This study shows that brown olivine and brownish olivine around shock melt in Martian meteorites clearly contain higher Fe3+ ratios compared to colorless olivine although further investigation is needed to obtain more accurate quantitative ratios of Fe3+/ΣFe. This result supports that iron nano-particles in brown olivine are formed by olivine self- oxidation and reduction during the transformation of olivine to their high-pressure and high-temperature phases. On the other hand, yellowish olivine shows extremely higher Fe3+ contents and this may be induced by weathering on the Earth.  References: [1] Treiman, A. H. et al., (2007) JGR, 112, E04002.
