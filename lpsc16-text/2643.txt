Introduction:  The compositional and physical properties of dark carbonaceous asteroid surfaces remain, for the most part, poorly constrained. Their reflective properties depend on both the surface composition and physical properties [1]. Unlike planetary surfaces, which are greatly shaped by strong gravitational forces, asteroids seldom present smooth, flat surfaces [2]. Spacecraft observations of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) (Itokawa and Eros) have shown that the surfaces of small bodies are highly variable, ranging from fine dust to boulders. For this study we examined the ability to distinguish the spectral characteristics of carbonaceous asteroids as a function of grain size variation, mineralogical variations across meteorite slabs, and the effects of dust coating on meteorite slabs. This spectral data could assist the identification of surface compositions and physical properties of asteroids for future exploration missions, such as the NASA OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample return mission to B-type NEA (101955) Bennu and the JAXA Hayabusa-2 mission to the C-type NEA 162173 Ryugu. Methodology: Reflectance spectra of the CV3 meteorite Allende were measured at HOSERlab (psf.uwinnipeg.ca) using an Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD) FieldSpecPro HR spectrometer from 350 nm to 2500 nm. Sample illumination was provided by a 150 watt quartz tungsten halogen light source. Samples were measured at an incident angle of 30° and an emission angle of 0°. Reflectance spectra were measured relative to a near perfect reflector (Spectralon®). 200 spectra were measured and averaged for each sample.  ________________________________________ Table 1. Samples included in this study. Meteorite  Sample size   Allende  <2000 µm, 500-2000 µm,                               <150 µm, 75-250 µm              Slab <5 µm saw-cut dust               Results: Figure 1 shows the reflectance spectra of varying grain sizes of Allende powder (<2000 µm, 500-2000 µm, <150 µm and 75-150 µm). All spectra are relatively dark (<15%). Reflectance of each sample at 560 nm was 0.090 for <2000 µm, 0.085 for 5002000 µm, 0.098 for <150 µm and 0.074 for 75-250 µm, indicating a weak dependence on grain size. Using the 700/2500 nm reflectance ratio as a measure of overall slope, the <150 µm and <2000 µm powder samples reflectance ratios indicate a red slope, while the 75-250 and 500-2000 µm are blue sloped. The spectra show very little variation in the absorption band depths and positions. This suggests that the presence of the finest fraction is required to produce red-sloped spectra.   Figure 1: Reflectance spectra of four different grain size powders of Allende.    Figure 2 shows the spectral variability of different spots on a single slab of Allende. The reflectance spectra obtained for the slab are all relatively dark (<15% reflectance). The spectra show some variability in absolute reflectance, this is evident by comparing reflectance of each spot at 560 nm wavelength (0.073, 0.103, 0.124, 0.122). The variability in reflectance may be attributed to surface roughness or compositional variations across the slab. Reflectance ratios (700/2500 nm) for the spots all indicate a blue slope. Any variation in absorption band depths and positions is minimal and could be attributed to the variation in mineral phases, such as the presence of large chondrules or large bright inclusions.

Figure 3 exhibits the spectral variability as a result of applying low density (by airfall) <5 µm dust coatings on slabs using saw-cut fines of Allende. The absolute reflectance at 560 nm indicates increasing reflectivity as a result of the accumulation of fine-grained dust. By assessing the 700/2500 nm reflectance ratio, it is evident that the presence of a dust coating produces more red-sloped spectra as compared to the bare slab. Weak absorption bands are present in all the spectra near 1050 and 2000 nm, due to ferrous iron crystal field transitions in olivine and CAIs, respectively.   Figure 3: Reflectance spectra of Allende slab (red), slab with dust coating (<5 µm dust) (blue and green) and the pure saw cut dust (<5 µm grain size) (black).  Discussion: Numerous previous studies have shown that the spectral characteristics of particulate materials are affected by grain size. Generally there is an increasing reflectivity with decreasing particle size [3]. Fewer studies have assessed the spectrum-altering effects of fine-grained dust coatings of material derived from the underlying substrate. Using the absolute reflectance at 560 nm, we can conclude that the presence of fine-grained dust (<5 µm) on the slab increases reflectivity and also produces a more red-sloped spectrum relative to the slab (i.e., approaching the spectral properties of the fine-grained dust). On the other hand, the varying grain size samples (<2000, <150, 75-250 and 500-2000) showed a variation in reflectivity that was not a linear function of grain size [4]. The cause of this non-linearity is still being investigated. Dark asteroids normally exhibit wide range in spectral slopes and very few noticeable absorption bands [5].  The variations in spectral slope of low albedo asteroids may be attributed to grain size variation of the dark organic materials [3]. It has been reported that blue sloping spectra can be the result of removing fine particles from sample, or increasing the sample grain size [6]. Interestingly, the reflectance ratio (700/2500 nm) associated with the <5 µm dust coatings provided indication of blue sloping due only to fine-grained dust coatings. Previous studies have provided similar results [6]. By assessing the absorptive properties of each sample at the 1000 nm iron absorption band (band minimum position), we found variations as a result of grain size. The variability of absorption bands found within the single slab of Allende is most likely due to different relative abundances of the different components that comprise CV carbonaceous chondrites.   Conclusion: The reflectance spectra of the Allende samples show variations due to grain size and likely mineralogy. The absolute reflectance and spectral slope show variability as a result of grain size. Reddening of spectral slopes seems to require the presence of the finest-grain component (down to ~0 µm) of a powder. The presence of a thin coating of fine-grained dust results in spectral properties more akin to a powder than a solid surface, at least as measured by spectral slopes. Fine-grained powder also causes an expected increase in reflectance, approaching that of a powder. The implications of this study are that images of asteroids, such as Itokawa, that show boulder fields, does not necessarily imply that slab spectra are the most appropriate data to use for interpreting spectroscopic data for “rocky” regions, as the spectral properties of rocky terrains could be dominated by dust. Thin dust coatings would not necessarily be evident in imagery of rocky regions; rocks could retain their morphologies and sharp outlines. The effects of grain size and dust coatings on the spectral variability of slabs is  being further examined on additional classes of carbonaceous meteorites and Martian meteorite samples.
