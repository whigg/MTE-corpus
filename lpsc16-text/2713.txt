Introduction: The widely accepted model for the origin of the Earth-Moon system as the result of a Mars-sized giant impactor colliding with proto-Earth is inconsistent with a variety of new isotopic data. Generally, it is thought that the Earth and the Mars-sized Moon-forming impactor were isotopically different (for mass independent isotopic variations). Therefore, according to the "canonical" Moon forming SPH simulations, the Earth and the Moon should end up isotopically different from each other and that is inconsistent with observations. In contrast, isotopic studies have demonstrated that the Earth and Moon are remarkably similar in their isotopic compositions for many elements (notably mass independent isotopic compositions of O, Ti, Cr and W, and mass dependent isotope compositions of Mg and Si). This similarity between the Earth and Moon is unique in our Solar System when compared to other planetary bodies. In particular, the isotopic similarity in W isotopes and Hf/W ratios are unexpected, as this is a system that evolves with time after the formation of the solar system. It provides a fundamental constraint on the theory of the origin of the Moon; any successful model must properly explain such similarity between the Earth and Moon. We have developed a new model (see companion abstracts: [14]) that we believe is capable of meeting the isotopic, chemical and physical modeling constraints. In this model the Moon condenses out of bulk silicate Earth (BSE) vapor. The requirement is that the silicate Earth and impactor materials are shocked to a sufficiently high energy state such that upon adiabatic release to lower pressures this material forms a single phase fluid that bypasses the critical point and the Moon forms surrounded by 10's of bars of BSE gas. During Moon formation, the most volatile components stay in the vapor resulting in the well-known volatile element depletion of the Moon. Many siderophile elements are more depleted in the Moon's mantle compared to the Earth (Ni, Mo, Re) that has been taken as evidence for the formation of a small (few percent) lunar metal core after/during the formation of the Moon. We first discuss the constraints on the composition of the Moon and then we explore the case of the 182Hf-182W evolution as many previous studies have reported measurements that suggest that the 182W/183W isotopic compositions of the Earth and Moon are essentially the same; in addition their Hf/W ratios are similar. This is surprising in light of abundant evidence for a small lunar core. We show here that the inferred elemental composition of the Moon is consistent with the new model and that a small lunar core may only lead to insignificant effects in the Hf-W isotopic system while having major effects on elements like Mo. The Bulk Silicate Composition of the Moon: The bulk silicate Earth (BSE) composition is compared with different estimates of the bulk silicate Moon (BSM) in Figure 1 for the major, minor and selected trace elements. For the Earth we chose the widely used BSE composition of [5]. The gray band in Figure 1 shows a range of estimates of the bulk Moon composition (BSM) normalized to the bulk silicate Earth. Our range of estimates of the bulk Moon composition is based on data and discussions provided by [6-17].    Figure 1: The grey band indicates the range of estimates for bulk lunar composition. Colored lines show predicted composition of the Moon from our model for a variety of conditions [3] and are consistent with our inferred BSM composition.   All BSM estimates are depleted in volatile elements (Na, K, Mn) relative to BSE, but there are substantial differences in Fe enrichment. The estimate of [10] reflects an early view that the Moon, in addition to volatile element depletion, is enriched in refractory elements and Fe (mg# = 84). Other early estimates, such as [7,9,12] predict similar enrichment in Fe, but not in refractory elements. Because olivines with mg# of 87.5 have been found in two old lunar rocks (troctolite 76535 and dunite 72415), it is difficult to understand how the bulk silicate Moon could have an Mg# 10-4 10-3 10-2 10-1 100 Ni KCo CuW Cr Mn Na ZnCaHf TiAl MgMo Si GeFe Model BSE Moon's range 50 bar 3910K 25 bar 3700K 20 bar 3630K 15 bar 3545K 10 bar 3415K 5 bar 3190K 1 bar 2485K  as low as 8 compositio Re-evaluat straints fro gests a lun thickness o longer sup richment in normalized Al, Ti and have close Moon [16] elements H vary in a v ties in vari main plane uncertainti sent directl Mg throug ratio of the about 75.
