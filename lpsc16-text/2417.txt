 DISTURBED ZONES IN WEST CANDOR CHASMA, MARS.  B. K. Lucchitta, U. S. Geological Survey, 2255 N. Gemini Dr., Flagstaff, AZ 86001. blucchitta@usgs.gov.         Introduction: West Candor Chasma contains a shallow, asymmetrical dome called Ceti Mensa, which stands 2 to 5 km above the surrounding lowlands.  Both the dome and the surrounding floor are underlain by Interior Layered Deposits (ILD).  The geology of the area is summarized in Figure 1, which is a condensed version of the map given in Lucchitta [1]. The major geologic units are, from the bottom up, (1) a core group (brown), consisting mostly of massive light material exposed in the large erosional reentrants cut into the  mensa at its SE and NW sides, (2) a rim-rock layered group (blue), displaying conspicuous cliffs on the upper rim of the reentrants and extending over much of Ceti Mensa and the adjacent lowlands, and (3) a cap-rock group (green), characterized variously by rocks displaying ledges, scallops, or flutes (yardangs) of erosional origin, and resting unconformably on all other units. The subject of this paper is disturbed zones occurring in the ILD of Ceti Mensa as well as in the surrounding floor materials.  For this analysis they are assigned to five regions shown in Figure 1.   Description and discussion: The disturbed zones are classified into landslides (ls, purple), fractured terrain (fr, blue-purple), lobate terrain (lb, bright yellow), breccia (br, red), contorted layers (cl, orange), and elongate knobs (ek, red-brown).  The landslides, fractured terrain, and lobate terrain tend to occur on the eastern flanks of Ceti Mensa, whereas the breccias, contorted layers, and elongate knobs are more prevalent on the western trough floor.   Region 1: Located on the NE flank of Ceti Mensa, it includes a landslide, fractured terrain, and breccias.  The landslide (ls) has been previously discussed by Metz [2] and Lucchitta [3]. It is composed of large blocks derived from the resistant uppermost layer of the rim-rock group.  The blocks form a coherent mass that slid downhill on a slope of about 5Â°. The slide likely is a gravity-driven decollement.  The blocks transition into fractured terrain (fr) and breccia (br) on the adjacent floor, suggesting that the floor fill is derived from the mensa.  The fractured terrain overlies the wall-rock slide, indicating that it is younger.       Region 2: Occupying an east-trending high ridge on the south side of Ceti Mensa, it includes landslides, lobate terrain, and breccia.  An apparently catastrophic slide (ls) fell off a steep slope; it is composed of an apron of chaotic material. Another slide on the north side of the ridge is marked by fractured terrain (fr) near its head and curved lobes (lb) at its toe.  This slide apparently formed by creep. The south-facing slope is composed of rim-rock layers with numerous small slumps [4] and a large breccia (br) zone at the base.  The breccia may reflect a basal detachment in the rimrock layers.  It also contains the damage zones and injectite pipes of Okubo [5], supporting structural disturbance.              Region 3: Located in the southwestern chasma, it contains breccia zones, contorted layers, and elongated knobs. The fault line along the southern wall is breached by a smooth-walled reentrant, but breccias (br), contorted layers (cl) [6], and a shallow trough mark the extended fault line in the reentrant. The ILD appear to be influenced by this buried fault.  The breccias and contorted layers may have formed when late movement on the trough fault disrupted the ILD.  Or wind erosion along the wall caused the depression and sliding of the ILD into the low.  The elongate knobs parallel to the western trough also occupy a shallow depression.  The elongation suggests compression, favoring an origin by sliding into the low.  Breccia patches in ILD located on top of the lower trough walls probably formed by settling on steep slopes.      Region 4: In the northwestern chasma, breccia zones (br), contorted layers (cl), and elongate knobs (ek) line the base of the trough walls and are likely the result of settling of the ILD on the steep trough walls.  However, a NE trending line of breccia and contorted layers parallels the contact between finely layered rim-rock below and fluted (yardang) cap rock above. The discontinuity between the more malleable lower unit and more rigid upper unit may have caused a decollement.  The slope here is to the south, suggesting movement away from a nearby wall rock spur.          Region 5: The western part of the wall-rock slide Candor Labes dominates the region.  Patches of breccia (br) and contorted layers (cl) are scattered in the area. A few patches on the southwestern end of the outcrops are along the contact between rim-rock and cap-rock and may mark a decollement.  All other patches are in the cap-rock fluted unit, where it buries the toe of the wall-rock slide. The breccias here are clearly formed by adjustments of the cap rock to the extremely rugged landslide topography.  Perhaps, some late movement within the slides enhanced the breakup of the unit.        Conclusion:  The disturbed zones in west Candor Chasma seem to be due to settling, sliding, detachments, and decollements.  Many were caused by the steep slopes on wall rock and Ceti Mensa.  However, a detachment between rim-rock and cap-rock is on shallow slopes.  Overall, the ILD in west Candor Chasma have zones that appear to be structurally unstable and susceptible to pervasive deformation.      References: [1] Lucchitta, B. K.
