Introduction:  The Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer (MOMA) investigation on the 2018 ExoMars rover will examine the molecular composition of samples acquired from depths of up to two meters below the martian surface, where organics may have been protected from radiative and oxidative degradation [1,2]. The clay-rich rock exposures accessible in Oxia Planum, the currently preferred landing zone, will provide an excellent opportunity to sample ancient material for organics analysis. MOMA incorporates both pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (pyrGCMS) and laser desorption mass spectrometry (LDMS) modes of operation, and is designed to work in concert with the other investigations in the rover's Pasteur Payload, particularly the Raman [3] and MicrOmega [4] instruments that analyze common drill samples presented on a carousel. With its two modes, MOMA detects compounds over a wide range of molecular weight, volatility, and mineralological association. As such, MOMA has the potential to contribute substantially to understanding the distribution and structure of organics preserved in a variety of mineralogical environments, in support of the ExoMars goal to seek the signs of past or present life on Mars. Implementation of GCMS and LDMS Modes: GCMS mode is operated analogously to the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) investigation on Curiosity. Samples are sealed into ovens and heated to 1000 C. Evolved gases, entrained in He, flow through the GC system to the MS. The GC includes two cooled hydrocarbon traps (Tenax and Carbosieve) that are opened after major water evolution (above 100 C) but prior to organic thermodesorption (from ~300 C up to > 500 C).  Trapped organics are then injected onto one of four columns and eluted over a temperature ramp to the MS electron ionization (EI) source via a split manifold. An automatic gain control (AGC) algorithm is implemented in the control software to ensure the ion trap is optimally filled for each scan. Derivatization agent present in some ovens enables detection of the higher ΔHV species over the full GCMS m/z range of 50-500 Da. Derivatization-GCMS mode analyzes compounds of high-to-moderate volatility (enthalpies of vaporization ΔHV ≤ 50 kJ mol-1) such as alkanes, amines, and lighter carboxylic and amino acids and aromatic species.  In LDMS mode, molecules are desorbed and ionized directly from powder samples with a pulsed UV laser (266 nm, 1 ns duration) at Mars ambient pressures. Molecular cations, and their fragments, are injected into the MS through an inlet system employing a fast aperture valve that closes after ions are trapped, permitting the ion trap pressure to reduce to <10-3 Torr where the detectors can be operated. LDMS mode is designed to analyze compounds of moderate-to-low volatility (enthalpies of vaporization ΔHV ≥ 40 kJ mol1) such as heavier carboxylic acids, aromatic species, chain-like compounds, and macromolecular organics. The nature of LDI permits some fraction of any large "parent" molecules to desorb intact. As previously demonstrated, the LDMS mode is immune to the potentially oxidizing effects of heat-evolved perchlorates, simplifying analysis of nonvolatile organics [5]. Flight Mass Spectrometer: The general design of the MOMA ion trap has been described previously [6,7]. The flight model (FM) of the MS subsystem (Fig. 1) has been fully assembled and is undergoing a series of critical tests, to conclude with a full Mars thermal vacuum campaign prior to rover integration.   Fig. 1 The flight linear ion trap (right) was integrated into the housing (left) in low-contamination, aseptic conditions. Electrodes meet tight mechanical tolerances (e.g., ≤ 10 µm rod alignment error) while remaining tolerant of propagated vibration and shock loads. Trap rods are less than 3 cm long.  The linear ion trap electrode assembly (Fig. 1, right) maintained the necessary micron-scale mechanical precision to assure ion cloud symmetry and resultant mass resolution and accuracy. After attachment of the dual-filament EI source on top of the rod assembly, the ion trap was installed in the housing (Fig. 1, left), and numerous electrical connections were made to the various headers, which required special design to tolerate voltage delivery from Mars ambient pressures into the vacuum environment. All MS integration and tests have additionally taken place in cleanroom and processing conditions that minimize airborne particulates, nonvolatile molecular residue, and bioburden (spore count) in order to meet all ExoMars contamination and planetary protection requirements. The integrated flight MS (Fig. 2) has undergone preliminary tests to confirm it meets all performance specifications and to establish baseline responses for trending and comparison with the engineering test unit (ETU), which is used to examine a full library of samples without the severe cleanliness restrictions of the FM. The system is currently using an ETU laser while the flight laser undergoes assembly in Germany. pUCZ%with% sample% carousel% Wide%Range% Pump%(WRP)% ITMS% Secondary% Electronics% Box%(SEB)% RF% Detector% Board% Laser% Fig. 2 MOMA Mass Spectrometer flight model (FM) integrated with the pulsed laser, RF power supply, wide-rangepump (WRP), and a pseudo-ultra clean zone (UCZ) to mimic its interfaces in the rover.  Cleanroom bench tests have demonstrated that the flight MS is performing to specification, with lower background counts and higher sensitivity than have been seen on breadboard and engineering units. EI spectra (e.g. Fig. 3, top) meet requirements for resolution, accuracy, limit of detection (< 1 pmol of PFTBA in He), and other specifications. MOMA includes a small cell of PFTBA to be used as an EI calibrant in situ. For LDMS mode, solid cluster-forming CsI samples have been used to verify that the FM laser mass range (up to 1000 Da), resolution, and accuracy all meet specifications with ample margin (e.g., Fig. 3, bottom). One CsI calibration target will be delivered with MOMA and will occupy one of the more than 30 available oven positions on the carousel. Additional tests of the FM with other selected gases and samples are underway to complete the verification of all operational parameters, including the limit of detection for solid analysis and the use of MS/MS and SWIFT protocols [6, 7].
