Introduction: V-type  Near-Earth  Asteroids  (VNEAs) are  basaltic  asteroids with  a  perihelion  less than  1.3 AU. Their  most  likely origin  is  the  Vesta family in the main asteroid belt, even though V-type asteroids can be found in  other  families (Eunomia, Magnya,  Merxia,  Agnia,  Eos and  Dembowska)  [1, 2], albeit in significantly smaller numbers. Their size ranges from ~60 m to ~3.4  km. Most  of them  are computed using a standard albedo for basaltic asteroids and their absolute magnitude [3]. In Fig. 1, we show the asteroid size distribution in the (a,i) plane (semi-major axis  and inclination plane).  This study is concerned  with  the statistics  of close encounters and  impacts  between  V-NEAs  and  the  terrestrial planets,  within  10 Myr.  For  impacts,  we primarily aim to establish the energy release and size of impact craters  on  planetary  surfaces,  especially  for  the Earth.  We performed numerical computations of orbits and simulated crater formation on planetary surfaces. Figure 1: Location  and  size distribution  of the  VNEAs in the  (a,i) plane. Circles are proportional  to the V-NEA size: the smallest asteroid is 62 m in diameter and the largest one is 3.4 km. The blue, violet and  green  lines  represent the  mean  motion  resonances  with  Earth,  Mars  and  Jupiter,  respectively. The green dot is Earth and the red dot is Mars. Numerical  simulations  of  the  V-NEAs  orbits and analysis: Fifty clones from each member of our sample of 28 known V-NEAs (1400 orbits) are generated and then integrated for 10 Myr using the Lie integrator [4]. Only gravitational perturbations from all  the  planets  were  taken  into  account.  For  each clone,  we derive the  impact  velocity,  impact  angle and the crater size [5, 6]. Where necessary, we take into consideration the atmospheric effect as modeled by [7].  A close encounter  occurs  when an  asteroid has  a  planetocentric  distance  less  than  0.005  AU (two lunar  distances).  We consider  a  collision  between an asteroid and a planet as the scenario when the asteroid has  a  planetocentric  distance less than the radius of the respective planet. An impact should occur if an asteroid crosses the radius distance of the planet  and when the diameter  of the body is larger than the critical diameter computed via eq. (7) of [7], therefore considering the atmospheric pressure (e.g. very relevant on Venus). Then we perform a statistical analysis of close encounters and impacts, and infer conditions by grouping the orbital elements of the V-types when they collide. Additionally, we compute the impact velocities and impact angles for the purpose of hydrocode modeling  of impact  craters.  Finally, we derive statistical distributions of the impact velocities and crater sizes, which are compared with the real crater sizes on the terrestrial planets, giving a  special  consideration  to  a  cutoff size  for  the  VNEAs produced craters. Laboratory  impacts  and hydrocode modeling of lab impacts: For numerical simulations of impact crater processes we employ iSALE2D, a multi-material, multi-rheology shock physics hydrocode [8, 9]. We use the ANEOS equation of state (EoS) for basalt to approximate the V-type asteroid material,  as well as the crustal  material  of Venus. For Earth,  we use granite to represent the crust. All simulations include the material strength [8] and damage [10] models, as well as the effects of acoustic fluidization [11]. Since vapour  production  is not  relevant  in  this  study,  all material with a density of >300 kg/m3 was removed. Impact velocities, derived from evolution and orbital dynamics of V-type particles, are scaled to the vertical component only, due to the cylindrical symmetry of iSALE-2D. The high  resolution zone cell size is varied according to the size of the impactor, keeping the number of cells per projectile radius constant at 20,  as  this  value  offers  a  reasonable  trade-off between computational time and resolution errors [12].  A sample simulation of a collision with a V-type asteroid is shown in Fig. 2. Figure 2: A sample simulation of a collision of 1996 AJ1 with Venus. The asteroid size is 200 m, with an impact velocity of 11.2 m/s and an impact angle of 78°. The top and bottom panels represent the crater cross-section 4 s and 80 s after the impact,  respectively. (Preliminary)  Conclusions: Our  early  results suggest  that  some V-type  asteroids  have  close encounters  soon after the beginning of the integration. The asteroids which experience a greater than average  number  of close encounters  typically exhibit  a peculiar  initial  orbital  evolution,  and  as a  result,  a higher  probability  to  impact  terrestrial  planets.  In fact,  the  eccentricity  of  these  V-NEAs  usually  increases  rapidly because  their  initial  conditions  put them  in  resonance  with  a  particular  planet;  i.e. (1981)  Midas  in  resonance  with  Jupiter  (J5:1), (7889) 1994 LX and (137052) Tielvar in resonance with Mars  (M4:3).  The initial  results show that  VNEAs have close encounters with all  the terrestrial planets; however, most frequent collisions occur with Venus and the Earth. Indeed, our preliminary results of 120 integrated orbits (part of the total sample) reveal that ~1/10 of V-NEAs are on impact trajectories. Since some collisions occur at velocities higher than the mean impact speed of asteroids (20 km/s) [13], these impacts have the potential to produce craters as large as 32 km in diameter  on Earth,  with possibly catastrophic outcomes. The V-type asteroids produce larger craters than those predicted for the Hungarias [2],  which  are  mainly  E-type  asteroids  (enstatite) [14, 15].  A collision between a V-type asteroid and the Earth is depicted in Fig. 3. Figure 3:  A geocentric view of impact collision of asteroid 2001PJ29 with the Earth. References: [1] Carruba V. et al.
