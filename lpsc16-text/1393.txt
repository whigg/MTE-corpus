Their  most  likely origin  is  the  Vestafamily in the main asteroid belt, even though V-typeasteroids can be found in  other  families (Eunomia,Magnya,  Merxia,  Agnia,  Eos and  Dembowska)  [1,2], albeit in significantly smaller numbers. Their sizeranges from ~60 m to ~3.4  km. Most  of them  arecomputed using a standard albedo for basaltic asteroids and their absolute magnitude [3]. In Fig. 1, weshow the asteroid size distribution in the (a,i) plane(semi-major axis  and inclination plane).  This studyis concerned  with  the statistics  of close encountersand  impacts  between  V-NEAs  and  the  terrestrialplanets,  within  10 Myr.  For  impacts,  we primarilyaim to establish the energy release and size of impactcraters  on  planetary  surfaces,  especially  for  theEarth.  We performed numerical computations of orbits and simulated crater formation on planetary surfaces.Figure 1: Location  and  size distribution  of the  VNEAs in the  (a,i) plane. Circles are proportional  tothe V-NEA size: the smallest asteroid is 62 m in diameter and the largest one is 3.4 km. The blue, violetand  green  lines  represent the  mean  motion  resonances  with  Earth,  Mars  and  Jupiter,  respectively.The green dot is Earth and the red dot is Mars. Numerical  simulations  of  the  V-NEAs  orbitsand analysis: Fifty clones from each member of oursample of 28 known V-NEAs (1400 orbits) are generated and then integrated for 10 Myr using the Lieintegrator [4]. Only gravitational perturbations fromall  the  planets  were  taken  into  account.  For  eachclone,  we derive the  impact  velocity,  impact  angleand the crater size [5, 6]. Where necessary, we takeinto consideration the atmospheric effect as modeledby [7].  A close encounter  occurs  when an  asteroidhas  a  planetocentric  distance  less  than  0.005  AU(two lunar  distances).  We consider  a  collision  between an asteroid and a planet as the scenario whenthe asteroid has  a  planetocentric  distance less thanthe radius of the respective planet. An impact shouldoccur if an asteroid crosses the radius distance of theplanet  and when the diameter  of the body is largerthan the critical diameter computed via eq. (7) of [7],therefore considering the atmospheric pressure (e.g.very relevant on Venus). Then we perform a statistical analysis of close encounters and impacts, and infer conditions by grouping the orbital elements of theV-types when they collide. Additionally, we computethe impact velocities and impact angles for the purpose of hydrocode modeling  of impact  craters.  Finally, we derive statistical distributions of the impactvelocities and crater sizes, which are compared withthe real crater sizes on the terrestrial planets, givinga  special  consideration  to  a  cutoff size  for  the  VNEAs produced craters. Laboratory  impacts  and hydrocode modelingof lab impacts: For numerical simulations of impactcrater processes we employ iSALE2D, a multi-material, multi-rheology shock physics hydrocode [8, 9].We use the ANEOS equation of state (EoS) for basaltto approximate the V-type asteroid material,  as wellas the crustal  material  of Venus. For Earth,  we usegranite to represent the crust. All simulations includethe material strength [8] and damage [10] models, aswell as the effects of acoustic fluidization [11]. Sincevapour  production  is not  relevant  in  this  study,  allmaterial with a density of >300 kg/m3 was removed.Impact velocities, derived from evolution and orbitaldynamics of V-type particles, are scaled to the vertical component only, due to the cylindrical symmetryof iSALE-2D. The high  resolution zone cell size isvaried according to the size of the impactor, keepingthe number of cells per projectile radius constant at20,  as  this  value  offers  a  reasonable  trade-off between computational time and resolution errors [12].1393.pdf

A sample simulation of a collision with a V-type asteroid is shown in Fig. 2.Figure 2: A sample simulation of a collision of 1996AJ1 with Venus. The asteroid size is 200 m, with animpact velocity of 11.2 m/s and an impact angle of78°. The top and bottom panels represent the cratercross-section 4 s and 80 s after the impact,  respectively. (Preliminary)  Conclusions: Our  early  resultssuggest  that  some V-type  asteroids  have  close encounters  soon after the beginning of the integration.The asteroids which experience a greater than average  number  of close encounters  typically exhibit  apeculiar  initial  orbital  evolution,  and  as a  result,  ahigher  probability  to  impact  terrestrial  planets.  Infact,  the  eccentricity  of  these  V-NEAs  usually  increases  rapidly because  their  initial  conditions  putthem  in  resonance  with  a  particular  planet;  i.e.(1981)  Midas  in  resonance  with  Jupiter  (J5:1),(7889) 1994 LX and (137052) Tielvar in resonancewith Mars  (M4:3).  The initial  results show that  VNEAs have close encounters with all  the terrestrialplanets; however, most frequent collisions occur withVenus and the Earth. Indeed, our preliminary resultsof 120 integrated orbits (part of the total sample) reveal that ~1/10 of V-NEAs are on impact trajectories.Since some collisions occur at velocities higher thanthe mean impact speed of asteroids (20 km/s) [13],these impacts have the potential to produce craters aslarge as 32 km in diameter  on Earth,  with possiblycatastrophic outcomes. The V-type asteroids producelarger craters than those predicted for the Hungarias[2],  which  are  mainly  E-type  asteroids  (enstatite)[14, 15].  A collision between a V-type asteroid andthe Earth is depicted in Fig. 3. Figure 3:  A geocentric view of impact collision ofasteroid 2001PJ29 with the Earth.References: [1] Carruba V. et al.
