THE EAST KAIBAB MONOCLINE: A TERRAN LOBATE SCARP? Paul K. Byrne1, Christian Klimczak2, and Julia K.

Introduction: The surfaces of Mercury, Venus, the Moon, and Mars abound with examples of tectonic shortening deformation [e.g., 1-8]. This style of deformation is typically manifest as positive-relief, arcuate-to-linear landforms (Figure 1), either in isolation [9], concentrated into narrow regions [2], or distributed broadly across entire regions [10]. A range of nomenclature including "wrinkle ridge" and "lobate scarp" has arisen in association with these landforms, with the former describing arch-like structures and the latter pertaining to cliff-like escarpments. Despite the broad morphological variety of such extraterrestrial landforms, there is a general consensus that they collectively result from horizontal shortening involving some combination of reverse faulting and folding [e.g., 11].                       Our own world has no lack of shortening structures, although most are concentrated in orogenic settings reflecting convergent plate motion. Nonetheless, some examples of landforms on Earth thought analogous to crustal shortening structures on other bodies have been documented [e.g., 12]. Here, we explore a portion of a shortening landform in southern Utah, the East Kaibab monocline, and appraise its morphology, internal structure, and underlying fault system as a Terran counterpart to the lobate scarps observed on Mercury, the Moon, and Mars.  The East Kaibab monocline: Extending about 180 km from southern Utah to northern Arizona, the East Kaibab monocline is one of several large anticlines within the Colorado Plateau [13]. The monocline is likely underlain by an originally normal, high-angle basement fault that was reactivated with reverse offset during the Laramide orogeny [14]. The portion of the landform in southern Utah is ~50 km long and, striking north-northeast, possesses almost 1.5 km of reverse displacement and as much as 8 km of right-lateral displacement [15]. Despite differences in tectonic setting and lithology, there are substantial similarities between Terran monoclines like the East Kaibab structure and extraterrestrial lobate scarps. Both types of landform are convex in cross section and arcuate to linear in plan view, represent considerable horizontal shortening strain, and likely result from thrust-fault-related folding. Observations of the regional- and outcropscale geometry of the East Kaibab monocline, together with inferences about its subsurface geometry from elastic half-space modeling, may provide insights into the kinematic and geometric properties of lobate scarps not currently available from remotely sensed data alone. Field survey: A preliminary field assessment of the monocline yielded 40 strike and dip measurements along a 25 km stretch of the structure (Figure 2). Measurements were taken to characterize both the cross- and along-strike pattern of deformation within the monocline. The general shape of the monocline is apparent in the distribution of dips across strike. The peripheral Lower Jurassic Navajo Sandstone and Upper Cretaceous Kaiparowits Formations, which represent the strata above the hanging wall and footwall blocks, respectively, show relatively shallow (i.e., ~10°) dips to the east. The units that compose the monocline's forelimb, including the Middle Jurassic Entrada Sandstone formation in the north of our field area, and the Upper Cretaceous Tropic Shale formation in the south, show the greatest dips, which typically range ~60-80° to the east. These units outcrop in the center of the eroded portion of the monocline, along which the Cottonwood Canyon road meanders (Figure 2). At outcrop scale, the monocline is characterized by substantial brittle deformation. Folding has been accommodated locally by both normal and reverse faulting, resulting in single deformation bands,Figure 1.

complex fracture sets through individual strata, meterthick shear zones, and even decameter-size blocks that rotated such that their constituent beds have nearvertical dips. Previous field studies have also documented sets of transpressive faults with both left- and right-lateral displacements along the length of the Utah portion of the monocline [15].                                       Coulomb modeling: To reconstruct the portion of the landform now lost to erosion, we modeled with the Coulomb 3.4 program [e.g., 16] the entire structural relief arising from the geometry and kinematics of the underlying fault inferred by earlier studies [14, 15]. We followed the procedure developed in a study of largescale thrusts on the Moon [6]. Our results (Figure 3) show modeled vertical displacements for the major Jurassic and Cretaceous formations that compose the monocline. Notably, the use of a cumulative dip slip of 2 km (greater than the 1.6 km inferred previously [15]) allows us to closely match both the geometry and location of folded strata within the monocline, as documented in geological maps of the area [e.g., 17] as well as geological cross sections [15]. These displacements together define the pre-erosion shape of the landform, which bears a strong morphological similarity to landforms identified as lobate scarps on other silicate bodies (compare Figures 1 and 3).                  Outlook: Our field and model data suggest that there are strong geometric and kinematic similarities between large-scale shortening landforms on Earth and other worlds. The East Kaibab monocline has been interpreted as a fault-propagation fold [15]. Our understanding of crustal shortening processes on other planetary bodies will be enhanced by applying similar structural interpretations to extraterrestrial landforms historically labeled as lobate scarps.
