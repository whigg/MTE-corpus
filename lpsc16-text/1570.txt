Introduction: The ~290 Ma West Clearwater Lake impact structure (WCIS) [1] is located in northern Quebec at 56°08′N 74°18′W ~125 km east of Hudson Bay (Fig. 1). The target rocks are coarse-grained plutonic rocks of the Superior Province, comprising quartz monzonite, granodiorite, and amphibolite lithologies. This structure is ~30 km in diameter and has a series of central islands (Figure 1). In this work we examine impact melt veins found in the different country rock lithologies with a view to determining their origin and possible role in central uplift formation.   Figure 1.

Melt Vein Formation: There are two common formation processes for impact melt veins in impact structures; injection of shock induced melt and frictional melting. Shock induced melting occurs during decompression from high shock pressures; whereas frictional melting occurs during crater collapse and uplift formation when rapid slip displacement along faults allow for fragmentation and comminution of the rock [2]. This process results in pseudotachylite, a dense rock formed by frictional melting and known to occur in impact structures around the world [3]. By analyzing the bulk chemistry of both the melt veins and host rock we attempt to determine whether the melt is formed in situ or if it is injected into fractures in the host rock. In situ melt will have a similar chemical composition to the host rock whereas injected melt will differ in chemistry when compared to the host rock.        Methods and Samples: Approximately 300 samples were collected during fieldwork conducted in August and September of 2014 as part of a Canadian-US-UK expedition [4]. This study focuses on the analysis of five WCIS samples of host rock and melt veins from the central islands in West Clearwater Lake. The host rock and melt rock were powdered separately and analyzed for bulk chemistry, which resulted in a total of 10 samples with chemical data. In this study we have used a mixing model developed by Weirich [5] which replicates the geochemical signature of the melt veins using the country rock and melt rock bulk chemistry data as endmembers. The model evaluates the contributions from each endmember and performs a principle component decomposition of the geochemical data. The mixing model then determines the combination which produces the lowest chi squared value. The output also provides a p-value for each modelled combination to assess the probability that the chi squared value is low by chance.        Geochemistry: Figure 2 shows the relationship of the melt veins collected from Ile Lepage to the country rock from the island. It is clear that the melt veins appear intermediate to the country rocks but closely match the impact melt samples retrieved from Ile Lepage, which represents part of the coherent impact melt sheet. Thus, these melt veins are interpreted to have been formed through injected impact melt.   Figure 2. Harker diagram of samples from Ile Lepage  The central islands show a different pattern than the Ile Lepage melt veins; Figure 3 shows the relationship between melt veins from the central islands and the country rocks of granite and mafic lithologies which dominate the exposed outcrops on the islands.  The melt veins plot much closer to the country rocks than the melt average for the impact structure, and are likely not formed through injected impact melt. Per forming the mixing model analysis on the melt veins will reveal which lithologies are dominating the chemical composition of the veins and therefore give insight into their formation processes.    Figure 3. Harker Diagram of samples from central islands  The spider diagram in Figure 4 demonstrates that the REE signature of the Ile Lepage melts closely match the impact melt average and have fewer similarities to the country rocks, particularly the granite end members.  Based on the harker diagram and spider plots of the Ile Lepage data it appears that the veins are most similar chemically to the impact melt average for the Ile Lepage samples.   Figure 4.  Spider diagram of Ile Lepage melts (green) average impact melt (blue), the Ile Lepage country rocks are also represented; granite country rocks (red) diorite (teal) and diabase (purple).  We are able to test this hypothesis by using the model to perform a component decomposition on silicon for the melt vein samples. Figure 5 shows an example of this analysis for WCIS-14-RW-013, which is a sample retrieved from Ile Lepage of a red melt vein in a granitic basement lithology. The plot compares the modelled composition with the actual melt vein composition of WCIS-RW-013, while there are some anomalies the model is able to reproduce the majority of the elements relatively well. The modelled values produced the lowest chi squared value while keeping a high p value and determined the melt vein composition to be made up of ~88% impact melt, and  ~11% of the host rock lithology, with minimal to no contribution from diabase or diorite.    Figure 5. Comparison of trace and REE elements of modelled composition (blue) and actual composition (red) of Ile Lepage melt vein sample WCIS-14-RW013.  Discussion: It is expected that the other Ile Lepage melt veins will show similar results as WCIS-14-RW013, and be predominantly composed of injected impact melt. Some variation of host rock inclusion can be anticipated as injected melt can incorporate host rock into the vein during injection. Further analysis of these samples along with the central island samples will be conducted. It is hypothesized that the central island samples will be composed primarily of host rock and formed from frictional melting rather than injected melt. The mixing model will be used to determine the endmember percent composition of the remaining samples in order to gain a better understanding of their formation processes.
