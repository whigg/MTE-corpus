Evidence for Variable Ice Accumulation or Viscosity of Martian Glaciers on Opposing Slopes of Euripus Mons,Mars from Numerical Ice Flow Modeling Reid Parsons1, John W. Holt2, 1Fitchburg State University, (rparson4@fitchburgstate.edu) 2Institute for Geophysics, University of Texas at AustinIntroduction: Martian lobate debris aprons (LDAs)provide evidence of a past hydrologic cycle that wascapable of redistributing large quantities of water icefrom the poles to the mid-latitudes likely driven byobliquity-induced changes in insolation [1]. LDAs aredebris-covered ice deposits, ≥ 300 m thick [2,3] protected by a 10s of meters thick [4] regolith layer thatare found in several regions in the northern (e.g. Protonilus/Deuteronilus Mensae) and southern (e.g., East ofHellas and Southern Argyre) mid-latitudes on Mars.Observations Used as Model Inputs: Observationsfrom the SHARAD radar have constrained the topography at the base of many of these deposits (e.g., EuripusMons [2]). Using LDA age constraints from crater density studies [5,6,7], we can place limits on the ice viscosity within LDAs by comparing the surface topographygenerated from ice flow simulations over the SHARADdetermined basal topography with the observed surfacetopography of LDAs collected by the High ResolutionStereo Camera (HRSC).Numerical Approach and Assumptions: Our glacialflow model simulates changes in ice thickness as iceflows over a basal slope constrained by the SHARADradar at a horizontal resolution equivalent to the HRSCtopography (75 m and 109 m for N. and S. Euripus, respectively). The model assumes ice deformation in thegrain size sensitive (GSS) creep regime in which strainrate depends on the applied stress to the second power(�˙ ∝ τ2). Ice viscosity influences from ice grain sizeand temperature are incorporated in the model based onexperiments by Goldsby and Kohlstedt (2001) [8]. Theice grain size is a variable in our simulations, but oncespecified for a given simulation, it can be used to calculate the incorporated dust content via the grain-boundarypinning effect [9]. The density [9,10] and viscosity [11]effects of the incorporated dust are also incorporated inour simulations.The initially ice-free model domain accumulates icein the headlands scarp region at a rate of 5 mm/yr (Figure 1). Accumulation continues until a volume of iceequivalent to the volume observed within a particularsection of the LDA (calculated from the surface topography, basal topography, and deposit width) has beenreached. This takes 222 kyrs and 530 kyrs the N. andS. Euripus deposits, respectively. We assume no ice ablation in order to model LDA formation using the minimum amount of ice - providing us with a lower limit onthe ice viscosity. If ice ablation were to take place in themodel, the simulation would need to start with a largerice volume which would tend to flow faster due to thehigher stresses experienced within the LDA. In order tocompensate, the ice would need to be of a higher viscosity to produce a formation timescale in agreement withcrater density measurements (between 40 and 500 Myrs).Thus, our simulations are biased toward lower viscosities by neglecting ablation, but by assuming that a single deposition event was responsible for forming boththe N. and S. Euripus LDA lobes, we are biasing ourresults toward larger viscosity values. If ice depositionwere to occur in two or more events separated in timeby ∼ 10 Myrs or more, then ice flow would be muchslower due to the lower stresses in a thinner ice deposit.This sluggish flow would cause the overall LDA formation time to be greater than if deposition were to occurin a single event. We speculate, below, that S. Euripusmay have experienced a recent episode of ice depositionbased on an improved fit to the observed topography. Initially, however, we assume deposition occurs in a singleevent - an assumption which has the opposite influenceon our viscosity results than that of our assumption regarding ice ablation.Figure 1: Example numerical simulations for the northern (a)and southern (b) lobes of the Euripus Mons LDA. These twosimulations (thin black lines) use an ice temperature of 205 K,an ice grain size of 5 mm, and a basal slope that agrees withSHARAD data. a) Ice accumulates within the shaded region for222 kyrs and flows down the steep, scarp slope before reachingthe 1◦ basal slope. The HRSC topographic profile is given bythe blue line bounded by the black points indicating a goodagreement with the model once the ice has flowed for slightlyless than 200 Myrs. b) For the southern lobe, ice accumulatesfor 530 kyrs due to the larger volume - resulting in a faster flowtimescale (note the poorer fit to the observed topography whencompared with (a)).Ice Viscosity Constraints: Figure 1 compares twoexample simulations for N. and S. Euripus (thin blacklines with time labels) to the HRSC topography for bothlocations (blue lines) - indicating a much faster flowtimescale for S. Euripus than N. Euripus. Quantifyingthe root-mean-squared (RMS) error between the modeland HRSC profiles in these simulations results in a bestfit case after 155 Myrs of flow for the N. Euripus lobe(RMS error E = 23.2 m) and after only 7 Myrs for theS. Euripus lobe (E =109 m). Plotting the best-fit flowtimescales (contour lines) in a parameter space relatingto the ice viscosity is shown by Figure 2. This figure indicates that the ice viscosity for S. Euripus is a factor of1462.pdf

2∼ 20 larger than N. Euripus if the two deposits are of thesame age and formed in a single ice accumulation event.Figure 2: Trade-off between the ice flow timescale and iceviscosity. a) Simulations using different ice temperatures andgrain sizes give best-fit flow timescales indicated by the numbers (in Myrs) next to the black squares. Flow timescales indicated by the contour lines were determined based on the dependence of the flow velocity on ice temperature and grain size (seeappendix of [12]) in the numerical model. The shaded regionhighlights the range of likely LDA ages based on crater densitystudies. b) Southern Euripus flow time scale results using basaltopography constrained by SHARAD give flow timescales thatare 20 times faster than the N. Euripus Mons site for a givencombination of temperature and ice grain size.Two explanations for this viscosity contrast are indicated in Figure 2b: either (1) the S. Euripus LDAlobe containing ice with an order of magnitude largergrain size (dotted arrow), or (2) a factor of ≈3.5 largerice grain size accompanied by an ice temperature thatis 10 K colder for S. Euripus (dashed line). Estimatesof the slope-corrected annually averaged temperature onthe surfaces of these two LDAs indicate a temperaturecontrast of 3 K, but the temperature difference wouldbe greater between the N-facing and S-facing headlandscarps [12].Possibility ofMultiple Ice Deposition Events: Giventhe colder temperatures on the southern scarp of EuripusMons, enhanced deposition and/or reduced ablation ofice might have resulted in a thicker ice-rich mantle on thesouthern slope of Euripus Mons during periods of moderate to high obliquity while the northern, equator-facingscarp remained ice-free [13,14]. Such an event could explain the poor model fit to the observed topography for S.Euripus while also accounting for some of the differencein ice accumulation timescales between N. and S. Euripus. Pierce and Crown (2003) [15] documented severalinstances in Eastern Hellas where an ice-rich lobe superposes a pre-existing LDA suggesting that multiple ice deposition events have taken place, but found examples ofoverlying flow lobes emanating from both equator- andpole-facing scarps. An additional simulation (using anice temperature of 195 K and grain size of 5 mm) inwhich 80% of the total ice volume was allowed to precipitate on the scarp and flow for a 150 Myr period isshown by the dashed line in Figure 3. Then, a period ofprecipitation lasting 106 kyrs deposited the remaining icevolume onto the scarp which flowed down onto the preexisting deposit over an additional 15 Myr period (thin,solid line in Figure 3). The inset plot in Figure 3 showsthe time progression in E illustrating the temporary improvement of the fit 15 Myrs after the second ice deposition event. Although this simulation better matches thesurface topography, it is contingent upon ice depositionoccurring in the recent past (15 Myr ago) and over a limited area (southern scarp of Euripus Mons).Conclusions: Assuming that ice deposition was contemporaneous between the N. and S. lobes of the Euripus Mons LDA results in a viscosity contrast that likelyexceeds that which can produced simply by the insolation effect of the equator- and pole-facing slopes on theN. and S. LDA surfaces, respectively. We tentatively favor a hypothesis in which a more recent ice depositionoccurred, or was preserved, only the S. Euripus depositresulting in a more linear topographic profile. Howevermore modeling efforts, both of LDA formation at otherlocations and of ice deposition on slopes of various aspects during high obliquity, are needed to make a definitive conclusion regarding potential variability in viscosity and ice accumulation between LDA deposits.Figure 3: An ice flow simulation with an improved fit to theS. Euripus lobe by incorporating two ice deposition events separated in time by 150 Myrs. The initial deposition event accounts for 80% of the total ice volume in the simulation. Thebest-fitting ice topography occurs 165 Myrs after the start ofthe simulation (15 Myrs after the second deposition event). Thetime progression of the RMS misfit (E) between the HRSC topographic profile and the simulation is shown in the inset.References: [1] Laskar, J., et al. (2002), Nature,419, 375-377.
