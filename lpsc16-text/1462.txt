 Evidence for Variable Ice Accumulation or Viscosity of Martian Glaciers on Opposing Slopes of Euripus Mons, Mars from Numerical Ice Flow Modeling Reid Parsons1, John W. Holt2, 1Fitchburg State University, (rparson4@fitchburgstate.edu) 2Institute for Geophysics, University of Texas at Austin Introduction: Martian lobate debris aprons (LDAs) provide evidence of a past hydrologic cycle that was capable of redistributing large quantities of water ice from the poles to the mid-latitudes likely driven by obliquity-induced changes in insolation [1]. LDAs are debris-covered ice deposits, ≥ 300 m thick [2,3] protected by a 10s of meters thick [4] regolith layer that are found in several regions in the northern (e.g. Protonilus/Deuteronilus Mensae) and southern (e.g., East of Hellas and Southern Argyre) mid-latitudes on Mars. Observations Used as Model Inputs: Observations from the SHARAD radar have constrained the topography at the base of many of these deposits (e.g., Euripus Mons [2]). Using LDA age constraints from crater density studies [5,6,7], we can place limits on the ice viscosity within LDAs by comparing the surface topography generated from ice flow simulations over the SHARADdetermined basal topography with the observed surface topography of LDAs collected by the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC). Numerical Approach and Assumptions: Our glacial flow model simulates changes in ice thickness as ice flows over a basal slope constrained by the SHARAD radar at a horizontal resolution equivalent to the HRSC topography (75 m and 109 m for N. and S. Euripus, respectively). The model assumes ice deformation in the grain size sensitive (GSS) creep regime in which strain rate depends on the applied stress to the second power (�̇ ∝ τ2). Ice viscosity influences from ice grain size and temperature are incorporated in the model based on experiments by Goldsby and Kohlstedt (2001) [8]. The ice grain size is a variable in our simulations, but once specified for a given simulation, it can be used to calculate the incorporated dust content via the grain-boundary pinning effect [9]. The density [9,10] and viscosity [11] effects of the incorporated dust are also incorporated in our simulations. The initially ice-free model domain accumulates ice in the headlands scarp region at a rate of 5 mm/yr (Figure 1). Accumulation continues until a volume of ice equivalent to the volume observed within a particular section of the LDA (calculated from the surface topography, basal topography, and deposit width) has been reached. This takes 222 kyrs and 530 kyrs the N. and S. Euripus deposits, respectively. We assume no ice ablation in order to model LDA formation using the minimum amount of ice - providing us with a lower limit on the ice viscosity. If ice ablation were to take place in the model, the simulation would need to start with a larger ice volume which would tend to flow faster due to the higher stresses experienced within the LDA. In order to compensate, the ice would need to be of a higher viscosity to produce a formation timescale in agreement with crater density measurements (between 40 and 500 Myrs). Thus, our simulations are biased toward lower viscosities by neglecting ablation, but by assuming that a single deposition event was responsible for forming both the N. and S. Euripus LDA lobes, we are biasing our results toward larger viscosity values. If ice deposition were to occur in two or more events separated in time by ∼ 10 Myrs or more, then ice flow would be much slower due to the lower stresses in a thinner ice deposit. This sluggish flow would cause the overall LDA formation time to be greater than if deposition were to occur in a single event. We speculate, below, that S. Euripus may have experienced a recent episode of ice deposition based on an improved fit to the observed topography. Initially, however, we assume deposition occurs in a single event - an assumption which has the opposite influence on our viscosity results than that of our assumption regarding ice ablation. Figure 1: Example numerical simulations for the northern (a) and southern (b) lobes of the Euripus Mons LDA. These two simulations (thin black lines) use an ice temperature of 205 K, an ice grain size of 5 mm, and a basal slope that agrees with SHARAD data. a) Ice accumulates within the shaded region for 222 kyrs and flows down the steep, scarp slope before reaching the 1◦ basal slope. The HRSC topographic profile is given by the blue line bounded by the black points indicating a good agreement with the model once the ice has flowed for slightly less than 200 Myrs. b) For the southern lobe, ice accumulates for 530 kyrs due to the larger volume - resulting in a faster flow timescale (note the poorer fit to the observed topography when compared with (a)). Ice Viscosity Constraints: Figure 1 compares two example simulations for N. and S. Euripus (thin black lines with time labels) to the HRSC topography for both locations (blue lines) - indicating a much faster flow timescale for S. Euripus than N. Euripus. Quantifying the root-mean-squared (RMS) error between the model and HRSC profiles in these simulations results in a bestfit case after 155 Myrs of flow for the N. Euripus lobe (RMS error E = 23.2 m) and after only 7 Myrs for the S. Euripus lobe (E =109 m). Plotting the best-fit flow timescales (contour lines) in a parameter space relating to the ice viscosity is shown by Figure 2. This figure indicates that the ice viscosity for S. Euripus is a factor of  2∼ 20 larger than N. Euripus if the two deposits are of the same age and formed in a single ice accumulation event. Figure 2: Trade-off between the ice flow timescale and ice viscosity. a) Simulations using different ice temperatures and grain sizes give best-fit flow timescales indicated by the numbers (in Myrs) next to the black squares. Flow timescales indicated by the contour lines were determined based on the dependence of the flow velocity on ice temperature and grain size (see appendix of [12]) in the numerical model. The shaded region highlights the range of likely LDA ages based on crater density studies. b) Southern Euripus flow time scale results using basal topography constrained by SHARAD give flow timescales that are 20 times faster than the N. Euripus Mons site for a given combination of temperature and ice grain size. Two explanations for this viscosity contrast are indicated in Figure 2b: either (1) the S. Euripus LDA lobe containing ice with an order of magnitude larger grain size (dotted arrow), or (2) a factor of ≈3.5 larger ice grain size accompanied by an ice temperature that is 10 K colder for S. Euripus (dashed line). Estimates of the slope-corrected annually averaged temperature on the surfaces of these two LDAs indicate a temperature contrast of 3 K, but the temperature difference would be greater between the N-facing and S-facing headland scarps [12]. Possibility of Multiple Ice Deposition Events: Given the colder temperatures on the southern scarp of Euripus Mons, enhanced deposition and/or reduced ablation of ice might have resulted in a thicker ice-rich mantle on the southern slope of Euripus Mons during periods of moderate to high obliquity while the northern, equator-facing scarp remained ice-free [13,14]. Such an event could explain the poor model fit to the observed topography for S. Euripus while also accounting for some of the difference in ice accumulation timescales between N. and S. Euripus. Pierce and Crown (2003) [15] documented several instances in Eastern Hellas where an ice-rich lobe superposes a pre-existing LDA suggesting that multiple ice deposition events have taken place, but found examples of overlying flow lobes emanating from both equator- and pole-facing scarps. An additional simulation (using an ice temperature of 195 K and grain size of 5 mm) in which 80% of the total ice volume was allowed to precipitate on the scarp and flow for a 150 Myr period is shown by the dashed line in Figure 3. Then, a period of precipitation lasting 106 kyrs deposited the remaining ice volume onto the scarp which flowed down onto the preexisting deposit over an additional 15 Myr period (thin, solid line in Figure 3). The inset plot in Figure 3 shows the time progression in E illustrating the temporary improvement of the fit 15 Myrs after the second ice deposition event. Although this simulation better matches the surface topography, it is contingent upon ice deposition occurring in the recent past (15 Myr ago) and over a limited area (southern scarp of Euripus Mons). Conclusions: Assuming that ice deposition was contemporaneous between the N. and S. lobes of the Euripus Mons LDA results in a viscosity contrast that likely exceeds that which can produced simply by the insolation effect of the equator- and pole-facing slopes on the N. and S. LDA surfaces, respectively. We tentatively favor a hypothesis in which a more recent ice deposition occurred, or was preserved, only the S. Euripus deposit resulting in a more linear topographic profile. However more modeling efforts, both of LDA formation at other locations and of ice deposition on slopes of various aspects during high obliquity, are needed to make a definitive conclusion regarding potential variability in viscosity and ice accumulation between LDA deposits. Figure 3: An ice flow simulation with an improved fit to the S. Euripus lobe by incorporating two ice deposition events separated in time by 150 Myrs. The initial deposition event accounts for 80% of the total ice volume in the simulation. The best-fitting ice topography occurs 165 Myrs after the start of the simulation (15 Myrs after the second deposition event). The time progression of the RMS misfit (E) between the HRSC topographic profile and the simulation is shown in the inset. References: [1] Laskar, J., et al. (2002), Nature, 419, 375-377.
