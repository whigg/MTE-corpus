Introduction:  Tycho crater (43°23′S, 11°10′W) is a prominent lunar impact crater of Copernican ear. The relatively young age and the 1500-km long rays make it be of great significance to explore geothermal evolution process of the large craters formed in the same era [1, 2]. The crater has been thoroughly studied with the visible data [3, 4], and the thermal infrared data [5, 6, 7]. However, the penetration depth of these data is rather poor [8]. Moreover, the data of such kind, especially the thermal infrared data, are strongly affected by the environmental temperature, which makes it difficult to study the internal thermal features of the lunar regolith at Tycho crater area.  The penetration depth of the CELMS data can be up to about 10 m in 3 GHz [8, 9], and the CELMS data are sensitive to the substrate thermal feature of the lunar regolith, which provide a potential chance to study the thermal features cold behavior of the Moon surface. Therefore, the spatial and temporal features of the internal microwave thermal emission (MTE) at Tycho crater area are studied with the microwave sounder (CELMS) data from Chang'E-2 satellite combined with TiO2 abundance, surface slope and roughness, rock abundance data of lunar regolith. Methodology:  The study area is centered at Tycho crater, ranging from 41°S-45°S, 8.5°W13.5°W, which covers the Tycho crater and part of the ejecta blanket. According to the features of the terrain, the study area is divided into four representative parts, which include the south part of Tycho crater (A), the north part of Tycho crater floor (B), central peak (C), and the ejecta of the Tycho Crater (D).  The CELMS data are measured from October of 2010 to May of 2011. Firstly, the hour angle is introduced to select brightness temperatures (TB) at 24 hours which can eliminate the influence of observation time on the CELMS data. Then a degree-seven polynomial fitting scheme is used to fit the observation TB and the simulation one. Finally, the 24- hour TB maps at 3.0 GHz, 7.8 GHz, 19.35 GHz and 37 GHz are generated with the 0.25°×0.25° spatial resolution. Heading Styles:  To further study the interia MTE of the lunar regolith at Tycho crater area, the difference between TB of the same frequency at noon and dawn (Fig.1) and that between TB of the observation time at 3.0GHz and 37GHz are generated.

That is, the diurnal variation of the surface temperature is extremely large, and the temperature of the upper-layer of the lunar regolith is much higher than that of the lower-layer.  At Region B, TB is always low in the whole day. The difference between the TB of the same frequency at noon and dawn are rather small, which hints that the MTE of Region B is slightly influenced by the surface temperature. Meanwhile, the small fluctuation of the diurnal TB change hints that the change of the surface temperature here is rather small. Moreover, the difference between TB of the same observation time at different frequency is also small, which presents that the temperature of the upper-layer regolith is not much different from that of the lower-layer regolith. Furthermore, Fig.1 also hints that the vertical structure of the lunar regolith at east part of Region B is different from that at the west part. The change rate of the observation TB is highest at Region C. Considered the complex topography of the central peak, the formation mechanism of the highest TB change rate is valuable to be further studied. Region D presents the high TB difference as Region A at 3 GHz, while it gives the low TB difference as the east part of Region B at 37 GHz, which hints that the upper-layer of the lunar regolith structure here is approximating to Region B and the lower regolith layer is similar to Region A. The statistical analysis presents that the surface roughness and rock abundance has the strongest influence on the MTE of Tycho area, followed by the surface slope and TiO2 abundance. An interesting phenomenon, revealed by the 24hour TB map, is that TB at Region B is small fluctuated from 3 A. M. before the sunrise. The most likely cause to the phenomenon is that the thermal state of the region is tending to stability, which provides an ideal place to study the thermal flux for the future Moon research.
