HEAT TRANSPORT IN THE HADEAN MANTLE: FROM HEAT PIPES TO PLATES. Duminda G. J.Kankanamge1,2 and William B. Moore1,2, 1Department of Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences, Hampton University,Hampton, Virginia, USA (gjkduminda@gmail.com). 2National Institute of Aerospace, Hampton, Virginia, USA(bill.moore@nianet.org).Introduction: Plate tectonics is a unique feature ofEarth and it plays a major role in transporting Earths internally generated heat. It also governs the nature, shapeand the motion of the surface of Earth. The mechanismand the timing of the origin of plate tectonics on Earthhas been difficult to establish observationally, thereforeit is still an interesting subject, which is still under debate. The internal heat energy of the terrestrial planetswas greater in the early stages of their histories than itis today [1].In order to understand the behavior of the Earth undermuch higher heating rates, we turn to a contemporaryexample. Jupiter's moon Io is a rocky body experiencing very high heat production due to tidal dissipationresulting in a surface heat flow roughly 40 times Earth's[2]. Io transports heat from the interior to the surface bymelt segregation resulting in extreme volcanism [3, 4],a mode of heat transport called "heat pipes". Recentstudies [5] have proposed that, for roughly the first thirdof Earth's history, heat flow was sufficiently high thatEarth's heat-loss and lithospheric dynamics were alsodominated by the 'heat pipe' mode. When volcanismdominates the heat transport of a terrestrial body, hotmagma moves through the lithosphere in narrow channels to erupt on the surface. Continuous burial of old,cooled flows results in a thick, cold, and strong lithosphere.In this study, we numerically simulate the heat transport in the pre-plate tectonic Earth to understand thetransition from heat pipe mode to plate tectonic behavior. These simplified numerical simulations of the flowof Earth's mantle include heat transport by melting andmelt segregation (volcanism), Newtonian temperaturedependent viscosity, and internal heating. We investigate the influence of melt transport on the thermalstructure and stresses of the lithosphere vary with initial conditions and yield stress for a given set of solidusfunction parameters. This report discuss our numericalmodel, simulation results and discuss how the convective stresses exceed the yield stress of a lithospheric lidproducing overturn.Model: We use STAGYY [6] to solve the equationof mass, momentum, energy and composition conservation for infinite-Prandtl-number Boussinesq flow in a4 ⇥ 1, two-dimensional domain spanning the depth ofthe mantle. The system is made dimensionless by usingthe mantle depth, D, as the length scale, D2/ as thethermal diffusion time scale (, thermal diffusivity) andD2H/k as the temperature scale (where H , k are thevolumetric heat production rate and the thermal conductivity, receptively). The Newtonian, exponentiallytemperature-dependent viscosity (⌘) is used. We modelthe strength of the lithosphere by using a yield stress �ywhich modifies the constitutive equation as follows:�ij = 2�2y⌘�2y + ⌘2"˙2"˙ij ⌘ 2⌘e↵ "˙ij . (1)Here �ij is stress, "˙ij is strain rate, ⌘e↵ is an effectiveviscosity and "˙2 is second invariant of the strain ratetensor, and the effect of finite �y is to lower the viscosityto maintain an upper limit on the stress.To keep the dynamics of melting and melt extractionisolated, we take a highly simplified approach to mantle compositional evolution. Composition is assumed tovary between the two end-members basalt and harzburgite. The variable C, which varies from 0 (harzburgite) to 1 (basalt), represents the fraction of basalt ateach location. Melting is calculated in each grid cellat each time step. Basaltic melt is generated wheneverthe mantle exceeds a simple linearly pressure-dependentsolidus [7]. Only the basaltic component can melt; oncethe composition reaches harzburgite, further melting isnot permitted. The fraction of partial melt f that bringsthe temperature back onto the solidus, if sufficient basaltfraction is present. Melt is immediately extracted to thesurface, and the column in which the melt was producedis advected downwards to conserve mass.Results: We first investigate the influence of melttransport on the thermal structure and stress state of thelithosphere.

Figure 1 shows the conductive heatflux, volcanic heat flux and the heat flow in equilibrium with internal heat production for five different initial conditions varying only in the random number seedgiven to determine the 2% temperature variations imposed at t=0. The system rapidly evolves through aninitial transient into the heat pipe mode. During theheat pipe phase (up to about 0.25 time units), internalheat is mainly transported through volcanism, while thelithosphere transports a nearly constant amount of heat.As the heat pipe mode shuts off (⇠0.45 time units),internal heat is transported by conduction through thelithosphere. The transition to plate tectonic behavioris abrupt and always occurs after the cessation of heatpipe volcanism when conductive heat flux exceeds theinternal heating and the mantle begins to cool. Platebreaks resulting from different initial conditions occurat slightly different times demonstrating that the timingof the plate break is sensitive to the initial conditions andnot determined uniquely by the convective parameters.Figure 2 demonstrates why plate tectonics does notoccur during the heat pipe mode. Figure 2 shows themaximum horizontal temperature difference as a function of depth for the three different epochs indicated byvertical lines in Figure 1: In order to initiate plate-likebehavior, the strength of lithosphere must be overcomeby the convective stress. The convective stress scaleswith the amplitude of the temperature changes. Duringthe heat-pipe mode, the temperature difference is suppressed by the limiting effect of the solidus, and therefore the buoyancy forces and the convective stressesare not large enough to overcome lithosphere strength.When the conductive heat flux exceeds the internal heatproduction rate, the temperature difference is greaterthan that of the heat pipe mode, but the buoyancy forceis still not favorable for breaking plates. Finally whenthe heat pipe mode shuts off, the temperature differenceand the buoyancy forces increase so that the convective stresses from the mantle overcome the lithosphericstress and the plate breaks. Figure 3 shows the timeevolution of the temperature (left) and stress (right) distributions from heat pipe to plate break for one of thefive simulations. The snapshots in the top-left show that,the development of cold and thick lithosphere during theheat pipe mode. Note the very flat isotherms causedby the capping of the temperature distribution by thesolidus. Moving from top to bottom as heat-pipes shutoff, we see the gradual development of significant slopeson the lithosphere's base until a break occurs. Snapshotsin the right column show that the stress in the lid alsogradually increases (from top to bottom) until breaking.

This explains why Io displays no evidence of platetectonic behavior despite its very strong internal heating. When the heat pipe mode shuts off, the solidusno longer exerts a dominant effect on the temperaturedistribution in the upper part of the convecting mantleand the convective stresses increase. Eventually theymay overcome the strength of the lithosphere and breakthe plate, initiating plate tectonic behavior if the scaledyield stress is sufficiently low.Acknowledgments: This work was sponsored byNational Science Foundation grant EAR-1246983.References: [1] Franck S.
