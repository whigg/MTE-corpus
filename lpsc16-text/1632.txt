This is especially true at the poles, where limited ground observations have been made but significant quantities of water reside on the surface, providing nearly the entirety of the Martian water budget and cycle [1,2]. Mars polar regions are some of the most active places on the planet. Winds here strongly influence the surface distribution of water ice and other particulates, especially related to morphologic features such as the spiral troughs and prominent dune fields [3,4]. Understanding the pattern of winds throughout the year is an important step to understanding surface processes. Prior to this study, no other has completed mesoscale simulations throughout a Mars year for the polar regions with a focus on diurnal, sub-seasonal, and seasonal variability. Here we provide simulations for each 5-10° of solar longitude (Ls) beginning at northern vernal equinox (Ls 0°) and ending at northern autumnal equinox (Ls 180°). Dates outside this range are also simulated, but the seasonal CO2 ice provides a barrier for modifying the surface, and we exclude them. We find that the retreat of the seasonal CO2 cap is the primary driver of surface wind speeds for the first half of the season. Once the CO2 cap has disappeared, other factors, such as large eddies and regional transients play a larger role in determining wind properties. Our simulations of wind speeds and directions closely conform to geologic and atmospheric interpretations of near surface clouds and wind streaks, which afford a valuable check for simulations [3-5]. Methods: We ran simulations at relatively high mesoscale resolutions of 18 km per grid point. They have been completed at latitudes poleward of 75° and are run for three days every 5° Ls. For one date in our pilot study we ran a three-nested, high resolution simulation for 20 days plus additional spinup. The resolution of each grid was 90 km, 30 km, and 10 km. Inclusion of the many days allows us to perform the detailed analysis first described by [6] and differentiate diurnal from larger scale effects. To improve on previous versions, we have included observations from thermal instruments that detect where CO2 ice is present on the surface [7] and maps of thermal inertia [8]. This resulted in significant    improvements over previously run models, which took input from the LMD GCM to determine the location of CO2 surface ice and disagreed with observations. Results: We find that the seasonal CO2 frost plays an enormous role in influencing wind direction and Figure 1: Simulated wind speeds at selected dates plotted over ground surface temperature. As the CO2 seasonal cap retreats so do the fastest winds.1632.pdf

speed (Figure 1). This is a direct effect caused by thermal contrast between the interior of the CO2 cap (inside the crocus line) and outside, where water-ice and lithic material are allowed to warm significantly above the ~150 K sublimation point of CO2.  After compiling the individual model simulations into a time sequence, we determined the effect over longer periods. Figure 2 demonstrates the maximum wind speeds at 9 polar locations for various dates. Immediately apparent is that the intensity of the wind increases for all locations throughout spring until the seasonal cap retreats to higher latitudes. The timing is different for each location. Wind speeds drop precipitously once the CO2 retreats past the location. In other words: as the seasonal cap retreats, so do the fastest winds. This matches observations of atmospheric activity, especially in the presence of clouds that result from katabatic jumps. At both poles the clouds retreat at the same rate as the crocus line [9]. The usefulness of modeling throughout the year is readily apparent. With this catalog of wind speeds, we can determine the direction and velocity of maximum sustained winds for any date. Comparisons with inferred wind directions from dune orientations are then straightforward (Figure 3). Our one, long duration, triple-nested simulation was designed to test the relative effects of CO2 driven circulation and the larger synoptic structure near the northern ice cap. This was completed at Ls80°, when the CO2 ice was still present. Results from the analysis show that transients, as pressure and temperature anomalies, do play a role in the strength of katabatic winds; however, near the surface, where winds interact with the spiral troughs and dunes, this is a secondary effect that is mostly observed outside of the seasonal cap boundary. At higher altitudes the larger scale circulation dominates. Once the seasonal cap has completely disappeared, all wind speeds near the surface at the north pole are reduced, and larger scale transients begin to dominate the synoptic structure [5,10,11]. Conclusions: We simulate polar winds at high temporal frequency and observe the direct effect that seasonal CO2 ice on the surface has on wind speed and direction throughout the sunlit seasons. This is especially important in the late spring, when the seasonal CO2 ice boundary is within the NPLD margin near to the NPLD slopes. During this period (Fig 1), the winds have small diurnal variation inside the crocus line but significant changes in speed and direction outside. References: [1] Byrne, S. (2009) Annu. Rev.
