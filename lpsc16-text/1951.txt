Introduction:  The majority of Martian meteorite whole rock spectra do not provide a good match to dark, dust-free regions of Mars in the thermal infrared (TIR) [1] (Chassigny and ALH84001 being the exceptions).  Additionally, orbital TIR data suggest that the large dark regions of Mars are comprised of basaltic compositions that generally have plagioclase > pyroxene [2, 3], which is inconsistent with the mineralogy of the basaltic Shergottites [4]. Although good models have been achieved for TIR spectra of Mars with currently available terrestrial phase spectra, better matches may be obtained using spectra of phases obtained directly from Martian meteorites.  A phase of particular interest is pigeonite (lowCa Clinopyroxene), which is commonly abundant in Shergottites [e.g., 5], but is relatively rare in terrestrial rocks so is not well represented in spectral libraries. Pigeonite is difficult to isolate from terrestrial samples because of its small grain size and/or inversion to OPX/CPX intergrowths during cooling. In addition, the scarcity (as well as high value) of Martian meteorites makes physical phase separation impractical. Currently, the only publicly available TIR spectrum of pigeonite is a synthetic sample [6,7] that is not representative of the range of compositions observed in the meteorites. µ-FTIR spectroscopy offers a means of obtaining TIR spectra of all mineral phases, in situ, using existing thin sections from Martian meteorites without the need for excessively destructive sample preparation [e.g., 8]; this enables not only spatially resolved mineralogical spectral analysis of the meteorites, it also permits the extraction of isolated phase spectra that subsequently can be used in models of Martian surface spectra in the TIR.  The spectrum of a mineral crystal is based on the composition of the mineral as well as the orientation of the crystal. Databases of terrestrial mineral spectra are typically derived from granular or powdered samples. This means that the spectra represent a random distribution of crystal orientations. In order to derive spectra from thin sections that can be compared to these sample spectra, we have to account for orientation effects. The focus of this work is the combined use of EBSD/µ-FTIR to derive comparable spectra from thin sections for comparison to planetary surfaces. Sample and Methods:  The focus of our work is the lherzolitic, enriched Shergottite Robert Massif (RBT) 04262. This meteorite has been studied by many groups and the characteristics are described by [5, 9]. The main distinction is the presence two main textures; poikilitic (large) pyroxenes (not described by [5]) enclosing olivine and a normal lherzolitic texture. In our thin section (, 24), a serial section to one studied by [9], there is a large poikilitic CPX grain that represents ~25% of the section (fig. 1 - Area 1). It is dominated by a single twinned pigeonite grain with an augite rim and poikilitically encloses a number of olivine grains. The remainder of the thin section comprises a typical lherzolitic texture dominated by olivine, with two pyroxenes, and a number of minor phases. We've analysed this thin section using a variety of methods including electron probe microanalysis (EPMA; for mineral chemistry and element mapping) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD; to determine crystallography and mineralogy orientation) in addition to µ-FTIR spectroscopy. Results and Discussion:  We recently demonstrated [10] that EBSD and µ-FTIR can be used in tandem to isolate the effect of orientation on a TIR spectrum of a mineral (the large twinned CPX), with band positions and depths varying between the two orientations. Here we present a similar study of Area 2 (fig. 1A). The combined x-ray element map (fig. 1B) shows the distribution of olivine, low and high Ca pyroxenes and a variety of minor minerals. Olivines are not significantly zoned in Mg/Fe and olivine in the poikilitic texture is more Mg-rich. The pyroxenes tend have cores core of pigeonite and rims of augite, although there are some grains where the reverse occurs. There is not discernable Fe/Mg or Mg/Ca zoning in pyroxenes. Plagioclase (all converted to maskelynite) is found in the interstices between the olivines and pyroxenes. There is another poikilitic pyroxene in this area, but it does not exhibit the twinning seen in the larger grain. Figure 1C illustrates the relative orientations of the grains as measured by EBSD. This crystallographic data can be used to interpret spectra in two ways. First, orientations of grains can be analysed using pole figures to determine whether a crystallographic preferred orientation exists or not. The fact that the grains are all different colors and arranged around the entire pole figure implies they are randomly oriented.  Preliminary µ-FTIR spectral measurements of olivine grains are shown in Figure 2. We also show how an average spectrum produced from the thin section 1951.pdf

grains produces a spectrum that is very similar to a spectrum of particulate olivine. In addition, using the pole figures, we can identify grains that are specifically oriented along the a, b, and c axes of the augite, pigeonite and olivine grains. These particular spectra could be useful library endmembers for linear mixing models. Finally, this dataset will lead to a database of single crystal oriented spectra. References: [1] Hamilton V. E.
