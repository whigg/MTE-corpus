Introduction: Valles Marineris (VM) constitutes the largest canyon system in the Solar System and has a complex history. It consists of interconnected and enclosed troughs that extend from the Tharsis volcanic complex to the southern circum-Chryse outflow channels [1]. The central portion of VM (CVM, Fig. 1) includes the deepest of these troughs. Within the CVM troughs occur the thickest exposed sections of (a) layered wall rocks on Mars, mostly lavas and other early crustal rocks [2-3], and (b) interior layered deposits (ILD), generally thought to be of sedimentary or volcanic origin [4].  The trough floors are extensively covered by landslides, fans, and eolian deposits. In addition, they appear locally dissected by channel networks and include patches of fractured terrain development. The plateau surfaces that surround the troughs are extensively cratered and modified by contraction (wrinkle) ridges and extensional faults and grabens, some of which are aligned with pit chains. The plateau surfaces are covered by various types of flow deposits including some of possible volcanic and sedimentary origin.  Methodology: Using geographic information system (GIS) software, we are characterizing and mapping the distribution of materials and features exposed within the canyons and on the plateaus surrounding CVM at 1:1,000,000-scale. Recommended mapping methodologies for this scale, call for  drafting at 1:250,000-scale using a linear vertex spacing of 500 m. We are examining the timing relationships among unit outcrops and features through mapping (i.e., unit contacts, marker beds, and unconformities) and crater densities. For the latter, we are using CraterTools [7], a GIS add-on, to count craters on discrete geologic materials,  and CraterStats [8] to plot ages [e.g., 9]. We used LayerTools [10] to investigate if we could accurately measure bedding orientations of the interior layered deposits (ILD). Datasets: The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) Context Camera (CTX) mosaic provides ~95% coverage over the map area, with 99% coverage within the troughs, at 6 m/pix. The Mars Express High-Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) provides both visible-range at 12.5 - 25 m/pix and topography at 50 m/pix. Mars Odyssey THEMIS daytime and nighttime infrared controlled mosaics [11] provide details at 100 m/pix and will aid in determining material variation based on thermal differences. In addition, we also utilize Mars Global Surveyor MOLA data (460 m/pix), MRO HiRISE images (≥25 cm/pix), where supportive, and OMEGA and CRISM hyperspectral data, where applicable.  Figure 1: MOLA shaded relief (463 m/pix) overlying THEMIS daytime infrared mosaic (100 m/pix) of the mapping region (0° to 15°S,  -80° to -65°E) with nomenclature.  CVM Mapping results: We have identified eight categories of material units based on their typical geographical settings, geomorphic expressions, and geologic origins. Categories are made up of multiple map units, subdivided by additional morphology criteria, and by relative age. In addition, we are documenting further temporal relationships within units, including wall rock terraces and individual mass wasting lobes within overlapping sequences. Temporal inferences can be made based on (a) crosscutting relationships among outcrops of the same unit separated by internal contacts and structures and on (b) dating of temporally related features such as landslide alcove development.  The unit groups consist of (1) surficial materials including low-albedo mantles, sand sheets, transverse aeolian ridge fields, and dunes; (2) crater and ejecta materials; (3) mass wasting typically proximal to canyon walls with geomorphology categorized using a terrestrial scheme [11]; (4) catena materials, including a floor and a wall unit, including incipient collapse features; (5) chasma floor materials consisting of ridged, smooth, rugged materials, terraceforming blocks, flood deposits, and cavi exposures of 1981.pdf

subsurface materials; (6) interior layered deposits within VM troughs that include cap rock, and massive or poorly lineated underlying units, to be further subdivided where possible; (7) wall deposits consisting of a gullied, smooth, and coarser-grained unit; and (8) plateau materials made up of three widespread plateau units, three fluvial terrace units, flow materials, and a highland massif unit. We have divided the mass wasting materials into subgroups based on their geomorphology using the terrestrial classification scheme in [12]. We identified the following groups (subgroups in parentheses) in descending order of frequency: flows (debris, "earth", and solifluction), slides (rock planer, multiple rotation, single rotation, debris, translational debris, and successive rotational), falls (rock, "earth", and debris), spreads (debris and rock), and topples.  In addition, we are mapping linear features where useful in reconstructing the geologic history. These features include unit contacts with certain, approximate, buried, and internal younger/older relationship types. Tectonic features include inferred grabens, normal faults, and contractional wrinkle ridges. Some ridges are differentiated as sinuous (possible inverted fluvial features), curvilinear on landslides, and erosional geomorphologies (yardangs and massifs). Scarps are mapped at collapse margins, landslide heads and toes, and flow margins.  The tectonic feature mapping shows 5 generations of graben development preserved on the plateau and within the canyon walls: (1) oriented roughly NNESSW, mostly confined to Sinai Dorsa, surrounding an ancient caldera; (2) circumferential to the alcoves in southern Melas Chasma, possibly key to expansion of these alcoves; (3) oriented roughly NNE- SSW, paralleling most of the wrinkle ridges, located in Thaumasia and Lunae Plana, and in the Tithoniae Catenae region; (4) oriented WNW-ESE and paralleling and bounding the chasmata throughout the region, prevalent on Ophir Planum, and may be responsible for canyon widening; and (5) isolated to Ophir Planum are curvilinear faults expressions that may be reactivations of older structures. Channels and rilles are also differentiated to show the influence of volcanic and fluvial processes in the development of CVM. Finally, we mapped crater rim crests and buried crater features larger than 5 km. Crater Statistics: We have detailed crater counts on a selection of mass wasting units located in eastern Ius (1 age) and northern Melas Chasmata (3 ages), and on Ophir Planum (4 ages) and Coprates Labes (1 unit). These ages (Table 1) are younger than those reported in [13] by at least half. These data indicate that trough expansion through mass wasting processes have been important in the very recent past. For these counts, we used CTX data which should have similar resolutions to the Mars Orbiter Camera used in [13], but with greater areal coverage.  Table 1: Ages from current and previously published work.  Detailed crater counts on the plateau units indicate Thaumasia and Lunae to have similar primary emplacement ages (~3.75-3.6Ga)  with Ophir indicating a wider range of emplacement (~4.0-3.4Ga). The older age in Ophir Planum is associated with an interpreted ancient volcanic edifice and the younger age is associated with the faulted plateau units. Two resurfacing periods are indicated by the crater statistics. The first is 2.7 Ga, 2.8-2.2 Ga, and 1.9 Ga and the second is geologically recent at 1.0 Ga, 0.6-0.2 Ga, and 1.3-1.0 Ga in Thaumasia, Ophir, and Lunae Plana, respectively.  Interior Layered Deposits: In an effort to subdivide the ILD in CVM, we used HRSC stereo and the CTX mosaic to determine bedding orientations using the LayerTools [10]. We tested whether the lower resolution, but areally extensive HRSC would garner similar results to bedding orientations on HiRISEderived DTMs. We compared our results to [14], and found agreement in both the magnitude of dips and the dip directions. All of our measured dip magnitudes were within the range of the slope values in the measurement areas. We have determined this to be an unreliable method of gathering the bedding orientations, and subdividing the ILD based on interpretations of these measurements. We are now using morphologic variations in bedding, erosional character, and incorporating CRISM mineralogic data.  References: [1] Lucchitta B.K. et al. (1992) in Kieffer H.H. et al. (eds.) Mars, U.
