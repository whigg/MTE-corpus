 A COMMUNITY ARCHIVE OF THRESHOLD (MINIMUM) WIND SPEED DATA FROM WIND TUNNEL EXPERIMENTS: INITIATION OF AN AEOLIAN DATA ARCHIVE   D. M. Burr 1 (dburr1@utk.edu), E. V. Nield 1 , and L. D. V. Neakrase 2. 1 University of Tennessee Knoxville, 2 NASA PDS Atmospheres Node, New Mexico State University.  Introduction:  Aeolian processes are wide-spread in the Solar System.  Movement of sediment by gas flow- whether atmospheric, exospheric, or episodic  - has been documented on Earth, Mars, Venus, Triton, Titan, Enceladus, and comets [e.g., 1-8].  Thus, data on aeolian processes are critical for understanding sediment behavior throughout the Solar System [3, 9].   Such data are commonly derived from wind tunnel experiments under various conditions [1, 3].  Beginning with the ground-breaking work of Bagnold [1], wind tunnel experiments have a long history of providing critical data for describing aeolian sediment transport.  A review of planetary wind tunnel use illustrates their importance in parameterizing aeolian processes, for example, the threshold (minimum) wind speeds necessary to move particles [10].  Although threshold wind speeds on other planetary bodies - first on Mars, then on Venus - were not originally modeled correctly, the simulation of these extraterrestrial conditions in planetary wind tunnels enabled the development of improved models [see summary in 10].  This sequence of events is now being repeated for understanding threshold wind speeds for Titan [10, 11]. Having a record of experimental data enables this interative development and improvement of aeolian models.  However, decades-old wind tunnel data are becoming unusable or inaccessible due to their (analog) publication formats.  At the same time, new data are not widely distributed because no unified archive exists to store them and provide community access.   Goal of this work:  The goal of this work is to facilitate the development of improved models for aeolian processes through creation of a systematic, centralized, and searchable archive of old, new, and future wind tunnel data.  This archive, to be hosted at the Plaentary Data Systems (PDS) Atmospheres Node (http://pds-atmospheres.nmsu.edu/pds4_comp.html), will provide a reference database on which to advance our understanding of aeolian processes under widely varying boundary conditions.  We are currently focusing this archive on threshold wind speed data, but with community input hope to expand it to other processes. Methodology: Our complete approach to accomplish this goal includes three sequential steps: 1) increase the amount and usability of threshold wind speed data collected under a range of conditions, 2) use those data to rederive threshold wind speed model parameters, and 3) make these data broadly available via a searchable on-line archive.  This abstract reports on the first and third of these three steps, namely, collecting previously published data for incorporation into a PDS threshold wind speed archive.  Progress on the second step is reported in a companion abstract [12].  Data Collection: In collecting threshold wind speed data, we use two primary sources.  The first data source is records published in books or peer-reviewed journals. The journals draw from the physics and geology/aeolian literature for experiments performed under both terrestrial and planetary conditions (Table 1).  The second data source is unpublished records.  We have such records from the NASA Ames Research Center Planetary Aeolian Laboratory, including threshold data from the Mars Surface Wind Tunnel, Venus Wind Tunnel, and Carousel Wind Tunnel (1975 to present).  In addition, we seek data from other potential respositories [e.g., the Aarhus Mars Simulation Facility; 13].   For each individual record, whether published or unpublished, we collect data through several steps.  Publication information and experimental boundary conditions are transcribed, along with information about the wind tunnels and the sediments used in the experiments.  Relevant plots and tables are scanned and digitized; we are using GetData Graph Digitizer (http://www.getdata-graph-digitizer.com/index.php) for this purpose.  Model parameters derived from these experimental data are also transcribed.  Lastly, any images or videos of the experimental set-up or aeolian processes are scanned and included.  Archive creation:  These collected data are compiled into spreadsheets, for archiving under the most recent PDS standard, PDS4. PDS4 format is an XML digitally-based system where products are registered so they are searchable throughout the PDS. PDS4 supports video archiving and a more flexible system for delivering data so that individual bundles can be built to best serve the needs of the community.  These characteristics make the PDS4 a user-friendly digital environment for accessing wind tunnel data.  Both metadata and the collected wind tunnel data, in the form of tables, plots, and images, including stacked arrays of images taken from video, can be made available.   Future work:.  While this initial work focused on threshold data derived from wind tunnel experiments, we hope to expand our data collection to include 1) other types of data (e.g., saltation trajectories), and 2) other sources (e.g., field or model) data.  The PDS4 provides a new and improved opportunity to store and provide aeolian data to the community, analysis of  http://pds-atmospheres.nmsu.edu/pds4_comp.html http://www.getdata-graph-digitizer.com/index.php which will improve our understanding of the wind range of aeolian proceses in the Solar System.  We welcome any input on this archive and the provision of data (published or unpublished) or suggestions of data sources to explore.
