Introduction: We report the first 40Ar/39Ar ages of the paired nakhlites Miller Range (MIL) 090030, 090032 and 090136 [1, 2], hereafter MIL 30, 32, and 136. Nakhlites are cumulate Martian meteorites consisting of clinopyroxene (magnesian augite, Fs22Wo43Fs49Wo34 for MIL 30, 32, and 136, [3]), olivine (Fa57Fa89, [3]) and mesostasis enriched in incompatible elements of plagioclase and alkali feldspars, Fe-Ti oxides, silicic/basaltic glass, and quench olivine [e.g., 4]. Unlike shergottites, the nakhlites have given 40Ar/39Ar ages that agree closely with those obtained using other radiometric techniques and in particular Sm/Nd (Figure 1) [e.g., 5, 6, 7]. Also, nakhlites are known to contain iddingsite, which is a secondary product of the alteration of olivine [6, 8].  Experimental methods: Samples. The MIL samples were generously allocated by the Meteorite Working Group. We gently crushed and hand-picked mesostasis  from MIL 30 and MIL 136. Fifteen samples were prepared for Ar analysis: 7 from MIL 30 (mesostasis; 24 to 482 µg); 7 from MIL 136 (mesostasis; 11-285 µg) and 1 from MIL 32 (bulk; 165 µg).  Ar analysis: The samples were loaded in an Al-well plate, sealed in an evacuated quartz tube, and irradiated for 80 hours without Cd shielding at the USGS TRIGA reactor in Denver. Samples were heated with a CO2 laser and the argon isotopes released were analyzed using a modified MAP 215-50 mass spectrometer [10, 11]. Results: Plateau 40Ar/39Ar ages (T). Among 15 nakhlite release spectra, 5 show plateaus (successive ΔT<1-σ for >50% of 39Ar release) (Table 1); 7 show "forced plateaus" (3 successive steps with ΔT<1-σ), and 3 are disturbed. 10 of the 12 plateau ages are in the narrow range of 1311 Ma to 1365 Ma, and are identical within errors to the crystallization age determined by Sm/Nd chronometry (Figure 1). Two samples have younger plateau ages: 738 ± 33 Ma (MIL30, id:2162201) and 1180 ± 250 Ma (MIL136, Id: 21625-03). EDS and XRF analyses of selected material (Figure 2) confirmed the identity of the mesostasis and gave K concentrations from 0.057 to 3.2 wt%. Integrated 40Ar/39Ar ages (total fusion ages). With two exceptions, the integrated ages fall within the wider range known for typical nakhlites of ~1.3-1.4 Ga (Table 1). Isochron ages. Isochron ages of MIL 30 without corrections for cosmogenic 36Ar are similar to the integrated ages, while those of MIL 136 and 32 are a bit older. The average isochron ages for MIL 30, 32, and 136 are 1373 ± 4 Ma, 1404 ± 9 Ma, and 1492 ± 4 Ma, respectively.  Discussion: Pairings. MIL 30, 32 and 136 were paired based on find location, mineralogy, and petrography [1, 2]. Identical 40Ar/39Ar ages support this pairing.  Release patterns. Figure 3 compares some release patterns for MIL 090xxx with one for the paired nakhlite MIL 03346 [9]. The integrated 40Ar/39Ar ages of MIL 03346 are 1272 ± 105 Ma (whole rock), 1413 ± 88 Ma (plagioclase) and 1404 ± 182 Ma (pyroxene). The step ages of MIL 03346 decrease steadily, from ~1.52 Ga down to <1.28 Ga [9]. The plateau ages are 1368 ± 83 Ma (Plagioclase, [9]) and 1334 ± 54 Ma Figure 1. 40Ar/39Ar and Sm/Nd ages of Martian nakhlites and MIL 090030, MIL090032, 090136. (References are in [7] and this work).

The release pattern of MIL 03346 [9] is similar to that of MIL 32 (bulk), which supports the pairing. Overall, the ages obtained for these four MIL nakhlites are remarkably consistent.  Young 40Ar/39Ar ages (Iddingsites?). One sample of MIL 30 mesostasis (21622-01) with an age of 738 Ma (Figure 1 & 3) is younger by far than the others. Nakhlites are known to contain iddingsites, which are products of the aqueous alteration of olivine. Iddingsite could have escaped notice during the EDX analyses. K-Ar ages from zero to 670 ± 91 Ma have been reported for iddingsites from Lafayette [9]. Rb-Sr ages of 0.65 ± 0.08 Ga and 1.30±0.02 Ga were reported for the nakhlite Yamato 000593 [12]. The former age was obtained for brownish alteration products (presumably iddingsite) sampled as two olivine leachates. It is consistent with our result for MIL 30 (21622-01).The latter Rb-Sr age refers to major minerals [12] and is consistent with most of the other ages. An average age of 633±23 Ma was suggested for iddingsite formation age from K-Ar and Rb-Sr methods [6]. Our 40Ar-39Ar age for 21622-01 is analytically robust and likely gives the time of aqueous alteration and iddingsite formation in MIL 30. Some release patterns also show evidence of intermediate ages of ~1180 Ma (e.g., MIL 136), which could result from mixing of radiogenic 40Ar released both from secondary and primary minerals.  Conclusions: We conclude that MIL 30, like other nakhlites, crystallized ~ 1.3-1.4 Ga ago. Later it experienced an aqueous alteration event on Mars that produced iddingsite. Our new 40Ar/39Ar results set a robust limit of 0.6 to 0.7 Ga B.P. for the time of the alteration.  References: [1] McKay and Schwandt, 2005, LPSC 36,#2351. [2] Corrigan C.
