Introduction: Remote spectral study of lunar surface based on measurements from Chandrayaan-1 Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) instrument has revealed widespread hydration in the lunar surface, strength of which increase towards the cooler higher latitudes, thereby implying that the Moon is not completely anhydrous [1-3]. Remote observations and direct impact experiments also discovered the presence of water and water-ice in the permanently shadowed regions (PSRs) of lunar poles [4, 5]. Moreover, in-situ measurements of lunar melt inclusions and lunar apatites revealed some parts of the deep lunar interior to be hydrated [6-8]. Recent discovery of enhanced hydration associated with endogenic water from Compton Belkovich Volcanic Complex (CBVC) [9, 10] and central peaks of Bullialdus [11], Theophilus [12] and Jackson [13] craters hint towards the presence of a hydrous lunar mantle. Also, [14] has reported the detection of magmatic water in association with olivine of possible mantle origin from the inner ring of Sinus Iridium recently. Here we report the detection of water/hydroxyl of possible magmatic origin along the inner flanks of crater Proclus in association with crystalline plagioclase-bearing PAN rocks, olivine-bearing dunitic/troctolitic lithologies and low-Ca pyroxene-bearing noritic rocks.  Geological setting: Proclus is a 28-km diameter crater (26.4°E, 11.4°S) situated on the northwestern rim of Crisium basin in the near side of the Moon. The rays from Proclus crater can be distinctly seen and rays from other craters are mostly overlain by Proclus ejecta. This Copernican crater is characterized by a diverse mienralogy as described by [15] exposed along the steep inner flanks, which could be attributed to the complex geologic setting being situated on the north-western edge of Crisium basin.  Data used: Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) data from Chandrayaan-1, having 85 spectral channels spanning over 460-3000 nm at a spatial resolution of ~140 m [16], have been utilized that are photometrically and thermally corrected [17]. We have also used the 12.6 cm-wavelength Mini-RF data obtained from the LRO (zoom mode, 15×30 m resolution)  to examine the relationship between physical characteristics and compositional diversity of the Proclus crater region. Radar can penetrate to a depth of about 10-times the wavelength and is sensitive to blocks that are one-tenth to 10 times the wavelength collected.  Results and discussions: Figure 1 shows the IBDAlbedo based FCC of the study area clearly depicting the first-order mineralogical diversity that exist in the studied region. Spectral analysis of the central and eastern part of the inner flank region reveals the association of OH/H2O absorption features with crystalline plagioclasebearing PAN lithology, olivine-rich dunitic exposures and also with olivine-crystalline plagioclase-bearing troctolitic lithologies and low-Ca pyroxene-bearing noritic lithologies. Interestingly, the eastern, northern and southern inner flanks exhibit a strong OH/H2O feature near 2800-3000 nm. The features are sharp, narrow and consistent with that of the hydration features associated with nominally anhydrous minerals as observed by  [11]. Also, the hydration feature is found to be localized along the southwestern, southeastern, northern, northeastern and eastern inner flanks of the crater, whereas the western flank does not show such enhanced hydration feature. The equatorial location and localized nature of the hydration feature possibly suggest a magmatic/endogenic source.    Fig. 1. IBD-FCC of crater Proclus.

 Fig. 2. Locations of the ROIs within the Proclus crater and their corresponding mean spectra. A strong OH/H2O feature is seen in association with olivine- (green spectra), crystalline plagioclase- (red spectra) and low-Ca pyroxene spectra (blue). Black vertical line indicates the position of the OH/H2O feature near 2800 nm. Spectra of olivine (maroon), crystalline plagioclase (sea green) and norite and/or troctolite (magenta) exposed along the western inner flank of crater Prolcus do not show any hydration feature.   Among the more readily apparent features in Mini-RF Sband circular polarization data (CPR) image are the radar-bright features associated with impact structures and the presence of coherent bodies of impact melt towards the northeast and northwest region of the crater. These impact melt deposits typically have CPR values up to and exceeding unity, making them relatively easy to distinguish from the background terrain. We have generated an m-chi decomposition image of the Proclus crater region (Fig. 3) to understand the dominant scattering mechanism near the hydration features observed from the M3 data as discussed above. While the pink regions in the IBD FCC (Fig.1) are observed to have randomlypolarized backscatter constituents in Fig.3, we observe portions of surface covered by orange in Fig. 1 that shows a mixture of Bragg scattering and volumetric backscatter which is somewhat surprising. This is not expected for inner flank material of the crater and is instead more indicative of the surrounding mature lunar regolith.   Fig. 3. An m-chi decomposition image of the Proclus crater region generated from the Mini-RF data. Here, Blue indicates single-bounce (and Bragg) backscattering, Red corresponds to double-bounce, and Green represents the randomly polarized constituent. Future work: Future work will include quantifying mean CPR values for melts and ejecta at Proclus crater region relative to background values. Additionally, employing more band depth and integrated band depth RGB color composites with the M3 data sets will help us to further discern the composition of these melts and if certain compositions can be related to physical property variations seen in the images obtained at radar and optical wavelengths.
