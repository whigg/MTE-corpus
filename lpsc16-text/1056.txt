Introduction:  Pentlandite in ordinary chondrites has a variable chemical composition, and its compositional variation is tied to many factors. In this study, we discovered the chemical composition properties of pentlandite from different ordinary chondrites. Materials and Methods:  We studied pentlandite in the samples of six ordinary chondrites that fell in the Urals: Ural (H5-6), Kunashak (L6), Ozernoe (L5), Severny Kolchim (H3), Kargapole (H4), and Chelyabinsk (LL5). The chemical composition of pentlandite and the backscattered electron images were defined by the electron microprobe Cameca SX 100 (IGG UB RAS). Results:  In a matrix of the meteorite, Ural- zoned troilite grains were observed [6]; inside its margin, the nickel and cobalt content value were approximately 13.6 wt.% and 1.1 wt.%, respectively. Pentlandite occurs in the margin of troilite individual grain and grain aggregations. In the Kunashak meteorite, pentlandite forms two classes of grains [3]. The first grain class is cubic inclusion in troilite with a 10-15 μm size (Figure 1), which has high copper content values (up to 5,1 wt.% - see Table 1). The second class of pentlandite grain is individual grains in a chondrite matrix, which have a size of up to 50 μm and less copper content (Table 1). The Ozernoe meteorite consists of two fragments that were found in 1983 and 1985, respectively. Dr. Loginov believed that the fragments differed from each  Fig. 1.

In a matrix of the Ozernoe meteorite, troilite formed individual grains, and the grain accumulation was up to 0.2-0.3 mm size. There was an increase in nickel content values (up to 3.2 wt.%) at the margins of troilite grains, and pentlandite appears at the rims and in the grains. In matrix of the Severny Kolchim meteorite, pentlandite appears together with troilite. The pentlandite has formed thin rims of 3-5 μm thickness in the margin of the large troilite grains. In the Kargapole meteorite, pentlandite appears together with troilite. In the margin of the troilite grains, we see nickel content values of up to 8-9 wt.%; here, pentlandite is forming grain accumulation and thin margins around the troilite grains. In the matrix of the Chelyabinsk meteorite (in nonimpact samples), troilite and metals are segregated in grain congestion and veins, which are separated from each other by chondrules and matrix areas containing no metal or sulfides. Some troilite grains consist of po- Table 1.

Pentlandite has formed individual grains of up to 20-25 μm in size, and there is an intergrowth of pentlandite and troilite. Discussion:  After comparing the composition of pentlandite from studied ordinary chondrites, as well as the composition of pentlandite in contrast to that of other ordinary chondrites, of the articles [2, 4, 8-9], it becomes obvious that, in pentlandite, the Ni content values decrease in the series H - L - LL chondrites. Also, the Ni/Fe ratio decreases in the direction from three to five to six petrological types within each group of ordinary chondrites (Figure 2). The pattern that we determined seems incomplete, because we do not have composition data for the pentlandite from low metamorphosed chondrites of 3 and 4 petrologic types of the L and LL groups. Pentlandite can be formed in chondrite by different means [1, 10]. Variations of Ni content in pentlandite from a matrix of ordinary chondrite as a function of the group of ordinary chondrite (H, L, LL); in other words, chondrite bulk composition, and in petrological type (the temperature and intensity of metamorphic alterations) shows the formation of chondrite that occurred was in equilibrium with troilite and metal during the conversion of the Fe-Ni-S system via the recrystallization of the chondrite matrix. As seen in the diagram Ni versus Cu (Figure 3), pentlandite from H-chondrites formed a detached field because of having a high Ni content and a low Cu content. Points of pentlandite of L and LL chondrites formed the unified field and were characterized by a lower Ni content and a higher Cu content. This pattern  Fig. 2. Ni versus Fe by pentlandite in ordinary chondrites. was only revealed by pentlandite from six studied samples only. We did not find published data about the Cu content values in ordinary chondrites. Although the copper content in pentlandite sometimes achieves high percentages, in practice, the definition of its contents is rare. In the Kunashak meteorite, the copper content of the pentlandite varies significantly among different morphological varieties of grains. Pentlandite inclusion grains contain more Cu than do individual pentlandite grains. This is likely due to the fact that, in metal-troilite-pentlandite systems, pentlandite concentrates the copper, and a redistribution copper to pentlandite by local diffusion in the troilite grains occurs during the slow cooling of a system. Thus, the diffusion contribution has a greater effect on variations in the copper content of pentlandite than the composition and degree of metamorphic alterations of ordinary chondrites.
