Since that time,the variations have been studied to determine the properties of the surface, both in albedo (static or variable)and in composition.The  New  Horizons  flyby  of  Pluto  provides  awealth of information for further  refining our understanding  of  Pluto's  surface[1].   Beyond  the  obviousvalue of increased spatial resolution, the geometries ofthe new data are considerably different from that afforded  an  Earth-vicinity  view  and  significantly  improve  on  our  ability  to  extract  surface  photometricproperties.  These properties are essential for removalof illumination and viewing geometry effects that alsoappear to change the appearance of the surface but inthemselves  are  confusing  when  trying  to  understandother  properties  of  the  surface;  such  as  a  principalcomponent analysis of spectrophotometric data to lookfor compositional variations.We have used a combination of historical measurments of Pluto with the New Horizons data to furtherrefine our understanding of Pluto's surface.  This is avery complicated problem that will take some time tounravel but here we report on initial efforts and someearly results.Method: The surface reflectance theory developedby Hapke is a powerful tool for the study of light reflected from a planetary surface[2].   This underlyingmethodology was used with earlier HST observations[3,4] to derive global photometric properties combinedwith  a  single-scattering  albedo  (w)  map.   The  additional properties needed for a  full description are: h –surface  compaction  parameter,  P(g) –  single  particlescattering phase function,  B0 – backscatter parameter,and  θ –  mean  surface  roughness.   Single-scatteringalbedo is clearly a spatially variable quantity.  The restof the values are often determined as global quantitiesand applied to all terrains.  This approximation is oftenneeded since there is rarely enough information to permit their independent determination along with albedo.For most solid surfaces, treating these other values asglobal has worked reasonably well.  The high degreeof surface variations on Pluto is, however, a warningthat  such  global  treatments  may  work  more  poorlyhere than on other bodies.  Nonetheless, we must startsomewhere in our analysis. From the earlier HST-based work, there were 6 setsof  global  parameters  (h,P(g),B0,θ)  identified[3,4].These sets, labeled A-F, are equally able to match theobserved variation in photometric properties of Pluto'ssurface from the restricted range of phase angle possible from Earth.  The constrained range in this case isfrom 0.36 to 1.74 degrees.  Rather than try to determine an actual function for  P(g), a constant was usedover this phase angle range.For  this  initial  investigation,  we  have  applied  asimple  process  to  the  resolved  New  Horizons  data.Given  a  set  of  global  photometric  parameters,  eachpixel in a New Horizons image that maps onto the surface of Pluto is inverted.  This process takes the observed count rate, converts to absolute flux, then to bidirectional reflectance (r), and finally solving for thesingle-scattering albedo that gives the proper value ofr.  At that point, the illumination and viewing geometry effects inherent in the image have been removed.The image of w is then converted to a normal albedochosen to be at normal illumination and viewing direction but at 1 degree phase angle.   The slight shift inphase  angle  moves us  off  of  the peculiar  reluctanceproperties of particulate surfaces at ultra-low phase angles.   We call  this  normal  albedo  even  though  it  istechnically not.  The important thing is that this rendering  lets  us  see  something  directly  related  to  surfacealbedo without any geometric effects included.To assess the quality of the inversion, a region waschosen in the north polar terrains of Pluto from N55–85 degrees.  This region was extracted from 8 imagesranging  in  time  over  the  6  days  prior  to  close  approach.  The chosen terrain is thus seen to rotate underthe  spacecraft  viewpoint  and  is  always  in  view  butwith differing viewing geometries.   The phase anglerange for these observations is quite limited due to theencounter  geometry and only spans 15.3 to 16.2 degrees.  For this analysis, we thus chose a new value ofP(g)  to  hold  for  this  range  and  is  reduced  from theHST set by a reasonable amount (more on this later).Since the goal of the inversion is to remove illumination and viewing geometry variations, the resultinginversion should give the same result for w on all 8 images and should do so over the entire region of interest.   This  region  on  Pluto  has  far  less  variation  inalbedo than any other region of this size that was seenon Pluto.  Using this method we can then compare thetrend of  r versus the cosine of the emission angle (or2927.pdf

incidence angle) to this same trend for normal albedo.A plot of r will show the ensemble limb-darkening behavior and the normal albedo should be flat.Results: All  six  sets  of  photometric  parameterswere  investigated  along  with  some variations  in  theother  parameters.   Since these data are at a differentphase  angle  than  HST,  a  new  value  of  P(g) wasneeded.  The value chosen was P(g)=1.7 for sets A, B,C, and F;  P(g)=1.5 for set D, and  P(g)=1.9 for set E.These  values  were  based  on  relative  scaling  for  thephase  function  used  for  Triton.   The  training  set  isfrom LORRI monochrome imaging that has better longitude coverage.  Of the six photometric sets, set C isclearly the best with the values  of  h=0.05,  P(g)=1.7,B0=1.0, θ=10.  Note that this is using the formalism aspublished in the 1993 version of Hapke's book [3].These  parameters  are  effective  at  removing  anylimb-darkening effects for illumination and viewing directions within 78 degrees of the surface normal.  Atthe highest angles from vertical, the inversion does notwork  as  well.   Part  of  this  problem is  due  to  localslopes being a more important correction nearer to thelimb.  We avoid this problem by excluding these regions from the training set.We investigated the sensitivity of  all  photometricparameters on this inversion process by perturbing oneparameter at a time.  For h, P(g), and B0 the result is tochange  the  single-scattering  albedos  independent  ofviewing geometry within a give set, though each sethas its own limb-darkening behavior.  The mean-surface  slope  value  does  significantly  affect  the  limbdarkening and a range from 5-30 degrees was investigated.   The previously adopted  value  of  10  degreeswas the best value, despite the fact that the prior HSTmaps provided essentially no constraint on this quantity and the value was adopted from a similar type ofanalysis for Triton.Using  the  best  set  (C),  we  then  converted  theMVIC  PCOLOR_2  data  to  w,  then  normal  albedo.This gives us four distinct colors to compare and combine.  All four MVIC filters (BLUE, RED, NIR, andCH4) reveal distinct surface properties.  This much isalready evident from false-color images but these dataproducts  now  allow  a  more  quantitative  approach.This work is still on going but there are a few trendsthat are emerging.Not  surprisingly,  the  darkest  near-equatorial  regions (eg., Cthulu Regio) are well separated in albedo,color as well as in color ratios.  Note that all featurenames in this discussion are still informal.  The darkunit is also very tightly clustered in albedo space compared to all other regions.When viewed relative  to the RED filter  data,  allother  colors  show  a  weak  mixing  line  between  thedarkest and brightest end-members.  However, most ofthe terrain is most likely to be at the ends of the rangeand the intermediate cases  are  very much less  common.  Additionally,  the mixing line between the twoend members is never seen to fall on a strictly lineartrend.In the monochrome LORRI data and MVIC NIRand CH4, the most reflective regions are the southernend of Sputnik Planum and the most neutrally coloredportions of the north polar terrains.  In the BLUE andRED MVIC filters the brightest north polar terrain isslightly less reflective than southern Sputnik Planum.The most  neutrally  colored  regions  appear  to be theeast side of Tombaugh Regio.References: [1] Stern, S.
