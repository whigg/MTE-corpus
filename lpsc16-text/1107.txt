Hyperspectral micro-imaging  in the Visible-Infrared range of enstatite chondrite: preliminary investigation on thin section of Sahara 97072P.Manzari1, S.De Angelis1,  M.C.De Sanctis1,  Space Astrophysics and Planetology Institute - INAF-IAPS, via Fosso del Cavaliere, 100 – 00133, Rome (Italy)(paola.manzari@iaps.inaf.it) Introduction. The analyses  of the  minute quantities ofmeteorites  and  the  samples  returned  from  next  spacemissions makes it vital to develop non-invasive or semiinvasive  diagnostic  research  methods  to  study  thesematerials.  The reasons stand not only in the preservationof sample of extraterrestrail material, but also for openingthe possibilities to investigate the same sample by newtechnologies  developed  in  time  for  comparing  andinterpreting old data at the light of new data. The present study focused on the spectral analyses of anenstatite  chondrite  EH3,  Sahara  97072  previouslyinvestigated by [1]. Enstatite chondrites have importantimplications for constraining conditions in the early solarsystem and for understanding the evolution of the Earthand  other  inner  planets.  They  are  among  the  mostreduced  solar  system  materials  as  reflected  in  theirmineral compositions and assemblages.  In fact, they arecharacterized  by  a  highly  reduced  mineralogy  that  isdominated  by  nearly  pure  enstatite,  with  lesser  Fe‐Nimetal  (kamacite)  and Fe sulfide  (troilite).   It  has  beensuggested  that  Mg and Ca sulﬁdes could contribute  toMercury’s low reﬂectance, given the high abundance ofsulfur  and apparent correlations among S, Mg, and Ca(Nittler et al. 2011; Weider et al.2012). Given  the lack ofmeteorites that sample of the surface of Mercury, spectralstudies  of  meteorites  with reduced  mineral  assemblagelike EC could be useful  for interpreting Mercury remotesensed data.  The objective of this study focused on  thecapability  of  the  Spectral  Imaging  (SPIM)  facility  atINAF-IAPS,  Rome [2,3]  to  perform  spectral  analysis(range 0.4-5 micron) on thin section. Instrument setup. The imaging spectrometer installed inSPIM is a spare of the spectrometer on Dawn spacecraft[4]. It works in the 0.22-5.05 μm spectral range, with aspatial  resolution  of  38x38  μm  on  the  target.  Twobidimensional  focal  plane  arrays,  one  for  the  visiblebetween 0.22 and 1.05 μm (spectral resolution of 2 nm)and one for the IR between 0.95 and 5.05 μm (spectralresolution  of  12  nm)  allow  to  obtaining  the  spectralcoverage. Thanks to the alignment of the bidimensionalfocal  planes  with the spectrometer'  slit  axis  (the slit  is9x0.038 mm in size), it is possible to acquire the target’simage of 0.038x9 mm at different wavelengths.  Hyperspectral  cubes are built up observing the target  movingon  a  scanning  sample  holder.  Two  lamps  provide  thelight  sources  for  the VIS  channel  (120 W) and the IRchannel (108 W). The illuminating system supports twodistinct  optical  fibres  for  the  VIS  and IR  channel;  theillumination  and  emission  angles  are  30°  and  0°  withrespect to the normal to the sample surface, respectively.Sample  description. As  a  preliminary  test  we  collectdata on an small area near the edge of the sample (fig.1).Previously  investigations  by  optical  microscopy  andscanning  electron  microscopy  (fig.  2-3)  on  this  thinsection  showed  a  composition  dominated  by  radialpyroxene,  porphyritic  pyroxene  and  porphyriticpyroxene-olivine chondrules within the kamacite-sulfidematrix.  Minor  phases  occurr  like  trolite,  oldhamite,niningerite,  schereibersite  (Manzari,  PhD  thesis,  2010)within the matrix and the chondrules. The  pyroxene isalways enstatitic and  the olivine is forsteritic.Fig.1.  RGB  image  acquired  with  SPIM  on  the  thin  section(R:0.70 m, G:0.53 m, B:0.44 m).Analysis and results.  Data were collected on a regionthat comprehend fusion crust of this meteorite to samplealso  alteration  minerals.  Since  the  minerals  moreabundant  in  enstatite  chondrites  show  theircharacteristical  absorptions  in  the  visible-near  infraredrange, only this range is showed. This area is dominatedby  a  big  olivine-pyroxene  chondrule,  named  S2AC1,hosting  troilite,  niningerite  and  a  metal-sulfide  matrix.The  spectral  analysis  of  the  thin  section  showedoccurrences  of  four  spectral  classes:  enstatite  (fig.1),forsterite  (fig.2),  sulfides  (fig.3),  but  also  oxides  andhydro-oxides (fig.4).In all the spectra occurr  1.9  m feature related to watercontent  in  the  sample.  Furthemore,  iron  oxides  andhydro-oxides strongly affect the resulting spectra of thesedifferent mineralogical phases. Fig.2.  Spectrum  of  chondrule  rim  grain  (x141y23).  The500 m1107.pdf

composition  of  chondrule  rim  is  enstatite.  The  spectrum  isdominated by features near 1  m and 2m typical of that ofenstatite. Data in  1.4 and 2.5 m regions have been removedbecause of overlapping with instrumental artifacts.Fig.3.  Backscattered  electron  image  of  S2AC1  chondruleshowing sulfide phases in chondrule core.Fig.4.   Pixel spectrum of olivine (x109y37).  The spectrum isdominated by features near 1  m. The other spectral featuresare  related  to  water  absorption.  Data  in   1.4  and  2.5  mregions  have  been  removed  because  of  overlapping  withinstrumental artifacts.Other pixels, such as x154y17 in fig.5 showed almost featurlessprofiles with an exception related to a strong absorption near0.65m that could correspond to the occurrence of niningeritegrains  (fig.3)  [5].  Among  the  sulfides,  totally  featurlessspectra were found that are related to troilite occurrence.Fig.5. Pixel spectrum of sulfide grain (x109y37), probably MgS[5].

The preliminary resultsof  this  investigation  demonstrate  that  capability  of  theSPIM facility to act as a spectral microscope, that in turnsmeans  an  easier  comparison  with  other  analyticalmethods. Further investigations are on going on areas farfrom the fusion crust of this chondrite for a more closeridentification of the different sulfides that occur in thischondrite.References.  [1]  P.
