Introduction: Differences in interpretation of radiometric ages for lunar rocks and impact melts, and debates about the meaning of different age components in meteorites, limit our ability to confidently characterize the impact history of the inner solar system. Implementing new, more thermally-sensitive radiometric systems will provide a better means to document the timing and extent of the early bombardment flux, and lead to more comprehensive geochronological data sets to underpin dynamical models for its origin and evolution (e.g., [1]). Our research on lunar impact-melt breccia samples integrates existing U-Pb zircon ages of pre-impact lunar crust with new low-temperature zircon (U-Th)/He (ZHe) thermochronometry from the same grains. Produced during the decay of U and Th, 4He, closes to diffusion from zircon at temperatures between ~220 and <100°C depending on accumulated radiation damage to the crystal structure [2]. As such, the ZHe method is sensitive to both peak temperature and rate of cooling during and following impact events, with more damaged grains susceptible to He loss during lower temperature thermal events. This combined approach (U-Pb and ZHe) yields a record of multiple impact events of differing energy within a single sample. Background: Breccia sample 14311 was collected close to Flank Crater at Apollo 14 station Dg [3]. This crater sits within the edge of the continuous ejecta blanket of the larger Cone Crater [4], which formed at ca. 26 Ma [5]. It is unclear if 14311 came from within or outside of this ejecta blanket.  Breccias in the vicinity of the Apollo 14 landing site were interpreted to represent heterogeneous ejecta (referred to as the Fra Mauro formation; [3]) related to formation of the Imbrium basin at ca. 3.95 Ga (e.g., [6]). Within this framework, the breccia samples may represent different depths into the Fra Mauro formation, excavated by Cone Crater, each of which experienced different cooling (and annealing) histories [7]. Alternatively [8, 4, 9], the crystalline-matrix breccias collected further from the Cone crater could represent a different, deeper and older (pre-Imbrium) unit. Either interpretation allows for older material from this location to be mixed with Imbrium ejecta when the Fra Mauro was created. Target sample: Sample 14311 is a clast-dominated (melt-poor), polymict impact melt breccia interpreted to be a mix of pre-Imbrium crust and Imbrium impact melt [10]. It is composed of pyroxene, plagioclase, and Fe-Ti oxides, and contains 5-25% mineral and lithic clasts composed of igneous rocks and older breccia generations [10, 3, 11]. The sample has an “equant texture” (lacks glass, while silicate and oxides form a mosaic pattern), which was interpreted to result from solid state recrystallization of ejecta material at temperatures of up to and exceeding 1000°C [8]. Exposure ages of sample 14311 were estimated to be between ca. 530 Ma (40Ar-39Ar; [9]) and 661 Ma (81Kr-Kr; [12]); this is older than most other breccias sampled near Cone Crater (ca. 25-35 Ma; [9, 12]). Sample 14311 may be from another part of the Fra Mauro formation, or transported to that location after Fra Mauro formation deposition. Approach: Zircon grains used for (U-Th)/He thermochronometry were chosen from grain mounts of Apollo 14 breccia samples 14311,20, 14311,50 and 14311,60 previously documented by ion microprobe for U-Pb, Ti and REEs [13]. These zircon grains define three U-Pb age populations: 1) 4334 ± 10 Ma, representing igneous zircon from primary lunar crust; 2) 4245 ± 10 Ma, interpreted from REE data to represent a mixture of inherited and melt-generated products, probably impact-related; and 3) 3953 ± 10 Ma, from grains with clear impact damage where ages are interpreted to reflect near- to complete resetting of U-Pb isotopic systems during a major impact event (e.g., Imbrium). The U-Pb ages thus provide a context of maximum ages for any dates calculated from ZHe analyses.  Analytical methods: Prior to He analysis, zircon grains were imaged in grain mounts by optical light microscopy and by scanning electron microscopy. Grain shapes and volumes were determined by highresolution X-ray computed tomography (micro-CT) at the University of Texas (Jackson School of Geosciences) and Colorado School of Mines. X-ray data were processed using the computer program “Blob3D” (v2015; [14]). The polished surfaces of all grains were also analyzed to evaluate degrees of radiation damage with a Horiba LabRAM HR Evolution Raman microscope-spectrometer operated using a 532nm (green) laser and 100x objective at the University of Colorado Raman Microspectroscopy Laboratory.  Zircon grains were then carefully plucked from the epoxy mounts and placed into small Nb packets and analyzed on an ASI Alphachron He extraction and 2244.pdf

measurement line, where degassed 4He is analyzed on a Balzers PrismaPlus QMS 220 quadrupole mass spectrometer. Degassed zircon grains were spiked with a 235U-230Th tracer, dissolved using a multi-step acidvapor dissolution process, diluted with doublydeionized water, and analyzed for U, Th, and Sm content using a Thermo Element 2 magnetic sector ICPMS. All ZHe dates and associated element concentration data were calculated using an iterative approach that is required for ages >1 Ga. Degassed He abundances were corrected for cosmogenic 4He produced by galactic cosmic rays using the maximum 4He production rates from the experiments of Leya et al. [15]. These were typically <1% of radiogenic 4He, but as high as 25% in samples with low measured 4He. All zircon grains were assumed to be grain fragments, therefore no alpha-ejection correction was applied to calculated ZHe dates.  Results: Twenty six zircon grains that were ‘representative’ of each of the three U-Pb age populations and cover the full range of eU concentrations (eU = U + 0.2303*Th = 15-315 ppm) were analyzed. (U-Th)-He thermochronometry. The lunar zircon grains analyzed had degassed He abundances (0.275 - 330 ncc) well above detection limits (<0.001 ncc), even for the most radiation damaged grains analyzed in our sample set. Calculated ZHe dates range from ca. 4250-3500 Ma at low eU (<100 ppm), dropping to younger dates at higher eU (and corresponding higher accumulated radiation damage). The date-eU correlation is typical of that observed in normal terrestrial zircon samples. Importantly, multiple zircon grains preserve He dates close to their U-Pb crystallization ages, and older than the inferred Imbrium impact age of ca. 3.95 Ga. Forward modeling by HeFTy. A series of forward models were performed using the HeFTy software ([16], and the zircon radiation damage model of Guenthner et al. [2]) to calculate the predicted distribution of He dates for a range of zircon U-Th compositions observed in the lunar data set and a number of potential thermal scenarios based in part on known impact events.  When compared with the observed date-eU correlation, model outputs indicate that the preservation of He dates older than ca. 3.95 Ga in zircon grains from the ca. 4.33 Ga and ca. 4.25 Ga U-Pb populations requires: 1) during any impact event at 3.95 Ga, heating of these grains did not exceed ~400°C (for an event involving instantaneous heating followed by cooling to 0°C in ~2 kyrs) or heating to even lower peak temperatures if longer cooling times are considered; or 2) if the rock experienced higher temperatures, cooling rates must have been extremely short (e.g., at peak T=1000°C, cooling to zero in 1 year, ages are completely reset, with partial resetting at 500°C). Conclusions: ZHe thermochronometric results from this study have important implications for the interpretations of the origin of crystalline-matrix breccia sample 14311, and for the utility of lowtemperature thermochronometers in ancient samples.  Preservation of pre-3.95 Ga ZHe dates indicate that temperatures in the vicinity of this sample following deposition in the Fra Mauro formation must have been low (<400°C; correlating with inferred low melt volumes from textures), or that the sample must have been near the surface immediately after deposition to have cooled so rapidly (<<1 yr).  Furthermore, data also show that zircon grains with high-radiation doses and long histories of accumulated radiation damage can retain He over ~4 Gyr timescales and still yield meaningful ZHe dates.
