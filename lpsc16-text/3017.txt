(Jacob.Setera@rutgers.edu).  Introduction: 40Ar/39Ar thermochronology has been a useful tool for deciphering cooling rates of intrusions, thermal resetting events, the timing of exhumation, etc.  The precision of the age results has  been limited by sample size (i.e. low K2O content) and low Ar release from individual steps. By increasing step sizes/gas volumes we demonstrate method that yields precise 40Ar/39Ar  plateau ages and diffusion parameters for small terrestrial and meteorite samples. In addition the method permits simple and reliable step-heating, constant visual inspection of samples during loading and heating (useful for small samples such as meteoritic breccias <100µm), and measurement of background values that are indistinguishable from instrument blanks. Experimental Method: Samples - The terrestrial samples consisted of individual plagioclase grains (~400 mg each) from 3 stratigraphic levels of the Rustenberg Layered Suite (RLS) of the Bushveld Complex, South Africa.  We also report data for a 5.5-µg, high-K feldspar from the martian rock NWA7034 [1]; and a 535-µg sample from a mafic clast in the howardite MAC 02666.  Irradiation and mass spectrometry - Samples and reference standards (Fish Canyon (FC) sanidine (28.201 Ma) and Hb3Gr hornblende (1080 Ma)) were loaded into separate wells drilled in aluminum irradiation disks and irradiated at the US Geological Survey TRIGA reactor for 80 hours. Argon isotopes were analyzed using a Mass Analyzer Products (MAP) 215-50 noble gas mass spectrometer with an ion pulse counting upgrade [2]. Irradiated samples (one or a few grains) were placed in a dimple augured into a high purity (3N8) Ta foil platform. The samples were step-heated to required temperature by focusing a New Wave 45-watt CO2 laser on a spot of the Ta foil adjacent to the sample. Temperatures for Arrhenius plots were measured during step-heating analysis using a Mikron-M780 two-color pyrometer calibrated to ±≤1% against the melting points of Sn, Al, Ag, Cu, and Ag. The two-color pyrometer exploits the constant ratio between the short- and long-wave emissivities of the Ta substrate. This approach allows for visual monitoring of the sample during the step-heating analyses and confirmation of complete fusion. With isotopic and temperature data diffusion parameters and closure temperatures are calculated using the methods and equations of [3-5], assuming an appropriate geometry and cooling rate. Results:  Step-heating of individual plagioclase grains, from 3 different stratigraphic levels of the RLS, yield statistically different plateau ages of 2017.2 Ma to 2044.6 Ma (Fig. 1a). Arrhenius plots for B14-053A and B14-042 (Fig. 2b) yield diffusion parameters (Ea and ln(Do/a2)) that correspond to closure temperatures of  219.0 ± 4.8°C and 246.5 ± 7.9°C respectively. These values are well within the ranges reported for plagioclase separates from the critical zone of the RLS [6]. Figure 2a shows the age spectra for the meteorite samples from NWA 7034 and MAC 02666 which yield plateau ages of 1436.0 ± 8.8 Ma and 3638 ± 28 Ma respectively. Figure 2b shows the Arrhenius plots for the two meteorite samples.  Sample NWA7034 yields an activation energy of 160.6 ± 4.1 kJ/mol and a ln(Do/a2) value of 7.84 ± 0.43 ln(s-1).  These values are close to published values for other feldspars, both K-rich and non Figure 1: A) Step-heating spectra for plagioclase from the RLS.

Sample MAC 02666, a basalt, yields an activation energy of 110.4 ± 2.9 kJ/mol and a ln(Do/a2) value of 2.49 ± 0.34 ln(s-1).  These values match closely to various published values of relatively unshocked chondrites [10]. Discussion:  Bushveld Samples - Several studies have attempted to constrain the thermal history of some portions of the RLS using a combination of U-Pb and ArAr ages [11,12].  Nomade et al. [11] reported Ar-Ar ages in biotite from the UG2 chromitite layer to have a weighted mean plateau age of 2055.2 ±3.2 Ma (recalculated assuming an age of 28.201 Ma for Fish Canyon Sanidine [13]) which suggests a rapid cooling rate of ~1000°C/Ma to the closure temperature of biotite. Cassata et al. [6] measured Ar-Ar ages in plagioclase from a gabbro in the Critical Zone of the RLS and confirmed the prior findings [10] that the RLS cooled rapidly (≤ 3 My) to ~300°C.  Our newly obtained results indicate that the RLS cooled much more slowly at the lower temperature range (<300°C).  In addition, the data indicate that the RLS cooled progressively from the margins (2044.6 Ma) to the center (2017.2 Ma).  The closure temperatures calculated in this study (219.0°C and 246.5°C) show that the assumption of a single Ar closure temperature for plagioclase is not valid and the determination of closure temperatures for each grain is critical to accurately determining the low-T history of the RLS. Meteorite Samples - NWA 7034 meteorite is a polymict breccia of basaltic composition thought to represent the martian regolithic [14]. Given the several distinct lithologies observed within the breccia, a diverse range of ages has been reported for the NWA 7034 meteorite. Ages range from ~4.4 and 1.4 Ga (U-Pb) [15, 16] along with a disturbed Rb-Sr age of 2.1 Ga [14], a SmNd age of 4.4 Ga [17], a Pb-Pb phosphate age of 1.3 Ga [16], a K-Ar age of ~1.6 Ga [18], and a U-Th/He age of ~0.17 Ga [18]. Recently obtained Ar-Ar ages for NWA 7034 show a similar granularity of ages of ~2.1 Ga, ~1.8 Ga, and 1.4 Ga [1]. NWA 7034 has a slightly disturbed step-heating spectra (Fig. 2A) as indicated by the first three steps. This suggests that the sample has experienced a low temperature thermal event. Our best estimate is that this low temperature event occurred < 900 Ma (the age of the second step in Fig. 2A) at a temperture somewhere between the closure tempertures, 214°C at a 1°C/Ma cooling rate to 274°C at a 100°C/Ma cooling rate, and 740°C, the temperture for the second step. In support of this interprataion, [19] report a plateau age of ~800 Ma for the pair meteorite NWA 7533. MAC 02666 has an undisturbed step-heating spectra (Fig. 2A). A closure temperature of 418°C was determined assuming a rapid 100°C/Yr cooling rate, as indicated by the fine grained nature of the balastic clast. From these data, we conclude that MAC 02666 has not experienced any significant heating event since it's cryltalization age. Conclusion:  The method presented here allows for precise age measurements to be made during step-heating analysis while also yielding meaningful diffusion paramters.  This capability is supported by the results included in this study. These samples constitute a wide range of ages and characteristics including terrestrial and meteoritic, high K2O and low K2O, and high to low mass.  References:[1]Lindsay et al.
