Introduction:  CM chondrites are primitive chondritic meteorites that experienced various degrees of aqueous alteration [1-4].  Some evidence exists for preaccretionary aqueous alteration [5], while other evidence would point to alteration occurring primarily within an accreted CM chondrite parent body [6]. Regardless of the location of the aqueous alteration, it is petrographically identified and characterized.  For example, indictors of aqueous alteration in CM chondrites include: hydration of matrix, alteration of chondrule glass, production of and compositional changes within serpentine-tochilinite intergrowths ("PCP" phases), oxidation of metallic Fe-Ni, and alteration of and changes in carbonate mineralogy [1,2,4]. Despite the numerous mineralogical changes, current understanding suggests that the aqueous alteration took place isochemically within the CM chondrite parent(s) or within their larger pre-accretionary precursors before final assembly [4,7]. Using their own and previously collected [3,8] elemental abundance data, [4] examined the bulk major and trace elemental compositions of 8 individual CM chondrites. Within their analyses, they found no differences associated with progressive aqueous alteration. Whether CM chondrite aqueous alteration occurred isochemically or within an open chemical system is important for constraining the sequence of processes that have affected the CM chondrites [6,7]. To verify the previously concluded isochemical nature of CM chondrite aqueous alteration, in this work we expand the number of samples investigated and doubled the number of elements previously quantified.   Samples and Methods:  We included a total of 22 putative CM chondrites in our study. Other than Murchison, the single fall, the rest are Antarctic finds. 18 were analyzed specifically for this study while data for the others was taken from previous studies [9,10].  Trace element abundances were quantified with identical methods [11, also see 12 &13] for all samples. To place our elemental analysis data into an alteration context, petrographic thin sections of each were examined with optical light microscopy and SEM BSE imaging for this study.  Each sample was assigned a petrographic type and subtype according to the scheme of [4] (Table 1).   Table 1: CM chondrite samples and petrographic classifications. Sample class. Sample class.

Forty-four individual trace elements are included in our comparisons.  The initial graphical comparisons presented here are based on splitting our CM chondrites into two suites: a "low aqueous alteration" suite (CM 1.9-2.1, n= 11) and a "high aqueous alteration" suite (CM 2.5-2.7 , n =7).  The 3 CM 2.3 chondrites remaining will be included in a later exploration of the data.  For the graphical comparison presented below, we normalize all elemental abundances to the element Sc to compensate for the variable volatile (organic) compound contents within the variously aqueously altered CM chondrites [15,16].   Results: EET 83226.  EET 83226 was initially classified as a CM chondrite and was included in our initial suite of samples. Examination of the elemental abundances indicates that it is a heated CM-like chondrite akin to WIS 91600 or EET 96010 [see 10, 16]. It was excluded from further consideration. Initial comparison results. A graphical comparison of our mildly- and highly-aqueously altered CM chondrite suites is shown in Figure 1 below.  Within errors, no compositional differences are immediately apparent.  Most elements show little variation (<2%) between the two variously aqueously altered suites.  Elements that show deviations of more than 5% include U, Sb, Ag, and Mo. These elements are have either  lower analytical precision (Sb, Ag, and Mo) with our elemental analysis methodology or their contents can be variable in chondrites because of terrestrial alteration (U).  However, low methodological precision cannot account for the potential deviations of other elements (especially Mn, Rb, and Zn) which show differences greater than 4%.  More detailed compositional comparisons, including statistical evaluations, will be performed to investigate potential differences in greater detail.  Figure 1. Comparison of 7 highly aqueously altered CM chondrites (petrographic type 2.5-2.7) and 11 mildly aqueously altered (pet. type 1.9-2.1) CM chondrites.  1σ errors are shown. Within errors, no compositional differences are apparent between the two suites of variously aqueously altered CM chondrites.  Additional statistical analyses will be presented.     Discussion: Our initial results and rudimentary analyses suggest that there are no compositional differences with progressive degrees of aqueous alteration in CM chondrites, as has been previously observed [3,4,6-8].  Our analyses are based on a larger suite of chondrites with a greater number of elements than have been used in previous studies [3,4,8]. If this is the case, elemental abundances in CM chondrites established prior to accretion where essentially unchanged due to secondary aqueous alteration.  This suggests that aqueous alteration primarily occurred in a parent body scenario because preservation of a homogeneous bulk elemental composition is difficult to reconcile with a pure pre-accretionary aqueous alteration model.
