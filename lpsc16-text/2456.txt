Introduction:  Yamato 002712 (Y002712) is a new basaltic shergottite recently identified in the Japanese Antarctic meteorite collection at National Institute of Polar Research (NIPR) [1]. It is a 72.93 g rock paired with Y002192 (32.07 g). Y002712 is a fine- to medium-grained equigranular rock with evidence of strong shock metamorphism [2]. Although many shergottites have been recovered from Antarctica, most of them are lherzolitic and olivine-phyric shergottites, and basaltic shergottites are rare. In fact Y002712 is the 3rd Antarctic basaltic shergottite after EETA 79001 (lithology B) and QUE 94201, and is the 1st sample in the NIPR collection. Basaltic shergottites are usually more evolved compared to lherzolitic and olivinephyric shergottites, and thus provide important information about fractionated Martian magma. An earlier study suggested that Y002712 may show redox change during crystallization [2], and so we further analyzed this sample because such redox change is offering an important aspect of the Martian igneous activity in general [e.g., 3,4]. Additionally, in order to compare Y002712 with other related samples, we selected a desert basaltic shergottite NWA 2975 because it shows many similarities to Y002712 [5,6], and discuss crystallization environment of evolved Martian basaltic magma by their comparison. Samples and Methods:  We studied thin sections of Y002712 (Y002712,51-2) and NWA 2975. The sections were first observed by optical microscopy and then FEG-SEM equipped with EDS and EBSD detectors (Hitachi S-4500). Mineral compositions were analyzed with JEOL JXA-8900L and JXA-8530F electron microprobes using well-characterized natural and synthetic standards. We also analyzed maskelynite in Y002712 by SR-XANES at BL-4A, Photon Factory, KEK, Tsukuba, Japan to estimate its Fe valence. The size of the SR beam on the sample was about 5 µm. FeK pre-edge peak data were deconvoluted into two peaks and centroid peak positions of the pre-edges were used to determine the Fe3+/ΣFe ratio [7]  Results:  Y002712 is an augite-rich basalt with 70% clinopyroxenes (43% augite and 27% pigeonite) and 29% maskelynite plus accessory Ca phosphates, titanomagnetite, ilmenite, Fe sulfide and Si-rich glasses [2] (Fig. 1). The section we studied shows a variation of grain sizes especially for maskelynite (0.1-1 mm) and the area with large maskelynite has higher maskelynite abundance (Fig. 1). Augite and pigeonite are subhedral, mostly present as individual rounded grains, and augite is clearly dominant over pigeonite (Fig. 1). They often show complex chemical zoning in Fe-Mg and compositional ranges of augite and pigeonite are En45Wo35-En32Wo32 and En58Wo11-En35Wo13, respectively (Fig. 2). Both clinopyroxenes show a fine exsolution texture up to 1 m in width. Maskelynites are mostly homogeneous (An59-54Or1), but some show Na-K enrichment at rims (~An41Or3). The Fe SRXANES analysis of maskelynite shows that Na-K-rich rims are more Fe3+-poor (Fe3+/Fe=0.33) than the Carich cores (Fe3+/Fe=0.42) (Fig. 3). There are interstitial areas composed of Si-rich glasses, showing complex intergrowth of several phases with different Si and Al compositions. Silica is found among them and sometimes shows a lamellar texture similar to a mixture of seifertite and dense silica glass [e.g., 6,8]. The presence of such a high-pressure polymorph is consistent with the finding of majorite in shock melt veins [2]. Ilmenite exsolution is present in titanomagnetite, and their compositions give equilibration temperature and oxygen fugacity of 820-890 oC and logfO2=QFM-0.1 ~ -1.1 [9]. Both temperature and fO2 are higher than those in an earlier result [2], and shows a similar correlation found in NWA 2975 and nakhlites as fO2 becomes lower with decreasing temperature [4,5].  NWA 2975 is a medium-grained equigranular rock texturally similar to a coarser-grained part of Y002712. Its detailed description is reported in [6]. Pyroxene compositions of NWA 2975 almost overlap with that of Y002712, but pigeonite extends to more Fe-rich compositions (Fig. 2). We did not find extremely Ferich pyroxenes reported in [6]. The augite abundance appears slightly larger than pigeonite, but is not as much as that in Y002712. Maskelynite is An58Or1 to An40Or3, which is close to that in Y002712. We have not measured the Fe valence of maskelynite in NWA 2975 by SR-XANES yet, but plan to do by the meeting. Because Fe-Ti oxides show a similar size of exsolution texture to that found in Y002712, we also calculated equilibration temperature and fO2. The obtained values are 770-900 oC and logfO2=QFM-0.9 ~ -2.9 [9], which is roughly similar to [6] at high temperature, but extends to lower T-fO2. Discussion and Conclusion:  Y002712 (and Y002192) is a new "basaltic" shergottite (or "diabasic", "intersertal" shergottite), making it the 3rd sample in the Antarctic meteorite collections. Zagami is probably  the best known sample of this shergottite subgroup [e.g., 10], but the pyroxene grain sizes of Y002712 are a little smaller than those in Zagami and other basaltic shergottites. Also, pyroxenes in Zagami have more Mgrich core compositions. We consider that Y002712 most resembles NWA 2975 in general petrography, mineral compositions, equilibration temperature and fO2 among known basaltic shergottites. High abundance of pyroxene relative to maskelynite is common for basaltic shergottites, suggesting that it is a pyroxene cumulate. Nevertheless, high proportion of augite relative to pigeonite is uncommon and so preferential accumulation of augite in a magma chamber is proposed [2].  The calculated fO2 of Y002712 (QFM-0.1 ~ -1.1) is in the range of enriched shergottites [e.g., 11], and it is expected that a REE abundance will also show an enriched pattern. It is interesting that Y002712 is showing fO2 decrease with decreasing temperature. [5] reported similar redox change for NWA 2975. Such fO2 decrease with crystallization is supported by lower Fe3+ ratio at the maskelynite rim of Y002712. This kind of change in Fe3+ ratio has never been found in maskelynite of other shergottites by SR-XANES [12]. It is however reported that fO2 changed during crystallization of LAR 06319 olivine-phyric shergottite, but in this case fO2 increases with decreasing temperature [3]. The fO2 decrease is known for nakhlites when their intercumulus melts formed and it is suggested that nakhlites experienced early oxidation followed by intermediate stage reduction caused by S2 loss by degassing [4]. It is not clear whether this scenario can be applied to Y002712 and NWA 2975. If sulfur degassing really happened, we may see smaller amounts of Fe sulfide in these shergottites. The modal abundance of Fe sulfide in Y002712 is 0.1%, which is in fact smaller than, for example, Zagami (0.4-0.6%) [10]. However, it is uncertain whether this abundance is lower than any other shergottites and related to sulfur loss at low temperature. References: [1] Yamaguchi A. et al.

The rim is clearly more Fe2+-rich, suggesting more reducing condition compared to the core.
