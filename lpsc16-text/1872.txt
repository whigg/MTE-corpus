Introduction:  The global tectonic scenario of Mercury is dominated by contractional features mainly represented by lobate scarps and related to planetary cooling [1]. These structures are the expression of surface-breaking thrust faults and are linear or arcuate features widely distributed on Mercury. Since they display a broad distribution of orientations, lobate scarps are thought to be related to a global contractional strain. The age determination of these features will permit to estimate the rate of global contraction and whether limits could be placed on when the contraction occurred. This will give us new clues to better understanding the thermal evolution of the planet.   Fig.1 A thrust system located on the Kuiper quadrangle. The system is 1500 km-long and includes several lobate scarps. Encircled in green are the craters considered in the counting.   A thrust system at the edge of Kuiper quadrangle:  a 1500 km-long thrust system has been detected between latitudes 9°20'N-23°42'S and longitudes 72°73'-59°52'W, at the edge between Kuiper and Beethoven quadrangles (Fig.1). This system is composed by several scarps with a NNE-SSW orientation showing a prevalent westward vergence.  Enterprise Rupes: this 820 km-long scarps system represents the surface expression of a large-scale thrust fault. The system cuts the Rembrandt basin and shows a southward vergence outside the basin, and a vergence toward southeast inside the basin's floor [2] (Fig.2).  Fig.2 Enterprise Rupes. This 820 km-long scarp system cuts the Rembrandt basin. Encircled in green are the craters considered in the counting.  Dating the thrust system activity:  We dated the two thrust systems through the buffered crater counting technique [3,4,5], which can be used to derive absolute model ages of linear landforms such as faults, ridges and channels. We included in the counting all the craters whose rim directly cut the thrusts and all the craters whose ejecta clearly superimposed the lobate scarps. A fault buffer distance ≤ 1.5D has been considered (where D is the diameter of the crater) (Fig.1 and Fig.2).  Subsequently, the results of the crater counting have been arranged as a crater size-frequency distribution (CSFD), which describes the frequency of craters of specified size per unit area. Conclusions: The CSFD provided an age for the end of the two thrust system's activity comparable to that estimated for the Blossom Rupes system, in the Eminescu quadrangle, dated at about 3.5-3.7 Ga [5] (Fig.3). All these data suggest that the activity along   Fig.3 Comparison between CSFD of the thrust system of Fig.1 (in blue), CSFD of Enterpise Rupes (in green), and the CSFD of Blossom Rupes system (in red)  as [5].  major rupes all around planet Mercury have most probably begun before 3.5 Ga. This would imply a revision of the most recent Mercury thermal evolution  models which instead estimate the beginning of the global contraction at about 3.0 Ga, well after the end of the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB) [e.g. 6,7].  Moreover, these results could suggest that other processes, like tidal despinning and mantle convection, could have contributed to Mercury's evolution, although yet within the global framework of cooling and contraction.
