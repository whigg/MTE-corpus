Shock Effects in Northwest Africa 6234: A Spectroscopic Investigation of the Mineralogy of the Shock Generated Melts.  M. J. Rucks1 and T. D. Glotch1. 1Stony Brook University (melinda.rucks@stonybrook.edu)  Introduction:  Meteorite samples recovered on Earth hold significant value in the study of impact processes. The propagation of a shock-wave can result in deformation and transformation of the target material including shock-melting, amorphization, and crystallization of high pressure phases. These shock effects are recorded within a meteorite as observable features and can be used as indicators for specific impact conditions experienced by the sample [1-3]. In particular, high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) mineral phases found within or near shock generated melts within meteorites can be very useful in the estimation of impact conditions. The behavior of common rock-forming minerals under shock conditions is highly dependent on the shock-induced pressure and temperature experienced by the target rock, as well as an added time component [4]. These extreme events often result in HP-HT phases that are metastable, form under unique conditions, and exhibit unusual properties, such as the high concentration of vacancies shown in the newly discovered mineral, tissintite [5]. The goal of this study is to identify HP-HT minerals either within or in close proximity to the shock melt veins and pools in the sample. The results of this study can be used to further our understanding of the shock history of the sample and may shed further light on the constraints on the formation conditions for HP-HT phases like tissintite. Here we present the initial findings of this study. Sample: The sample used in this study is a thick section of the olivine -phyric shergottite North-west Africa 6234 Martian meteorite provided by the American Museum of Natural History, NY. The major mineralogy of NWA 6234 is dominated by mmsize olivine macrocrysts with a fine grained groundmass composed of pyroxene, plagioclase (now maskelynite), olivine, and spinel [6]. The sample is ~2 cm wide and 3 mm thick. A melt vein runs across the sample with smaller veins running perpendicular from the main vein. The average thickness of the melt vein is <200 µm with some areas ~ 300 µm (Fig. 1).   Methods: Areas of interest were identified using reflected light microscopy. These areas were investigated using micro-Raman and micro-FTIR spectral imaging techniques available to us at the Vibrational Spectroscopy Laboratory at Stony Brook University.  Raman spectra were collected using the WiTec alpha 300R confocal imaging system, equipped with a 532 nm Nd YAG laser. For each measurement, the spectra were obtained with a 50X objective using a laser power of 1 mW and a spot size of ~0.76 µm. A low laser power and longer average scan time was applied to reduce the background associated with fluorescence. Reflectance spectra were acquired using the Nicolet iN10MX micro-FTIR, equipped with a liquid nitrogen cooled 16 pixel MCT linear array detector. Spectral area maps (~ 500 µm X 500 µm) were collected with a pixel size of 6 or 25 µm and data range of 7000 – 715 cm-1. Results: The area indicated in Figure 1 was analyzed using Raman spectroscopy within the regions highlighted in Figure 2. The square indicates the false color area map shown in Figure 3. Representative sample spectra are shown in Figure 4 and labeled accordingly in Figure 3. The initial results from this area show an amorphous phase (blue) that may contain some Figure 1.

crystalline material, pyroxene (green), and possibly apatite (red).  Along the line scan shown in Fig. 2 we observed olivine, an amorphous phase that could be interpreted as maskelynite and rutile. Sample spectra are shown in Figure 5.  Conclusions: The preliminary data presented here are consistent with previous investigations of other portions of NWA 6234 [6]. The amount of melt present in this sample holds great potential to be a host to HPHT minerals such as tissintite. In our future work, we will continue to analyze and investigate the mineralogy of these shock melts using IR and Raman spectroscopic techniques.   References: [1] Artemieva, N. & Ivanov, B.
