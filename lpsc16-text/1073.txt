REGRESSION OF AUSTRALASIAN TEKTITE LOCALITIES TO PUBLISHED CANDIDATE SOURCE CRATERS. A. Whymark1, 1Consultant Wellsite Geologist (aubrey@tektites.co.uk).  Introduction: Impact craters on geologically inactive worlds such as the Moon or Mercury, clearly exhibit crater ray systems. The pattern of the rays is principally determined by the obliquity of the impact. The Earth has an atmosphere which, to some degree, will repress ray formation. It is inferred, however, that medial and distal tektites (e.g. Philippinites & Australites) were still molten and forming above 99% of the atmosphere. As early as 1912 [1] rays of tektite material were recognized in Australia. Uneven tektite distribution patterns, suggestive of rays, have also been noted in SE Asia. A distinct ray in the Philippines passes through the north of Metro Manila, through the northern Bikol region and into the Pacific Ocean. Tektite rays are defined by higher concentrations of material and larger than average sized tektites for the region. Method: Tektite localities were obtained from an extensive library of published data (whilst too numerous to cite individually, all localities are referenced and available on request). Additional unpublished, but validated, sites are from personal communications. Some cited localities were very precise whilst others encompassed broader regions or are transposed from maps and may be less reliable. It was deemed preferable to use as many localities as possible. Use of only the most precisely documented localities would have resulted in an inadequate database. A total of 1,441 localities were utilized in this study. Localities from Fenner (1935) were omitted as very numerous generalized localities detracted from and masked otherwise distinctive rays.  A total of 25 possible source craters or regions (some close to one another) were recognized from published literature. They were all analyzed, but cannot all be presented due to space limitations. A line was drawn from the suggested crater or region to each and every tektite locality. No corrections were made to the data.  Possible sources of error include: Poor generalized localities; large gaps in the database due to seas, oceans and land areas with a lack of published data; water transportation of tektites to their current position; burial / loss of tektites; wind transportation of microtektites prior to deposition; and minor Coriolis effects during flight. The Australasian impact is well established as a highly oblique impact. In analyzing the crater ray system one is looking for a bilateral symmetry on the medial and distal rays. A radial symmetry is sought for the proximal Indochinites, which are the last formed tektites ejected in all directions as the circular crater opened up. Secondly, one is looking for overlay of regression lines. The greater the overlay of lines to form sharply defined rays, the closer one is to the true source crater location. Selected Results:     Fig. 1: Tonle Sap, 13° N, 104.5° E. [2] [3]. Lacks symmetry, clearly this source is too far west. Fig. 2: Zaotang structure, 23°56'16.00"N, 111°36'30.00"E. [4]. Lacks symmetry, clearly this source is too far north-east. 1073.pdf

    Figure 3 shows good symmetry, appearing marginally too far east (but note the lack of localities to the east due to sea, so cannot be ruled out on symmetry). In terms of line overlay to form rays, this source location is optimal.      Conclusions: It is evident that the source crater should lie in a broad region from south-central Laos (Bolikhamxai, Khammouane and Savannakhet provinces), adjacent central Vietnam or within the central Gulf of Tonkin. In detail, the lack of tektites in the western part of Indochina and abundance to the east in Hainan and Leizhou, suggests the optimal crater location is close to Fig 5. SW-NE measurements of the circular proximal field suggest an ejecta diameter of 1,400 km, which would best support a crater near Fig. 5. The lack of land to the east, beyond Hainan, makes the easterly extent of the proximal strewnfield uncertain. This absence of data may give the impression of the crater being further west than it actually is. The best fit in terms of line overlay to form sharp rays is Fig. 3 then Fig. 5. Undoubtedly the crater is at or very close to Fig. 3 or 5 and likely buried offshore as no crater is visible on land. References: [1] Dunn E. J. (1912) GSV Bulletin, 27, 1-23. [2] Hartung J. B.
