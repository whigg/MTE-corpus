POSSIBLE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ORGANIC ABUNDANCE AND AQUEOUS ALTERATION OF CM2 CARBONACEOUS CHONDRITES.  M. P.

Introduction: The soluble organic content of carbonaceous chondrites is highly complex and contains a plethora of biologically relevant compounds [1].  Many of these organic compounds are thought to have been synthesized during aqueous alteration, which occurred on meteorite parent bodies.  Correlations between the degree of aqueous alteration and insoluble organic material (IOM) as well as some freely soluble organic species have been shown [2,3 for example].  Here, the correlation between degree of aqueous alteration and amino acid and nitrogen heterocycle content was examined.   Methods:  The classification scheme of CM chondrites recently developed by Alexander et al. [4] was applied in conjunction with published [5] and unpublished data from previous studies of amino acids and nitrogen heterocycles (e.g., nucleobases and pyridine carboxylic acids) in eight CM2 chondrites: Allan Hills (ALH) 85013, Dominion Range (DOM) 03183, DOM 08003, Elephant Moraine (EET) 96016, LaPaz Ice Field (LAP) 02333, LAP 02336, Lewis Cliff (LEW) 85311, and Wisconsin Range (WIS) 91600. Preliminary Results:  In this study, abundance negatively correlated with the degree of pre-terrestrial aqueous alteration that the meteorite parent body experienced.  This was the case for a few different classes of organic compounds isolated in the soluble component of meteorites.  Our comparison was limited to CM2 chondrites; however, these observations may extend to other aqueously altered chondrites groups.  One important implication for this study is the potential to predict CM chondrites with high abundances of soluble organic compounds if appropriate classification is in place.  Such predictive capabilities would be helpful towards selecting suitable meteorites for study among the very large collection of meteorite available.  Although more data analysis would be necessary to confirm this possibility.  References: [1] Sephton M. A. (2002) Nat. Prod. Rep., 19, 292-311. [2] Elsila J. E. et al. (2005) Geochim. Cosmochim.
