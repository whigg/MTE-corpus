Introduction: High resolution 0.5 to 2 m/pixel images obtained by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) have revealed a vast, global network of more than 3200 lobate scarps [1].  These scarps are interpreted to be the results of thrust faults based on morphology, crosscutting relations, reversals in vergence, segment linkage, and modeling [1-6]. Their small scale and crisp appearance, crosscutting relations with small-diameter impact craters, and rates of infilling of associated small, shallow graben, indicate these fault scarps are younger than 50 Ma and may be actively forming today [1-3].  The spatial distribution and orientation of the population of young thrust fault scarps is an expression of the very recent stress state of the Moon and provide insight into the origin of global stresses. The spatial distribution of the scarps confirms that the Moon has recently undergone global contraction. Analysis of the orienations of the fault scarp, however, indicates a nonrandom distribution, inconsistent with isotropic stresses from late-stage global contraction as the sole source of stress [1]. Modeling shows that tidal stresses contribute significantly to the current stress state of the lunar crust [1]. Tidal stresses (orbital recession and diurnal tides) superimposed on stresses from global contraction result in non-isotropic compressional stress and thrust faults consistent with lobate scarp orientations. Coseismic slip events on currently active thrust faults are expected to be triggered when peak stresses are reached. Here we investigate the timing of shallow moonquakes recorded by the Apollo Seismic Network to determine if there is evidence that some of the seismic events are related to activity on young faults during periods of peak stress.   Current Stress State: Radial contraction from interior cooling is the dominant source of stress, contributing ≥2 but <10 MPa based on the currently mapped population of lobate scarps [1, 2]. Superimposed on compressional stresses from contraction are tidal stresses that reach tens of kPa. Thus, the current stress state of the lunar crust consists of at least three global components: diurnal tidal stress t, orbital recession stress r, and global contraction c. This combination results in a net non-isotropic compressional stress field and thrust faults with preferred orientations, in general agreement with orientations of the mapped faults [1]. Stresses due to orbital recession do not change with orbital position, thus it is with the addition of diurnal stresses that peak stresses are reached. At apogee, diurnal and recession stresses are most compressive near the tidal axis, while at perigee they are most compressive 90° away from the tidal axis. Thus, the occurrence of shallow seismic events generated by coseismic slip on the thrust faults may be greater when the Moon is near apogee or perigee. Shallow Moonquakes: Four seismometers were placed on the Moon at the Apollo 12, 14, 15 and 16 landing sites. The Passive Seismic Experiment formed a triangular array with apices around 1100 km apart. The limited geographical coverage resulted in poorly constrained epicentral locations and depths and limited detection of moonquakes on the farside. During the operation of the seismometers (1969 to 1977), over 13,000 events were recorded [7], including >6500 deep moonquakes and 28 shallow moonquakes [8] (Fig. 1). Deep moonquakes have been linked to variations in tidal stress [9] and their analysis has revealed the interior structure [10]. Shallow moonquakes occur at depths <200 km and have been interpreted as tectonic in origin [7]. Analysis of all 28 shallow moonquakes indicates Richter magnitudes in the range from around 1.5 to near 5 [7].  Estimates of stress drops range from a few MPa to over 100 MPa for the 3 largest events [11]. The majority of the epicentral locations are in the highlands, with others within or near the boundaries of mare basalt units (Fig. 1).   An analysis of the timing of the 28 the shallow moonquakes shows that 19 indeed occur when the Moon is closer to apogee (Fig. 2, 3), while only 9 shallow events occur when the Moon is closer to perigee. Of the 9 closer to perigee, 3 are approaching, 2 are at perigee, and 4 are departing. Of the 19 closer to apogee, 7 are approaching apogee and 12 are departing.  We are interested in determining whether it is possible to connect shallow moonquakes to slip events on specific thrust faults. Current best estimates for most shallow moonquake locations are likely only accurate to several degrees (possibly more for small and/or distant events). Their depths are similarly ill-constrained, with some estimated to occur at the surface, and others up to 200 km deep (with uncertainty likewise up to 200 km). Thus it is difficult to match the exact locations of known tectonic features with specific shallow moonquakes. We are currently exploring the application of a location algorithm specifically designed for sparse net1642.pdf

(top) Plot of the Earth-Moon distance in km over the course of the Apollo seismic experiment. Note that in addition to the monthly variation, a longer 206-day modulation due to the Sun’s perturbations on the lunar orbit can be seen. Shallow moonquakes are indicated by red dots. (bottom) Same as top, but demodulated to remove all but the monthly variation. To demodulate a time series, we first remove its mean and compute the envelope functions. We then divide the de-meaned series by the difference between the upper and lower envelopes, evaluated at the times of the input series values. The result is a time series with a flat envelope consisting of values between ±0.5.   Figure 3. Histograms of the demodulated Earth-Moon distance (EMD). While demodulation removes long-period variation from a time series, it does not remove the effect of the non-uniform lunar orbital motion. This is illustrated in the left figure, which shows increased bin values in the first and last bins (times near perigee and apogee) - this is the same as the distribution of a sine wave. We therefore make the background EMD distribution uniform, by multiplying it by 2 and taking the inverse sine. This ensures that the histogram computed at moonquake times is not biased by the uneven sampling of the Moon’s orbital position with respect to the Earth. The histogram of the demodulated, uniform EMD at shallow quake times is shown on the right.  1642.pdf
