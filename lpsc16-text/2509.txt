Introduction:  Measurement of the oxygen isotope composition of solar wind samples collected by the NASA Genesis mission clearly show that solar wind and, by inference, the bulk Sun, are not on the terrestrial fractionation line (TFL, Fig. 1) [1], as hypothesized by Clayton [2]. Bulk solar oxygen isotopes are inferred from the solar wind data by correcting for inefficient Coulomb drag in the solar atmosphere. The correction is ~40 ‰ in  18 O [1] (Fig. 1). Direct astronomical measurement of the oxygen isotope composition of the solar photosphere has been attempted on many occasions, but has yielded a wide range of results (Fig. 1). Given the complexity of the solar atmosphere, and the potential for possible additional fractionation processes, it is important to reconcile the astronomically determined O isotope ratios of the photosphere with those inferred from Genesis. A reanalysis by Ayres et al. [3] of much earlier ATMOS FTS observations of CO in the photosphere made significant progress to that end, but an uncertainty in the oscillator strength (f-value) scale for CO rovibrational transitions left a 60 ‰ range in the results (HR96 [4] and G94 [5] in Fig. 1). Here we resolve these differences in f-values, and present new photospheric isotope ratios. Data, f-values and Photospheric Models: CO absorption line data was collected by the shuttle-borne ATMOS FTS in the early 1990s, and is discussed in detail in [3]. Using a new set of dipole moment functions from Li et al. [6], Gharib Nezhad et al. [7] recalculated the rovibrational dipole moments for the CO isotopologues. The new 12 C16 O f-values (multiplied by the multiplicity g) are shown in Fig. 2 normalized to the gf-values used in [3], and plotted against the energy of the lower state of the corresponding rovibrational transition (ELow). The key point of Fig. 2 is that the new oscillator strengths are much closer to those from HR96 [4] (in blue) than from G94 [5] (in red). The circles are for v = 1 transitions, and the squares are for v = 2. Very similar results are seen for the other isotopologues [7]. Because v = 2 lines are used for 12 C16 O and v = 1 lines are used for the isotopologues (to keep optical depths similar), Fig. 2 illustrates the origin of the 60 ‰ difference between the HR96 fvalues and those of G94.  The solar atmosphere and radiative transfer models are discussed in detail in [3]. Briefly, CO lines of similar lower state energy are co-added to reduce the radiative transfer computation required. Sixteen snapshots from a 3-D hydrodynamic atmosphere model are used to more accurately capture the temperature variation associated with convections cells at the base of the photosphere. Three atmospheric temperature models are considered, as was done in [3]. The O abundance is first determined from 12 C16 O lines; isotopic abundances are then computed separately for a given 16 O abundance. Figure 3 shows the dependence of the determined O fraction on the 3 temperature models. Only one of the models, 'Goldilocks', yields consistent O abundance results for both v=2 (yellow diamonds) and v=1 (orange) lines. The determined O abundance is 605-620 ppm, which is low compared to the preferred value of 640-680 from helioseismology [8]. Ideally, the O fraction would be identical for all lines, but a small trend is visible n Fig. 3. This may indicate additional small errors in the f-values or model temperature profiles.  Results and Implications: The oxygen isotope ratios corresponding to the Goldilocks model are shown in Fig. 4 with 1- error bars, and superimposed on a figure from McKeegan et al. [1]. The error includes contributions from sample signal-to-noise, an estimate of the 3-D hydrodynamic snapshot variability, and an estimate for the uncertainty in the f-values. The deviation in isotope ratios associated with the 'Baseline' and 'Max' models is ~3 times the 1- errors shown in Fig. 4. The error in  17 O in Fig. 4 is dominated by the low signal-to-noise for the 12 C17 O lines, making it impossible to distinguish between the inferred Genesis value and a terrestrial value at a 2- level. Our results provide the first accurate, directly determined, O isotope ratio for the solar photosphere. The value determined,  18 O = -50 ± 11 ‰ (relative to VSMOW), is consistent with the inferred value from Genesis measurement of the solar wind, and provides support for the dominant role of inefficient Coulomb drag in fractionation of O isotopes from the photosphere to the solar wind [9].  Given the likely importance of MHD waves in heating the upper chromosphere and corona, it is possible that other isotope fractionation processes could be present. Evidence for chromospheric heating by (torsional) Alfvenic waves has been found from SDO observa    tions by McIntosh et al. [10]. Elemental fractionation is well established as a function of first ionization potential (the FIP effect), and has been attributed to a  ponderomotive force associated with Alfven wave propagation [11]. This force appears incapable of fractionating isotopes of the same ion, but further investigation is certainly merited. References [1] McKeegan K.D. et al. (2011) Science 332, 1528-1532.

Blue points are normalized by HR96 [4]; red points are normalized by G94 [5]. Circles are for v=1 transitions, and squares are for v=2. This figure shows that the new gf-values are considerably closer to the gf-values of HR96, and are therefore consistent with an isotopically light photosphere, as shown by 'HR96' in Fig. 1.

The 'Goldilocks' model contains a mid-latitude photospheric temperature perturbation that yields equality between the O fraction for v=2 transitions (yellow diamonds) and v=1 transitions (orange diamonds). The Max and Baseline models yield less consistent results.
