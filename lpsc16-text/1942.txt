Introduction:  Dhofar  025 (Dho 025) is  a  lunar highland meteorite with no mineralogical evidence for a KREEP presence. However the rock is characterized by  highest  REE  contents  among  the  highland meteorites  [1].  Here  we  report  on  occurrence  of cathodoluminescent  (CL)  glasses  in  Dho  025.  The glasses have spinel-plagioclase composition similar to that  of  lunar  spinel  anorthosites.  Mostly  they  are enriched in Ti, REEs and other incompatible elements. Methods:  A polished thick section of the Dho 025 feldspathic  breccia  was  studied  using  optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (JEOL JSM-6610LV  with  Gatan  MonoCL4  detector). Chemical  composition  of  the  mineral  phases  was measured using JEOL JXA-8530F and Cameca SX100 microprobes in Vienna.  A laser  ablation system UP213  (New  Wave)  attached  to  inductively  coupled plasma-mass spectrometer Element-XR (Moscow) was used to measure trace and some major elements. Laser pulse frequency of 4 Hz and beam diameter of 30 µm were  used  for  the  analyses.  Data  reduction  was performed with Glitter software program [2]. Analyses were calibrated against the NIST 610 external standard and EMPA measured Al content of each glass as an internal standard. Results:  Dho 025 is an anorthositic impact melt breccia  containing  mineral  and  lithic  fragments  [3]. Lithic  clasts  (up  to  1.5  mm in size)  of  anorthositic, noritic,  gabbro-noritic and troctolitic composition are common.  Rare  clasts  of  VLT basalts  were  found as well. Most of the lithic clasts are impact melt breccias and  poorly  crystalline  impact  melts.  However, granulitic  and  cataclastic  rocks  are  present,  too. Coarse-grained  lithic  clasts  with  a  possibly  primary texture  are  rare.  Mineral  fragments  are  similar  in composition to those of lithic clasts. However, there is a  population  of  rather  coarse-zoned  fragments  of pleonaste (MG# 76-92), Mg-rich olivine (MG# 76-90), and minor Mg-rich low-Ca pyroxene (MG# 78-89). The meteorite  contains  an extremely fine-grained partly  recrystallized  glassy  matrix.  Numerous  small mineral fragments and schlieren objects are common in the matrix. One rounded glass fragment (160x170 m) enriched in Na and K was found. The matrix makes up 30-40% of the meteorite. The CL objects  are  sized from 10х10 to 70х120 m and have an isometric or irregular shape (Fig.1a-d). In some parts they replicate the schlieren texture of the matrix. The glasses show a bluish CL signal of varying intensity  unevenly  distributed  in  the  objects.  In  the studied section 17 such objects were recognized. The boundaries of the CL glass objects with the matrix are mainly blurred but partly are sharp. As a rule the CL glasses  in  contrast  to  the  matrix  glass  are  evenly devitrified (Fig.1a). Tiny microlites (1, rarely 3  m) are  represented  by pleonaste  (MG 75-78)  embedded into a glass  of  plagioclase  composition (Fig.  1d).  In one CL glass object another mafic phase is present in form  of  microlites  but  its  size  is  too  small  for identification. Fig.1 CL images of the Dho 025 CL glasses. Mafic phases are black. The CL glasses vary in composition from nearly pure plagioclase to more mafic one (Table 1). The CL glasses  enriched  in  Fe  and  Mg  have  higher  MG#. Some of the CL mafic members contain up to 0.5 wt.% TiO2. The CL glasses are certainly poorer in Na (0.10.3 wt.% Na2O) and richer in Al (30-42 wt.% Al2O3) than Dho 025 bulk rock (0.3 and 27 respectively). Table 1.

CI-chondrite normalized element patterns of the CL glasses, the Dho 025 whole rock, and plagioclases. The trace elements abundances in the CL glasses resemble  those of  the Dho 025 whole rock (Fig.  2). The  majority  of  the  glasses  have  a  plagioclase-like REE pattern with a small positive Eu anomaly and an enrichment  of  LREEs  relative  to  HREEs.  The exception is the 18CL glass that has the most intense CL signal as well as the highest Ti, REEs (10xCI) and other  incompatible  elements.  This  glass  is characterized by the absence of Eu anomaly (Fig. 2), lowest  Al,  highest  Fe,  Mg and a low MG# 67. Two other  CL  glasses  with  lower  incompatible  elements have  composition  intermediate  between  plagioclase and the main portion of CL glasses composition as a consequence  of  an  admixture  of  surrounding plagioclase (Fig. 2). Discussion:  Mn2+ is  the  most  important  CL activator  in  lunar  plagioclases  [4].  In  spite  of  the feldspathic composition of the studied glasses their CL intensity  positively  correlates  with  REE  and  Ti contents which therefore could be CL activators too. In addition, the intensity of the CL signal should depend on the constitution of the glass  and therefore  should reflect some special features of the thermal history and the nucleation kinetics of the Dho 025 CL glasses. In comparison,  the Dho 025 matrix glasses  which have similar trace element content but do not show strong CL signal. The absence of the CL signal may be also connected  with  a  quenching  effect  of  a  higher  Fe2+ amount [5].  The blurred boundaries  and the variable composition indicate that the CL glasses similar to the Dho  025  matrix  glasses  were  formed  by  impact melting. On the Fo-An diagram a majority of CL glass melts  should  crystallize  spinel  first  (Fig.  3).  In  the spinel-plagioclase  composition  the  CL  glasses correspond  to  so-called  spinel  anorthosites  recently discovered  by  remote  sensing  [6].  It  means  that  the spinel  anorthosites  could  be  originated  by  impact mixing and melting of anorthosites with some mafic rocks,  and  following  crystal-liquid  fractionation  of such impact melts. The enrichment of the CL glasses in incompatible trace elements suggests that the mafic component  could  be  related  with  HMS rocks  which often show such enhancement in a KREEP component. Thus  the  investigations  supports  the  models  [7-10] suggesting impact origin of lunar spinel anorthosites.  1900 C0 1600 1300 Fo+L Fo+Sp+L Sp+L An+Sp+L Fo+An 1320 C 030 70 LAn+L Fo An Fig. 3.
