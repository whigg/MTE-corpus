However the rock is characterizedby  highest  REE  contents  among  the  highlandmeteorites  [1].  Here  we  report  on  occurrence  ofcathodoluminescent  (CL)  glasses  in  Dho  025.  Theglasses have spinel-plagioclase composition similar tothat  of  lunar  spinel  anorthosites.  Mostly  they  areenriched in Ti, REEs and other incompatible elements.Methods:  A polished thick section of the Dho 025feldspathic  breccia  was  studied  using  opticalmicroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (JEOLJSM-6610LV  with  Gatan  MonoCL4  detector).Chemical  composition  of  the  mineral  phases  wasmeasured using JEOL JXA-8530F and Cameca SX100microprobes in Vienna.  A laser  ablation system UP213  (New  Wave)  attached  to  inductively  coupledplasma-mass spectrometer Element-XR (Moscow) wasused to measure trace and some major elements. Laserpulse frequency of 4 Hz and beam diameter of 30 µmwere  used  for  the  analyses.  Data  reduction  wasperformed with Glitter software program [2]. Analyseswere calibrated against the NIST 610 external standardand EMPA measured Al content of each glass as aninternal standard. Results:  Dho 025 is an anorthositic impact meltbreccia  containing  mineral  and  lithic  fragments  [3].Lithic  clasts  (up  to  1.5  mm in size)  of  anorthositic,noritic,  gabbro-noritic and troctolitic composition arecommon.  Rare  clasts  of  VLT basalts  were  found aswell. Most of the lithic clasts are impact melt brecciasand  poorly  crystalline  impact  melts.  However,granulitic  and  cataclastic  rocks  are  present,  too.Coarse-grained  lithic  clasts  with  a  possibly  primarytexture  are  rare.  Mineral  fragments  are  similar  incomposition to those of lithic clasts. However, there isa  population  of  rather  coarse-zoned  fragments  ofpleonaste (MG# 76-92), Mg-rich olivine (MG# 76-90),and minor Mg-rich low-Ca pyroxene (MG# 78-89).The meteorite  contains  an extremely fine-grainedpartly  recrystallized  glassy  matrix.  Numerous  smallmineral fragments and schlieren objects are common inthe matrix. One rounded glass fragment (160x170 m)enriched in Na and K was found. The matrix makes up30-40% of the meteorite. The CL objects  are  sized from 10х10 to 70х120m and have an isometric or irregular shape (Fig.1a-d).In some parts they replicate the schlieren texture of thematrix. The glasses show a bluish CL signal of varyingintensity  unevenly  distributed  in  the  objects.  In  thestudied section 17 such objects were recognized. Theboundaries of the CL glass objects with the matrix aremainly blurred but partly are sharp. As a rule the CLglasses  in  contrast  to  the  matrix  glass  are  evenlydevitrified (Fig.1a). Tiny microlites (1, rarely 3  m)are  represented  by pleonaste  (MG 75-78)  embeddedinto a glass  of  plagioclase  composition (Fig.  1d).  Inone CL glass object another mafic phase is present inform  of  microlites  but  its  size  is  too  small  foridentification.Fig.1 CL images of the Dho 025 CL glasses. Mafic phases are black.The CL glasses vary in composition from nearlypure plagioclase to more mafic one (Table 1). The CLglasses  enriched  in  Fe  and  Mg  have  higher  MG#.Some of the CL mafic members contain up to 0.5 wt.%TiO2. The CL glasses are certainly poorer in Na (0.10.3 wt.% Na2O) and richer in Al (30-42 wt.% Al2O3)than Dho 025 bulk rock (0.3 and 27 respectively).Table 1.

Fig. 2. CI-chondrite normalized element patterns of the CL glasses,the Dho 025 whole rock, and plagioclases.The trace elements abundances in the CL glassesresemble  those of  the Dho 025 whole rock (Fig.  2).The  majority  of  the  glasses  have  a  plagioclase-likeREE pattern with a small positive Eu anomaly and anenrichment  of  LREEs  relative  to  HREEs.  Theexception is the 18CL glass that has the most intenseCL signal as well as the highest Ti, REEs (10xCI) andother  incompatible  elements.  This  glass  ischaracterized by the absence of Eu anomaly (Fig. 2),lowest  Al,  highest  Fe,  Mg and a low MG# 67. Twoother  CL  glasses  with  lower  incompatible  elementshave  composition  intermediate  between  plagioclaseand the main portion of CL glasses composition as aconsequence  of  an  admixture  of  surroundingplagioclase (Fig. 2). Discussion:  Mn2+ is  the  most  important  CLactivator  in  lunar  plagioclases  [4].  In  spite  of  thefeldspathic composition of the studied glasses their CLintensity  positively  correlates  with  REE  and  Ticontents which therefore could be CL activators too. Inaddition, the intensity of the CL signal should dependon the constitution of the glass  and therefore  shouldreflect some special features of the thermal history andthe nucleation kinetics of the Dho 025 CL glasses. Incomparison,  the Dho 025 matrix glasses  which havesimilar trace element content but do not show strongCL signal. The absence of the CL signal may be alsoconnected  with  a  quenching  effect  of  a  higher  Fe2+amount [5].  The blurred boundaries  and the variablecomposition indicate that the CL glasses similar to theDho  025  matrix  glasses  were  formed  by  impactmelting. On the Fo-An diagram a majority of CL glassmelts  should  crystallize  spinel  first  (Fig.  3).  In  thespinel-plagioclase  composition  the  CL  glassescorrespond  to  so-called  spinel  anorthosites  recentlydiscovered  by  remote  sensing  [6].  It  means  that  thespinel  anorthosites  could  be  originated  by  impactmixing and melting of anorthosites with some maficrocks,  and  following  crystal-liquid  fractionation  ofsuch impact melts. The enrichment of the CL glassesin incompatible trace elements suggests that the maficcomponent  could  be  related  with  HMS rocks  whichoften show such enhancement in a KREEP component.Thus  the  investigations  supports  the  models  [7-10]suggesting impact origin of lunar spinel anorthosites.  1900 C016001300Fo+LFo+Sp+L Sp+LAn+Sp+LFo+An 1320 C030 70LAn+LFo AnFig. 3.
