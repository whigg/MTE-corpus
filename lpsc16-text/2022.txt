Introduction: The NASA MESSENGER mission [1] ended its operations on 30 April 2015, after more than 4 years in orbit around Mercury. Over the course of >4100 revolutions, a wealth of radio tracking data and altimetric range measurements were acquired by the MESSENGER spacecraft and the onboard Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA) [2]. The gravity and topography products that can be derived from those datasets provide important geophysical constraints to better understand Mercury and its evolution, from its deep internal structure [3] when combined with groundbased radar observations [4] to its crust [5]. During the final year of the mission, the remaining propellant was utilized to observe Mercury from very low altitudes, down to 5 km, compared with the initial 200 km periapsis. Favorable Earth viewing geometry allowed radio tracking down to ~25 km between August and October 2014. Such lower periapsis altitudes greatly enhanced the sensitivity of the MESSENGER dataset, especially to shorter-wavelength gravity anomalies. Figure 1 shows the minimum tracking altitude of MESSENGER over Mercury's surface and illustrates the substantial increase in resolution that can be expected from the MESSENGER extended mission data compared with earlier solutions [6,7]. Global Gravity Solution:  The complete tracking data, to 30 April 2015, were analyzed and included in the latest gravity solutions obtained at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. The noise level during each tracking pass was evaluated and used in the weight, after spline detrending to ensure that short-wavelength gravity signals contribute. Regularization (Kaula) was applied above spherical harmonic degree l=10. An intermediate degree and order 75 solution (HgM006) was used by the navigation team to design and fly the final "hover campaign" [8,9]. Our new HgM007 solution is to degree and order 100. Unlike previous solutions obtained in the "principal axes" frame [10], HgM007 is expressed in the reference frame adopted for the final MESSENGER Planetary Data System data release. On the basis of the work of Margot [4] and new spin rate (6.1385108°/ day) constraints [7], the reference longitude (329.5988°) was selected to maintain Hun Kal at -20°E. The HgM007 field is archived at the PDS. The uneven low-altitude data coverage (Figure 1) leads to a spatially variable resolution. As earlier [2], we computed a degree strength map from the full covariance matrix obtained during the inversion. The degree strength at each location is the degree at which the computed error spectrum intersects the Kaula constraint. Compared with previous fields such as HgM005, the degree strength reaches >75 at specific locations at northern latitudes. The gravity anomalies over northern latitudes show detailed features correlated with topography (e.g., impact craters, see Figure 2). MLA altimetric data were used as an additional tracking measurement to improve orbit determination, particularly when radio tracking was not available. up to March 15, 2012 up to March 2, 2015 minimum tracking altitude (km) no data orthographic plots centered at  0°E / 180°E and 45°N Figure 1.

Orthographic projections centered at 0°E / 180°E and 45°N.   Local Gravity Solution:  In order to resolve even shorter wavelengths than permitted by our current global approach, we developed companion solutions to the global gravity solutions, using local analysis techniques demonstrated with GRAIL [11].  Starting with a "background" spherical harmonic field, we estimated gravity anomaly corrections at a scale of 1º x 1º (corresponding to l~180). Such local gravity anomalies were arranged on a grid between 10° N and 88°N. We use the Stokes formulation to express the gridded gravity anomalies. Anomaly values with respect to the global model were estimated at the center coordinates of grid cells, such that :  Δgfull = Δgadj + ΔgGLOBAL. The solution was constrained spatially (neighbor smoothing) over the full anomaly (global background and adjustments). Instead of forming the information matrices directly from the range-rate data used in the orbit determination, as is typical, we used the line-of-sight (LOS) derivatives of those Doppler data residuals. We constructed the LOS derivatives by numerical differentiation of the time-series (on a pass-by-pass basis). Derivatives of Doppler data are akin to accelerations, and they are more sensitive to local, short-wavelength signals in the gravity field than the normal Doppler residuals. The smoothing factor was varied empirically, to find the best compromise between smoothing and resolution. The correlation of the local model with MLA topography over two 30° spherical caps at northern latitudes is shown in Figure 3. The local model maintains higher correlation at higher degrees than the global model. Conclusions: The first spacecraft to orbit Mercury, MESSENGER acquired a large radio tracking dataset and furthered our understanding of the planet's interior. In particular, the extension of the MESSENGER mission beyond its first year provided data much more sensitive than originally anticipated. The analysis of the late 2014 low-altitude data to produce gravity fields with high resolution in the northern hemisphere will allow new geophysical analyses of the crust and lithosphere of Mercury.
