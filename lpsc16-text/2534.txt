University Blvd., Tucson, AZ85721.Introduction: The William E. Gordon telescope atArecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico is the largest andmost sensitive single-dish radio telescope and the mostactive and powerful planetary radar facility in the world.Since opening in 1963, Arecibo has made significantscientific contributions in the fields of planetary science,radio astronomy, and space and atmospheric sciences.Arecibo is a facility of the National Science Foundation (NSF) operated under cooperative agreement withSRI International along with Universities Space Research Association and Universidad Metropolitana, partof the Ana G. Me´ndez University System. The planetaryradar program and radar infrastructure maintenance atArecibo are currently funded via grants from the NASANear-Earth Object Observations program.The 305-m William E. Gordon telescope has studiedobjects in the Solar System since its construction in the1960s. The initial 430-MHz transmitter was used to unambiguously determine the rotation periods of the planets Mercury and Venus, refine the value of the astronomical unit, and to obtain some of the first images ofthe surface of Venus. A joint NSF and NASA-fundedupgrade in the 1970s included the installation of a 450kW, S-band (2.38 GHz) transmitter. Over the next 15years, this system detected tens of near-Earth and mainbelt asteroids (NEAs and MBAs) and several comets,imaged the surface of Venus at 2-km resolution, discovered the anomalous reflection properties of icy surfaces at radio wavelengths, and mapped the ice depositsat the poles of Mercury. In the 1990s, a second NSFand NASA-funded upgrade increased the sensitivity ofthe radar system by a factor of ten to twenty dependingon declination. Observations with this system have provided characterization and astrometric measurements ofdozens of NEAs per year, confirmed the existence ofbinary and triple NEAs, verified the existence of theYarkovsky effect and contributed to the verification ofthe YORP effect (both effects due to solar radiation),obtained the first non-spacecraft images of cometary nuclei, imaged a number of main-belt asteroids, discovered hydrocarbon lakes on the surface of Titan, imagedthe rings of Saturn, and obtained multi-polarization imagery of the Moon and terrestrial planets.Technical Capabilities: Its 1 MW transmitter,nearly 20-acre collecting area, and gain of 2×106 makethe Arecibo planetary radar the world’s most powerfulinstrument for post-discovery characterization andorbital refinement of near-Earth objects and the studyof Solar System objects at radio wavelengths. Theunmatched sensitivity of Arecibo allows for detectionof any potentially hazardous asteroid (PHA; absolutemagnitude H < 22) that comes within ∼0.05 AU ofEarth (∼20 lunar distances) and most any asteroidlarger than ∼10 meters (H < 27) within ∼0.015 AU(∼6 lunar distances) in the Arecibo declination window(0◦ to +38◦), as well as objects as far away as Saturn.In terms of near-Earth objects, Arecibo observationsare critical for identifying those objects that may be ona collision course with Earth in addition to providingdetailed physical characterization of the objects themselves in terms of size, shape, spin, and surface-property(reflectivity, polarization, geologic features and sometimes composition and density) information. In fact,radar investigations of near-Earth objects are roughlyequivalent, in their science content, to spacecraft flybymissions, but at a cost orders of magnitude less. RangeDoppler radar measurements provide line-of-sight positional astrometry, orthogonal and complementary to optical plane-of-sky astrometry, with precision as fine as∼10 m in range and ∼1 mm/s in velocity with a fractional precision 100 to 1000 times finer than that of typical optical measurements. These unique capabilities ofradar are critically important as we work towards the2005 congressional mandate of detecting and characterizing 90% of NEAs down to 140 m in diameter.Current Research: The majority of telescope hoursdedicated to planetary radar observations in recent yearshave concentrated on near-Earth asteroids with the remainder dedicated to monitoring the Moon, the surfaceof Venus, comets, main-belt asteroids, and the Galileansatellites of Jupiter. Currently Mars and Saturn aretoo far south to view from Arecibo, but will return ina few years. Observations of planets, planetary satellites, comets, main-belt asteroids, and near-Earth asteroids are proposed on a semesterly basis and peerreviewed prior to time allocation. A significant fractionof NEAs are observed as targets of opportunity duringother scheduled tracks, as individual urgent proposals,or as part of monthly survey nights to observe ”whateveris up” during a typically 8-hour track near new moon.Nearly half of the asteroids detected in 2015 were ontheir discovery apparition and observed in one of thesemodes. Among these, Arecibo actively responds toNASA requests for observations of PHAs and those asteroids specifically of interest for possible future robotic2534.pdf

Figure 1: Detections per year of near-Earth asteroids(top) and the subsets of potentially hazardous asteroids(top) and NHATS objects (bottom). The number of detections has grown substantially under NASA support.A detection rate of ∼100 objects per year is sustainableand could possibly increase.or crewed missions, referred to as ”NHATS compliant”by the NASA Near Earth Object Program Office.Since the second upgrade in the mid-1990s, Arecibohas detected over 500 near-Earth asteroids, almost halfof which are designated as potentially hazardous andmore than 1 in 6 are NHATS compliant. Figure 1 showsthe number of NEA observations attempted and successfully completed since 1998. After the planetaryradar program became fully NASA funded in late 2010,asteroid observations drastically increased by more thana factor of 3. In fact, 2015 included a record number ofdetections in all categories: 95 NEAs, 36 PHAs, and 23NHATS objects.Broader Impacts: The unique capabilities of radarto provide ultra-precise astrometry and fine spatial resolution of Solar System bodies impacts the astronomicalcommunity, its ground- and space-based astronomicalassets, and humanity as a whole. Radar astrometry complements optical astrometry and routinely extends ourability to accurately predict the trajectories of asteroidsfor decades or centuries into the future, often preventing newly discovered objects from being lost. Radar,often in conjunction with other radio telescopes such asGoldstone, the Green Bank Telescope and elements ofthe Very Long Baseline Array, is the only ground-basedtechnique capable of characterizing a large number ofnear-Earth objects in detail, providing insight into thepopulation as a whole and revealing that the populationis heterogeneous in terms of size, shape, spin, and surface properties. Additionally, compared to visible or infrared studies, radar allows for direct measurement ofobject sizes without assumption of albedo or thermalproperties. Radar-based size and shape information actsas a calibrator for infrared observations by the WISEand Spitzer spacecraft, which typically assume spherical shapes to estimate sizes and albedos. Radar also provides direct determination of densities for those objectsthat are binary (or multiple) systems, a property notoriously difficult to measure accurately by other means.Such level of characterization of the population, in addition to specific bodies, is critical to hazard assessmentand mitigation, necessary for understanding dynamicaland collisional evolution in the Solar System, and invaluable in planning for spacecraft missions.Radar reconnaissance has played an important rolein reducing risk incurred by spacecraft missions bysimplifying navigation and predicting the gravitationaland surface environments the spacecraft will encounter.Arecibo has contributed to the planning and execution of missions such as the Hayabusa mission to(25143) Itokawa, the upcoming OSIRIS-REx missionto (101955) Bennu, the Marco Polo-R, Asteroid Impact& Deflection Assessment (AIDA), and Psyche missionconcepts, the Deep Impact extended mission (EPOXI)to comet 103P/Hartley, and in characterizing the surfaceconditions of proposed landing sites on Mars. Areciboalso aided in the recovery of the SOHO satellite andcame to the assistance of the Lunar ReconnaissanceOrbiter (LRO) when its onboard radar transmitterfailed. Subsequent bistatic Arecibo transmissions to theMoon received by LRO allowed for the first non-zerophase angle observations of the lunar surface.Acknowledgments: The Arecibo Observatory isoperated by SRI International under a cooperativeagreement with the National Science Foundation(AST-1100968) and in alliance with Ana G.
