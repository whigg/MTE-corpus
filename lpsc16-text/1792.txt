Grosfils2, and Gerald Galgana1, 1Lunar and Planetary Institute, 3600 Bay Area Boulevard, Houston, TX, 77058. lecorvec@lpi.usra.edu, 2Geology Department, Pomona College, Claremont, CA 91711.   Introduction:  Magma accumulation in the lithosphere leads to the formation of magmatic reservoirs. The shape of these reservoirs is complex and evolves with their growth and failure, which is controlled by the depth of the reservoir within the lithosphere [1], the tectonic environment [2, 3], and the mechanical properties of the lithosphere [4]. These studies principally consider the reservoirs to be spherical [4], however calderas on Venus demonstrate that the underlying reservoir shapes tend to be elliptical (e.g., Sacajawea Patera, Ishtar Terra [5]). The caldera diameters range commonly between 40 and 80 km in diameter [6]. In addition to the formation of calderas, Venusian volcano-tectonic complexes possess intriguing giant radiating dike systems [7], which have been recently constrained by new studies showing that tectonic environments affected by upward flexure tend to promote the formation of radial dikes for shallow magma chambers [2, 4]. In this work, we develop finite element models to test the stability of elliptical magma reservoirs and magma propagation. These models are tested first using elastic and subsequently elastoplastic rheologies for the lithosphere to consider more realistic rock behavior (i.e., tensile and compressive behaviors being pressure dependent). Methodology:  Following previous methodology [1-4], axisymmetric finite element models (FEMs) using COMSOL Multiphysics [8] were used to study the stability of elliptical reservoirs (Fig. 1). The models are gravitationally loaded with lithostatic pre-stress, constrained horizontally with rollers at the outer edge of the model. The lithosphere is initially lying in equilibrium on top of the asthenosphere (modeled as a boundary condition) [2].   Figure 1: FEM boundary condition. The magma reservoir is pressurized until it reaches tensile or shear failure. The depth of the reservoir varies from 3 to 9 km, and 6 to 18 km for a 20 km and 40 km thick lithospheric, respectively. Not to scale. The uplift deformation is created with a conical load applied at the base of the lithosphere (height 5 km, radius 250 km). Embedded within the lithosphere, magma reservoirs are pressurized to reach failure of its surrounding material. We tested the influence of ellipticity on the amount of overpressure needed to reach failure through different axis ratios (Ra/Rb = 1:1, 1:20 and 1:40). The different lithospheric rheologies were tested independently. First, elastic models were defined with their Young’s Modulus (E= 1e11 Pa), Poisson’s ratio (ν = 0.25) and density (ρ = 2800 kg/m3 equivalent to a basaltic composition), then elastoplastic models were defined using the same elastic properties with a Drucker-Prager (DP) yield criterion [9]. The DP criterion is a pressure-dependent model for determining whether a material has failed or undergone plastic yielding. Results:  Elastic models.  We observed that spherical magma reservoirs, when stable (i.e., overpressure > 0 MPa), fail at their summit (Fig. 2a). Tensile failure is controlled by the hoop stress, and will promote the formation of vertical dikes. These results are in accordance with previous work [2]. The amount of overpressure to reach failure increases with depth and is on the order of 100s of MPa (ratio Ra/Rb = 1:1, Fig. 2a). Increasing the elliptical shape of the reservoirs moves the location of failure from their summit to their midsection (Figs. 2b and c). Tensile failure is in these cases controlled by the tangential stress, which will promote the formation of sills.   Figure 2: Overpressure and stresses controlling the failure of the magma reservoir in an elastic lithosphere for three different aspect ratios (a. Ra/Rb = 1:1, b. 1:20, c. 1:40). The green and orange curves represent the hoop and tangential stress, respectively, controling the tensile failure of the reservoir. The blue curves represent shear failure (Faults. N = Normal, CT = Circumfrential Thrust, SS = Strike Slip). The gray bars represent the amount of overpressure. The vertical black line represents the threshold for either tensile or shear failure. 1792.pdf

The amount of overpressure drops dramatically with the increases in ellipticity from 10s (ratio Ra/Rb = 1:20, Fig. 1b) to several MPa only (ratio Ra/Rb = 1:40, Fig. 1c). Elastoplastic models.  To compare the influence of a different rheological environment, we used the same amount of overpressure necessary to reach tensile failure in the elastic models. First, we observe that shallow elliptical reservoirs (Dmc = 6 km) become less stable (Figs. 3b and c), while deeper reservoirs (Dmc > 6 km for spherical, and Dmc >10 km for elliptical reservoirs) becomes more stable (Fig. 3). The location and type of potential tensile failure remains similar for elliptical reservoirs (Figs. 3b and c), while failure for spherical reservoirs may occur between the midsection and summit, and favor the formation of radial dikes (Fig. 3a). The higher stability of the deeper reservoirs is due to plastic yielding.  Figure 3: Overpressure and stresses controlling the failure of the magma reservoir in an elastic lithosphere for three different aspect ratios (a. Ra/Rb = 1:1, b. 1:20, c. 1:40). The green and orange curves represent the hoop and tangential stress, respectively, controling the tensile failure of the reservoir. The blue curves represent shear failure (Faults. N = Normal, CT = Circumfrential Thrust, SS = Strike Slip). The gray bars represent the amount of overpressure. The vertical black line represents the threshold for either tensile or shear failure. Shear failure. We observe that in both elastic and elastoplastic models, magma reservoir failure should initially occur via shear failure (blue lines in Figs 2 and 3) [10]. Shear failure occurs at the same location as tensile failure and produces different types of faults according to Andersonian criteria [11, 12]. Normal faulting would occur above spherical reservoirs in elastic environments (Fig. 2a), while strike slip would radiate from spherical reservoirs in elastoplactic environments (Fig. 3a). Circumferential thrusts would form at the tip of elliptical reservoirs for both rheological environments (Figs 2b and c, and 3b and c). Volcanological implications:  The origin of large elliptical reservoirs is a fundamental question in order to understand the volcano-tectonic processes happening on Venus. Our models show that the ellipticity of shallow reservoirs above domical flexure favors their lateral growth through the formation of sills. While these magmatic intrusions do not match with the formation of observed radial dike systems, the state of stress in the far field, independent of the rheological properties of the lithosphere, favors the propagation of lateral dikes. Therefore, we suggest that while the elliptical shape of the magma reservoir favors their continued expansion, the tectonic environment may influence the propagation of the magma by rotating the sills into lateral dikes, as observed at Fernandina volcano in the Galapagos [13, 14].  Shear failure promotes the formation of faults, which may such as strike slip faults help to initialize or channelize radial dikes [15, 16] (Fig.3a), while circumferential thrusts maybe be involved in ring fault and caldera formation [12, 17] (Figs. 2b and c and 3b and c). Magma propagation is, however, principally controlled by mode I fractures [18]. Shear failure will therefore not provide the conditions allowing large propagation of magmas; thus pressurization of the reservoir can increase until it reaches tensile failure.
