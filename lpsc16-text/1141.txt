Introduction:  The task of naming planetary surface features, rings, and natural satellites is managed by the International Astronomical Union's (IAU) Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WGPSN). WGPSN members include Rita Schulz (chair) and 9 other members representing countries around the globe (see author list). In 2013, Blue et al. [1] presented an overview of planetary nomenclature. Given the extensive planetary exploration and research that has taken place since 2013, it is timely to update the community on the status of planetary nomenclature, the purpose and rules, the process for submitting name requests, and the IAU approval process.  Status: There are currently 15,201 surface feature names in use (not including names that have been dropped but retained in the database for reference). Table 1 shows the breakdown of the number of adopted surface feature names for each body. A table showing the named rings and ring gaps can be seen at the following URL:  http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Page/Rings.  Planet and satellite names are listed here: http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Page/Planets.    Table 1.

Approved names are listed in the Transactions of the IAU [2] and on the Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature web site [3]. Any names currently in use that are not listed in References 2 and 3 are not official.  Planetary names must adhere to rules and conventions established by the IAU WGPSN (see http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Page/Rules for the complete list):   Planetary names should be simple, clear and unambiguous.   Features should be named only when they are scientifically significant and when the naming is useful to the scientific and cartographic communities at large.   Name duplication on two or more bodies is discouraged, as is the use of the same name for satellites and minor planets.  Solar system nomenclature should be international in its choice of names.   Names having political, military, or religious significance are not allowed.  Commemoration is not a goal in itself, but may be employed in special circumstances and is reserved for persons of high and enduring international standing. Persons being so honored must have been deceased for at least three years.   Submitting a Name Request: The gazetteer includes an online Name Request Form (http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/FeatureName Request) that can be used by members of the professional science community. A specific name may be suggested for a feature, but the name is subject to IAU review and there is no guarantee it will be approved. A published reference is required for each name (reliable web sites and scanned online books are permitted). Suggested names must also fit the approved theme for each feature type on each body (see http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Page/Categori es). Requests to name a crater specifically to honor an individual rather than for scientific needs are not accepted.   Before submitting a name request, the online database and maps showing named features (http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Page/Images) should be consulted to confirm that the feature is not already named. If a specific name is included in the request, the database should also be checked to ensure the name has not already been approved for a different feature.  Name Approval Process: Name requests are first reviewed by one of six task groups (Mercury, Venus, Moon, Mars, Outer Solar System, and Small Bodies). After a task group has successfully reviewed a proposal, it is submitted to the WGPSN. Allow four to six weeks for the review and approval process, but more time may be necessary if the proposal is complicated or if questions are raised during the review process. Name requests should be submitted well in advance of publication deadlines. Upon WGPSN approval, names are considered formally approved and it is then appropriate to use them in publications. Approved names are immediately entered into the database and shown on the web site.  Summary: The members of the WGPSN and its task groups have worked since the early 1970s to provide a clear system of planetary nomenclature that represents cultures and countries from all regions of Earth. This activity supports ongoing planetary research, and the participation of knowledgeable scientists and experts in this process is vital to its success. Questions about the nomenclature database and the naming process can be sent to Rosalyn Hayward, USGS Astrogeology Science Center, 2255 N. Gemini Dr., Flagstaff, AZ 86001, or by email to                      rhayward@usgs.gov. Acknowledgments: Funding for R.
