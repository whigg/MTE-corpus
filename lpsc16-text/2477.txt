Introduction: APXS instrumentation has been used to analyze soils at three separate Martian locations: 1. Meridiani Planum (Opportunity, MER); 2. Gusev Crater (Spirit, MER); 3. Gale Crater (Curiosity, MSL). Previous research has indicated that soils at Gusev and Meridiani are similar in composition and may represent a global unit [1]. Comparison to Gale soils can further our understanding of the origin and evolution of this unit. Whilst a more complete cross calibration between the three APXS instruments will require more data from Curiosity, it is possible to compare soils from the three locations. The MER datasets (undisturbed, "dark" soils, max. grain size 100 μm [1]) used here comprise 6 samples from Meridiani Planum [2, 3] and 24 samples from Gusev Crater [2, 3]. Gale Crater (undisturbed) soil samples are divided into two categories here: Gale Soil (n=10, the main grouping (including Portage, which is regarded as being representative of Average Gale, and is used here to ratio abundances for ease of comparison) and Bagnold Dunes Soils (from the ongoing Bagnold Dunes Campaign). (Individual Bagnold Dunes samples denoted by BD; av=average). Comparison of soils analyzed by APXS - major elements and Ni, Zn and Br: The ratio of soil analyses from Gale soils and from the basaltic soils at Meridiani and Gusev to Portage (Fig. 1) indicate that soils from all three locations have similar compositions with minor differences, e.g., Ni and Br.  Fig. 1. All analyses ratioed to Portage, showing the variability within an individual category and across categories, relative to Portage (i.e., Average Gale).  It can be seen that samples from Meridiani Planum (blue) are less varied than Gale and Gusev (due in part to the smaller data set). However, the majority of elemental concentrations are also typically lower or similar to those for Portage. Gusev (green) (at n=24, the largest sampling) exhibit the greatest compositonal variation, and divergence from Portage. FeO, P2O5, TiO2, Cr2O3, MnO and Zn are notably depleted, relative to Portage. As expected, the Gale soils (red) show the strongest similarity to Portage. The majority of lighter elements, including Na, Al, Si and Ca, as well as Br, are tightly constrained, showing little variability, whilst Mg shows some variation. In contrast, S, Cl and K are considerably depleted or elevated, relative to Portage. Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni and Zn also show variation, although not as pronounced. Fig. 2. Average chemical compositions of samples from Meridiani Planum, Gusev Crater, and Gale Crater, ratioed to Portage.  Fig. 2 plots the average undisturbed soil composition (Table 1) for a given category, ratioed to Portage. Si, Al and Ca abundances for each soil are tightly constrained, with little range (Fig. 1, 2; Table 1). Si abundances are similar for Gusev and Meridiani, but are lower and more varied at Gale. The highest Al2O3 is seen in the Gusev soils, whilst the Meridiani samples are more similar to the Gale soils (av. 9.12 wt. %). Conversely, the Gusev soils have the lowest CaO and FeO contents (Fig. 1, 2). MgO abundances for Gale and Gusev soils are similar; Meridiani concentrations are lower.  K, S and Cl show considerable variation, relative to Portage, in all categories (Fig. 1). Within the Gale soils, values show two distinct groupings - the bulk of the samples (incl. Portage) cluster together, close to averages for Meridiani and Gusev, whilst the second cluster (n=3) shows relatively high values for K, S and Cl. The largest range in values for Cl, S and K are seen at Gusev; however, the high-value Gale cluster comprises the highest Cl soil values seen on Mars so far (av. 0.98 wt. %).  Portage is elevated in TiO2, P2O5 and Cr2O3, all of which show variation across the three soil categories. 0.000.501.001.502.002.50Ratio to PortageGale CraterGusev CraterMeridiani PlanumNa2O  MgO Al2O3 SiO2 P2O5 SO3 Cl      K2O   CaO TiO2 Cr2O3 MnO FeO Ni       Zn     Br0.000.501.001.502.002.50MeridianiGusevGaleRatio to PortageNa2O  MgO Al2O3 SiO2 P2O5 SO3 Cl      K2O   CaO TiO2 Cr2O3 MnO FeO Ni       Zn     Br2477.pdf

Cr2O3 abundances within Gusev and Meridiani Soils have a fairly consistent profile. However, values within the Gale Soils are typically higher than those for Meridiani or Gusev. TiO2 values for Gale and Meridiani Soils are generally higher than Gusev soils.  Ni, Zn and Br show the highest degree of variation for each category. Ni and Zn values for Gale are higher than those seen at Meridiani, which are lower than those from Gusev. Br abundances for the Gale soils are typically intermediate between those seen at Meridiani and Gusev soils. Br values show the most variation (Fig. 1) when ratioed to Portage (34 ppm), with highest values seen at Gusev (range from 0 to 263 ppm).

Averages for Gale (excl. Bagnold Dunes), Meridiani [1, 2] and Gusev [1, 2]. Comparison to Bagnold Dunes: The first soil analysis from the Bagnold Dunes campaign was taken on Sol 1182. Soil analyses from this ongoing campaign show considerable differences, both to previous analyses at Gale Crater and earlier MER analyses, and between individual Bagnold Dunes samples (Fig. 3).  Bagnold Dunes samples are higher in SiO2 than the Gale soils, but typically lower than Gusev or Meridiani; however, BarbyBD has the second highest SiO2 (48.11 wt. %) seen thus far in Martian soils. Although Al2O3 abundances are tightly constrained for other categories, the Bagnold Dunes values range from some of the lowest values seen for Martian soils (e.g., WarsawBD 8.46 wt. %), to samples higher than those seen in the Gale Soils (e.g., BarbyBD 10.87 wt. %). MgO values for the Bagnold Dunes are amongst the highest seen for Martian soils e.g., KibnasBD (9.97 wt. %). CaO and FeO abundances are comparable to Gale soils, whilst TiO2 values are lower.  The Bagnold Dunes samples are lower in K2O, SO3 and Cl, than the lowest Gale soils. SO3 values are the lowest for any soil analysed to date (e.g., WeissrandBD 3.19 wt. %), although not the lowest values seen at Gale . K2O and Cl are comparable to the lowest Gusev and Meridiani values. Ni, Zn and Br are among the most variable elements at Bagnold Dunes, as quantified by APXS, and appear to be depleted, relative to the other soil samples (Fig. 1). Whilst typical Bagnold Dunes Ni values range from 490 to 511 ppm, WarsawBD has the highest Ni (822 ppm) seen in any of the Martian soils. Zr abundances are lower than those seen within the Gale soils - BarbyBD 191 ppm is the lowest Zn value seen within Gale. Br values for the Bagnold Dunes samples are typically low (range 20-60 ppm); however, the BarbyBD samples have higher Br abundance (103 ppm) than any other soil seen at Gale Crater.  Fig. 3: Comparison between Gale Soils and Bagnold Dunes samples, ratioed to Portage.  Conclusion:  Gale soils (excl. Bagnold Dunes), and the basaltic soils at Gusev Crater and Meridiani Planum (Fig. 1, 2; Table 1) show consistency in composition within limits, indicating a homogenous source and/or a homogenizing process (such as eolian mixing). More significant differences in soil chemistry can be seen at Bagnold Dunes, both between  the Gale soils and those at Bagnold Dunes (Fig. 3) - the Bagnold Dunes samples are more enriched in lighter elements, (e.g., Si and Mg), but lower in K, P, and Ca, and depleted in volatiles (Ni, Zn and Br) - and between individual Bagnold Dunes soils.  As the Bagnold Dunes are an active dune system, this variability may be related to position and associated sorting, e.g., BarbyBD, which is on the crest of a ripple, displays more extreme variation from the norm (i.e., Portage) than does the corresponding trough sample, KibnasBD (Fig. 3). The variability may also suggest a limited contribution from eroded local bedrock. Further APXS investigation of the Bagnold Dunes will add not only to our understanding of soils on Mars, and local variations, but also allow us to compare this active dune system with less active dunes, as planned for later in the MSL campaign.
