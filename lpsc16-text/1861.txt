Nakashima 1. 1 Department of Earth and Planetary Material Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi 980-8578, Japan (masakuni.yamanobe.p6@dc.tohoku.ac.jp)  Introduction: Oxygen isotope ratios of most chondrules are internally homogeneous, which reflects oxygen isotope ratios of the solid reservoirs from which chondrules formed [1]. In carbonaceous chondrites, chondrules show a systematic trend wherein  17 O (= 17 O-0.52× 18 O) values increase with decreasing Mg # (= molar% MgO/[MgO+FeO]). The  17 O-Mg # trends are specific to individual chondrite groups [1-4]. In contrast, chondrules in enstatite and ordinary chondrites show constant  17 O independent from Mg # [5-6]. These meteorites, however, are originated from the inner regions of the asteroid belt. Oxygen isotope systematics of chondrules that formed in the outer regions of the asteroid belt are not well understood. Although oxygen isotope ratios of chondrules in the Tagish Lake meteorite derived from the outer regions of the asteroid belt [7] have been analyzed, the  17 O-Mg # trend is not clear because only type I chondrules were analyzed [8]. Thus it is necessary to analyze type II chondrules in meteorites from D-type asteroids.   Wisconsin Range (WIS) 91600 is an ungrouped carbonaceous chondrite. The reflectance spectrum is similar to those of D-type asteroids [9] which are abundant in the outer solar system beyond the main asteroid belt. Thus, it is considered that WIS91600 is originated from the outer region compared to other chondrites. Here we report suite of data for oxygen isotopic and chemical composition of chondrules (both of type I and type II) and chondrule fragments from WIS91600 in order to understand oxygen isotope ratios in the outer solar system before accretion into parent bodies. Methods: Backscattered electron images of WIS91600 were obtained using a scanning electron microscope. Major element composition analyses of chondrules and chondrule fragments were performed with an electron probe microanalyzer equipped with wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (WDS). WDS quantitative chemical analyses were performed at 15kV accelerating voltage and 15nA beam current. Oxygen three-isotope analyses were performed with the Cameca IMS-7f at the Tohoku University. We applied Cs + ion primary beam of ~1.5 nA (20 µm in diameter) with 10kV accelerating voltage. The mass resolving power of 5200 was applied to minimize the contribution from 16 O1 H to 17 O and electron gun was used for charge compensation. Secondary ion of 16 O, 17 O- and 18 O- were detected by a Faraday Cup ( 16 O) and electron multipliers ( 17 O, 18 O) on the mono-collection system.

Results: Type I chondrules in WIS91600 are > 300 m in diameter, and their shapes range from round to irregular. They consist of olivine and phyllosilicate. Type II chondrules have irregular shapes with diameters of > 150 m. They consist of olivine and phyllosilicate, and some of them have olivine with Fe-Mg zoning. Chondrule fragments have irregular shapes and consist of solely olivine. We classified FeO-poor (Mg #>90) chondrule fragments as isolated forsterite and FeO-rich (Mg #<90) ones as isolated olivine. Some of isolated olivine show Fe-Mg zoning. FeO-poor objects (Type I chondrules and Isolated forsterites) contain 0.1-0.2wt% FeO, 0.1-0.8wt% Cr2O3 and 0-0.2 wt% MnO. FeO-rich objects (Type II chondrules and isolated olivines) contain 20-43wt% FeO, 00.5wt% Cr2O3 and 0.1-1.0wt% MnO (Fig. 1). The oxygen isotope ratios of olivine phenocrysts in chondrules, isolated forsterites and isolated olivines show wide variation from -28.94‰ to 9.41‰ in  18 O along the slope-1 lines of carbonaceous chondrite anhydrous mineral line (CCAM; [10]), Primitive Chondrule Minerals (PCM; [1]) and Young and Russell lines (Y&R; [11]) (Fig. 2). FeO-poor objects are richer in 16 O than FeO-rich objects. The  17 O values of FeOpoor objects are around -6‰ and those of FeO-rich objects are from -3‰ to +2‰ (Fig. 3). Discussion: Chondrules preserve oxygen isotope ratios of the solid reservoirs, but which may have been changed during aqueous alteration and thermal metamorphism on their parent bodies. Here we evaluate effects of aqueous alteration and thermal metamorphism and then compare the  17 O-Mg # trend of WIS91600 with those of other chondrites. Aqueous alteration: Bulk oxygen isotope ratios of WIS91600 are distributed along the TF line with 17‰ in  18 O as a result of aqueous alteration [12], which is clearly distinct from oxygen isotope ratios of chondrules (and fragments) (Fig. 2). This suggests oxygen isotope ratios of chondrules (and fragments) were not affected by aqueous alteration on the parent body. Although phyllosilicates are abundant in chondurles, we confirmed by SEM observation that the analyzed areas for oxygen isotope ratios are free of phyllosilicates and thus minimum effects of aqueous alteration on the oxygen data (Fig. 2). Thermal metamorphism: It is known that olivine in chondrules from primitive chondrites shows characteristics of (1) distinct bimodal distribution in FeO contents between type I and II chondrules and (2) wide variations from 0-1.0wt% in MnO and Cr2O3 contents for type I chondrules [13]. WIS91600 shows the same features (Fig. 1). This suggests MnO and Cr2O3 contents in olivine in chondrules have not been affected by thermal metamorphism. Oxygen diffusion in olivine is slower than those of Mn and Cr [14]. This suggests that oxygen isotope ratios of chondrules (and fragments) did not change during thermal metamorphism. 17O vs. Mg#: Chondrules in ordinary, enstatite and carbonaceous chondrite have been analyzed for oxygen isotopes in previous studies. For Acfer 094 (ungrouped C3.0) and Yamato-81020 (CO3.0), chondrules show a bimodal distribution of  17 O at ~-5‰ and ~-2‰ for chondrules with Mg # >96 and <96 [1-2]. For CR chondrites, FeO-poor chondrules show a monotonic increase of  17 O values from ~-5‰ to  ~-2‰ with decreasing Mg # from 99 to 94, and FeO-rich chondrules show  17 O from -2‰ to +2‰ [3-4]. Similar  17 O-Mg # trend is observed for Wild2 particles [15-18]. For ordinary and enstatite chondrites, chondrules have  17 O of ~+1‰ and 0‰ regardless of Mg #, respectively [5-6]. In WIS91600, FeO-poor objects with Mg # > 98 have  17 O of ~-6‰, FeO-rich objects with Mg # from 50 to 80 show  17 O from -3‰ to +2‰ (Fig. 3). Differently,  17 O values of chondrules from the Tagish Lake meteorite increase from ~-5‰ to ~-2‰ with decreasing Mg # from 99.5 to 97 [8]. This difference, however, is insignificant compared to the difference between other types of meteorites. The  17 O-Mg # trend of chondrules in meteorites from D-type asteroids are similar to chondrules in CR chondrites and Wild2 particles. In summary the oxygen isotope systematics of crystalline silicates in the Kuiper belt resemble those of chondrules in outer regions of the main asteroid belt, which implies chondrules formed in outer regions of the asteroid belt were transported to the Kuiper belt.
