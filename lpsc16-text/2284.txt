Observation:  The Linear Etalon Imaging Spectral Array (LEISA) component of New Horizons' Ralph instrument [1] provides spectral  coverage from 1.25 to 2.5 µm, at a resolving power (λ/Δλ) of 240.  LEISA's spectral dispersion is provided by a wedge filter affixed to the detector so as to give each column of the array a unique wavelength.  By scanning the array across the scene  in  the  wavelength-dispersion  direction  while recording a series of images, each part of the scene is eventually  imaged  in  each  wavelength,  enabling  a multi-spectral image cube to be assembled. The highest spatial resolution LEISA observation of Pluto, at about ~3 km/pixel was obtained by New Horizons at around 10:56 UT 2015 July 14, from a range of 47,000 km.  As shown in Fig. 1, the scan ran diagonally from the sunlit limb at mid-northern latitudes, southeast across  the  mountainous  contact  region  between  the large, dark, reddish expanse of Cthulhu Regio1 and the extremely bright and volatile ice-rich Sputnik Planum. These features are so large and conspicuous that their existence  had  already been  known from Earth-based observations,  enabling  the  encounter  sequence  to  be designed to reveal more about them. Results:  Maps of Pluto's various ices species were constructed from the LEISA observation by computing integrated areas, band depth ratios, or correlations with template spectra as described in [2].  These maps (e.g., Fig. 2) trace specific materials across Pluto's surface in a qualitative sense.  More quantitative abundance maps await pixel-by-pixel analysis of the individual spectra, using radiative transfer models to account for multiple scattering and particle  size effects,  a  computationally expensive process (see [3]). Fig. 2 shows H2O and CH4 ice maps of the region around Elliot  crater  and  Virgil  Fossa,  in  comparison with an albedo map based on New Horizons LORRI 1 All feature names throughout this abstract and the associated talk are informal.

The  crater  is  strikingly depleted  in H2O, while the fossa is rich in that material, which is non-volatile  at  Pluto surface  temperatures.   The  surrounding plains also show H2O ice absorption but less so to the north of Elliot, where the H2O gives way to CH4 ice.  The flat floor of Elliot is very rich in CH4, as are the north-facing portion of its inner rim and central peak. Another interesting region appears  in Fig. 3,  with maps of albedo, H2O, CH4, and highly volatile N2 ice. In  dark  Cthulhu Regio  at  lower  left,  H2O ice  has  a patchy distribution, and there is little or no N2 ice.  CH4 occurs  there,  but  mostly just  on  north-facing slopes. No H2O is seen in Sputnik Planum, but that area is rich in both N2 and CH4.  Interestingly, the N2 ice absorption in Sputnik does not appear to be spatially uniform (unfortunately this is a noisier map owing to the weakness of the N2 absorption band at 2.15 µm).  A region just north of Baré Montes shows particularly strong N2 absorption.   An  unnamed  crater  with  a  bright  floor stands out at upper left.  The bright floor material looks similar to Sputnik Planum, rich in both CH4 and N2. Despite  its  low  visible  wavelength  albedo,  Baré Montes  shows reasonably strong H2O ice  absorption and little CH4 or N2.  H2O ice was expected in mountainous  regions,  since  the  more  volatile  ices  are  too ductile for large, enduring edifices to be built of them. But its distribution in the various mountain ranges in this  region  is  curious,  tending to  be  associated  with south-facing slopes.  It  appears to be masked by CH4 ice on north-facing slopes. At mid-northern latitudes, as in Fig. 4, the distributions of CH4 and H2O ices often appear anti-correlated. Many craters show bright rims with strong CH4 absorption, while their dark floors show H2O absorption.  A possible explanation for this CH4 distribution is that it preferentially condenses from the atmosphere on topographic highs and regions with high albedos. This co-occurrence of H2O absorption with visually dark  regions  is  seen  widely across  Pluto,  with Baré Montes and Cthulhu Regio providing good examples in Fig. 3.  It  is unclear whether the H2O plus tholins responsible for darkening the crater floors actually accumulate there (perhaps arriving as wind-blown dust), or are generally representative of Pluto's subsurface materials but are seen to outcrop only in regions such as crater  floors  where  they  are  least  likely  to  become coated by volatile ices, owing to the local thermal environment.
