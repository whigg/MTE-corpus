TESTING THEAXIAL DYNAMOHYPOTHESIS FOR THEMOONBYMODELING THEDIRECTIONOF CRUSTALMAGNETIZATION. Joana S. Oliveira1 and Mark A. Wieczorek1, 1 Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, Universite´ ParisDiderot, 75205 Paris. (oliveira@ipgp.fr).Introduction Magnetic field maps of the Moon showthat there are strong magnetic anomalies of crustal origindistributed heterogeneously across the lunar surface [1,2].However, the origin of the field that magnetized the crust is stillcontroversial, with some proposing that the Moon once had aglobal dipolar magnetic field generated by a core dynamo [35], and others suggesting a more exotic origin related to impactevents [6]. If the Moon possessed a core dynamo in its past, itwould likely be largely dipolar with its symmetry axis alignedwith the lunar rotation axis. In this case the direction of crustalmagnetization would vary with planetary latitude, just as onEarth.We test the hypothesis that the Moon once had an axial,dipolar magnetic field by modeling the direction of crustalmagnetization spacecraft-derived magnetic field data. Fromthe direction of magnetization, we calculate the corresponding"paleopole", which we define as the north geomagnetic poleof a predominantly dipolar core-generated field when theanomaly was formed. If the paleopoles all correspond tothe present-day geographic poles, this would be consistentwith a dipolar magnetic field generated by a core dynamo.If the paleopoles all cluster about an axis that is offset fromthe current rotation axis, this would also be consistent with acore-generated dipolar field, but with a subsequent episode oftrue polar wander [1]. Alternatively, if the paleopoles do notcluster, then this could either be a result of the Moon having apredominantly quadrupolar field, or of an impact origin.Previous studies have attempted to investigate the originand direction of crustal magnetization by utilizing simplifyingassumptions about the location and geometry of magneticsources. These models have included point dipoles [1], circulardisks [7], and elliptical prisms [8], and were often applied tosimple, isolated, magnetic anomalies. The results of suchstudies are highly non-unique, and are critically dependenton the validity of the assumed source geometry. As mostlunar magnetic anomalies are complex, these approaches arenot appropriate for large portions of the lunar crust. In thiswork, we utilize an approach originally developed by Parker[9] that largely bypasses the non-uniqueness associated withspecifying the geometry of the magnetic sources. In thismethod, the strength of magnetization is allowed to vary withposition, and it is only assumed that the direction of crustalmagnetization is constant in direction within the crust.Method We make use of the approach developed by [9]that was previously used to study seamount magnetization onEarth. To date, this approach has not yet been applied toany other planetary body. In this method, many dipoles areplaced over a localized region on the surface, all with thesame common direction, M(si) = mˆ m(si), where mˆ is thedirection of magnetization, and where m(si) is the dipolemoment at position si. It can be shown that the distributionof unidirectional dipoles on the surface of the planet ismathematically equivalent to unidirection dipoles placed atarbitrary depths within the crust. The only assumptionof the model is that when the region acquired a remnantmagnetization, the main field was constant in direction.The magnetic field d at observation point j is given bydj =∑Ndi=1gj(si)m(si), j = 1, ..., Nowith,gj(si) =µ04pi∑Ndi=1(3mˆ·(rj−si)rˆj ·(rj−si)rj−si5 −mˆ·rˆjrj−si3)where No and Nd are the number of observations andsurface dipoles, and rj and si are the vector positionsof the observations and dipoles relative to a fixed origin,respectively. We emphasize that no assumptions about theintensity of magnetized sources, source geometry, or statisticaldistributions are made, which is the main strength of themethod. The above two equations can be written in matrixformd = G(mˆ)mwhere the matrix G depends upon the assumed direction ofmagnetization mˆ, d is a vector of the observations, and m isa vector that contains the (positive) magnitudes of the surfacedipoles. We solve form using the method of non-negative leastsquares [10], and as discussed by [9], if there areNo magneticfield observations, a maximum ofNo of theNd surface dipoleswill be non-zero. The non-negative least squares approachnaturally finds which dipoles are non-zero, as well as theirintensity.For each direction of magnetization, we invert the abovematrix equation, determine the best fit magnetic field andthe rms misfit between the observations and model. Themagnetization direction is converted to the north magneticpaleopole, and we then plot the model misfit as a function ofpaleopole direction. This modeling approach can give rise tostrong edge effects, where large model magnetic anomaliesare present exterior to the region being modeled. To minimizethese effects, we place surface dipoles within a circle of angularradius θd, and calculate the model misfit within a circle oflarger angular radius θo.Results For our inversions, we use the global griddedmagnetic field maps of [2] at 30 km altitude that arebased on both Lunar Prospector and Kaguya magnetometerobservations. These maps have a spatial resolution of 15 km,whereas maps developed at the surface have a higher spatialresolution of 6 km. Three different magnetic anomalies areconsidered for our preliminary inversions: Reiner-γ (58.3◦E,7.5◦N), Hayford (171.9◦E, 13.4◦N) and Descartes (16.0◦E,10.7◦S). Figure 1 shows the results of Parker’s inversionapplied to those anomalies. In the left hand column, we plotthe observations, the locations of the observations used in theinversion, and the two circles that enclose the observationpoints and surface dipoles. The middle column shows thebest fitting modeled field, along with the points where dipoleswere placed on the surface. The right hand column shows the2288.pdf

For eachanomaly, the data points and thelocations of dipoles used in theinversion are denoted by dotsin the left and middle diagrams,respectively.locations of the non-zero magnitude surface dipoles and theirintensities. In these simulations, a distance of 0.5◦ was usedto separate the two circles that enclose the surface dipoles andobservations.The misfit values (at 30 km altitude) obtained for Reinerγ, Hayford and Descartes are 0.57, 0.90, 0.48 nT, respectively,which is smaller than the 1.5 nT estimated uncertainty of themagnetic field maps [2]. The right hand column in Figure 1shows that most of the retained dipoles have low magnetizationintensities, and the strongest dipole moments are generallylocated where the strongest magnetic fields are found. Theglobal misfit as a function of the north paleopole location arecomputed for each studied anomaly, and the results are shownfor Reiner-γ in Figure 2.0.000.250.500.751.001.251.501.752.002.252.50nTFigure 2: Misfit as a function of paleopole location for theReiner-γ anomaly. The white circle indicates the best-fit paleopoleposition, and the white curve is the 1 nT contour.The best-fit paleopole positions obtained for the Reinerγ, Hayford and Decartes anomalies are (176◦W, 82◦N),(66◦W , 82◦S) and (99◦W, 19◦S), respectively. Two of theseanomalies give paleopole positions close to the actual rotationaxis, which is supportive of a global core-generated magneticfield in the past. Though the best fit paleopole location forDescartes is inconsistent with an axial dipole field, we havenot yet evaluated the uncertainty associated with our paleopolelocations.Conclusions The paleopole positions for the Reiner-γ andDescartes anomalies are slightly closer to the lunar rotationaxis in comparison to the results obtained by [1] who modeledthese anomalies by a single dipole. For the Hayford anomalywe obtain a difference in paloepole latitude of 20◦ withrespect to [1], with our paleopole position being closer tothe rotation axis. Two of the three anomalies investigated inthis study have paleopole positions close to the lunar rotationaxis, which could be taken as supporting evidence for a pastcore-generated dynamo field aligned with the rotation axis.Though the third anomaly is apparently inconsistent with anaxial dipolar magnetic field, we have not yet estimated theuncertainty of the paloepole location, and it remains possiblethat the Moon might have had an episode of true polar wanderin its past [e.g. 1]. We are currently applying this technique toa larger number of lunar anomalies that should help us resolvewhether the lunar magnetic field was predominantly dipolar ornot.References [1] Takahashi F. et al.
