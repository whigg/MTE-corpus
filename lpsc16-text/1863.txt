Chondrules, main constituents of chondrites are thought to have form by repetitive and brief heating phases between 1450°C and 1850°C [1]. They hold mostly olivine and pyroxene which textures are strongly dependent on oxygen fugacity and cooling rates that they were submitted to. In olivines from every type of chondrule, as well as in olivines isolated in the chondrites matrix, glass inclusions can be found. These inclusions resemble terrestrial magmatic inclusions by being spherically shaped and often containing a shrinkage bubble. As for terrestrial samples, they can be found as clusters or isolated inside olivines. However, they are smaller than terrestrial average [2][3]. Studying these inclusions can help understanding chondrules formation processes.  Terrestrial melt inclusions have been much studied since the end of the 19th century in order to better understand igneous rocks and magmatic mineral formation [4][5]. Since then, melt inclusions were also studied to determine pre-eruptive conditions of magmas [6][7].  In order to address how glass inclusions may have formed in olivines from chondrules, the Liquid Condensation Model was proposed [8]. Indeed, the measured glass inclusions have chemical compositions that are not at equilibrium with their host olivine. Thus the model rests on formation of host olivine in an open system, from surrounding gas interacting with a small liquid droplet that allows olivine to grow. Inclusions would then be trapped from the resulting thin layer left around grown olivine. However, a recent study shows that it is possible to experimentally synthesize such inclusions from slow crystallization from magma and that those exotic compositions can be explained by metastable equilibrium [9]. Therefore, our study is focused on the determination of the chemical composition of olivine glass inclusions in chondrites. In order to recover melt inclusions chemical composition, it is necessary to re-melt them inside of their host to remove the bubble, the olivine overgrowth that formed on their walls and any daughter crystal that could have form while cooling. This is called homogenization and is very used for terrestrial inclusions [10][11]. Afterwards, a quench prevents any mineral crystallization from the melt and gives access to the original composition of the inclusion.  Homogenization experiments were performed on olivines from type I chondrules (with Mg-rich olivines) of Allende CV3 chondrite  up to 1450°C but no glassy state was reached [3][8]. Chondrules from olivines are thought to have form above 1600°C, thus in order to try homogenizing at higher temperatures, a new device is needed. Vernadsky and Linkam heating stages used for terrestrial samples cannot reach such temperature nor a fO2 reductive enough. We thus built a new high temperature heating stage. The stage can be placed under a microscope for in situ observations and can reach a temperature of 2800°C and very low fO2 (10-6 atm O2 at 1700°C), thanks to a tungsten furnace. Experiments were performed on olivines from Allende type I chondrules, extracted from a thick section with a MicroMill Sampling System after SEM characterization. The experiments were done at very low fO2 and calibrated with Au, Pd and Pt to account for the thermal gradient inside the olivine. Inclusions were then analyzed with EMPA and calibrated SEM. Samples were heated to different temperatures up to 1750°C but no homogenization was observed. However, SEM measurements revealed that even after heating at such temperatures, inclusions still hold high Na2O values, up to 8 wt% (Fig. 1), relatively similar to those of unheated inclusions.    Figure 1 : Na2O (wt%) values from heated glass inclusions trapped in Mg-rich olivines from Allende CV3 chondrules in regard to the maximum reached temperatures. Empty circles data are from [8]. Full circles are from this study.  Sodium is considered moderately volatile on Earth but at such high temperatures, it is highly volatile. Thus, this suggests that every heated inclusion behaved as a closed system. Therefore, we can assume that all trapped inclusions studied here contain a liquid whose chemical composition remained unchanged since trapping. These data also suggest that olivines were formed 1863.pdf

in a Na-rich environment, as suggest in [12]. At such temperature, this also implies that pressure is high enough to keep such high amounts of Na2O in liquids surrounding olivines while they form. This is in agreement with recent studies suggesting that olivines cannot have formed in a canonic nebula [13]. The preliminary results of this study thus seem a further argument to consider olivines formation under pressure and at least, in conditions far from a canonical nebula. It also allows concluding that glass inclusions behave as closed system and, as such, can be used as tools to constraint chemical and physical conditions of chondrules formation.
