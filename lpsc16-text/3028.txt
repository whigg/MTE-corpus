Introduction: High-resolution near-infrared observations of carbon monoxide (CO) gas in absorption have been shown to enable precise comparisons between carbon and oxygen isotopic reservoirs toward low-mass (solar-type) young stellar objets (YSOs) within ∼ 1 kiloparsec (kpc) of the Sun [1-3]. Results with such observations have revealed signatures of CO self shielding - supportive evidence for this process on disk surfaces [2,3,4] - and significant heterogeneity in [12CO]/[13CO], with possible interplay between CO ice and gas reservoirs as a cause [3,5,6]. Precise ratios of [12C18O]/[12C17O] have also been used to argue for supernova enrichment in the early solar system [7], and comparison between low-mass binary systems and embedded protostars suggest carbon isotopic homogeneity within a few hundred AU [8]. Here we present results from our ongoing observational survey of CO isotopologues toward massive YSOs along a galactic gradient. Unlike their low-mass counterparts, massive YSOs are observational tracers of regions with high-UV fluxes, span a larger observational range in Galactocentric radius (RGC), and enable robust comparisons to other carbon reservoirs along the same lines of sight. These targets thereby provide robust observational comparisons with solartype YSOs, helping to shed light on key chemical reservoirs involved protoplanetary and prebiotic evolutionary pathways. Observations and Methods: We have thus far observed 14 massive YSO targets with Keck-NIRSPEC (R∼ 25, 000). Targets span in RGC from 4.5 to 9.7 kpc and range in luminosity from ∼ 1×103 to ∼ 4.7×105 LSun. Fundamental (v = 1−0) and first overtone (v = 2 − 0) rovibrational spectra were reduced using our customized IDL pipeline (example, Figure 1). Equivalent widths (Wν) for each isotopologue line were computed using polynomial + Gaussian fits (sample fits, Figure 1). For 12C18O and 12C17O lines, column densities (NJ ) were calculated directly using the optically thin relation, Wν = (πe2/mec2)fJNJ [9], with fJ representing the absorption oscillator strength for the J th transition. A curve of growth (example, Figure 2, top) relatingWν toNJ , was used in conjunction with a rotational analysis (example, Figure 2, bottom) to find the best-fit Doppler broadening parameter (b) for each YSO; this b was then used to derive NJ values for the 12CO and 13CO lines.

Results and discussion: Derived ratios of [12CO]/[13CO] for the four fully analyzed massive YSOs thus far - AFGL 2136 [10], MonR2 IRS3, NGC 7538 IRS9, and W3 IRS5; RGC from 6.1 to 9.7 kpc - are shown in Figure 3, which plots 12C/13C against RGC. For the massive YSOs, we find that the [12CO]/[13CO] derived from the cold gas (T ∼5 to 60 K) consistently follows the predicted Galactic trend for [12C/13C], unlike the significant dispersion previously found in the low-mass sources at ∼ 8 kpc [3,8]. Further, the cold-gas [12CO]/[13CO] are consistently lower than the solid-phase [12CO2]/[13CO2] [11] for the same lines of sight, which suggests that CO2 may not originate directly from CO reservoirs as previously assumed [12]. For massive YSOs with two-temperature distributions, warm-gas [12CO]/[13CO] ratios are consistently higher than those from the cold gas, a trend we also see in the low-mass targets, suggesting that there may be similar temperature-dependent CO fractionation pathways for both high- and low-mass YSOs. Our [12CO]/[13CO] ratio for W3 IRS5 (103 ± 4) is significantly higher than that derived from radio observations of 12C18O  -4.5 -5.0 -5.5 -6.0 -6.5 8.58.07.57.06.56.0 (1-0) 12C17O (1-0) 12C18O (2-0) 12C16O (1-0) 13C16O log10(NJfJ 1) lo g 1 0(W /) Curve of Growth MonR2 IRS3 b = 4 km s -1 b = 6 km s -1 b = 8 km s -1 40 35 30 6004002000 b = 8 km/s 137 +/- 19 High-temperature 51+/- 13 Low-temperature [12C16O]/[13C16O] 12C17O 12C18O 134 K 186 K 5 K 202 K 13C16O 12C16O 13 K 147 K E/k (K) Ln (N J/( 2J +1 )) MonR2 IRS3 Figure 2: Analysis for massive YSO MonR2 IRS3.

This discrepancy could be due to a higher photodissociation rate for 12C18O [14]. We find a mass-independent trend in oxygen isotopes for W3 IRS5 (Figure 4), suggesting that CO self-shielding could affect the evolution of oxygen isotopes in protoplanetary disks surrounding both massive and solar-type YSOs. Conclusions: Our high-resolution observations of CO toward massive YSOs across the Galaxy thus far show ratios [12CO]/[13CO] with significantly less dispersion off the predicted Galactic trend than low-mass YSOs. We find signatures of CO self-shielding in both high- and low-mass YSOs, and similar trends between beteween CO ice and gas reservoirs. Together, our results suggest that massive YSOs may follow dissimilar pathways in certain phases of evolution in protoplanetary carbon and oxygen as compared to solar-type systems. Further, our observational suggestion that CO2 may not originate from CO should be considered in evaluating carbon-based pathways for protoplanetary and prebiotic compounds.
