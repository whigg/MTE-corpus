Resultswith such observations have revealed signatures of COself shielding - supportive evidence for this processon disk surfaces [2,3,4] - and significant heterogeneity in [12CO]/[13CO], with possible interplay betweenCO ice and gas reservoirs as a cause [3,5,6]. Preciseratios of [12C18O]/[12C17O] have also been used to argue for supernova enrichment in the early solar system[7], and comparison between low-mass binary systemsand embedded protostars suggest carbon isotopic homogeneity within a few hundred AU [8].Here we present results from our ongoing observational survey of CO isotopologues toward massiveYSOs along a galactic gradient. Unlike their low-masscounterparts, massive YSOs are observational tracersof regions with high-UV fluxes, span a larger observational range in Galactocentric radius (RGC), andenable robust comparisons to other carbon reservoirsalong the same lines of sight. These targets therebyprovide robust observational comparisons with solartype YSOs, helping to shed light on key chemicalreservoirs involved protoplanetary and prebiotic evolutionary pathways.Observations and Methods: We have thus far observed 14 massive YSO targets with Keck-NIRSPEC(R∼ 25, 000). Targets span in RGC from 4.5 to 9.7 kpcand range in luminosity from ∼ 1×103 to ∼ 4.7×105LSun. Fundamental (v = 1−0) and first overtone (v =2 − 0) rovibrational spectra were reduced using ourcustomized IDL pipeline (example, Figure 1). Equivalent widths (Wν) for each isotopologue line were computed using polynomial + Gaussian fits (sample fits,Figure 1). For 12C18O and 12C17O lines, column densities (NJ ) were calculated directly using the opticallythin relation, Wν = (pie2/mec2)fJNJ [9], with fJrepresenting the absorption oscillator strength for theJ th transition. A curve of growth (example, Figure 2,top) relatingWν toNJ , was used in conjunction with arotational analysis (example, Figure 2, bottom) to findthe best-fit Doppler broadening parameter (b) for eachYSO; this b was then used to derive NJ values for the12CO and 13CO lines.

For the massive YSOs, we find thatthe [12CO]/[13CO] derived from the cold gas (T ∼5to 60 K) consistently follows the predicted Galactictrend for [12C/13C], unlike the significant dispersionpreviously found in the low-mass sources at ∼ 8 kpc[3,8]. Further, the cold-gas [12CO]/[13CO] are consistently lower than the solid-phase [12CO2]/[13CO2][11] for the same lines of sight, which suggeststhat CO2 may not originate directly from CO reservoirs as previously assumed [12]. For massiveYSOs with two-temperature distributions, warm-gas[12CO]/[13CO] ratios are consistently higher thanthose from the cold gas, a trend we also see in thelow-mass targets, suggesting that there may be similartemperature-dependent CO fractionation pathways forboth high- and low-mass YSOs. Our [12CO]/[13CO]ratio for W3 IRS5 (103 ± 4) is significantly higherthan that derived from radio observations of 12C18O3028.pdf

Thisdiscrepancy could be due to a higher photodissociationrate for 12C18O [14]. We find a mass-independenttrend in oxygen isotopes for W3 IRS5 (Figure 4),suggesting that CO self-shielding could affect theevolution of oxygen isotopes in protoplanetary diskssurrounding both massive and solar-type YSOs.Conclusions: Our high-resolution observations ofCO toward massive YSOs across the Galaxy thus farshow ratios [12CO]/[13CO] with significantly less dispersion off the predicted Galactic trend than low-massYSOs. We find signatures of CO self-shielding in bothhigh- and low-mass YSOs, and similar trends betweenbeteween CO ice and gas reservoirs. Together, our results suggest that massive YSOs may follow dissimilarpathways in certain phases of evolution in protoplanetary carbon and oxygen as compared to solar-type systems. Further, our observational suggestion that CO2may not originate from CO should be considered inevaluating carbon-based pathways for protoplanetaryand prebiotic compounds.Figure 3: Ratios of 12C/13C vs. RGC (kpc) for our massiveYSOs in this study (boxed, RGC∼6 to 10 kpc), data fromthe literature [15-19], and COGas from the high-resolutionCRIRES survey at ∼ 8 kpc [2,3,8].
