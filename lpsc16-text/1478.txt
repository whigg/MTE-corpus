NANOSIMS AND TEM INVESTIGATIONS OF SUPERNOVA SIC GRAINS. J. Kodolányi1, C. Vollmer2, P.Hoppe1 and  M.  Müller3,  1Max Planck  Institute  for  Chemistry (Hahn-Meitner-Weg  1,  55128  Mainz,  Germany;j.kodolanyi@mpic.de), 2Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster (Corrensstrasse 24, 48149 Münster, Germany),3Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research (Ackermannweg 10, 55128 Mainz, Germany).Introduction: About  1  % of presolar  SiC grainsare the so-called X and C grains which have a supernova  (SN)  origin  [see  1  and  references  therein].  SNderived SiC grains are key to our understanding of condensation  of  C-rich  dust  in  SN ejecta,  yet  only fewstudies have so far been dedicated to their nanotexture,an important record of condensation conditions [2–4].The detailed investigation by [2]  showed that  SiC Xgrains consist of inclusion-poor, mostly cubic crystals(3C  polytype)  of  60–460  nm diameter,  which  oftenform oriented overgrowths. Besides 3C the only polytypes observed in SN-derived SiC grains are the hexagonal  2H [2,3,5]  and  the trigonal  15R [4],  which areboth very rare. Hynes et al. [2] proposed that the smaller crystal size of X grains relative to that of grains fromasymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars was the result ofmore  rapid  condensation  in  SN ejecta  than  in  AGBwinds. Here we provide new constraints on the condensation of SiC in SN ejecta through the study of the internal structure of 6 X grains and a C grain.Procedure and analytical  methods: Selection ofsupernova SiC grains:  SiC grains of SN origin wereidentified in two mounts of an SiC grain separate of theMurchison meteorite (“Mur2012B”), based on their Siisotope compositions.  The grains’ Si (and C) isotopecomposition  was determined  using ion  imaging withthe  NanoSIMS  50  of  the  Max  Planck  Institite  forChemistry,  Mainz  [6,7].  We selected  7  large  (>  0.7µm) X and C grains for later study with the transmission electron microscope.  Five of the selected grainswere  further  analyzed  with  the  NanoSIMS  after  ionimaging, to obtain their N isotope composition.Preparation of electron transparent lamellae: Electron-transparent slices of the selected grains were prepared by a 0.050–20 nA focused Ga+ ion beam (FIB;instrument: FEI Nova 600) at the Max Planck Institutefor Polymer Research, Mainz. The slices were mountedon Cu grids with a micromanipulator [cf. 3].Transmission electron microscopy (TEM): The FIBlamellae  were  investigated  with  a  Zeiss  Libra  200FEtransmission electron microscope (200 kV accelerationvoltage)  equipped  with a  Köhler  illumination systemand an in-column Omega energy filter at the MünsterUniversity.  Besides bright and dark field imaging wealso recorded selected area diffraction (SAD) patternson the grains in different stage tilt positions, which enabled  the  accurate  determination  of  the  polytype(s)and, in case of polycrystalline grains, the determinationof the relative orientation of different grain domains.All bright field and SAD images were recorded in energy-filtered mode with the energy slit centered over thezero loss peak to reduce background noise from inelastically scattered electrons. We also used energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) to determine the minorelement concentrations of the studied grains and to infer the chemistry of inclusions.Figure 1.

Error bars: 1σ.Results: Out of the imaged ca. 4000 SiC grains ofthe two studied mounts we identified  56  X and 3 Cgrains. All but one of the grains selected for TEM workhave Si, C (and, where available, N) isotope compositions  typical  of  X  and  C  grains  (Fig.  1).  GrainGE2_2.17a,  although  depleted  in  28Si,  like  other  Xgrains, has a very low 12C/13C ratio of 8.5 ± 0.04, atypical of X grains.Two of the 7 grains investigated with TEM are single crystals of the 3C polytype. The other 5 grains areaggregates of crystals of the same hexagonal polytype(6H, 2 grains) or of more than one different polytypes(3C + 2H, 3C + 6H; 1 and 2 grains, respectively). Thesize of individual crystals, or grain domains, of polycrystalline  grains  varies  between  ~50  and  ~500  nm(Fig. 2a). Domains with a longer diameter of 150–200nm are the most common.

growth of grain domains on one another in 3 grains.Stacking  faults  were  observed  in  4  of  the  7  grains,mostly in 3C domains (Fig. 2b). Twinning occurs in 1grain.Inclusions are rare. We found an isometric, Fe- andNi-rich  inclusion  of  about  10  nm diameter  in  grainGB1_1.1a, and an isometric, 20 nm diameter TiC inclusion in GE2_2.17a (Figs. 2c and d).Figure 2.

Discussion: Our findings regarding the domain sizeand inclusion content of SiC grains from SN ejecta aresimilar  to  those  of  [2].  However,  we  find  that  thehexagonal polytypes are more common among our SNderived SiC grains than reported by the same authorsfor SiC X grains (1 out of 7 grains contained SiC ofhexagonal symmetry) and by [17] for the presolar SiCpopulation as  a  whole (~20 % of the grains  containhexagonal  SiC  crystal  or  crystals).  In  addition,  wefound evidence for the wide-spread occurrence of the6H polytype (Fig. 3) among our grains, which has notbeen reported in presolar SiC before. Whether the discrepancy between the previous and the present studiesis significant is unclear because of the low number ofgrains  investigated  (excluding rare  SiC inclusions  inSN graphites only 10 individual SiC grains of SN origin have been subject to structural analysis before ourwork [2–4]).Figure 3. SAD pattern of a 6H SiC domain of X grain GB4_3.3The 3C polytype of SiC has been found to form athigher supersaturation and higher Si/C in the gas phaseand lower T than most hexagonal polytypes,  such as6H  [e.g.,  18].  The  higher  abundance  of  hexagonalpolytypes among SiC grains of SN origin (~70 % if weconsider only our data and ~40 % if data from [2–4]are also included) than among those from AGB winds(~20 % [17]) may thus indicate that a lower supersaturation in the condensing gas is more common in the SNejecta sampled by the X and C grains than in the windsof AGB stars.  Furthermore,  the occurence of the 6Hpolytype among the SN grains may indicate that crystallization extends to higher T in SN ejecta than in thewinds of AGB stars.Acknowledgements: We  are  grateful  to  AntjeSorowka,  Christa  Sudek and Wataru Fujiya  for  theirhelp with sample preparation, and Elmar Gröner for hisassistance  with  the  NanoSIMS  analyses.
