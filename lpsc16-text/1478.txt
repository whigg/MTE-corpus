Introduction: About  1  % of presolar  SiC grains are the so-called X and C grains which have a supernova  (SN)  origin  [see  1  and  references  therein].  SNderived SiC grains are key to our understanding of condensation  of  C-rich  dust  in  SN ejecta,  yet  only few studies have so far been dedicated to their nanotexture, an important record of condensation conditions [2-4]. The detailed investigation by [2]  showed that  SiC X grains consist of inclusion-poor, mostly cubic crystals (3C  polytype)  of  60-460  nm diameter,  which  often form oriented overgrowths. Besides 3C the only polytypes observed in SN-derived SiC grains are the hexagonal  2H [2,3,5]  and  the trigonal  15R [4],  which are both very rare. Hynes et al. [2] proposed that the smaller crystal size of X grains relative to that of grains from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars was the result of more  rapid  condensation  in  SN ejecta  than  in  AGB winds. Here we provide new constraints on the condensation of SiC in SN ejecta through the study of the internal structure of 6 X grains and a C grain. Procedure and analytical  methods: Selection of supernova SiC grains:  SiC grains of SN origin were identified in two mounts of an SiC grain separate of the Murchison meteorite ("Mur2012B"), based on their Si isotope compositions.  The grains' Si (and C) isotope composition  was determined  using ion  imaging with the  NanoSIMS  50  of  the  Max  Planck  Institite  for Chemistry,  Mainz  [6,7].  We selected  7  large  (>  0.7 µm) X and C grains for later study with the transmission electron microscope.  Five of the selected grains were  further  analyzed  with  the  NanoSIMS  after  ion imaging, to obtain their N isotope composition. Preparation of electron transparent lamellae: Electron-transparent slices of the selected grains were prepared by a 0.050-20 nA focused Ga+ ion beam (FIB; instrument: FEI Nova 600) at the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research, Mainz. The slices were mounted on Cu grids with a micromanipulator [cf. 3]. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM): The FIB lamellae  were  investigated  with  a  Zeiss  Libra  200FE transmission electron microscope (200 kV acceleration voltage)  equipped  with a  Köhler  illumination system and an in-column Omega energy filter at the Münster University.  Besides bright and dark field imaging we also recorded selected area diffraction (SAD) patterns on the grains in different stage tilt positions, which enabled  the  accurate  determination  of  the  polytype(s) and, in case of polycrystalline grains, the determination of the relative orientation of different grain domains. All bright field and SAD images were recorded in energy-filtered mode with the energy slit centered over the zero loss peak to reduce background noise from inelastically scattered electrons. We also used energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) to determine the minor element concentrations of the studied grains and to infer the chemistry of inclusions. Figure 1.

Error bars: 1σ. Results: Out of the imaged ca. 4000 SiC grains of the two studied mounts we identified  56  X and 3 C grains. All but one of the grains selected for TEM work have Si, C (and, where available, N) isotope compositions  typical  of  X  and  C  grains  (Fig.  1).  Grain GE2_2.17a,  although  depleted  in  28Si,  like  other  X grains, has a very low 12C/13C ratio of 8.5 ± 0.04, atypical of X grains. Two of the 7 grains investigated with TEM are single crystals of the 3C polytype. The other 5 grains are aggregates of crystals of the same hexagonal polytype (6H, 2 grains) or of more than one different polytypes (3C + 2H, 3C + 6H; 1 and 2 grains, respectively). The size of individual crystals, or grain domains, of polycrystalline  grains  varies  between  ~50  and  ~500  nm (Fig. 2a). Domains with a longer diameter of 150-200 nm are the most common. We observed oriented over growth of grain domains on one another in 3 grains. Stacking  faults  were  observed  in  4  of  the  7  grains, mostly in 3C domains (Fig. 2b). Twinning occurs in 1 grain. Inclusions are rare. We found an isometric, Fe- and Ni-rich  inclusion  of  about  10  nm diameter  in  grain GB1_1.1a, and an isometric, 20 nm diameter TiC inclusion in GE2_2.17a (Figs. 2c and d).

Discussion: Our findings regarding the domain size and inclusion content of SiC grains from SN ejecta are similar  to  those  of  [2].  However,  we  find  that  the hexagonal polytypes are more common among our SNderived SiC grains than reported by the same authors for SiC X grains (1 out of 7 grains contained SiC of hexagonal symmetry) and by [17] for the presolar SiC population as  a  whole (~20 % of the grains  contain hexagonal  SiC  crystal  or  crystals).  In  addition,  we found evidence for the wide-spread occurrence of the 6H polytype (Fig. 3) among our grains, which has not been reported in presolar SiC before. Whether the discrepancy between the previous and the present studies is significant is unclear because of the low number of grains  investigated  (excluding rare  SiC inclusions  in SN graphites only 10 individual SiC grains of SN origin have been subject to structural analysis before our work [2-4]). Figure 3. SAD pattern of a 6H SiC domain of X grain GB4_3.3 The 3C polytype of SiC has been found to form at higher supersaturation and higher Si/C in the gas phase and lower T than most hexagonal polytypes,  such as 6H  [e.g.,  18].  The  higher  abundance  of  hexagonal polytypes among SiC grains of SN origin (~70 % if we consider only our data and ~40 % if data from [2-4] are also included) than among those from AGB winds (~20 % [17]) may thus indicate that a lower supersaturation in the condensing gas is more common in the SN ejecta sampled by the X and C grains than in the winds of AGB stars.  Furthermore,  the occurence of the 6H polytype among the SN grains may indicate that crystallization extends to higher T in SN ejecta than in the winds of AGB stars.
