 Introduction:. Certain EH3 chondrites have been described as primitive breccias because they contain fragments of chondrules, shock-melt veins of Fe metal and troilite with eutectoid intergrowths, and finegrained aggregates that are interpretated as having formed through impact processes [1]. Impact-formed fine-grained aggregates within breccias are consistent with multiple episodes of parent-body disaggregation and reassembly [2] or perhaps regolith gardening not involving total disaggregation [3]. We report new examples of such aggregates in EL3 MacAlpine Hills 88136 (MAC 88136) and EH3 Larkman Nunatuk 06252 (LAR 06252).  The aggregates are similar in size to chondrules and metal-sulfide nodules, and consist of metal, sulfide, and silicate fragments (Fig. 1). Our goal is to describe these rounded aggregates and to interpret the implications of their occurrence and mineralogy for processes that may have occurred on the EH and EL parent bodies. Methods:  Element maps and high-resolution images of the aggregates were made with two field-emission-source scanning electron microscopes (SEMs) equipped with energy-dispersive spectrometers. Quantitative analysis was performed with a JEOL JXA-8600 electron microprobe using wavelength-dispersive spectrometry. Results:  The aggregates consist of 5 to 40 Âµm opaque and non-opaque fragments, which together form a fine-grained matrix (Fig. 1). The fragments in LAR 06252 are dominated by Fe-Ni metal, troilite, niningerite, pyroxene, SiO2, and albite. Both high- and low-FeO pyroxene occur adjacent to one another. In MAC 88136, the fragments are pyroxene, troilite, and Fe-Ni metal. Pyroxene within the MAC 88136 aggregate contain ~4 wt. % Fe, whereas Fe is below detection in pyroxene outside the aggregate. Most silicate fragments in the MAC 88136 aggregate are rounded or granular (Fig. 1A, B). In contrast, the silicate fragment shapes range from spheroidal to elongate and lath-like in LAR 06252 (Fig. 1C, D). The LAR 06252 aggregate consists of two distinct regions separated by a third region with higher concentration of kamacite and troilite. To the left of this region the opaque minerals are ~50% niningerite and troilite surrounding silicates with angular morphologies. To the right of this region the opaques are dominated by kamacite, with minor troilite, and the silicates are more granular (Fig. 1D). Discussion:  Although these aggregates may result from multiple episodes of asteroid disaggregation and reassembly [2], smaller impacts could create them through the process of regolith gardening. Such primitive breccia has been proposed to represent immature regolith [3]. The mineralogical differences between the EH3 aggregates (present work and [1]) and the EL3 MAC 88136 aggregate shows that they formed in their respective EH and EL environments (i.e., they have the same redox state as the parent bodies and thus are not exotic objects). The EH3 meteorite as a whole and its aggregates are more reduced than the EL3 meteorite. Not only is the Si content of the metal higher in the EH3 aggregates than the EL3 aggregate, but the EL3 aggregate lacks Mg and Mn sulfides. Thermodynamic modelling suggests such sulfides can form from silicates between 1400 and 1600 K, with the fS2 buffered by kamacite and troilite, but only in H-depleted environments [4]. One such environment may be the EH regolith. The niningerite and silica replacing the more angular and lath-like pyroxene in the left region of the EH3 aggregate suggest that the left side experienced higher fS2 than the right side. The partial sulfidation of this aggregate indicates the process occurred only locally, perhaps as pockets of S-rich gas are generated by impact heating within regolith. Even smaller areas of sulfidation were observed in the fine-grained EH3 matrix [5]. Conclusions:  The impact-formed aggregates  consist of fragments reflecting the mineralogy of the much larger EH and EL chondrules and metal-sulfide nodules, respectively. The occurrence of these aggregates is interpreted as evidence for regolith gardening and possible dissagregation that occurred prior to the final accretion and lithification of the meteorites. Such primitive regolith is one possible environment that could satisfy the conditions required for silicate sulfidation. References: [1] Lehner, S. W., and P. R. Buseck, (2009).
