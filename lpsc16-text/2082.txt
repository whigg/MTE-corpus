McEwen1, 1Lunar & Planetary Laboratory, University of Arizona, 1629 E University Blvd. Tucson, AZ 85721.   Introduction & Background: We are analyzing and mapping a geologic facies that we are calling 'crater concentric ridges' or CCRs. This facies is generally found around small (1-10 km), fresh craters in the lunar maria [1]. CCRs appear as short lengths of ridges oriented concentrically to the crater, which frequently curve their tips away from the crater [2]. In mare examples where the surrounding topography is slight, the CCRs are distributed relatively evenly around the crater and tend to extend from roughly 1.2 crater radii to several crater radii [3].  Sometimes these ridges can also be seen around highlands craters, although with a much more sporadic distribution and generally only on pre-existing slopes which face the crater [1]. In the 1970s, when these features were last studied [1,4], they were referred to as 'Lunar concentric dunes', however we find that name to be misleading as they do not form like normal dunes (but may form like antidunes), do not have dune-like slopes, and as of this study their known occurance is no longer confined to the Moon. In this study we examine the crater concentric ridges using a variety of data sets - primarily focusing on LROC NACs. These modern data sets, a significant improvement over what was available in the 1970s when these features were previously studied, help us to better understand these features, and allow us to evaluate various hypotheses for their formation.  Methodology: We are surveying the Moon to find craters that exhibit the CCR facies.  To do this we first examine the LROC WAC Global Mosaics in order to find likely candidate sites by looking for very fresh craters of the correct sizes. At these candidate sites we examine LROC NACs to see if this morphology is present.  So far we have found seventy-seven craters ranging in size from one to eleven kilometers in diameter, forty of them in the Lunar Mare and thirty-seven in the Highlands. Interestingly it appears that these ridges may not be less common around highlands craters as previously suggested [1], although they are harder to find there due to the less regular distributions of CCRs in these cases. We are creating mosaics of LROC NACs to study and map CCRs over entire ejecta blankets. Currently we have whole or partial mapping at eight different craters, including Linné [see Fig. 1], Mösting C and Piton B, as well as mosaics for another nine craters. The only previous mapping of CCRs is from the southeast quadrant of Linné crater [1].  The high resolution NAC mosaics allow us to make better maps then were previously possible, for example at Linné crater we have mapped CCRs further from the crater than they     Fig. 3: Hi-res (6 m/pix) MDIS image of CCRs on Mercury. This image is located ~3-4 CR SE of a 3.4 km crater. were found in earlier studies [1]. Our maps also allow us to chart where and with what specific morphology [see Fig. 2] CCRs form around craters, and to compare this information from crater to crater.  At some sites we are also able to study the topography of the ridges using Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) or shadow measurements. The morphologies and volumes of these CCRs help constrain how they are formed. When looking at how the ridges form on pre-existing slopes - specifically around highlands craters - we use LOLA altimetry data to determine the overall topography of the area. In so doing we have found that the CCRs around highlands craters can also form in flat regions and occasionally on slopes facing away from the crater, contrary to earlier studies which found them mostly on facing slopes [1].  Results: Lunar maria CCRs exhibit a fairly consistent progression of ridge morphologies moving outwards from the crater [see Fig. 2]. Those ridges closest to the crater appear very subdued, meaning that they are very smooth in appearance rather than sharp, perhaps as a result of being buried by the thick deposit of proximal ejecta. Moving outwards the ridges appear more sharply defined and can be quite sinuous. Further out, troughs are found immediately down range of the CCRs and past this region troughs are sometimes found without an associated ridge.  Using a DTM at the 2 km diameter crater Linné to examine the topography of these ridges we observe that both the up and down range faces of the features form at roughly the same slope. On the visually freshest ridges these slopes range from ~11-18° (not >30° like dunes). The tallest CCR that we found at Linné was ~11 meters high, and these ridges are observed to generally decrease in height with distance from the crater. They are also found to be taller around larger craters, for example at Piton B (a 5 km crater) we measured one CCR to be approximately 42 meters tall. Using our maps we are able to plot how the summed area of the CCRs as a percent of total area varies with distance from the crater. The areal packing density of the ridges quickly rises to its highest value around two crater radii from the crater center and then decreases exponentially outward. This trend is roughly invariant with crater diameter, however the amplitude of the curve increases with crater size: for example the maximum packing density at Linné (D ~ 2 km) is 16% whereas at Piton B (D ~ 5 km) it is 35%. This trend does change somewhat at craters where the CCRs appear more degraded, such as Mösting C. In these cases the amplitude of the curve is higher than would be predicted for their respective diameter, most likely because degradation will shorten and widen CCRs, thus increasing their individual areas. Mercury & Mars: We have also been looking for these CCRs on other planetary bodies, specifically Mercury and Mars. This inter-planetary comparison will aid our assessment of how these features form. On Mercury we have been searching the MDIS NAC data from the MESSENGER for craters with these ridges and to date we have found three good examples of CCR craters [see Fig. 3]. We expect that there are many more CCR craters on Mercury, however the sparsity and relatively low resolution of MDIS data makes them very difficult to find. Thus far we have not been able to find any of these ridges on Mars, despite the resolution and coverage advantages afforded by HiRISE, likely because the erosion rates on Mars are higher than those found on the moon, or because the regolith/surface properties are different. Gravitational acceleration does not explain their absence as that of Mercury is nearly the same as Mars.  Future Work: We will be extending all of these studies, especially those examining topography as we have new DTMs. Additionally we will be extending our study more towards CCRs around highlands craters and the resulting effect of local topography on CCR formation. Finally, we will be examining different hypotheses for the formation of CCRs including: interaction of ejecta with local topography, interference of shockwaves (hydraulic jumps) in the debris surge— i.e., antidunes, seismic effects of the impact, and the currently accepted ballistic impact sedimentation and erosion hypothesis from the 1970s [4].
