Samples from the Stardust InterstellarCollector present unprecedented challenges, and arevastly more difficult to prepare and analyze thanStardust cometary samples. Specifically:. Particles are of order 1 pg in mass, <10−3 of themass of typical particles in the other small-particlecollections (Stardust Cometary, Cosmic Dust, andHayabusa).. The total number of interstellar particles near 1 µm insize is probably <10.. Unlike the Stardust cometary collection, the background is large: for each track containing extraterrestrial material, there are ∼30 tracks due to secondaryejecta.. Distinguishing signal from background nondestructively requires synchrotron-based x-raymicroprobes, which are heavily oversubscribed.During the Stardust Interstellar Preliminary Examination (ISPE)[1, 2], we identified three impacts in aerogel and four impacts in the aluminum foils which wereconsistent either with an origin in the interstellar duststream, or with an origin as secondary ejecta from impacts on the spacecraft. Two of the projectiles in aerogelwere captured at sufficiently low speed that the projectiles survived: olivine and spinel were identified in one,and olivine was identified in the other. An origin as secondary ejecta or as interplanetary dust is statistically unlikely, but isotopic measurements are required to definitively test for interstellar origin. These measurementswere not allowed under the rules of the ISPE.Methods: Interstellar dust particles in the 1 µm sizerange penetrate approximately 100 µm into the aerogel collectors. To simulate aerogel collectors whichhave captured interstellar dust particles, we synthesizedseveral aerogel tiles in which a layer of spinel separates from the Allende meteorite were included in asingle layer several hundred µm below the surface.Most of these spinel grains are 16O-rich, and lie on theCCAM line at approximately (δ18O, δ17O) = (−40h,−40h). Sample preparation and systematic analytical errors during isotope measurements may cause measured isotope ratios to differ from the true values in amass-dependent or mass-independent way. The accuracy and precision of analog spinel separate measurements will help us to identify our sources of error, whichcan then be addressed in the next iteration of analogsample preparation and analysis, in order to achieve theideal protocol to measure the Stardust interstellar candidates.We extracted spinel particles in aerogel keystones[3].We embedded one of these keystones in epoxy on anepoxy bullet, and microtomed the keystone using a diamond knife, exposing one of the spinel grains. We thenmounted the bullet on a standard "buckler" mount[4],and analyzed the sample on the Cameca ims 1280 ionmicroprobe at the University of Hawai'i. In parallel,we pressed another keystone into In, using a tefloncoated press, at sufficiently high pressure that the resulting compressed aerogel was conductive after a carboncoat (Figure 1). (This procedure was also used for thesample preparation on the bulb of track 184, reported inthese proceedings[5].)Figure 1: Spinel keystone pressed into indium, mountedin a 1-inch aluminum round.We used a <3 pA Cs+ primary beam focused to∼250 nm, and acquired 10×10 µm, 128×128 pixelscanning ion images of the spinel potted butt (Figure2). An electron flood gun was used for charge compensation. We simultaneously collected 16O- , 17O- , and18O- on electron multipliers. We used a mass-resolvingpower of 5500 on 17O- to minimize the interference2970.pdf

from 16OH- . We collected 400 total frames (220 minutes of measurement). We measured San Carlos olivineunder identical conditions, and from this measurementcalculated a correction that was applied to the δ17O andδ18O measured values for the spinel grain.The keystone containing spinels pressed into indium was measured under similar conditions, except24Mg16O- , 27Al16O- , and 56Fe16O- were also collected by magnetic-field peak jumping in order to easilyidentify the spinel grains embedded in aerogel. Weused a larger measurement raster collected for a longertime. The grain we measured was 3.9 µm in size. Theraster was increased to 25×25 µm and 872 frames werecollected for this particle (a total measurement time of14.5 hours).Figure 2: Scanning ion image of 16O from the spinelgrain. Image is 10×10 µm.Results: The spinel grain mounted in the pottedbutt was measured to have O isotopic composition:δ18O = 20.3±3.3, δ17O = 10.0±7.5 (all errors are2σ). The spinel grain in aerogel pressed into indiumwas measured to have O isotopic composition: δ18O =20.9±12.7, δ17O = 14.3±28.8. The larger uncertainties for the spinel mounted in indium was due to thelarger raster used in this measurement. A larger rasterwas used to find spinel grains more efficiently; a smallerraster was used on the potted butt because the locationof the spinel grain was precisely known.Conclusions: Both particles were found to haveoxygen isotopic compositions consistent with terrestrialspinel. Some spinels have been reported in ordinarychondrites that are close in composition to terrestrialspinel (δ18O, δ17O) = (+22.3h, +11.6h) [6] (presumably from 16O-poor chondrules), but we found noreports in the literature of such spinels separated fromAllende (which are mostly from 16O-rich CAIs).Figure 3: Oxygen isotope ratios of IS analog spinels reported here compared to presolar silicates and oxides,three young stellar objects in the Sun's galactic neighborhood, the Sun, and the range of Solar System materials. Our 2σ measurement precisions of the two spinelsreported here are shown by the two black ellipses.Although a measurement of oxygen isotopic composition is probably necessary to confirm an interstellarorigin for particles captured in aerogel in the StardustInterstellar Dust Collector, the measurement is not required to have high accuracy or precision. It is knownfrom astronomical observations that the Solar Systemis strongly anomalous in oxygen: 18O/17O = 5.2 in theSolar System, while 18O/17O = 4.1 ± 0.1 in the localgalaxy[7] (Figure 3). This difference in ∆17O of about250h should be a smoking gun for interstellar origin.Even if the actual composition of two spinels that wemeasured here were (δ18O, δ17O) = (−40h, −40h),which we think is unlikely, the corresponding systematic error in ∆17O ≈ 25h is about an order of magnitude smaller than the difference expected between thelocal interstellar and the Solar System values. Nevertheless, care must be taken to be sure that the signal is notdiluted significantly by surrounding aerogel (and epoxy,in the case of the epoxy embedding process), particularly since the statistical precision of the measurementwill be compromised by small counting statistics. Weconclude that further measurements are necessary to establish the reliability of either technique.References: [1] A. J. Westphal, et al. (2014) MAPS49(9):1720. [2] A. J. Westphal, et al.
