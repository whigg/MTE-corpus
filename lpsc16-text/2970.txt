Introduction: With the discovery of extraterrestrial materials of possible interstellar origin in the Stardust Interstellar Dust Collector, NASA now has an eighth returned sample collection[1], after the Apollo, Antarctic meteorite, Cosmic Dust, Genesis, Stardust Cometary, Hayabusa and Exposed Space Hardware collections. Samples from the Stardust Interstellar Collector present unprecedented challenges, and are vastly more difficult to prepare and analyze than Stardust cometary samples. Specifically: . Particles are of order 1 pg in mass, <10−3 of the mass of typical particles in the other small-particle collections (Stardust Cometary, Cosmic Dust, and Hayabusa). . The total number of interstellar particles near 1 µm in size is probably <10. . Unlike the Stardust cometary collection, the background is large: for each track containing extraterrestrial material, there are ∼30 tracks due to secondary ejecta. . Distinguishing signal from background nondestructively requires synchrotron-based x-ray microprobes, which are heavily oversubscribed. During the Stardust Interstellar Preliminary Examination (ISPE)[1, 2], we identified three impacts in aerogel and four impacts in the aluminum foils which were consistent either with an origin in the interstellar dust stream, or with an origin as secondary ejecta from impacts on the spacecraft. Two of the projectiles in aerogel were captured at sufficiently low speed that the projectiles survived: olivine and spinel were identified in one, and olivine was identified in the other. An origin as secondary ejecta or as interplanetary dust is statistically unlikely, but isotopic measurements are required to definitively test for interstellar origin. These measurements were not allowed under the rules of the ISPE. Methods: Interstellar dust particles in the 1 µm size range penetrate approximately 100 µm into the aerogel collectors. To simulate aerogel collectors which have captured interstellar dust particles, we synthesized several aerogel tiles in which a layer of spinel separates from the Allende meteorite were included in a single layer several hundred µm below the surface. Most of these spinel grains are 16O-rich, and lie on the CCAM line at approximately (δ18O, δ17O) = (−40h, −40h). Sample preparation and systematic analytical errors during isotope measurements may cause measured isotope ratios to differ from the true values in a mass-dependent or mass-independent way. The accuracy and precision of analog spinel separate measurements will help us to identify our sources of error, which can then be addressed in the next iteration of analog sample preparation and analysis, in order to achieve the ideal protocol to measure the Stardust interstellar candidates. We extracted spinel particles in aerogel keystones[3]. We embedded one of these keystones in epoxy on an epoxy bullet, and microtomed the keystone using a diamond knife, exposing one of the spinel grains. We then mounted the bullet on a standard "buckler" mount[4], and analyzed the sample on the Cameca ims 1280 ion microprobe at the University of Hawai'i. In parallel, we pressed another keystone into In, using a tefloncoated press, at sufficiently high pressure that the resulting compressed aerogel was conductive after a carbon coat (Figure 1). (This procedure was also used for the sample preparation on the bulb of track 184, reported in these proceedings[5].) Figure 1: Spinel keystone pressed into indium, mounted in a 1-inch aluminum round. We used a <3 pA Cs+ primary beam focused to ∼250 nm, and acquired 10×10 µm, 128×128 pixel scanning ion images of the spinel potted butt (Figure 2). An electron flood gun was used for charge compensation. We simultaneously collected 16O- , 17O- , and 18O- on electron multipliers. We used a mass-resolving power of 5500 on 17O- to minimize the interference  from 16OH- . We collected 400 total frames (220 minutes of measurement). We measured San Carlos olivine under identical conditions, and from this measurement calculated a correction that was applied to the δ17O and δ18O measured values for the spinel grain. The keystone containing spinels pressed into indium was measured under similar conditions, except 24Mg16O- , 27Al16O- , and 56Fe16O- were also collected by magnetic-field peak jumping in order to easily identify the spinel grains embedded in aerogel. We used a larger measurement raster collected for a longer time. The grain we measured was 3.9 µm in size. The raster was increased to 25×25 µm and 872 frames were collected for this particle (a total measurement time of 14.5 hours). Figure 2: Scanning ion image of 16O from the spinel grain. Image is 10×10 µm. Results: The spinel grain mounted in the potted butt was measured to have O isotopic composition: δ18O = 20.3±3.3, δ17O = 10.0±7.5 (all errors are 2σ). The spinel grain in aerogel pressed into indium was measured to have O isotopic composition: δ18O = 20.9±12.7, δ17O = 14.3±28.8. The larger uncertainties for the spinel mounted in indium was due to the larger raster used in this measurement. A larger raster was used to find spinel grains more efficiently; a smaller raster was used on the potted butt because the location of the spinel grain was precisely known. Conclusions: Both particles were found to have oxygen isotopic compositions consistent with terrestrial spinel. Some spinels have been reported in ordinary chondrites that are close in composition to terrestrial spinel (δ18O, δ17O) = (+22.3h, +11.6h) [6] (presumably from 16O-poor chondrules), but we found no reports in the literature of such spinels separated from Allende (which are mostly from 16O-rich CAIs). Figure 3: Oxygen isotope ratios of IS analog spinels reported here compared to presolar silicates and oxides, three young stellar objects in the Sun's galactic neighborhood, the Sun, and the range of Solar System materials. Our 2σ measurement precisions of the two spinels reported here are shown by the two black ellipses. Although a measurement of oxygen isotopic composition is probably necessary to confirm an interstellar origin for particles captured in aerogel in the Stardust Interstellar Dust Collector, the measurement is not required to have high accuracy or precision. It is known from astronomical observations that the Solar System is strongly anomalous in oxygen: 18O/17O = 5.2 in the Solar System, while 18O/17O = 4.1 ± 0.1 in the local galaxy[7] (Figure 3). This difference in ∆17O of about 250h should be a smoking gun for interstellar origin. Even if the actual composition of two spinels that we measured here were (δ18O, δ17O) = (−40h, −40h), which we think is unlikely, the corresponding systematic error in ∆17O ≈ 25h is about an order of magnitude smaller than the difference expected between the local interstellar and the Solar System values. Nevertheless, care must be taken to be sure that the signal is not diluted significantly by surrounding aerogel (and epoxy, in the case of the epoxy embedding process), particularly since the statistical precision of the measurement will be compromised by small counting statistics. We conclude that further measurements are necessary to establish the reliability of either technique. References: [1] A. J. Westphal, et al. (2014) MAPS 49(9):1720. [2] A. J. Westphal, et al.
