INTRODUCTION Global distributions of several km wide sites with exposed end-member of various lunar major minerals have been revealed from the global survey using the spectral data obtained by Spectral Profiler (SP) onboard SELENE/Kaguya [e.g., 1-6]. In addition to these sites, it is expected that there are exposure sites of quenched glasses produced by impacts and volcanic glasses on the lunar surface (hereafter glass-rich sites, regardless of the origin). However, the global distribution of the glassrich sites on the Moon has been unknown. Thus, we conducted the global survey using SP data to reveal the global distribution of the glass-rich sites on the Moon. RESULTS SP has obtained continuous spectral reflectance data for about 70 million points (0.5 by 0.5 km footprint) on the Moon in wavelength λ = 0.5-2.6 µm and a spectral resolution of 6-8 nm [7,8]. According to [9,10], an Fe-bearing glass shows a spectrum with a broad absorption band centered at λ ∼ 1.1 µm. Analyzing the 70 million spectra with the global survey algorithm used in [2-6], we pick up the spectra which show a broad 1.1 µm absorption as the glass-rich spectrum. We also rejected the spectrum that can be interpreted as mixtures of plagioclase and small amount of pyroxene based on the lithology for areas around the detection point [see 7]. Finally, 176 points are selected as the glass-rich points. Fig. 1 shows example spectra of the glass-rich sites found by this survey. We can see a broad 1µm band with no 2µm band. For a comparison, the spectra for an olivine-rich site, a purest anorthosite (PAN) site, a low Ca-pyroxene (LCP) rich site, and a high Capyroxene (HCP) rich site measured by SP are plotted [25]. The glass-rich spectra with a broad 1µm absorption are clearly different from those of PAN, LCP, and HCP. Although the olivine-rich spectrum with absorption minimum at 1.05µm may resemble those for the glass-rich spectra, the glass-rich spectra do not show 1.25µm and weak 0.85 µm absorption bands, which are important diagnostic bands of olivine. Thus, the glass-rich spectra found by this study are different from those of the lunar crystalline minerals.

For a comparison, the spectra for an olivine-rich site (green), a PAN site (black), a LCP rich site (purple), and a HCP rich site (light blue) are plotted. All spectra have been vertically offset for clarity, and the tick intervals of the vertical axes are 0.05. Fig. 2 shows the global distribution of the glass-rich sites. Most of the glass-rich sites are associated with the major lunar impact basins: e.g., the Moscoviense, Humboldtianum, Humorum, Orientale, Imbrium, Crisium, and Serenitatis basins. Note that most of these impact basins also possess the olivine-rich sites at the peak rings [3]. On the other hand, there is no glass-rich site in the center regions of the South-Pole Aitken basin nor Feldspathic Highland Terrane. Fig. 3(a) shows the local distribution of the glass-rich points in the Humorum basin. The glass-rich points are distributed on the pyroclastic deposits near the inner ring of this basin [12]. The olivine-rich and PAN points are also distributed along the inner rings. On the other hand, there is no glass-rich point in its central region. Fig. 3(b) shows the glass-rich points in the Moscoviense basin. They are also distributed on the pyroclastic deposits near the inner ring [12]. The olivine-rich points and spinelrich points [3,5] are also distributed along the inner ring.

Although both the glass-rich and the olivine-rich sites are distributed along the inner rings, the local distributions are different between the two sites in each basin. Fig. 4(a) shows the local distribution of the glassrich sites at the Aristarchus plateau. The glass-rich spectra are found on the pyroclastic deposits in this plateau. While the olivine-rich sites are found at the rim of the Aristarchus crater [3], there is no olivine-rich sites in this plateau. We also found the glass-rich spectra at Compton-Belkovich thorium anomaly (CBTA) area [13], where is located near the outer rings of the Humboldtianum basin (Fig. 4(b)). The glass-rich spectra are found on the bright-reflectance terrain in CBTA, which corresponds to domes formed from silicic, viscous lava [13]. CBTA has also an olivine-rich point found by [3].

In addition, the glass-rich spectra are found at large, prominent impact craters: e.g., Humboldt, Compton, and Gauss craters (Fig. 2), where the glass-rich points are found mainly on the pyroclastic deposits near the crater rim. DISCUSSION The glass-rich sites are found at the pyroclastic deposits near the inner rings of the impact basins, in the complex craters, and on the Aristarchus plateau. In addition, the glass-rich spectra are detected on the silicic volcanic domes at CBTA [13]. Interestingly, most of the glassrich sites are associated with the olivine-rich sites. On the other hand, there are many pyroclastic deposits exhibiting no glass-rich spectrum among the pyroclastic deposits listed in [12]. Whether or not the pyroclastic deposit possesses the glass-rich sites may be due to the compositional variation of the magma (e.g., the amount of Ti or silicic materials) and/or difference in the amount of volatiles in the magma. If so, the global distribution of the glass-rich sites may provide an important information of the compositional variation of the lunar mantle and/or the distribution of the amount of volatiles in the mantle.
