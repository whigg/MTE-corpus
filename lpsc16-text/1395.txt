In addition to these sites, itis expected that there are exposure sites of quenchedglasses produced by impacts and volcanic glasses on thelunar surface (hereafter glass-rich sites, regardless of theorigin). However, the global distribution of the glassrich sites on the Moon has been unknown. Thus, weconducted the global survey using SP data to reveal theglobal distribution of the glass-rich sites on the Moon.RESULTSSP has obtained continuous spectral reflectance data forabout 70 million points (0.5 by 0.5 km footprint) onthe Moon in wavelength λ = 0.5-2.6µm and a spectral resolution of 6-8 nm [7,8]. According to [9,10], anFe-bearing glass shows a spectrum with a broad absorption band centered at λ ∼ 1.1µm. Analyzing the 70million spectra with the global survey algorithm usedin [2-6], we pick up the spectra which show a broad1.1µm absorption as the glass-rich spectrum. We alsorejected the spectrum that can be interpreted as mixturesof plagioclase and small amount of pyroxene based onthe lithology for areas around the detection point [see7]. Finally, 176 points are selected as the glass-richpoints. Fig. 1 shows example spectra of the glass-richsites found by this survey. We can see a broad 1µmband with no 2µm band. For a comparison, the spectra for an olivine-rich site, a purest anorthosite (PAN)site, a low Ca-pyroxene (LCP) rich site, and a high Capyroxene (HCP) rich site measured by SP are plotted [25]. The glass-rich spectra with a broad 1µm absorptionare clearly different from those of PAN, LCP, and HCP.Although the olivine-rich spectrum with absorption minimum at 1.05µm may resemble those for the glass-richspectra, the glass-rich spectra do not show 1.25µm andweak 0.85µm absorption bands, which are important diagnostic bands of olivine. Thus, the glass-rich spectrafound by this study are different from those of the lunarcrystalline minerals.Continuum Removed Reflectance(offset, 0.05 interval)0.6  0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 2.2 2.4Wavelength [µm] Olivine PAN HCP LCP GlassFigure 1: The continuum-removed reflectance spectrameasured by SP at the glass-rich sites in theMoscoviense(blue) and Humboldtianum (red) basins. For a comparison, the spectra for an olivine-rich site (green), a PANsite (black), a LCP rich site (purple), and a HCP rich site(light blue) are plotted. All spectra have been verticallyoffset for clarity, and the tick intervals of the vertical axesare 0.05.Fig. 2 shows the global distribution of the glass-richsites. Most of the glass-rich sites are associated withthe major lunar impact basins: e.g., the Moscoviense,Humboldtianum, Humorum, Orientale, Imbrium, Crisium, and Serenitatis basins. Note that most of these impact basins also possess the olivine-rich sites at the peakrings [3]. On the other hand, there is no glass-rich sitein the center regions of the South-Pole Aitken basin norFeldspathic Highland Terrane.Fig. 3(a) shows the local distribution of the glass-richpoints in the Humorum basin. The glass-rich points aredistributed on the pyroclastic deposits near the inner ringof this basin [12]. The olivine-rich and PAN points arealso distributed along the inner rings. On the other hand,there is no glass-rich point in its central region. Fig. 3(b)shows the glass-rich points in the Moscoviense basin.They are also distributed on the pyroclastic deposits nearthe inner ring [12]. The olivine-rich points and spinelrich points [3,5] are also distributed along the inner ring.Similarly, at the other impact basins, the glass-rich points1395.pdf

The glass-rich spectra are found on the pyroclastic deposits in this plateau.While the olivine-rich sites are found at the rim of theAristarchus crater [3], there is no olivine-rich sites inthis plateau. We also found the glass-rich spectra atCompton-Belkovich thorium anomaly (CBTA) area [13],where is located near the outer rings of the Humboldtianum basin (Fig. 4(b)). The glass-rich spectra are foundon the bright-reflectance terrain in CBTA, which corresponds to domes formed from silicic, viscous lava [13].CBTA has also an olivine-rich point found by [3].

In addition,the glass-rich spectra are detected on the silicic volcanicdomes at CBTA [13]. Interestingly, most of the glassrich sites are associated with the olivine-rich sites. Onthe other hand, there are many pyroclastic deposits exhibiting no glass-rich spectrum among the pyroclasticdeposits listed in [12]. Whether or not the pyroclasticdeposit possesses the glass-rich sites may be due to thecompositional variation of the magma (e.g., the amountof Ti or silicic materials) and/or difference in the amountof volatiles in the magma. If so, the global distribution ofthe glass-rich sites may provide an important informationof the compositional variation of the lunar mantle and/orthe distribution of the amount of volatiles in the mantle.REFERENCES[1] Ohtake, M. et al., Nature, 461, 236, 2009.
