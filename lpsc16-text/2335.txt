Labsphere Inc. produces a sintered polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) reflectance standard known as Spectralon [1]. It is chemically inert, and thermally and environmentally stable, providing extremely stable, reproducible spectral reflectance close to 99% from 350 -2500 nm [2].  Labsphere has been able to create diffuse reflectance standards that can offer the highest diffuse reflectance values of any known substance [3].       The Hyperspectral Optical Sensing for Extraterrestrial Reconnaissance Laboratory (HOSERLab) at the University of Winnipeg has been utilizing an assortment of standards of various reflectance levels from Labsphere for nearly a decade.  The original standard set included a 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 99% reflectance levels (HOSERLab standards). Recently we have been working with Labsphere to characterize reflectance standards of various gray scales in support of the upcoming Mars 2020 rover.  Labsphere provided five sets of four reflectance levels which include 2, 20, 50, and 99% (Labsphere standards).  It was noted upon the initial inspection that these standards appeared to be different, both visually and in their consistency; they seemed to be "spongier" than the original HOSERLab standards but also with a more uniform tone as opposed to a more "salt and pepper" apperance of the original gray scale pucks.         Methodology: VisNIR reflectance spectra were collected for the new Labsphere standards. Diffuse reflectance spectra were measured with an Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD) FieldSpec Pro HR spectrometer over the wavelength range of 350-2500 nm with a spectral resolution of between 2 and 7 nm. Spectra were measured at a viewing geometry of i = 30ยบ and e = 0ยบ with incident light being provided by an in-house 150 W quartz-tungsten-halogen collimated light source. All of the standards' spectra were measured relative to the HOSERLab NIST-traceable 99% Spectralon. In each case, 250 spectra of the dark current, standard, and sample were acquired and averaged, to provide a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio for subsequent interpretation.       With spectral differences observed between the two sets of standards, it was decided to collect more data with other instruments to try to better understand the cause of the spectral differences.       Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was conducted over a similar range as the ASD, 10 000 - 4000 cm -1 to rule out ASD instrumental issues.       Raman spectra were also collected on both sets of standards in the 170 - 4000 cm -1 range at a resolution of ~4 cm -1 at 614 nm with a B&WTek i-Raman instrument. Excitation was provided by a 532 nm 50 mW solid state diode laser.        Microscopic images were captured through a x15 objective on a stereoscopic dissecting microscope using a Samsung S4 smartphone.        Results:  The spectral difference observed with the Labsphere standards were mostly with the 50 and 20%  targets: their spectral slopes were significantly redder than the original HOSERLab standards and the new 99% standard was bluer and slightly less overall reflective (Fig. 1) .

The FTIR spectra showed the same optical behavior and differences as the ASD spectra (Fig. 2).  This confirmed that the spectral differences were due to material properties rather than spectrometer performance.  Figure 2: FTIR spectra of the Labsphere standards set compared to the original HOSERLab 99% standard       The Raman spectra of the Labsphere collection were comparable to the HOSERLab set (Fig. 3).   An assortment of sharp Raman features ranging from 170 - 1400 cm -1 are present for both 99% targets with no differences in peak positions.  Both sets of spectra exhibit a large, broad fluorescence emission feature. With decreasing reflectance values of the standards, the Raman features associated with PTFE lost intensities while a new peak at 1600 cm -1 emerged.   Figure 3:  Raman spectra of the Labsphere standards set compared to the original HOSERLab 99% standard       The microscopic images of the 50% reflectance standards (Fig. 4) proved to be  useful in understanding the difference in reflectance spectral behavior.  It is evident from the images that the HOSERLab 50 is actually white PTFE with flecks of carbon black sprinkled throughout, darkening the standard. The Labsphere 50 lacks this carbon black sprinkling and is a much more uniform grey colour.       Discussion:  Differences do exist between Labsphere reflectance standards of different generations.  The slight difference observed between the two 99% standard could be attributed to their size difference. The HOSERLab standard was larger and backed by the typical black Labsphere casing whereas the new standards were only small disks  13 mm across by 10 mm deep. It is possible the lower reflectance value is caused by light escaping from the side of the standard and not being reflected back.       The Raman spectra exhibit prominent features connected to a variety of C-F and C-C modes.  The peak developing at 1600 cm -1 is likely a C=C related to the carbon-rich material used to darken the PTFE. Figure 4: Microscopic images through a x15 objective of                    HOSERLab 50% (left) and Labsphere 50% (right)       The microscopic images show the difference in microstructure of the standards.  It is clear to see that the procedure for making the grayscale Spectralon pucks has changed over the past decade.  In one sense, the new  "recipe" is better for providing a micro-scale optically homogeneous material.  However, the spectral reflectance data suggest that this comes at the cost of a material that is not as spectrally flat across the 350 - 2500 nm interval.
