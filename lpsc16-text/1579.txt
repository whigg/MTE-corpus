THE FATE OF HYDROXYL AND WATER ON THE LUNAR SURFACE OVER TIME.  G. Y Kramer1 & J.-Ph.Combe2; 1 Lunar & Planetary Science Institute, Houston, TX, kramer@lpi.usra.edu, 2 Bear Fight Institute, Winthrop, WA.IntroductionThe discovery of hydroxyl (OH) and water(HOH)* across the lunar surface and its fluctuationwith the lunar diurnal cycle has been cited as one ofthe more important discoveries from the Moon in thelast 40 years [2, 3, 4]. This discovery potentially portends a solar system-wide phenomenon, and the elucidation of key factors that likely influence its presenceon the Moon can be expected to provide improved insight into the volatile history and potential availabilityof water throughout the inner solar system. There isevidence to support the conclusion that specific soilcharacteristics favor retention of OH and HOH which,in turn, would have strong implications for an improved understanding of the history of volatiles duringplanetary accretion. In addition, understanding thosespecific conditions that favor creation and retention ofOH and HOH could be used to develop technologiesthat would help to provide access to, or even generate,this precious resource for human exploration.Geometric/Temporal CorrelationSpectral reflectance observations by the MoonMineralogy Mapper (M3) showed spectral absorptionsat 2.8 μm and 3.0 μm indicative of the presence of OHand HOH, respectively. Furthermore, M3 showed thatboth OH and HOH vary spatially as a function of solarillumination geometry [2]. At high solar incidence angles, the observed strengths of the spectral features arestronger than at low incidence angles, suggesting thatthe abundance varies with the diurnal cycle [2, 5]. Furthermore, these features increase with increasing latitude, such that above ~60º there is little change in thedepth of the water-related spectral absorption bands.It was immediately recognized that the widespread occurrence of hydroxyl and water across the lu nar surface was the result of solar wind-induced hydroxylation [5], which was predicted almost 50 yearsago [6]. The means by which water and hydroxyl formand are retained on the Moon is a question that is stillbeing explored. Laboratory experiments demonstratedthe importance of understanding how solar wind ionsinteract with surface materials [7, 8], and what kind ofbonding would be observed as hydroxyl and water inreflectance spectra [5].Compositional CorrelationThe ability of mineral and glass surfaces to internally host or surficially adsorb OH is a function of* For water to be stable under the lunar surface conditionsdiscussed here it is likely to be in its dissociative form - asan adsorbed hydroxyl and an adsorbed hydrogen atom [1].Therefore, we use the abbreviation HOH (instead of H2O) tobe clear about the form of water measured with M3 data anddiscussed herein.several interrelated variables, such as composition,surface roughness, and degree of crystallinity. Theseproperties of the material will affect observed banddepths in remote sensing measurements.Maps obtained for the whole Moon using M3 datashow an apparent correlation between OH/HOH andcrustal lithology [2, 4, 5]. For example, high-albedofeldspathic materials generally exhibit stronger OHand HOH absorption features. This apparent association between OH/HOH abundance and lithology canbe due to one or more of the following: 1) OH andHOH abundances are actually higher in the morefeldspathic materials, 2) Multiple reflections in thesurfaces of the highlands may create stronger absorption bands because of a more rugged topography, 3)Multiple-scattering is greater in the higher-albedo regolith (due to a lower absorption coefficient), whichenhances the absorption bands, 4) Spectra generallyincrease in reflectance as particle size decreases due tothe relative increase in volume to surface scattering.Thus, the strength of the OH and HOH absorptions increase with decreasing particle size for a given watercontent [9]; 5) The thermal correction applied to level2 M3 data does not accurately account for the physicalproperties that give rise to the albedo of a material,thereby causing absorption bands at 2.8 and 3.0 μm toapparently be weaker in dark materials. [e.g. 10, 11].Thermal CorrectionAt temperatures >250 K thermal emission overwhelms the reflected energy at wavelengths longerthan ~2.3 μm, and thus fills and distorts the absorptionbands associated with H/OH. Ideally, this would bemitigated by the thermal correction applied to reflectance spectra, however, there is strong evidencethat the strategies for the thermal correction in thelevel 2 M3 data currently in the PDS does not accurately account for the extent of the thermal contribution to the measured spectrum. The abundance ofOH/HOH is proportional to the depths of these absorption bands. Without an improved thermal correctionfor M3 data, efforts to accurately estimate the abundance of these volatiles, or the properties of the soilwith which their presence correlates, cannot be trulyrealized.Our long term research goal is to determine theproperties of the lunar soil that favor the formation andretention of OH and HOH within the inner solar system. This dictates a preliminary goal of improving theaccuracy of the currently-used thermal emission modelfor M3 spectral reflectance data. To improve the thermal emission correction, we consider that the localsurface roughness within an M3 pixel creates a distribution of temperatures, not a uniform temperature.1579.pdf

Modeling the thermal emission contribution [12]) using High resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM)from Lunar Orbiter Camera (LROC) and Lunar LaserAltimeter (LOLA), and surface roughness derivedfrom the Diviner thermal imaging spectrometer, ismore accurate than performing a correction solelybased on M3 spectra.Areas of InterestBecause improving the thermal correction is along, complicated and iterative process, we begin byfocusing on specific locations where M3 data showsdifferences in OH and HOH content between regionsof different compositions which have similar albedo(same average reflectance between 0.4 and 2.1 microns - outside the range of thermal emission). This includes materials that may have different absorptionbands of minerals, or different depths of the same absorption bands of minerals. In this way we can determine the mineral compositions that favor the retentionof hydroxyl and water.At the completion of this preliminary project, wewill have generated and implemented an improvedthermal correction for M3 data selected for this preliminary project. These data will accurately represent thereflectance portion of the spectrum beyond 2.2 μm,and that these improved reflectance spectra will allowus to accurately characterize the absorption bands diagnostic of the presence of OH and HOH in materialsof similar albedo, but different composition. The successful completion of this project can, therefore, beexpected to have an important positive impact on current understanding of the lunar water cycle, compositional and maturity properties of the soil that influencethis phenomenon, and can serve as a guide for paths offuture exploration and technology development. Thisproject will answer the questions:1. Is the abundance of surficial OH/HOH increasingor decreasing over time (with maturity of thesoil)?2. Does the abundance of OH/HOH vary as a function of different soil compositions (mineralogy)?Do we see the same effects on the maria and high lands?3. Is there a difference in behavior/retention ofOH/HOH with different soil textures (e.g., crystalline versus glassy, pyroclastics, swirls)?References[1] Hibbitts C. A. et al.
