Introduction: In the course of studying impact melts in ordinary chondrites (OC) from the U.S. Antarctic Meteorite Collection at the Smithsonian Institution [1-6] we have identified a number of impact melt and other secondary clasts (i.e., not chondrules) within OC impact breccias.  This is part of an ongoing search for ancient melt clasts to gain insight into the lunar cataclysm [7-12] and small body scattering in the early Solar System (thereby causing the late heavy bombardment [13-15]).   Meteorite Hills (MET) 01004 melt clasts:  We have previously reported on a large melt clast in the brecciated Antarctic LL5 ordinary chondrite Meteorite Hills (MET) 01004  (Figure 1) as part of this ongoing study [1-4].  In addition to this large melt clast, a number of other clasts have been identified and five are presented here.  Thick sections of potential clasts were made and analyzed using instrumentation at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. Backscattered electron imagery (BSE) and elemental mapping were completed using the FEI NanoSEM at the Smithsonian Institution, which is equipped with a THERMO-NORAN energy dispersive X-ray analytical system.  Electron microprobe analyses of the clast were conducted using the Smithsonian's JEOL 8900R Superprobe.  Results: Optical microscopy and SEM imaging/mapping of a number of thick sections of MET 01004 show a wide variety of other clasts, many that also appear to be melt clasts.  Polished thick sections MET 01004,11, ,13 and ,14 were examined during this study.  Large electron microprobe transects were run across all three of these sections to gather bulk data for the meteorite.  The majority of the minerals analyzed in these sections were olivine, pyroxene, Fe,Ni metal, feldspar, glass, and rare apatite.  Individual clasts of interest within the sections ,11 and ,14 were analyzed and transects were performed across these clasts as well, to collect a random sample of grains.  Very little metal or sulfide is present in any of the clasts analyzed in this study.   Clast MET 01004,11-A (11-A):  This clast, black in hand sample, measures 3 mm x 1 mm.  It has a microporphyritic quench texture comprised of olivine and glass (Figure 2). Olivine (Fa7-16) shows major element zoning in backscatter indicating disequilibrium crystallization that has not been subjected to post-shock metamorpshim.   Clast MET 01004,11-B (11-B):  This clast, light colored in hand sample, measures 1 cm x 4 mm.  Olivine (Fa18) is poikilitically enclosed by pyroxene (Fs1516Wo1-3).  This clast also contains accessory feldspar (An3-19Or3-14).  This clast may be related to the Hchondrite clast reported in [1-4], though it contains more metal. Clast MET 01004,11-DF1,2 (11-DF1 and 11DF2):  Two small fragments, dark in BSE/low atomic number, were found in this section within the matrix.  11-DF1 (~500 x 500 microns) only contains pyroxene, the composition of which is Fs9-12Wo0.4-2. Clast 11DF2 (~300 x 500 microns) contains pyroxene of      Fs4-9Wo0.1-0.3.  One grain each of olivine (Fa9) and feldspar (An43Or0.5) were analyzed.  Fe/Mn ratios for both of these clasts fall between 10 and 20.  These clasts were too small for reliable textures to be assessed, though compositionally they have an affinity to silicates in carbonaceous chondrites.  Clast MET 01004,14-A (14-A):  This clast, dark in hand sample, measures 4 mm x 7 mm, though is truncated by the edge of the section, so is likely larger.  This clast also contains olivine (Fa17-19), pyroxene (Fs17-19Wo1-3) and feldspar (An14-26Or13-30).  Overall, this clast has an H chondrite composition.  This clast is much more fine-grained compared to those previously described and it also lacks metal. MET 01004 classification:  This meteorite was originally announced in the spring of 2004 and was classification as an LL5 chondrite.  This study has resulted in an abundance of electron microprobe data that cover large swaths of the matrix of four, ~1 inch sections of the meteorite.  Aside from a few grains that are distinct outliers, the majority of the olivine and pyroxene data in this meteorite have bulk H chondrite compositions (Fa18-20).  Additionally, trave element analyses of the matrix show H chondrite affinities [1]. It is possible that this meteorite should be reclassified as an H chondrite breccia, though further analyses will be conducted to confirm this reclassification.  It is either a genomict, or possibly a polymict breccia.   While most clasts that we have studied within the meteorite have the same mineral compositions (H chondrite), others may be related to other meteorite types (e.g., clasts 11-DF1 and 11-DF2 with Fs4-12Wo02).  As mentioned, the original classification of the meteorite was LL chondrite, and it is possible that  original analyses may have been conducted on a clast of LL chondrite material found within this meteorite.   With the continued analyses of this meteorite and the discovery of additional clast types, the geologic history of the MET 01004 parent body becomes even more enigmatic than previously thought [1-4], as we are now possibly seeing clasts from multiple meteorite 2729.pdf

classes.  Future isotopic and trace element analyses will shed light on this hypothesis.  In any case, it appears that the history of this meteorite and its parent body was complex, and involved multiple impact events. Age dating: Impact melt clasts from OCs are distinctly under-represented in terms of solar system ages [17], but if successfully obtained, these dates will lead to a better understanding of how early solar system bombardment affected the asteroid belt. We certainly recognize that this is a significant challenge.  Age dating of the H chondrite clast and other clasts in MET 01004 will help us further understand mixing between ordinary chondrite parent bodies.  References: [1] Corrigan et al., 2015 MAPS #5283.
