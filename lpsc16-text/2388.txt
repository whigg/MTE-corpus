HOW WELL DOES THE PRESENT SURFACE INVENTORY OF WATER ON MARS CONSTRAIN THE PAST?  S. M. Clifford1 and F. M. McCubbin2, 1Lunar and Planetary Institute, 3600 Bay Area Blvd, Houston, TX, 77058 USA (clifford@lpi.usra.edu), 2NASA Johnson Space Center, Mailcode XI2, 2101 NASA Parkway, Houston, TX, USA.  Introduction: Over the past 40 years, estimates of the total outgassed inventory of water on Mars have ranged from a global equivalent layer (GEL) ~7-1000 m deep [1, 2]. However, Carr and Head [3] have recently argued that it is not the total inventory of outgassed water that is important, but the amount that exists in climatically exchangeable surface and nearsurface reservoirs – suggesting that any exchange with water in the deep subsurface is precluded by the existence of a thick cryosphere, at least during the Amazonian and Hesperian. Based on this assumption and their estimate of the present day near-surface inventory of H2O (~34 m GEL, stored as ice in the polar layered deposits (PLD), lobate debris aprons, ice-rich latitude dependent mantles, and as shallow ground ice), they extrapolate the evolution of this inventory backward in time, taking into account the introduction of new water by volcanism, outflow channel activity, and the loss of water by exospheric escape. They conclude that, at the end of the Noachian, Mars had a near-surface water inventory of ~24 m and ~62 m by the end of the Hesperian – inventories that Carr and Head [3] argue were incompatible with the existence of a former ocean. Yet, estimates of the amount of water lost or gained, over Martian geologic history, have large uncertainties. Further, the freezing and subsequent burial of a Noachian or Hesperian ocean (by volcanic ash, lavas, and eolian and fluvial sediments) provides a plausible and effective means of sequestering many hundreds of meters of H2O (GEL) well below the ~6080 m depths sampled by the MARSIS surface permittivity investigations [4]. The potential survival of a buried remnant of a former ocean, outflow channel discharge, and past climatically emplaced ice-rich latitude dependent mantles, is consistent with theoretical expectations of the hydrologic and climatic evolution of Mars, the abundant geologic evidence for km-thick accumulations of volcanic and sedimentary deposits, the observed distribution and morphologic characteristics of fluidized ejecta craters, as well as other geomorphic indicators of subsurface volatiles throughout the northern plains [5-7]. This suggests that the present near-surface inventory of H2O places no constraint on either the past near-surface inventory, or the former existence of a northern ocean, although it probably represents a lower limit to the amount of H2O.  Near-Surface Inventory of H2O and Resurfacing History of the Northern Plains. Current research suggests that Mars accreted from a population of planetesimals that were more volatile rich than those that formed the Earth [8, 9], yielding an initial Martian planetary inventory of (bound) water ~600-4000 m deep (GEL). A potentially large, but unknown, fraction of this inventory was released from the interior by the formation of an early magma ocean, as well as by subsequent impact and volcanic degassing. It is not known how much of the initial outgassed inventory survived the early period of atmospheric escape – nor how much more was added by volcanic outgassing during the Noachian. However, there is persuasive evidence that Mars experienced intense volcanic activity throughout its first billion years of geologic evolution. This evidence is apparent at the eastern end of Valles Marineris, where ~4-5 km of layered stratigraphy is exposed in the canyon walls, capped by a plateau unit that dates from the Late Noachian [10, 11]. Additional evidence is provided by the regional flow directions of Late Noachian/Early Hesperian valley networks, which indicate that the vast bulk of Tharsis volcanic province was in place prior to the last episode of valley network formation [12]. This inability to quantify the inventory of water on Mars during the Noachian motivated Carr and Head [3] to try a different approach, based on three key assumptions: (1) that the inventory of water present in climatically exchangeable near-surface reservoirs can be considered in isolation from the planet’s total outgassed inventory of water, (2) that the present nearsurface inventory of water is reasonably well-known, and (3) that we can accurately estimate the amount of water added and removed from the near-surface inventory during the Amazonian and Hesperian. In this way, Carr and Head [3] attempt to deduce the Late Noachian near-surface inventory of water by extrapolating the present inventory backward in time. Although  all three assumptions have some merit, we focus here on the first assumption, which appears to be contradicted by several observations. Early Mars global climate models [13, 14] suggest that, if the Noachian inventory of water was large enough to form a northern ocean, it would have rapidly frozen – creating a northern ice sheet. While sublimation may have redistributed some of this ice to high elevations (forming snowpacks and glaciers) [15], Noachian Mars was the most geologically active period in the planet’s history [11]. Higher atmospheric pressures would have resulted in enhanced eolian erosion, with global dust storms redistributing dust across the planet. Fluvial discharges, 2388.pdf

associated with the formation of the valley networks and earliest outflow channels, would have caused extensive erosion and carried substantial volumes of water and sediment to low elevations – especially in the northern plains. Finally, the intense volcanic activity that characterized this era could have readily blanketed any frozen remnant of an early ocean, outflow channel discharge, or ice-rich latitude dependent mantles, with volcanic ash and lavas – 10’s to 100’s of meters deep.This episodic resurfacing would have had a profound effect on the stability and preservation of ice at depth [7, 16]. For example, at mid-latitudes, a mantle of regolith <10 cm deep is sufficient to thermally isolate near-surface ice from daily temperature extremes, greatly reducing its sublimative loss. Mantles >1-2 m, provide enough insulation to protect ice from annual temperature extremes, allowing buried ice to survive for billions of years. Present-day examples of this effect include the defrosted regions of the SPLD and the ice-rich latitude dependent mantles. Numerous examples of the preservation of glacial ice, by its burial beneath mantles of sediment, volcanic ash and lava, can also be found on Earth (e.g., Fig. 1).      Identification and isolation among water reservoirs in communication with the atmosphere and crust respectively is also supported by H isotopic data from the martian atmosphere and martian meteorites. H isotopic signatures of crustal rocks [16-18] indicate a substantial reservoir with an H isotopic composition that is intermediate between the mantle and atmosphere, consistent with a substantial martian hydrosphere component in the crust that is unaccounted for by the surface deposits of ice.  Conclusions. If early Mars possessed an inventory of outgassed water sufficient to form an early ocean, then a frozen relic of that body may survive at depth to the present day, which may be recorded by H isotopes in martian crustal rocks. While sublimation undoubtedly depleted some fraction of the initial inventory of ice, later episodes of outflow channel activity and obliquity-driven polar ice redistribution, combined with the concurrent accumulation of ~0.5 - 1.5 km of sediments and volcanics, since the Noachian [20], would have led to the development of a complex volatile stratigraphy throughout the northern plains [7] – at depths well below those associated with the present near-surface inventory of ice (Fig 2). Thus, even if we could assess the present near-surface inventory of ice with high precision, it would place no constraint on either the past near-surface inventory of H2O or the former presence of a northern ocean. Finally, because the burial of ice significantly inhibits its diffusive communication with the atmosphere [19], any estimate of the original outgassed inventory of water, inferred from the present atmospheric D/H ratio [21], must be considered a minimum.
