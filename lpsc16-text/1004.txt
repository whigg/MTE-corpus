Introduction: Recent studies about lunar domes are based on the evaluation of their spectrophotometric and morphometric properties, rheologic parameters, and their classification based on the spectral properties and three dimensional shapes of the volcanic edifices [1-3]. In this contribution we provide an analysis of three domes located to the south of Hortensius region where six well known domes are located. We term the examined lunar domes H8-10 (Fig.1 and Table 1). The lavas of the examined mare domes are characterized by moderate R415/R750 of 0.61-0.62 indicating a moderate TiO2 content (Table 3).  Fig. 1. Telescopic image acquired on May 1, 2012, at 03:44 UT with a 450 mm aperture Starmaster driven Dobsonian (M. Wirths). Morphometric properties of the domes H1-H7 have been examined in previous studies [1, 3].  Dome long. [°] lat.

Morphometric dome properties: Based on the telescopic CCD image (Fig. 1) we obtained a DEM of the examined domes by applying the combined photoclinometry and shape from shading method (sfs) described in [1-3]. The heights of the domes H8-10 were determined to 65, 97 and 142 m, respectively (Table 1 and Figs. 2-3). We also estimated the height of H9 based on shadow length measurements in the oblique illumination view shown in Fig. 1, where a value of 95 m was computed according to photoclinometry analysis. For sloped soils the height was measured as maximum elevation from lowest point.     LOLA DEM dataset: The Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA), a science instrument on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft, has been described in [4]. The precision of topographic data is estimated to be about 10 cm and the LOLA dataset was used as the reference for evaluating the quality of the GLD100 dataset [5]. For this research we used the dataset of LOLA Gridded Data Records (GDR) at a resolution of 512 pixels per degree to generate a set of geometric measurements including the diameter, height, slope and volume of each dome. The last three quantities were measured from the lowest elevation in the immediate vicinity. Volumes were computed by direct integration of height over the footprint of the dome using numerical integral calculus.

  Fig. 3. The examined domes are not prominent in the LROC WAC imagery M117677775ME.        Rheologic properties: The rheologic model developed in [6], which relies on the morphometric dome properties, yelds estimates of the lava viscosity η, the effusion rate E, and the duration T of the effusion process for a monogenetic lava dome.     Using the morphometric values listed in Table 1, we obtained rheologic properties for the examined domes (Table 2). Lava viscosity is computed based on a lava density of 2,800 kg m-3.     According to the classification scheme for lunar domes introduced in [1, 3], and based on a principal component analysis (PCA), the domes H8-10 belong to class E2, E1 and C2, respectively. The domes H8-10 formed over a period of time of about 0.3, 0.7 and 1.4 years, respectively and with effusion rates of 95 m3 s-1  (H8 and H10) and 23 (H9) m3 s-1. According to the model developed in [7], we estimated the magma rise speed U and the dike geometry (width W and length L). For three domes we found magma rise speeds of the order 10-4-10-6 m s-1 and dike lengths of 64 km for H8 and of 185 km for H9 and H10. The inferred dike widths amount to 15 m, 47 m and 41 m for H8-10, respectively. With its rheologic properties and dike dimension, H8 is a typical representative of the rheologic group R1 introduced in [1, 3], while the domes H9 and H10 belong to group R3 due to their higher lava viscosity.
