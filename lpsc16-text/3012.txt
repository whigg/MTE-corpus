Conundrum: If Ceres formed as an ice-rich body, as suggested by its low density and the detection of ammoniated phyllosilicates [1], then it should have formed an icy shell, analogous to large icy satellites [2]. Instead, Dawn observations reveal a weakly differentiated body with a shell dominated by rocky material [3].  Here we argue that Ceres may have lost its original ice shell when it migrated inwards from a cold accretional environment to the warm outer main belt [1], or when the solar nebula dissipated (if formed in situ), as a consequence of frequent exposure by impacting. This hypothesis implies that Ceres' current surface represents the base of the original shell, a region that is extremely rich from a chemical evolution standpoint. This leads to specific predictions that may be tested during Dawn's low-altitude mapping orbit (LAMO). If confirmed, then the contribution of Dawn to better understanding other icy worlds will be unprecedented.       Observations:  Dawn has obtained Ceres' topography and gravity with sufficient accuracy to render previous predictions of its interior structure obsolete. Combined with gravity data [4] and geological observations [5], a new picture of Ceres' internal evolution and current state arises. It challenges earlier predictions for a thick shell dominated by ice [6] or even a dirty ice shell [7], and instead suggests a high-density shell dominated by rocky material.        Previous studies modeled Ceres based on our understanding of large icy satellites [2, 6]. Ceres is expected to have had a deep liquid layer that provided an environment for the aqueous alteration of its rocky material in hydrothermal conditions and led to the observed mineralogy [1]. That ocean froze over a few 10s of My leading to a shell mostly devoid of rocky material [6]. Indeed, large icy satellites exhibit little authigenic silicates on their surfaces. This is also consistent with terrestrial observations of ice sheets that are slowly freezing top-down and tend to reject hard particles and salts [8, 9].       A critical clue to understanding Ceres' current state is its bulk density [4], which points to a (anhydrous) rock to ice volume ratio of 0.85. If Ceres formed in the outer Solar system and preserved its full volatile makeup, its rock to ice volume ratio should be <0.5 [e.g., 10], which implies that Ceres would have lost the equivalent of a 50-km thick water shell. The original fraction of volatile is expected to be lower if Ceres formed in situ from local rocky material and volatilerich planetesimals that migrated inwards from the outer Solar System [11].  An Volatile-Rich Body in a Warm Environment: None of the aforementioned models explored the fate of a volatile-rich Ceres exposed to the (relatively) warm environment of the outer main belt, either following migration or when the solar nebula dissipated. It has been generally assumed that a lag deposit would protect Ceres' shell from sublimation, but impact models [12] and the heavily cratered surface of Ceres itself indicate significant disturbance during Ceres' history. During periods of intense impacts Ceres did not have time to rebuild a protective lag layer, leading to ice sublimation and volatile loss. A variety of scenarios lead to the removal of a few tens of kilometers provided that that event happened early in Ceres' history when (a) impact rate was fast and (b) Ceres' icy shell was warm and/or partially molten. Furthermore, if Ceres migrated inward, early impact velocities could have been considerably higher than today as the impacting population was dynamically hot.  This could have greatly increased the volume of ice melted/vaporized during impact and the residual temperatures within the craters, accelerating the sublimation.       A New Interior Model for Ceres: We argue here that the "icy satellite" physical analog assumed by [2, 6] could still apply to Ceres, but with a major caveat. Kirk and Stevenson [13] pointed out that when an icy body is undergoing separation of rock from a volatile phase in the liquid state, a fraction of the silicate phase remains in suspension in the ocean. This idea was explored in more detail by [7] who assumed that the particles would become homogeneously trapped in Ceres' shell. However [13] noted that a slowly freezing ice shell does not incorporate rocky particles, even fines. Instead those particles sink at the bottom of the icy shell, helped by solutes that promote flocculation.  The porosity of mud so produced, and hence its thickness, is a function of pressure. Oceanic sediments may be taken as an analog; they usually show a porosity of ~ 40% at pressures of 10-40 MPa [e.g., 14]. We infer a thickness of ~160-200 km for Ceres' (current) outer 3012.pdf

shell. Pores are filled with ice and salts (anhydrous and hydrated, including carbonates, sulfates) and possibly clathrates hydrates. The salt chemistry is complex but dominated by chloride compounds with minor sulfate species. Combined geochemical (using Geochemist's Workbench) and freezing chemistry modeling (with FREZCHEM [15]) yields a compositional gradient across that layer, with more ice at the top and more chloride salts at the base. In practice, impacting and convection [16] likely altered the original stratification and introduced lateral heterogeneities in the relative rock to ice and salt content.      Implications for Ceres: The resulting structure (Figure 1) can be represented, to first order, by a core with a density of 2700-2900 kg/m3 and a ~180 km thick outer shell with a density between 1900-2100 kg/m3. This model is consistent with gravity observations [4] and hydrothermal evolution modeling [17]. It also explains the absence of very large (>300) km craters. The composition of the rocky component is consistent with the VIR observations, and especially Mgphyllosilicates, ammoniated clays, and carbonates [1]. Geochemical modeling suggests that the basal layer should also contain salt species such as chlorides and sulfides. This layer plays an important role in moderating heat loss from Ceres' interior owing to the salt low thermal conductivity and the concentration of potassium leached from the rock. Preliminary models indicate that it could remain warm until present, at least warm enough to host the source of the cryovolcanic features inferred by [5], promote global relaxation [3], and provide a context for explaining the production of ammoniated phyllosilicates [18].       Big Picture: Partially differentiated interiors may be a common feature of mid-sized icy bodies that went through a phase of ice melting and hydrothermal activity [e.g., 13, 19]. Dawn's GRaND instrument has the capability to detect markers of hydrothermal environments [20], which can help test the proposed model. High-resolution images obtained during LAMO would help link geological features and small-scale color variations to interior composition. Clathrates, ices, and rock mixtures find an analog with permafrost, and evidence for destabilization patterns (e.g., pitted terrains) may be observable at high resolution.       The implications of seeing the base of the original ice shell in an object believed to have undergone hydrothermal processes similar to those predicted for icy satellites [e.g., 21, 22] are profound. If confirmed, this would open a new dimension in our quest to assess the astrobiological significance of these objects: the zdimension. Also, it would underscore Ceres as a new playground for exobiology research, just a couple AU away from Earth.   Acknowledgements: Part of this work is being developed under NASA sponsorship.
