!Incompatible Element Ratios in Plate Tectonic and Stagnant Lid Planets Kent C. Condie1 and Charles K.

Introduction: Because ratios of elements with similar incompatibilities do not change much with degree of melting or fractional crystallization in the mantles of silicate planets, they are useful in characterizing compositions of mantle sources of basalts that have not interacted with continental crust [1,2].  Using Nb/Th and Zr/Nb ratios in young oceanic basalts, three mantle domains can be identified [3]:  enriched (EM), depleted (DM), and hydrated mantle (HM) (Fig. 1).  DM is characterized by high values of both ratios (Nb/Th > 8; Zr/Nb > 20) due to Th depletion relative to Nb, and to Nb depletion relative to Zr.  EM has high Nb/Th ratios but typically has Zr/Nb ratios < 20.  In contrast, HM has very low Nb/Th (< 8) and variable Zr/Nb ratios.  On Earth, DM is most widespread in the asthenosphere tapped at ocean ridges, but also may appear in mantle wedges associated with subduction [4,5].  EM is a common mantle source for basalts erupted in oceanic plateaus and islands, where it is thought to occur in mantle plumes and as inhomogeneities in the asthenosphere [4,5].  Similar domains are recognized with Th/Yb-Nb/Yb and La/Sm-Nb/Th relationships. We propose that comparison of incompatible element ratios in basalts from terrestrial oceanic tectonic settings with mare basalts from the Moon may be useful in in constraining when plate tectonics began on Earth.  Data: Terrestrial data come from Condie [1-3] and the mare basalt and pyroclastic glass data are derived from a variety of sources summarized in [6-11]. In many cases, individual mare basalts have multiple analyses of Nb, Th, Zr, La, Sm, and Yb collected over several decades. The data used in comparisons were selected based on sample split size, method of analysis, and reproducibility among analyses. The estimate for KREEP (Potassium-Rare Earth ElementPhosphorous-enrich lunar component linked to the last stages of lunar magma ocean crystallization) was derived from the work of [12,13]. Modeling of trace element evolution during melting, crystallization, and mixing used lunar appropriate D values [e.g.14-16].  Results: Terrestrial basalts from greenstones with oceanic tectonic settings and their corresponding mantle domains (EM, DM, HM) can be tracked to about 2.5 Ga with geologic and geochemical characteristics [3] (Fig. 1). Prior to this time, however, DM and EM basalts are difficult to distinguish in terms of incompatible element ratios, and the two populations seem to collapse into one group centered near Earth’s primitive mantle (PM) composition (Fig. 2). This distribution is similar to the distribution of most mare basalts from the Moon sampled by the Apollo missions, except for the highTi basalts from Apollo 11 and 17 both of which are enriched in Nb.  The primitive mantle grouping is especially evident for Apollo 11, 12 and 15 basalts in which samples cluster tightly around primitive mantle (PM) composition on Zr/Nb-Nb/Th, Th/YbNb/Yb and La/Sm-Nb/Th diagrams (Fig. 3). Very low-Ti green volcanic glasses (and some intermediate-Ti yellow volcanic glasses) plot in a tight cluster with a mean Nb/Th=4 and Zr/Nb=13, whereas high-Ti orange volcanic glasses fall in two populations at the low Nb/Th end of the Apollo 17 high-Ti basalts. The high-Ti basalts and volcanic glasses from Apollo 11, 12, 15, and 17 plot along a trajectory from the PM composition to high values of Nb/Th. Individual high-Ti basalt types (e.g. A-11 high K and low-K basalts, A-17 A, B1, B2, C, and D basalts, and pyroclastic glass types) systematically define clusters along that trajectory (Fig. 4). This clustering of high-Ti basalt types is consistent with observations made from other trace elements (Hf, K, C, La/Sm, Eu) [7]. Discussion and Conclusions Source region compositions for mare basalts are derived from melting of cumulates that crystallized from the lunar magma ocean (LMO) during the initial stages of lunar differentiation. These sources represent different cumulate horizons which may have experienced varying degrees of mixing during post-LMO dynamic processes.  However, because many incompatible element ratios such as Zr/Nb and Nb/Th do not vary appreciably with either varying degrees of fractional crystallization or partial melting, the tight grouping of these ratios near primitive mantle in many of the very-low and low-Ti mare basalts suggests, 1) that they come from a lunar source with similar Zr/Nb and Nb/Th ratios, 2) these ratios do not fractionate dramatically during substantial periods of LMO crystallization, and 3) only with ilmenite becoming a liquidus phase during the latter stages of LMO crystallization does the Nb/Th ratio increase in the cumulate horizon.  Modeling of the variations in Zr/Nb and Nb/Th in the mantle sources for the high-Ti basalts are shown in Fig. 4. These models include mixing between two mantle components and cumulate compositions during ilmenite crystallization from the LMO. In the 1058.pdf

!latter model, changing the percent cumulate ilmenite dramatically changes Nb/Th with only limited variation in Zr/Nb. Our preliminary modeling suggests that the high-Ti Apollo 11 and 17 basalts and volcanic glasses were produced by melting of distinct mantle sources produced by one or a combination of 1) mixing of a late-stage LMO cumulate mantle source rich in ilmenite (with high Nb/Th ratio) with a PM source perhaps during postLMO cumulate overturn, or 2) variations in the ilmenite content of late-stage cumulate horizons during LMO crystallization. Elimination of ilmenite from the cumulate source during melting has a substantial effect on Nb/Th of the melt. The fact that prior to 2.5 Ga, Earth’s oceanic basalts have similar incompatible element signatures suggests they came from a relatively unfractionated mantle source similar to primitive mantle in composition.  Such a source may be characteristic of a stagnant lid planet or satellite like the Moon, and if so, this suggests that Earth also may have been in a stagnant lid regime prior to 2.5 Ga.  An onset of plate tectonics on Earth around 3-2.5 Ga may have led to the production of DM and EM mantle sources after this time.  Figure 1. Zr/Nb-Nb/Th graph showing young oceanic basalts.
