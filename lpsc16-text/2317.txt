Introduction: Clasts with complex or unusual origins have been documented previously in ordinary chondrites [1]. Such clasts have been found relatively commonly in petrologic type 4-6 ordinary chondrites, because of the high abundance of these meteorite types. In comparison, type 3 ordinary chondrites are much rarer and therefore reports of exotic clasts are commensurately low. We have recently discovered a 5 mm, complex clast in the Semarkona LL3.00 ordinary chondrite, an object that appears to be the first documented example of such clastic material in this meteorite [2]. This object has a complex zonal structure that includes layers that contain microchondrules and rare Ca-Al-rich objects, indicative of an unusual evolutionary history.  In order to understand the sequence of events and the processes that were involved in the formation of the clast, layers, Ca-Al-rich objects and their relationship to the Semarkona parent-body, detailed microanalytical study using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Focused Ion Beam, Transmission Electron Microscopy (FIB-TEM) observations were made. These observations complement detailed, larger scale petrographic studies of other serial thin sections, reported by [2]. Methods: Several serial sections of AMNH sample #4128-t4 revealed a large clast [2]. One polished section #4128-t4-ps8 had been sampled for chondrule paleomagnetic studies [3]. Section 4128-t4-ps8 was initially mapped at AMNH at 3 µm/pxl and 1 µm/pxl using WDS stage map mode. The section was then studied by SEM on a FEI Quanta 3D FEGSEM/FIB operating at 30 kV, using backscattered electron (BSE) imaging at UNM. Five TEM sections of the clast and the rims were prepared using the FIB technique with a FEI Quanta 3D Dualbeam® FIB instrument. Bright and dark-field TEM images and quantitative EDS Xray analyses were carried out at 200 kV on a JEOL 2010F FEG TEM/Scanning TEM (STEM). Results: The clast (Fig. 1) is round in shape (~5 mm in diameter) and consists of a central core of ~3.9 mm in size surrounded by a sequence of three, texturally-distinct layers ending with a fine-grained matrix material. The central core consists of anorthite (~13 vol.%), glass (<2 vol.%), irregularly-shaped Nipoor sulfides (~6 vol.%), Fe,Ni metal (~19 vol.%), forsterite (~20 vol.%), and pyroxene (~41 vol.%). The bulk chemical composition of the central core of the clast was determined quantifying the EDS spectrum intensity of one X-ray map (1 x 1.5 mm). This bulk chemical composition is semiquantitative and it is not density corrected.   Figure 1. SEM BSE map of the polished section of Semarkona containing the clast (outlined by the red line). Detailed BSE (b) and WDS maps (c – Fe, Ni, S; d – Mg, Ca, Al and e – S) of the white rectangle shown in Fig. 1a. The yellow lines (c-e) are estimated layer boundaries. Two of the clast layers are coarse-grained and consist of : (1) a sulfur-free layer including heterogeneously distributed, irregular olivine-rich regions and Ni-rich metal nodules; (2) microchondrule-rich (µch.) layer that contains Ca-Al-rich objects. The final layer on the outside of the clast is (3) a fine-grained matrix-like rim (Fig. 1). The µch.-rich layer varies in thickness around the clast, being absent in some places (up to 300 µm in size). The boundary between the last two layers is not sharp and sometimes the fine-grained matrix rim also 2317.pdf

contains µchs. and Ca-Al-rich objects. The µchs. have smooth textures and are pyroxene-rich with an average size of ~6 µm (avg. of 40 µchs.). Six Ca-Al-rich objects were identified embedded in the µch. layer and in the fine-grained matrix (Fig. 1). The Ca-Al-rich objects vary in size from 14 to 84 µm with an average of ~40 µm, representing about 600 ppm from the total surface of the clast. These objects contain fine-grained, euhedral low-Ca pyroxene (En94-99, avg. En97), Ca-rich pyroxene (En67Wo33), minor amounts of anorthite (An100) and Ca-Al-rich glass (Fig. 3). The Ca-rich pyroxenes and the Ca-Al-rich glass contain up to 1.8 wt.% TiO2. The TiO2-rich pyroxene contains up to 8.3 wt.% Al2O3. Magnetite and Ni-bearing Fe sulfide (up to 6 wt.% Ni) were identified between the µchs. and the Ca-Al-rich objects.  Figure 2. Average bulk compositions (major and minor elements – in at.%) in the central core clast (black line), finegrained rim of the clast (red line) and the fine-grained matrix composition of Semarkona (purple shaded region) [4-6]. The data are normalized to the bulk composition of LL chondrites [7]. The elements are arranged in the order of increasing volatility. Discussion: The first clast identified in Semarkona appears to record a complex and unusual history, which is atypical of most materials that occur in ordinary chondrites and further demonstrates the diversity of materials and processes that occurred in the solar nebula. The texture and mineralogy of the clast core suggest that this object could have been partially melted rather than completely melted. This is indicated by the presence of minor amounts of glass and the irregular shapes of sulfides in the core of the inclusion. The bulk composition of the clast core is similar to the bulk composition of Semarkona (Fig. 2, [7]). The core of the clast contains Mg-rich phases, dominated by pyroxene, Ni-rich metal grains (~16 wt.% Ni), and it is relatively rich in irregularly shaped sulfides compaired to the most abundant objects in UOCs, i.e. chondrules. All of these characteristics are distinct from type I chondrules, which tend to be Ni-poor metal-bearing and sulfide-poor objects [8].  The clast is layered by three different types of materials. The texture and mineralogy of the two coarsegrained layers suggest that they were probably formed during a thermal event (flash heating) that processed only the exterior of the clast. The evidence of melting of the exterior of the clast include: (1) the sulfide depletion and the rounded metal nodules of the first coarse-grained layer compared to the clast core texture and mineralogy; (2) the shape and association of µchs. and Ca-Al-rich objects [9-10] and (3) the presence of glass (Fig. 3d). The high amount of sulfides in the external coarse-grained layer could indicate the migration of sulfides from the S-poor layer (the inside layer) towards the exterior.   Figure 3.
