Overview.  MESSENGER observations from Mercury orbit reveal signatures of field-aligned electric currents that we identify as Birkeland currents [1]. The current density distribution versus latitude, local time, magnetospheric activity, and altitude are consistent with externally driven currents. We have mapped the current density distributions to the planet's surface and modeled their closure through the planet for a radially varying electrical conductivity. A range of plausible conductivity profiles was used to determine the dependence of electric potential on conductivity structure, to estimate the fraction of current closing through the planetary core and to evaluate the effect of an electrically insulating regolith layer. Between 50 and 90% of the current closes through the core, and a ~100-mthick regolith reduces the total current by less than 1%. We present a relationship between the current, electric potential, and conductivity that can be used to constrain the conductivity structure given electric and magnetic field observations from Mercury orbit. Methodology. Using all MESSENGER Magnetometer data acquired at altitudes less than 1000 km, we first subtracted the axial-aligned offset dipole representation of the internal field, BInt [2,3], and model fields for the magnetopause and magnetotail currents, BExt [4]. The remaining signals, B, were transformed into Mercury body fixed (MBF) and Mercury solar orbital (MSO) coordinates (X sunward, Z northward). The MSO system is aberrated for the orbital motion of Mercury relative to the average solar wind speed. Analysis of Magnetic Signals: The B vectors are best ordered in MSO coordinates, implying that the signals are of external origin [3]. The largest B values occur poleward of ~60 N and are directed sunward [1,3]. The B values are typically tens of nT, ~10% of the planetary field, but can exceed 100 nT. Signals due to Birkeland currents should increase with decreasing altitude due to the convergence of the magnetic field at the pole, and indeed B is ~30% smaller at higher (Fig. 1, Yr 2) than at lower (Fig. 1, Yr 4) altitudes.  Derivation of Birkeland Current: Because Birkeland currents are field aligned, we subtracted the portion of B parallel to the total model field, BInt+BExt, to obtain the transverse residuals, B┴. For each year, we defined a mean "orbit surface" on which the B┴ were mapped. Because this surface changed as MESSENGER's orbit precessed, each year was analyzed separately. The curl of B┴ gives the current density normal to the surface, jn, and the current density parallel to the magnetic field is j = jn/cos where  is the angle between the mean observed field and the surface normal. The radial current density at the planet surface is given by jrS = j(BS/BObs)cosS, where BS = BInt+BExt evaluated at the surface and S is the angle between BS and the radial direction. The surface location was derived by mapping the model field down to the planet.   Figure 1. Average horizontal B in 1 latitude by 1 hr local time bins for descending orbit segments during the second (Yr 2) and fourth (Yr 4) years of orbit operations. The Sun is to the right (12 LT), and dawn is at the bottom (06 LT). The B are shown as line segments from the bin center in the B direction. Magnitude is shown by length and color. The dawn-dusk asymmetry is due to phasing between local time and Mercury's orbit [1,5]. The surface current density as a function of latitude and local time was calculated for each year of operations and within each year by magnetic disturbance level in five equal percentile bins from 0-20% for the quietest to 80-100% for the most disturbed intervals. Figure 2 shows results for jrS for two activity levels averaged over three years. This result demonstrates the dependence of jrS on magnetic disturbance. We find one region of downward current in the morning and another region of upward current in the evening. At Earth, Birkeland currents consist of similar currents, denoted as Region 1, and additionally a set of currents 1243.pdf

of opposite polarity, denoted Region 2, just equatorward of the first set [6,7]. The observations from MESSENGER extend 20 in latitude farther equatorward than shown in Figure 2 without any indication of Region 2 currents [1].  Figure 2. Average jrS from descending orbit segment data from 23 March 2011 to 31 March 2014. Upward and downward currents (in red and blue, respectively), with contours every 20 nA/m2 and current densities indicated by the color bar. Panels show current density for low (0-20%) and high (80-100%) magnetic disturbance levels [5]. Conductivity Model and Current Closure:  The jrS distributions were used as input to solve for current closure through the planet. For a single shell with an infinitely conducting interior, the ratio of the normalized maximum potential difference, , to the thickness of the finite-conductivity shell, , is nearly constant for  < 150 km [1]. We have generalized this calculation for an arbitrary variation of conductivity, , with depth, d = rM - r, where rM is Mercury's mean radius and r is radial distance. For a radially varying conductivity, the potential, , is solved by considering a series of thin shells of conductivity i spanning depths d0i to d1i. Within each shell 2 = 0, and the charges at the shell interfaces give the divergence of the electric field, E = -, required by the radial discontinuity in . At the surface we require Er = jrS/(0). At each shell interface, jr and the azimuthal electric field, E, must be continuous. At the inner boundary, d = dCore, and we take  =  ∞,  which gives (dCore) = 0. This formulation results in a sparse matrix constrained by jrS, which we inverted to obtain , E, and j for d = 0 to dCore. Results.  Guided by thermal evolution models for Mercury with a range of mineral compositions [8], we considered a radial profile of the form shown in Figure 3a. We used core depths from 370 to 470 km consistent with those derived from Mercury's gravity field and rotational state [9]. Just below the regolith, we assigned  = s and assumed an exponential increase with depth: (d) = sexp(d/), where  is a scale length. We let s = 10-4S/m and took  between 1 and 40 km. Since the conductivity may plateau with increasing depth [8], we took the minimum of Max and sexp(d/) and used Max from 0.01 to 1.0 S/m. We also considered a case with a 100-m-thick regolith with  = 0.01s. Results for the total current fraction closing through the core are shown in Figure 3b. Even for unrealistically steep conductivity profiles,  < 5 km, more than half of the total current closes through the core. More of the current closes through the core for smaller dCore. There is a maximum in current to the core near  ~ 20 to 30 km because for small  the lateral and radial mantle and crustal conductances are comparable, whereas for large  the resistance to the core through the mantle and crust inhibits current flow to the core.  Significantly, for cases K through O (Figure 3b), / is constant to within 0.01%. The resistive regolith layer increases  by only 1% but the slope is the same as in the other cases. This result implies that the simple proportionality between s and  derived earlier [1] actually holds for radially varying conductivity.  Figure 3.  (a) Model radial conductivity profile and (b) fraction of total current closing through the core for a range of conductivity profiles. Discussion.  Letting / = C, the relationship between the maximum surface current density, jrS,max, and the maximum potential difference, V, can be written as s/ = CrM jrS,max/V. Taking V = 15 to 30 kV [10,11], we have s/ ~ (5 ± 2.5) x 10-11 S/m2. Coordinated measurements of electric and magnetic fields in orbit about Mercury should allow a significant reduction in this uncertainty. Constraints on s or , e.g., from induction signals on time scales relevant to mantle conductance, could be used together with this result to determine these parameters. References. [1] Anderson B.
