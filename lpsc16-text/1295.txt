HYDROUS EARLY MOON? CONSTRAINTS FROM HYDROUS LUNAR MAGMA OCEAN SOLIDIFICATION EXPERIMENTS.  Y. H. Lin*, E. S. Steenstra and W. van Westrenen, Faculty of Earth and Life Sciences, VU University Amsterdam, The Netherlands (y.lin@vu.nl)    Introduction:  Since ~2008, the traditional view of a dry Moon [1] has been challenged by the identification of water in lunar pyroclastic glasses [2, 3], lunar minerals including apatite [3-12] and melt inclusions in lunar olivine [3, 13, 14]. Water could therefore play an important role in the evolution of the Moon, including perhaps during the cooling and crystallization of an early lunar magma ocean (LMO). Numerical [15] and recent experimental [16, 17] models simulating solidification of the LMO were all performed under anhydrous conditions. Although some models of the effect of water on the evolution of the Moon have been published [e.g. 18], these are based on experimental data of physical and chemical rock properties obtained under anhydrous conditions. Water has been shown to greatly affect the physical and chemical properties of minerals and magmas, even at low concentrations [19]. Therefore, the presence of significant amounts of water in the ancient lunar interior requires a reassessment of lunar evolution models. This study: Here, we show results of a ~95% crystallization sequence of a wet LMO using experiments at pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions that are directly relevant to the evolution of the lunar interior. A 'two-stage' model of magma ocean solidification is assumed, which features early efficient crystal suspension in magma and corresponding equilibrium crystallization, followed by fractional crystallization of the later residual magma ocean. The crystallization sequence and composition of the resulting concentric cumulate layers with different mineralogical assemblages are of primary importance for further understanding key events in lunar evolution, including the thickness of a plagioclase-rich crust [20]. The aim of this work is to solve two main questions: (1) What is the crystallization sequence of a hydrous LMO and how do the chemical compositions of cumulates and corresponding residual LMO vary with progressive solidification under hydrous conditions. (2) What are the quantitative differences between dry and wet LMO solidification scenarios. Answering the latter question could provide new constraints on the amount of water that can/should/might be present in the Moon during LMO crystallisation.               Experimental:  Except for the water content of the experiments, we use a similar experimental approach as in our companion work focusing on the evolution of a dry LMO [17]. Hydrous experiments were performed from the fifth step of our dry LMO solidification model [17], which is the first step in which plagioclase starts crystallizing. In the first set of experiments reported here, we simulate a hydrous LMO by adding quantitative amounts of Mg(OH)2 to produce 2 wt.% OH (1 wt.% H2O) upon melting from the fourth step of the dry LMO solidification series [17]. This implies a water content of 3150 ppm H2O in the initial LMO. The water concentrations in subsequent starting materials are calculated and added based on mass-balance and the percent of the residual liquid of the previous crystallization step with removal of the corresponding crystals. Future experiments will start with different initial water concentrations.        Analytical:  All experiments were analyzed with a JEOL electron microprobe at  Utrecht University (15kV, 25nA for Si, Ti, Al, Fe, Mg and Ca), and checked for contamination and/or iron loss. The mineral and melt proportions were determined both by mass balance calculations and area percentage using an EDAX EDS system in imaging mode.         Results:  Unsurprisingly, our results differ markedly from our companion experimental study performed on the same bulk magma ocean composition under anhydrous conditions [17]. There are obvious differences in formation conditions and the amount of crystallized minerals between the anhydrous and wet LMO [15,17] (Fig. 1). Under hydrous conditions, plagioclase first appears between 73 and 77 per cent crystallisation (PCS) (68-76 PCS for [17]). Ca-rich pyroxene starts crystallizing at 70-73 PCS, and olivine does not crystallize at >77 PCS. Plagioclase starts crystallizing at 1200 ºC in our experiments, 40 ºC lower than that for a dry system [17]. Subsequently, the crystallizing amounts of plagioclase are smaller than those produced at the same P-T conditions in a dry system (Fig. 1). From 89 to 95 PCS, spinel, ilmenite and quartz appear and coexist with plagioclase and cpx. Corresponding residual LMO compositions also differ markedly from those produced under dry conditions [17].       Discussion and conclusions: The presence of water significantly suppresses the crystallization of plagioclase [19], and results in the formation of spinel. At ~95 PCS, the anorthosite crust has a thickness of 32.2 km, which is about 26 km thinner compared to ~58 km under dry conditions [17]. This suggests that improved estimates of lunar crustal thickness [e.g. 21,22] could be used as a hygrometer for the early lunar interior.   1295.pdf

Upcoming experiments will be focused on constraining estimates of the total predicted thickness of the plagioclase crust under different lunar interior water contents.    References:  [1] Taylor S.
