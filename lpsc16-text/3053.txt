Introduction:  Remote Raman has been demostrated as a viable technique for planetary exploration. Raman spectroscopy requires no sample preparation and can provide univocal chemical characterization without sample damage. Remote Raman systems fitted with gated lasers and detectors can perform fast measurments under daylight at increasing distances. Larger measurement ranges increase the efective exploring area of a planetary rover, saving mission time and increasing the number of accesible targets.  The University of Hawaii (UH) has developed multiple Remote Raman systems. The system used for this study can perform measuremenst of organics and inorganic chemicals such as benzene or calcite at 120 meters range [1]. In this study we report the ability of the Remote Raman system to perform good quality fast measurements up to 430 m range. UH is collaborating with LANL adnd french partnersvIRAP and CNES under the Mars 2020 mission in which the SuperCam instrument will perform Remote Raman analysis of Mars rocws, alongth with LIBS and time-resolved fluorescence [2]. Experimental setup:  Figure 1 shows the Remote Raman system in the UH Manoa campus, with the target samples placed in a balcony at 430 meter range. The systme is gated with coaxial geometry. The collection is made through at 8-inch (203.2 mm) diameter telescope (Meade LX-200R AdvancedRitcheyChertien, f/10). The sample is excited with a frequency-doubled Q-switched Nd:YAG pulsed laser source (Quantel Laser, CFR model, 532 nm, 100 mJ/pulse, 15 Hz, pulse width 10 ns). The system is fitted with a Kaiser Optical Systems f/1.8 HoloSpec spectrometer equipped with and a 1024x256 intensified CCD camera (PI-IMAX, Princeton Instrument, Trenton, NJ). The telescope is directly coupled to the spectrometer through a camera lens. A 532-nm notch filter is used to remove the laser light. The system is mounted on a panand-tilt scanner allowing to accurately aim the system at large distances. The laser was focused on the sample through a 10x beam expander mounted in front of the laser. We focused it to obatain a parallel beam and a laser spot 10 cm in diameter at 430 meter. We succesfully measured acetone, benzene, cyclohexane, dry ice, gypsum, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, potassium nitrate, ammonium nitrate, marble rock, methanol, quartz, sulfur, urea, water and water ice, acetonitrile, anhydrite, and magnesium sulfate with integration times of 10 s or less. Liquid samples were placed in large vials and powdered samples were placed iside 4 inch diameter petri dishes.   Figure 1: experimental setup showing the Remote Raman instrument and, in the enlargement, the target sample location 430 m away.   Results and Discussion:  Figure 2 shows the remote Raman spectra of ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3), potassium nitrate (KNO3), potassium chlorate (KClO3) and urea ( CO(NH2)2) with fast 1 second integration time, equivalent to 15 laser pulses. In the potassium nitrate spectrum, the 1052 cm-1 peak corresponds to the symmetric stretching vibrations υ1 in the nitrate ions NO3-. The 1349 cm-1 peak corresponds to the υ3 mode. The NH4NO3 and KNO3 molecules both contain NO3- ions, and the 1044, 1288, and 1655 cm-1 Raman  Figure 2: Remote Raman spectra of NH4NO3, KNO3, KClO3, and urea at 430 m range with 1 s detection time.

ple peaks between 1400 and 1500 cm-1 are the result of vibrational coupling between some ammonium ion deformation and nitrate stretching. Similarly urea and potassium chlorate show distinct Raman peaks that allow unequivocal chemical identification at 430 meter range and 1 second integration time. Urea peaks are found at 1002 cm-1 as well as at 1160 cm-1. These two peaks correspond to the two NH2 rocking vibrations in the planar NH2-CO-NH2 urea molecule. The peak at 1468 cm−1 corresponds to the anti-symmetric NCN stretching mode and the peak at 1540 cm-1 to a NH2 bending mode. The 1578 and 1647 cm−1 urea peaks are also visible and correspond to stretching modes of the free and hydrogen bonded C-O group. The potassium chlorate shows its fingerprint peak at 930 cm-1 very clearly. Figure 3 shows the remote Raman spectra of gypsum (CaSO4 2H2O) and epsum salt (MgSO4 7H2O) with 10 seconds integration time, equivalent to 150 laser pulses. Gypsum and epsom salt are both hydrated sulfates and therefore show similiar Raman peaks corresponding to the symmetric stretching vibrations υ1 in the sulfate ions SO3 at 1008 and 984 cm-1 respectively. The slight difference in peak possitions and the sharp contrast in the O-H streching region (~3400 cm-1) are enought to differenciate between both compounds at 430 meters. Figure 4 shows the remote Raman spectra of dry ice (solid CO2) and water ice (solid H2O) with 10 seconds acquisition time. Dry ice and water ice are commonplace in the Solar System. Both spectra are very distinct.  Carbon dioxide spectrum shows its characteristic doublet at 1284 and 1392 cm-1 while water ice shows the sharper solid water peak at ~3100 cm-1. This peak depends on temperature and can help in determining the temperature of the measured water ice.  Figure 3: Remote Raman spectra of gypsum and MgSO4 with 10 s acquisition time at 430 m range.
