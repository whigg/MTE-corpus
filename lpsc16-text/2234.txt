Introduction: Pluto is one of the largest Kuiper Belt objects, with a radius of 𝑅 ≈  1185 km [1, 2] and a bulk density of 𝜌 ≈1.85 g/cm3 [1], suggesting a mixed ice-rock composition [3,4]. The New Horizons flyby on July 14 2015 revealed incredible geologic diversity on Pluto's surface [1]. In addition to very recent geologic resurfacing in Sputnik Planum, where nitrogen and carbon monoxide ices may be flowing, New Horizons images also hint at recent geologic activity in the water ice shell [1]. Large "mountains" on the western and southern margin of Tombaugh Regio as well as scarps and troughs in Cthulu Regio suggest tectonic activity in the water ice "bedrock" [1].  What is the driver of this recent tectonic activity? One possibility is global volume change due to phase changes in the ice shell [5]. If Pluto has an ocean that is slowly freezing, it would cause global volume expansion and extensional stresses at the surface. Conversely, if ice Ih is converting into a denser phase such as ice II, it would lead to global volume contraction. Robuchon and Nimmo [6] modeled the thermal evolution of Pluto and find that if the ice shell is conductive, an ocean would form and survive to the present, leading to a present day extensional tectonic regime. However, this result may be sensitive to the density and thermal conductivity of the silicate core. For example, higher thermal conductivities would allow heat to escape the core more efficiently and lead to colder final states [e.g. 7]. It is necessary to vary these parameters over a range of reasonable values to understand their effect the Pluto's thermal evolution. Here, we simulate the thermal evolution of Pluto to understand its present day internal structure and tectonic environment. We find that the thermal conductivity and density of the silicate core strongly control Pluto's thermal evolution. Changes in these parameters lead to two different thermal evolution pathways: 1) Pluto forms an ocean that survives to present day or 2) the ocean freezes and ice II forms at depth. These scenarios lead to distinct types of tectonic activity at the surface that may be observable by New Horizons.  Methods: We have constructed a spherical onedimensional, finite difference model of the thermal evolution of Pluto. We assume Pluto is differentiated into a silicate core and a water ice shell [3,4,6]. Initially, we assume that both the core and ice shell transmit heat conductively. We begin our simulations just after the Pluto-Charon system has finished its tidal evolution into the dual synchronous state, 100 Myr after the formation of CAIs [8]. We vary the silicate conductivity and silicate density to understand their influence on the present day internal structure. The density of the silicate core is varied between 2.45g/cm3 (similar to the inferred density of the core of Enceladus [9]) and 3.5 g/cm3 (appropriate for compressed carbonaceous chondrite [4]). The thickness of the ice shell is varied with silicate density to match the bulk density of Pluto. In the core, we use heating from long-lived radioisotopes with isotopic abundances appropriate for CI Chondrites [6,10]. We vary the silicate conductivity, kr, between 1 to 4 W/kg-K [6,7,11,12].  We use a temperature dependent thermal conductivity for ice, 𝑘!"# = 651/𝑇 W/kgK [13], but limit the conductivity in the top 5 km to 1 W/kgK to account for the effect of increased porosity [14]. The surface temperature is constant at 𝑇! = 40 K. Everywhere in the satellite, the initial temperature 𝑇! = 150 K.  Melting at the base of the ice shell can occur if the heat flow out of the core exceeds the maximum heat flow that can be transferred conductively through the ice shell. After an ocean forms, the ocean boundary moves upward at a rate,  !"!" = !!!!!!!!" , where 𝐹 is the heat flow at element 𝑖 and 𝐿 is the latent heat of water ice. We use a pressure dependent melting temperature [15] and assume an isothermal ocean. We benchmark our model against exact solutions to the Stefan equation [16]. We also treat the phase transition between ice Ih and ice II, a dense polymorph of ice with a rhombohedral structure and a density 𝜌!! = 1.18 g/cm3 [17]. The equilibrium temperature (Teq) between these phases is described by  𝑇!" = 𝑃 − 14 0.827, where 𝑃 is pressure in MPa and temperature is in Kelvin [18, 19]. As temperature drops, ice II becomes the stable phase in the ice shell. For likely pressures at the base of Pluto's shell, ice II begins to form when temperatures drop below ~170 K. The reaction of ice Ih to ice II liberates ~1 kJ/mol [20]. Results: So far, we have examined ~50 histories of Pluto's thermal evolution and tracked several important parameters over time, including: 1) the surface heat flux, 2) ocean thickness, 3) ice II thickness, 4) surface stress and 5) surface strain. In all of our simulations so far, the surface heat flux achieves a maximum 5 - 6 mW/m2, and exponentially decays to ~3 2234.pdf

mW/m2 at present. Figure 1 shows the results of a simulation with rock density 2.75 g/cm3 and thermal conductivity 3 W/kg K. An ocean forms at 650 Myr, reaches a thickness of ~100 km but then freezes by 3.5 Gyr. In the last ~200 Myr, ice II begins to form deep in the ice shell. This occurs because the ice shell cools sufficiently to permit the plutotherm to cross the phase boundary. A layer of ice II, 80 km thick, forms. This causes a global surface contraction of ~3% and compressional stresses of up to 100 MPa, sufficient to drive the formation of global tectonic features. The persistence of the ocean and the formation of ice II depend strongly on the thermal conductivity and density of the silicate core.  Figure 1: A cross section of Pluto's ice shell through time, with 𝑘! = 3 W/kgK and 𝜌! =2.75 g/cm3. White, green and blue represent ice Ih, ice II and liquid water, respectively.  Pluto's Present State: Figure 2 shows our results for the present state of the ice shell as a function of silicate conductivity and H2O layer thickness (which varies with 𝜌!). For H2O layers thinner than 240 km (corresponding to 𝜌! < 2.7 g/cm3) the ice shell is entirely composed of ice I. Thinner ice shells are more efficient at removing heat and staying cool, but pressures at the base of the ice shell are not high enough to form ice II. Thicker H2O layers and low silicate conductivities lead to scenarios where a liquid ocean persists to present day. Higher silicate conductivities allow the core to lose heat more efficiently, leading to scenarios where the ocean freezes and ice II forms.  Ocean: Our simulations show that an ocean on Pluto can survives only if the water layer is thicker than 200 km and if 𝑘! < 3 W/kgK. However, if ammonia is present in the ice shell the liquidus of the ammonia-water system decreases and the solidus decreases to 173 K [15]. Thus if ammonia is present a partially molten ocean is stable in most scenarios.  Convection in the ice shell, although not explicitly modeled here, may prevent ocean formation by removing heat more efficiently [6] and may lead to colder scenarios where thick layers of ice II form.   Figure 2: Present state of the ice shell as a function of silicate conductivity and H2O layer thickness. Green and blue contours show the thickness of the ice II layer and black lines show contours for the ocean thickness.  Resurfacing. In colder scenarios where ice II forms, large surface contractions occur in the last few 100 Myr. This scenario could account for recent tectonic activity suggested by New Horizons if the mountains on the margin of Tombaugh Regio are the result of compressional uplift. Conversely, if the surface morphology suggests recent extensional tectonic activity on a global scale, it could suggest that global volume expansion is occurring and an ocean has persisted to present day.
