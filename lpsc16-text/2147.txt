Introduction: Quantitatively modeled mineral abundances derived from remote sensing data place critically important constraints on past fluid compositions, atmospheric conditions, weathering timelines, and sub-surface processes on the terrestrial planets. Such results are one of the cornerstones of interpretations of surface geology on terrestrial planets. Intimate mixtures of minerals (i.e., rocks and soils) are prevalent at all scales on planetary surfaces. However, many of the relevant remote sensing instruments used to analyze these mixtures (Casini VIMS, MRO CRISM, and AVIRIS) cover the visible and near-infrared (VNIR; 0.35-2.5 m). In this wavelength region, spectral response is not a linear function of composition, so direct extraction of quantitative abundances through linear unmixing is not possible.       Radiative transfer (RT) theory can be used to tackle the problem of nonlinear spectral mixing and extract quantitative mineral abundances in the VNIR [1] if the optical constants, the real and imaginary indices or refraction, n and k, for the minerals in the mixture are known [2]. These are determined using laboratory spectra coupled with the appropriate theory [3]. Where large, single crystals are available, Lorentz-Lorentz dispersion analysis can be performed on spectra from oriented crystals, but classical dispersion theory breaks down when k is small, as in the VNIR, which leaves determining k from transmission spectra of thin sections and using the Fresnel reflectance equation to determine n [3]. For samples that only form as finegrained powders, RT theory can be used to determine k from reflectance spectra of powders, provided that grain size >> λ [2]. The Kramers-Kronig relation can then be used to determine n from k in an iterative fashion [4]. Spectral unmixing using RT theory, however, has seen limited use due to lack of optical constants for a wide variety of materials [5]. Furthermore, where optical constants do exist, adequate descriptions of physical and chemical properties of the samples are often lacking, and powder methods are rarely verified against single crystal or thin section methods.      This abstract represents the first in a series of studies on well characterized minerals common to planetary surfaces where RT and thin section optical constants will be determined and compared. Plagioclase feldspars like bytownite (nominally Na0.2Ca0.8Al1.8Si2.2O8) are common in the crusts of terrestrial planets and asteroids, especially Earth, the Moon, Mercury, and possibly Venus [6-8], making this an ideal mineral to begin this study. Optical constants for bytownite appear in four-decade old literature, but serve as a valid point of comparison. Methods: Bulk bytownite was acquired and prepared as outlined in [9]. All samples were wet-sieved to remove clinging fines and analyzed at Brown University using the NASA/Keck Reflectance Experiment Laboratory (RELAB) facility using their bidirectional spectrometer to obtain data from 0.32 to 2.55 µm, referenced to Spectralon. Each grain size was analyzed at i=20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70, and e=0.   Optical constants n and k were determined using in-house, open-source software that models the interaction of light with the particulate surface using Hapke’s formulation of radiative transfer theory [2, 10]. For this initial assessment, it is assumed that the backscatter function, B(g)=1, and porosity is ignored, leaving  𝑟𝑐 =𝑤4𝜋1𝜇0+𝜇{𝑝(𝑔) + 𝐻(𝜇0)𝐻(𝜇) − 1}, where p(g) is the phase function determined in [11] and H(x) is the Ambartsumian-Chandrasekhar Hfunction of the cosines of the angle (x). The program first determines a guess for k using fixed values for n and p(g), and using a lookup table to determine k. This guess is then used in a least squares minimization which finds a single k() for 3 grain sizes simultaneously with apparent grain size <D>, internal scattering function (s), and phase function coefficients b and c for each grain size as variable parameters. A Kramers- Kronig transformation is then used on this VNIR k combined with MIR k determined from LorenzLorentz dispersion analysis to determine a VNIR n. This step is taken because it was found that the value of n determined in this way is highly dependent on the value of k in the MIR [10]. Next, b(l) and c(l) are determined for 3 grain sizes at 7 phase angles simultaneously using k(l) and n(l) as scalable parameters and <D> and (s) as variable parameters.      Results: The imaginary index of refraction, k, for the three grain sizes calculated individually and for the multi grain size minimization are shown in Fig. 1 along with the converged <D> values and the modeled data using the multi grain size k is overlaid on the reflectance data in Fig. 2.

the multi grain size k is not an average of the three individual grain size ks, and second, this simplified model is not adequately describing the data. Specifically, the grain size term is not completely compensating for the differenced seen in the three different grain size spectra. Considering the results from the phase function minimization step (Fig. 3), it appears that assuming a single phase function for all three grain sizes is an oversimplification, and a different phase function entirely may need to be considered. Calculating the porosity for each grain size and including a porosity term could also help improve the results. The real index of refraction, n, is shown in Fig. 4.  Figure 1.

Conclusions and Future Work: Determining optical constants using Hapke’s formulation of radiative transfer theory creates a mathematically underdetermined problem (fewer constraints than unknowns). The multi-step iterization procedure, multiple grain sizes, and multiple phase angles are all used to add sufficient constraints; however, dividing the minimization steps may over constrain the problem. These are the first results from a multi-step optimization that will include modifications to the theory used to model the radiance coefficient, as well as the minimization methods used to employ the theory. These results will be compared to thin section-derived optical constants to help validate this method. This procedure will then be applied to additional well characterized samples.   Figure 3.
