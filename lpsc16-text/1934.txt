Introduction:  COSIMA, the Cometary Secondary Ion Mass Analyser, is a secondary ion time-of-flight mass spectrometer on board ESA’s Rosetta mission. COSIMA collects dust from the coma of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and analyses it [1], [2]. During arrival and the still ongoing escort phase, we have collected several thousands of cometary particles on square-centimeter sized metal target plates [3]. These particles are photographed for bookkeeping and classification [4]. A selection of them is further analyzed by mass spectrometry. Methods and Data:  We use our high resolution (1400 at 100 u) secondary ion mass spectrometer to obtain mass spectra of the cometary particles and of the targets, as well, to obtain background contamination control. The data is calibrated in a first step on board the spacecraft to derive a time to mass relation. In a second step all spectra are rescaled to reference spectra to obtain better matching and the same mass binning. This allows for a better resolution, when looking at the sum of many spectra, which is commonly done to improve the signal to noise ratio. COSIMA spectra generally show a mixture of peaks that originate from the particle and from the target, as cometary particles can be smaller than the primary ion beam. The more of the primary ions are hitting the particle, the lower is the contribution of background secondary ions and vice versa. These background peaks are often larger than the signal from the particle, hiding the information (Figure 1). It is therefore necessary to remove the background signal, e.g. by subtraction to obtain quantitative results [2, 5]. Correlating the different mass bins between several spectra that originate from clear on and off particle positions can also differentiate between elements and compounds that are either on the particle or from the background. 1934.pdf

  Figure 1: Three parts of one of our high resolution mass spectra (consisting of the sum of several single spectra from the line scan in Fig. 2), showing the results for particle "David.Toivesi.2" from June 2015. Resolution decreases with mass, but even for high and midrange masses, like shown in the third panel, a clear distinction can be made between peaks that are just below or above an integer mass. While some elements like Na, Mg and Fe are clearly recognizable by their own peaks, others like Al and K appear only as shoulders on “organic” peaks of the same integer mass. The large peaks that are slightly above integer mass are mostly organic contamination on the target [8].  Results:  Figure 2 shows the particle “David.Toivesi.2” with a part of a line scan of individual mass spectra (represented by red circles). David is a so called “shattered cluster”[4]. This is one of the type of particles that show some form of break up on impact onto the target plate, hinting at different tensile stregths of the particles [7]. The particles are generally much brighter then the target plate, which in this case is covered with Au nanoparticles (“black gold”)[9]. Some elements like Na are very prominent in our results, due to their abundance and because they are easily ionized by the indium beam of COSIMA (Fig. 1) and show up specifically on the position of the particle when performing scans (Fig. 3). Therefore, we could report about those early on the Rosetta mission [6]. Other elements are harder to identify or to be associated with the particles. However, careful background subtraction and peak fitting/deconvolution has led to the identification of the following mineral building elements in particles sampled inside 67P’s coma: Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Fe, and Ni, including some of their isotopes. Not all particles carry the same set of elements. Other elements are harder to be attributed to the particles, but there are at least hints for Li and Mn.   Figure 2: Cometary Particle David as imaged by COSISCOPE. The red circles present the aimed position of the primary ion beam during different line scans across the particle. The pixel size is 14 µm, the size of the ion beam on the target is approximately 35x50 µm.  Figure 3: Mass 23 (Na) from a scan over particle David.Toivesi.2. The brighter the color, the higher the counts are for Na. Figure 2 shows only part of this full scan. Long scans extending outside the particles give information about the local background.
