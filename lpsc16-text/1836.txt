Introduction: One of the key geochemical findings about the bulk interior of Mars was the polybaric two-stage mantle melting and subsequent differentiation to generate the parent magma of the incompatible trace-element depleted Martian basalts from major-element study and isotope systematics [14]. The mantle source and parent magma of the traceelement enriched Martian basalts were successfully modeled by a mixing process between the depleted mantle and an enriched component [2, 4]. In this study using REE data of melt-inclusions in Tissint, a depleted shergottite, we quantitatively model the generation of parent magma of the shergottites from the depleted Martian mantle (DMM) and the subsequent fractionation and enrichment. Methodology: Major-element compositions of six melt-inclusions in two polished sections of Tissint were acquired using a CAMECA SX-100 EPMA at PRL. In-situ trace element analysis of the meltinclusions was carried out using a NWR-213 Thermo X SeriesII LA-ICPMS at NGRI. Olivine-Hosted Melt-Inclusions: The Martian meteorite Tissint was classified as an olivine-phyric shergottite [5]. Megacrystic olivines contain sparsely occurred melt-inclusions. Based on occurrences in host olivine, size and shape of the melt-inclusions, constituent daughter phases, their modal abundances and chemistry range, we distinguish two types of meltinclusions in Tissint (Fig. 1). Type-I melt-inclusions are sub-rounded with 40-80 µm in largest diameter and occur in the olivine core (Fo76-70) (Fig. 1a). Type-II melt-inclusions are mostly rounded with ≤30 µm in largest diameter and occur at Fo62-55 of the host olivine (Fig. 1b). Type-I melt-inclusions contain low-Ca pyroxene (LCP), high-Ca pyroxene (HCP), glass and occasional chromite and spinel. HCPs and LCPs in these melt-inclusions are massive. Type-II meltinclusions are mostly glassy groundmass, which contains skeletal HCP and peripheral chromite grains. Melt Compositions: Present bulk composition (PBC), in major-elements, of the melt-inclusions was calculated from the average modal abundance (wt %) and chemical composition of the daughter phases. A trend of decreasing Mg# and increasing Si-, Al- and alkali-contents were observed from the PBCs of TypeI (PBC1) to Type-II (PBC2) melt-inclusions in the olivine–plagioclase–quartz ternary phase diagram projected from wollastonite [6]. Type-I melt-inclusions are dominated by pyroxene (92 vol %), indicating high Mg# (74), low-Al (2.5 wt% Al2O3) and low-alkali (0.25 wt% Na2O+K2O) contents. Type-II meltinclusions are least magnesian (Mg# 39), most aluminous (12.5 wt% Al2O3) and alkalic (1.8 wt% Na2O+K2O). The PBC2 is compositionally in the range of the observed melt-inclusions of Tissint by [7]. PBC1 plots in the olivine field, while PBC2 plots within the plagioclase-silica field.  Melts in-equilibrium with the host olivines of the melt-inclusions are Mg# 52-46 (Type-I), and 35-31 (Type-II), considering partition coefficient of Fe/Mg between olivine and co-existing melt as ~ 0.35. In comparison, the PBC values are Mg# 74 and 39, respectively, for Type-I, and -II melt-inclusions. The calculated PBC1 and PBC2 are more magnesian than the melts in-equilibrium with host olivines, which indicates significant post-entrapment re-equilibration of Fe (and Mg) with the host olivine. The postentrapment corrections were performed to retrieve the primary trapped melt (PTL) compositions. MELTS algorithm [8] was used to determine the minimum amount of olivine that was deficient in the respective PBCs of the melt-inclusion types. We further estimated the true parent magma of Tissint from the PTL1, which yielded requirement of an extra 22 wt % olivineaddition to the PTL1.  Trace-element analyses were done on exposed surface of two Type-I, and two Type-II meltinclusions.

inclusions (Fig. 2). The absolute REE content in TypeII melt-inclusions displays parallel trend but somewhat lower value in comparison to the Tissint whole rock. REE content of the Type-II melt-inclusions is in the range of that observed for the melt-inclusions of Tissint from the study of [7]. The light REEs (e.g., La to Nd) in Type-I melt-inclusions are an order of magnitude depleted compared to that in Type-II and the whole-rock.  Entrapment Stages of Melt-Inclusions: Equilibrium between the highest-Mg olivine (Mg# 8081) and the WR (Mg# 60) indicates early-stage phases of Tissint crystallized in a closed system. However, the enrichment of Al, Ca, Na, P and REE contents in the WR composition may indicate the effect of crustal assimilation or magma mixing processes during the late-stages of crystallization of primary Mg-rich phases. The MELTS model calculation indicates 15-30 % crystallization from PM to PTL1, 40-50 % crystallization from PM to PTL2, and 20-25 % from PTL1 to PTL2. The REE-enrichment was 3-5 times for LREE (La-Sm), 2-3 times for MREE (Eu-Er) and 1-2 times for HREE (Tm-Lu) from Type-I to Type-II meltinclusions. Using the partition coefficients of REE between shergottite mineral and melt phases from [9], we calculate that the difference in REE content between the Type-I and Type-II melt-inclusions demonstrates a large range (20-80 %) of crystallization. The amount of crystallization is 70-80 % for LREE (La-Sm), 50-65 % for MREE (Eu-Er) and 20-50 % for HREE (Tm-Lu) from Type-I to Type-II melt-inclusions. It must be noticed that there is a mismatch in the estimated crystallization amount between the model calculations involving the major elements and the trace elements, which provides another clue that the Tissint whole-rock does not represent a closed system throughout its crystallization and underwent initiation of enrichment during 40-50 % stages of crystallization (from PM to PTL2). Mantle Melting and Subsequent Enrichment: To model the REE of the most-depleted Type-I meltinclusion from the DMM source of [3], we adopted two successive stages of melting (9.0±1.0 % and 4.0±0.5 %) of a mantle mineralogy similar to that chosen by [4]. The chosen mantle mineralogy yielded the best matching REE-content for the parent magma of Tissint (Fig. 2). The PM of Tissint was necessarily formed from a garnet-bearing mantle source, which underwent two times partial melting.  Although depleted but PTL2 contains ~ 10 times higher REE-abundances than the PM of Tissint. The REE-abundances in PTL2 is somewhat similar to that of Tissint whole-rock and at least LREE part of the highly evolved but depleted shergottite QUE 94201 (Fig. 2). Modeling of PTL2 involved fractional crystallization of the PM, followed by mixing between the residual melt after 45% crystallization and an Al, Ca, Na, P and REE rich component, which can be crustal material or hypothetical last dreg of trapped melt composition from the solidified Martian magma ocean [3]. Fractional crystallization calculations were used to derive the residual melt (55%) using MELTSderived proportion of major silicates and calculated bulk partition coefficients from [9, 10]. In next stage, the residual melt was mixed with various crustal components. Model calculation indicates 0.1-2 % mixing of the enriched crustal and trapped melt components was required to reproduce the PTL2, and whole rocks of Tissint and LREE of QUE 94201 compositions (Fig. 2). This model calculation explains that the enrichment during the Type-II to the later stages did reset the whole-rock trace-element budget in Tissint. This is because the incompatible traceelements can enhance their content in the bulk sample via carrier phases of very low modal abundances, which is therefore insensitive to the mass balance. We propose the presence of Al, Ca, Na, P and REE- rich layer at the shallower upper mantle above the depleted mantle source region during the geologic evolution of Mars.
