Retrieving ballistic parameters from the ray patterns of impact ejecta onthe Moon; mainly that of the Tycho crater P. M. Jo..gi and D. A. Paige, Earth, Planetary,and Space Sciences, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, 90095-1567, USA (jogi@physics.ucla.edu).Introduction: Lunar ray patterns provide a test ofour understanding of impact and ejecta mechanics.Recent observations by LROC [1] has resultedin detailed normalized light (643 nm) reflectancemaps of the entire Moon. These maps show thatseveral of the impact craters anchor extensive rayfans which in some cases reaches across large distances (thousands of km). The prominence, in thisrespect, of the near side’s Tycho crater triggeredseveral earlier investigations including, two-body,ballistic simulations [2, 3]. The ejecta and reimpactdynamics are well understood in this approximation and may, if need arises, be supplemented bygeneralizations to those of “wandering” pole situations [4]; all such ballistics formulae can be conveniently manipulated [5].Methods and Results: We use standard imageanalysis tools [6] in order to select sequences oflocations within particular ray filaments. The resulting data set constitute one terminus of the, assumed, ballistic trajectory path. The other terminus, the initiation site, is allowed to attain a rangeof positions within the confines of the impact craterrim boundary. Fixing the value of the rotation rateof the Moon and the direction of its rotation axiswill then determine a multidimensional parameter volume (i.e. intervals of time of flight, speed,and ranges of launching vector angles) for the Keplerian motion of the ejecta fragment. Proceeding in this fashion along a specific ray producesa family of distinct parameter volumes. We further process these parameter volumes by searching for maximum overlap between volumes associated with pairs of adjacent reimpact locations onthe ray of interest. Various forms of likelyhood assignments can then be computed for the aggregatedshape of the ejecta launching vectors. The Tychocrater ray setting is analyzed accordingly with anadded emphasis on providing plausible scenariosfor the discernment of launching parameter valuesallowing for antipodal reconnections.The far side of the moon is repleat with cratersanchoring distinct ray patches and among thesewe select some of the more clearly delineated fora launching parameter determination analogous tothat performed on the Tycho ensemble. Commonfeatures are recognized and anisotrophies in raypattern direction distributions are categorized.References[1] A. K. Boyd, et al.
