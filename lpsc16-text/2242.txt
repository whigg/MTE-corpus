Thiemens, University of California, San Diego, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 920930356 (subrata@ucsd.edu).  Introduction: Dust particles are obiquitous throughout the universe and constitutes about 1 mass % in the interstellar medium (ISM) and may be as high as ten % in planetary nebula [1, 2]. Dust particles are mainly of two types based on the stellar out-flow environments- carbonaceous and silicates. All dust is significantly processed during their lifetime journey from the stellar region through diffuse, dense or molecular clouds to the new born star or its planetary system. The formation of metal oxide dust is a complex process. Simple condensation at the cooler region of the stellar outflow does not produce complex oxides, i.e., the silicate minerals (Forsterite- Mg2SiO4, Fayalite-Fe2SiO4, etc.). One of the intriguing observations associated with the refractory silicate minerals found in primitive meteorites is their unique oxygen isotopic compositions. The O-isotopic composition of high temperature mineral phases, e.g., anorthite, melilite, perovskite, aluminous spinel, hibonite, calcic pyroxene, and forsterite-rich olivine, in the first condensates in the protoplanetary disk- calcium aluminum rich inclusions (CAIs), are distributed along a slope 1 line in a 3-isotope plot (in 18O/16O vs. 17O/16O space) with a significant enrichment in 16O (~ 50 ‰ with respect to the terrestrial composition, with equal changes of 17O and 18O) [3-5]. The O-isotopic distribution is striking because of the departure from the normal terrestrial mass dependent fractionation line observed for equilibrium and kinetic fractionation processes [6, 7]. The grains collected by the Stardust mission from comet Wild-2 also depicts the same O-isotopic relationship [8].  For the solar nebula, the measured distribution of O-isotopic compositions is mainly explained using different reservoirs with distinct compositions within the nebula. Photochemistry (i.e., CO photodissociation) was also invoked to create an isotopically distinct water reservoir [9]. However, so far the explanations are not satisfactory due to several complicating unknowns [10]. It has been recently shown that through gas phase oxidation reaction (SiO + OH) simple silicate (SiO2) could be formed with O-isotopic compositions similar to the slope values as that of the meteorites [11]. These type of reactions are possible under nebular conditions and will generate isotopically distinct reservoirs within the nebula during normal chemical reactions.  The chemistry of transformation of simple oxide dust (SiO) to a complex silicate mineral is mechanistically poorly understood. The chemistry of the growth of silicate dust and the O-isotopic composition of meteorite silicate might be connected to this unknown chemistry. To address this issue, we have designed an experiment to study the silicate formation on dust analogues and describe the new discovery in this abstract.  Experimental:  Oxidation reactions on grain surface analogs were performed by vaporizing SiO nuggets by heating a tungsten boat filament at ~1600 oC inside a home-made LN2 cryostat kept at high vacuum (~10-6 torr). A collector plate was placed at a distance of 3 cm at the top of the filament as shown in Fig 1. During vaporization of SiO, the collector plate was kept at LN2 temperature and, several monolayers were deposited on the bottom surface of the collector plate. A separate arrangement was made to boil H2O at 90oC and the vapor was sprayed directly over the SiO layers via a spray nozzle (Fig 1) and subsequently LN2 flow was seized and allowed the system to attain room temperature (~ 30 min). The reactants were kept undisturbed for various times from 1.5 to 26 hours. After that the cryostat was opened and the products were collected from the collector plate (Fig 2) as well as from different sections of the reaction chamber. The Oisotopic compositions of the product silicate were determined through CO2-laser fluorination treatment.              Fig 1. Schematic of experimental apparatus. Results: The products were examined under an optical microscope. The microscopic picture (Fig 3) show the degree of oxidation (by color). Some of the lightest colored ones were imaged with an environment-SEM. The elemental analysis shows a stoichiometric ratio as of SiO2. The measured O-isotopic compositions of the products are striking as shown in Fig 4. SiO2 produced on the collector plate are off the mass-fractionation line  2242.pdf

(slope = 0.52) passed through the initial H2O and SiO compositions, following a trend line of slope 1.2.                  Fig 2. Formation of silicate over collector plate.                              Fig 4. Oxygen three isotope plot showing the compositions of SiO2 formed on the collector plate following a trend line of slope 1.2. The SiO vapor deposit layer is depleted compared to the initial SiO Nugget by ~ 11‰ and lie over the mass-fractionation line as shown in the figure. Discussion: The preliminary results of the present experiments are very encouraging showing a special kind of oxidation pathway involving an existing surface. The images (Fig 2 and 3) show that the silicate forms and grows over the SiO layer. Apart from amorphous form, crystalline SiO2 was also documented to be forming. The most intriguing observation is the Oisotopic compositions. Direct oxidation of SiO layers with H2O does not produce mass-independent Oisotopic composition. As mentioned, SiO oxidation by OH in gas phase produced slope 1 trend line [11], the similar oxidation by OH on the surface might have the potential to proceed in anomalous way. Experiments show that metal oxide surfaces are reconstructed by hydroxylation, when water absorb on the surface [12, 13]. Metal oxides adsorb cations or anions from aqueous solutions by releasing protons or hydroxide ions, resulting in ion-exchange reactions and the mechanism of OH production depends on defects on the surface.  In the present experiment, the metal surface (SiO) was at LN2 temperature when water absorbed over the SiO layer, it immediately formed ice upon absorption. There is a possibility of dissociating water under adsorption when water was not an isolated molecule but belonged to an extended structure, ice. Dissociation of half of the physisorbed water layer on a non-defective metal oxide surface molecules at the interface was found in this means through an interface between 3D water and oxide layer and, through compression [14]. We postulate that the major oxidation pathway is via OH (i.e., SiO + OH → SiOH* → SiO2 + H) on the surface.  The time dependent progression of δ18O show an increase in about 2 ‰ in 26 hours, whereas no significant increase in ∆17O, indicate that the OH reaction goes relatively fast, as it forms The OH oxidation scheme on grain surface is an attractive mechanism of oxide dust growth. The same might be operational in solar nebula at the boundary of the snowline and silicates with meteorite like oxygen isotopes might have formed on the existing dust grains. Further experiments and analysis are in process and will be discussed in the conference.   Authors acknowledge grant support from NASA cosmochemistry program.  References: [1] T. P. M. Goumans and S.
