Introduction: Titan (and other hydrocarbon worlds [1]) posseses many of the basic elements of habitability, including a rich organic chemistry. However, the thick atmosphere of Titan shields the surface from radiation, which makes the incorporation of oxygen into organic compounds at the surface difficult, due to a reducing environment and low temperatures that slow chemical reactions. These obstacles may be overcome by impacts [2,3] or cryovolcanic heating of ice, which would mix organics with liquid water and allow chemical reactions that can incorporate oxygen [4,5].  Recently, we have identified carbamation, the reaction of carbon dioxide with primary amines to form carbamic acids [6] (Fig. 1), as a reaction that could occur thermally on Titan's surface.   While the surfaces of the moons of the outer Solar System are usually considered too cold (30-100 K) for significant chemistry to occur without the input of energy, this reaction occurs readily at Titan surface temperatures (94 K). Amines should be present on Titan's surface, formed by photochemical reactions of N2 and CH4 in the upper atmosphere [7]. Amine-containing molecules have been detected as a component of laboratory tholins made in terrestrial laboratories [8,9]. There is some spectral evidence CO2 is present on the surface, and CO2 has been definitively identified in the atmosphere [10]. Experimental: We use a combination of microRaman spectroscopy and UHV FTIR spectroscopy to examine the reaction products and kinetics of the carbamation reaction for a variety of primary and secondary amines.  Infrared spectra were obtained by vapor depositing CH3NH2:CO2 mixtures onto a cooled KBr window under ultrahigh vacuum.  Spectra were then obtained as a function of temperature using a Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer. Raman spectra were acquired using a confocal dispersive micro-Raman spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon LabRam HR), with excitation at 532 nm.  Samples were prepared by depositing CH3NH2 and CO2 from the gas phase onto a cooled microscope slide held in a nitrogen-purged cryostage (Linkam LTS 350). Results and Discussion: Figure 2 shows spectra of methylcarbamic acid formation from CO2 and methylamine under Titan surface conditions. We have observed carbamic acid formation in mixtures of methylamine and ethylamine with CO2 at cryogenic temperatures. This suggests that the carbamation reaction at low temperatures is general for primary amines. Reaction was observed with methylamine as low as 40 K, and with ethylamine at 100 K, demonstrating that carbamation is fast at Titan surface temperatures.  In future work, we will present further data on the kinetics of the carbamation reaction for a variety of amines, as well as  estimates of the quantity of carbamic acids that may be produced on Titan's surface and in the atmosphere.   Conclusions:  1) The carbamation reaction between CH3NH2 and CO2 proceeds rapidly under Titan surface conditions.  Both methylcarbamic acid and methylammoFigure 2. Raman spectra demonstrating the reaction of CH3NH2 with CO2 under Titan surface conditions. Blue: Pure CH3NH2 at 94 K and 1 bar N2. Red: Spectrum of a sample prepared by depositing pure CH3NH2 from the gas phase at 94 K, followed by deposition of CO2 on top of the CH3NH2.  Reaction was immediate.  Note the changes, relative to CH3NH2, in the N-H stretch region, 3200-3400 cm-1. Also note the appearance of the amide bands at 581 and 1151 cm-1, a clear indication of the formation of methylcarbamic acid (CH3NHCOOH).  Figure 1. The carbamation reaction.  An amine can react with carbon dioxide to form a carbamic acid (top).  In the presence of excess amine, an ammonium carbamate salt is formed.  R NH2 + C OO RN OOH HR NO OH RNH3 +R NH2 + C OO2  nium methylcarbamate can be formed depending on the ratio of the reactants. 2) We have also shown that the reaction occurs with ethylamine (CH3CH2NH2), and is likely general for primary amines. 3) Sufficient amine is likely present on Titan's surface to react with all CO2 precipitated from the atmosphere. From [11], the CO2 precipitation rate is 9 g cm-2 Byr-1, while the tholin precipitation rate is 1800 g cm-2 Byr-1.  If only a small weight percent of the tholin contains primary amine functionality, there is sufficient amine to fully react with available CO2. 4) Under Titan surface conditions (94 K, ~1 bar N2), CO2 reacts with CH3NH2 within seconds.  This suggests that any CO2 observed on Titan's surface is likely fresh, and represents recent outgassing from the interior.  References: [1] Lunine, J. I. (2009) P Am Philos Soc 153, 403-418.
