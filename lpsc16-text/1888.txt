MOLYBDNUM ISOTOPE ANOMALIES IN NON-CARBONACEOUS METEORITES.  Y. Nagai1 and T. Yokoyama2, 1Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan (corresponding author: yuichiro.nagai@geo.titech.ac.jp).   Introduction:  Presolar materials whose isotopic compositions reflect their diverse nucleosynthetic origins have experienced dynamical processes in the early solar nebula. While these processes homogenized stable isotope compositions (e.g., Te, Os) in the Solar System [1-2], planetary scale nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies are observed for some elements (e.g., Sr, Mo, Ru, Ba) especially in carbonaceous chondrites [36]. Recently, Warren [7] proposed a new classification of meteorites based on the extent of isotope anomalies for multiple elements. For instance, carbonaceous chondrites can be discriminated from the other meteorites using the ε50Ti–ε54Cr and Δ17O–ε54Cr diagrams. These characteristics regarding isotope anomalies observed in bulk meteorites would reflect complicated physicochemical histories in the early Solar System that affected differently on the source materials of parent bodies for individual meteorites, depending most likely on the heliocentric distance [7].  Molybdenum has seven stable isotopes which have been synthesized via different stellar nucleosynthesis of the s-process, the r-process and the p-process. Previous studies discovered Mo isotope anomalies in bulk aliquot of meteorites and concluded that the anomalies were originated from the heterogeneous distribution of s-process-enriched carries in the early Solar System [4]. Although previous studies predominantly focused on carbonaceous chondrites and iron meteorites, data for the other non-carbonaceous meteorites (ordinary, enstatite, and rumuruti chondrites, achondrites, and stony-irons) are limited because the degree of Mo isotope anomalies for these meteorites are only marginal and nearly equal to the analytical uncertainties of standard materials. In this study, we determine Mo isotope anomalies in non-carbonaceous meteorites with N-TMIS to better understand the origin of source materials for non-carbonaceous meteorites which represent the materials that existed in the inner part of the early Solar System. Experiments:  Molybdenum isotopic composition of single-element standard solution for atomic absorption spectrophotometry (Kanto Kagaku) was prepared as a terrestrial reference material. Meterorites examined in this study include ordinary chondrites (Ochondrite: Adrian (H4), Forest City (H5), Tuxtuac (LL5), Olivenza (LL5), Saint-Séverin (LL6)) and rumuruti chondrites (R-chondrite: NWA 753 (R3.9), NWA 4814 (R4)), which cover different grade of metamorphism. We also analyzed three types of magmatic iron meteorites (Tambo Quemado (IIIAB), Henbury (IIIAB), Alibion (IVA) and Chinga (ungrouped)) and a non-magmatic iron meteorite (Mont Dieu (IIE)). The chondritic samples (~2 g) were dissolved in Teflon beakers using 30 M HF–16 M HNO3 (2:1), followed by dissolution with 12 M HCl–16 M HNO3 (1:2). The sample was subsequently treated with 16 M HNO3–35 wt% H2O2 to decompose remaining organic matters. Iron meteorites (~2g) excluding IIE were leached in 6 M HCl and digested with 16 M HNO3–12 M HCl. IIE iron meteorite was dissolved in 16 M HNO3–12 M HCl, and then with 16 M HNO3–30 M HF. After recovering solutions including Mo, the samples were dissolved in 0.4M HCl–0.5M HF to separate Mo by employing the anion exchange resin (Eichrom AG1-X8) through HCl–HF and HF–HNO3 media [8]. Molybdenum isotope analysis was performed using N-TIMS, TRITON plus at Tokyo Tech. Molybdenum isotopes ratios were acquired by monitoring MoO3- with in-situ O isotope correction. The reproducibilities of repeated analyses of the standard material (n = 21) were 45, 13, 9.7, 13, and 32 ppm for µ92Mo, µ94Mo, µ95Mo, µ97Mo, and µ100Mo, respectively. Results and Discussion:  All the meteorites measured exhibited the s-deficit isotopic patterns defined as the “W-shape patterns” without the “94Mo kink” [9]. The magnitude of Mo isotope anomalies for most of the samples decreased in the order of µ92Mo > µ94Mo > µ100Mo > µ95Mo > µ97Mo, except for Chinga (µ95Mo > µ100Mo). Our precise Mo isotopic data indicate the existence of two types of the Mo isotope anomalies as observed in the diagram of µ94Mo vs µ95Mo (Fig. 1). The Mo isotope data for O- and R-chondrites, as well as iron meteorites IIE, IIIAB, and IVA are plotted on the mixing lines (pink) between the terrestrial component and the s-process endmember defined by individual nucleosynthetic models [10-13]. By contrast, the data for Chinga and reported values for IVB irons plus carbonaceous chondrites are plotted on the mixing line between the terrestrial component and the data for the s-process-enriched samples (acid leachates of Murchison [14] and presolar SiC grains [15]).  The distinctive trends for non-carbonaceous meteorites shown in Fig. 1 imply that multiple nucleosynthetic components other than presolar SiC have contributed to non-carbonaceous meteorites, and that the assemblage of presolar materials in the source materials for carbonaceous chondrites and non-carbonaceous meteorites are different from each other.

likely caused by the spatial difference of individual reservoirs, rather than the difference of their formation ages. One possible scenario is that thermal processing acted differently on the early Solar System material dependent on the distance from the young sun and the oxidized conditions in the each reservoir. The thermal processing in the C-chondrite reservoir was likely to be relatively mild as suggested by the large water content in carbonaceous chondrites [16]. By contrast, the source materials for non-carbonaceous meteorites were thermally processed in a location more close to the sun compared to carbonaceous chondrites, resulting in selective destruction of presolar grains including SiC [15]. Alternatively, injection of a nearby supernova and subsequent size sorting of grains containing nuclides synthesized by the r-process and p-process [17] would produce the distinctive trends in Fig. 1.  0 100 200 3000100200-50μ⁹⁴Moμ⁹⁵MoOC RCCC OC ECThis StudyB11/B14(a) 0 100 200 3000100200-50μ⁹⁴Moμ⁹⁵MoChinga other ironIVBThis StudyB11/B14 other iron CC(b) Figure 1. µ94Mo vs µ95Mo diagram for (a) chondrites, and (b) iron meteorites. Weak-colored square and diamond were determined in previous studies [4,18]. The mixing lines were calculated from the s-process models [10-13] and meteoric samples as SiC [14] or leachates [15] (gray lines).  The exception for the scenario above is Chinga and IVB irons which plot close to carbonaceous chondrites in Fig. 1. However, the difference of formation location between IVB and the other non-carbonaceous meteorites is evident in the µ64Ni vs µ95Mo plot (Fig. 2). Most of iron meteorites are plotted close to the data points of non-carbonaceous chondrites such as OC and EC, while IVB iron meteorites have isotopic compositions similar to carbonaceous chondrites. Although no Ni isotopic data of ungrouped iron meteorite Chinga are available to date, it would be plotted close to IVB iron meteorites because of the similarity between IVB and Chinga. To support this, the study of highly precise W isotope analysis [19] proposed that the IVB parent body must have formed in an oxidized condition with supercondritic Hf/W, which corresponds to the formation location of carbonaceous chondrites.
