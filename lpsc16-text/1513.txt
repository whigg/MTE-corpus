Introduction:  Gale Crater, Mars was chosen as the landing site for the Curiosity rover because of its inferred well exposed and accessible sedimentary rock record, spanning the drying period of the planet’s surface [1,2]. Gale Crater also has large amounts of loose sediments in the form of dark mafic sands accumulating on the crater floor. The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover is currently driving through the Murray formation at the base of Mt. Sharp [3]. The Murray formation is exposed in cross-section for several kilometers, and at the center of this broad expanse of bedrock lays the informally named Bagnold dune field (Figure 1a). The dunes consist of individual barchans migrating to the southwest near the upwind edge of the field, merging into barchanoidal ridges further downwind, which then transition into longitudinal dunes paralleling the margins of Mount Sharp. Sand composition is inferred to be olivine-rich [4], and spectral variability in the visible-near infrared wavelength range is observed from CRISM images (Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars) further to the northeast in the dune field [5]. These observations likely reflect spatial variability in composition, and may result from several mechanisms, such as a variable dust cover, different source regions, and/or wind sorting of mineral phases by grain size and density [6,7].       Wind sorting is an active geomorphic process on Mars [8-10] and perhaps more significant than on Earth due to the lack of fluvial and other competing agents that can remove grains from aeolian systems. Nevertheless, quantitative estimates of variability in modal mineral composition and grain sizes in Martian dune fields, , and by inference that which gets incoporated into sandstones that make up a major portion of the Martian rock record  [11,12],  largely remain to be performed.        Here, we investigate observed spectral variability near Curiosity’s traverse, and invert for sand bulk composition and grain sizes at two different locations along the rover traverse. We also compare these results to HiRISE-derived ripple displacement and sand flux measurements. Our findings will be directly compared to groundtruth, provided by Curiosity’s compositional datasets.       Methods:  Spatial correlation between spectral attributes and sand flux. We consider a set of barchan dunes and sand fills that are being investigated in-situ by Curiosity (Figure 1a). Ripple displacements have been measured from a time correlation of a HiRISE stereopair (ESP_018854_1755, acquired 08/04/2010, and ESP_035772_1755, acquired 03/14/2014) following the technique of Bridges et al. [13], over a total timespan of 1318 Earth days (Figure 1b). Because this technique relies on the movement of ripples only, we do not capture the full sand flux, but rather a proxy for the reptation flux, i.e., the portion of the grains that move via the splashing of other saltating grains [14]. We derive two spectral parameter maps: (1) a red/infrared band ratio from HiRISE images ESP_021610_1755 and ESP_035772_1755 generated using the methods from [15], and (2) the olivine index OLINDEX3 [16] from the CRISM image C0EF. The HiRISE red/infrared band ratio can be used as a proxy for dust cover [15]. Ferrous (Fe2+) minerals typically have higher red/infrared ratios than ferric (Fe3+) phases. Consequently, the red/infrared ratio of olivine and pyroxene are relatively high compared with ferric dust (Figure 1d). The olivine index OLINDEX3 is used as a proxy for olivine content (Figure 1c), although the depth of the 1-micron olivine absorption can also be reduced by the presence of dust.

Dashed white circles show locations of North and South dunes considered in Sections 3 and 4. Distance between the two dunes is approximately 600 meters.        Quantitative inversion of modal mineralogy. We converted CRISM I/F spectra from the DISORT-corrected oversampled image ATO0002EC79 [e.g., 17] to single scattering albedo. Single scattering albedo was retrieved from I/F using the surface scattering photometric function of Hapke [18]. We averaged atmospherically-corrected single scattering albedo spectra over two regions of interest: 74 along track oversampled (ATO) CRISM pixels on High Dune, and 127 CRISM ATO pixels on the Kalahari Dune (Figure 1b-d), and inverted for mineral composition and grain sizes through a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo implementation [19] of the Hapke reflectance model [20] using the mineral endmembers 1513.pdf

shown in Figure 2a. This technique allows mapping of probable mineral assemblages as opposed a single “best fit” model by providing quantitative estimates of uncertainty arising from noise and non-uniqueness of the inverse problem. Because the HiRISE red/infrared band ratio data show that the dunes have little dust cover, we modeled the sand only, rather than using a two-layer model with a dust endmember.       Results:  Figures 2b and 2e show the best fit modeled spectra for both dunes, as well as a random subset of 500 accepted models to illustrate the variability we allowed for through a covariance parameter. The 66% confidence intervals have widths of 10-25 wt% in abundance, and 150-1000 microns in grain size, further emphasizing that the inverse problem is highly non-unique. Residuals associated to the best fit models are less than 2.5% (Figure 2c and e). Inverted compositions are similar to that of the Rocknest sand shadow [21], even though the XRD instrument only analyzed the portion of the sand that was finer than 150 μm. Moreover, best fit inverted compositions for both dunes are similar (Table 1). Olivine is inferred to be more abundant at High Dune than at Kalahari Dune, in agreement with our qualitative assessment from OLINDEX3 (Figure 1d). Plagioclase and magnetite abundances also seem to vary from High to Kalahari Dunes (Table 1). Nevertheless, these two mineral phases tend to have rather featureless spectra in the wavelength range of interest, such that these differences likely result from tradeoffs between the rather bright plagioclase and dark magnetite in matching the overall albedo of the sands. Finally, a glassy component seems to be required at the Kalahari dune to model the data. Grain size probability densities tend to be rather uniform, i.e., the inversion is not very sensitive to grain size, with the exception of olivine, pigeonite, and the glassy phase (Table 2). Indeed, the presence of well-defined modes in the probability densities of olivine, pigeonite, and glass grain sizes suggest that coarse olivine is required at both dunes (≥1mm), while pigeonite and glassy phases need to be finer grained (<500μm).        In order to assess the statistical significance of subtle differences in modal mineralogy between the two dunes, we subjected the probability densities to a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The abundance and grain size probability densities are statistically different at a level of 1%. Consequently, if dust cover is minimal at the dunes, we predict that the suites of instruments onboard Curiosity should measure compositional differences between the two dunes, and provide the first insitu quantitative estimate of how much Martian winds sort mineral phases. Moreover, rover measurements of sand composition will provide ground truth testing of our predictions from orbital hyperspectral data for the first time.
