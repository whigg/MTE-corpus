UTCT: THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HIGH-RESOLUTION X-RAY COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY FACILITY. R.D. Hanna1, D.R. Edey1, J.A. Maisano1, and R.A. Ketcham1, 1Jackson School of Geological Sciences, University of Texas, Austin, TX, 78712 (romy@jsg.utexas.edu)  Introduction:  X-ray computed tomography (XCT) is a non-destructive 3D imaging technique that produces a data volume describing X-ray attenuation within a scanned object.  Because X-ray attenuation is a function of material density and composition [e.g., 1], XCT provides a powerful tool for the 3D investigation of phases and textures within a solid object.   XCT data can be used to generate a number of visualizations for scientific research including digital reslicings, 3D volumetric renderings, and surface models that can be printed using a 3D printer.  In addition, XCT data can provide a wealth of unique quantitative information to measure discrete objects and textural fabrics within the sample [e.g., 2-3].  As a non-destructive analysis tool, it is particularly applicable to the investigation of rare or valuable specimens such as meteorites and mission-returned samples and its use as a curation tool is being investigated at various museums and facilities that manage these types of collections [e.g., 4-5]. The High-Resolution X-ray Computed Tomography Facility at the University of Texas at Austin (UTCT) is a national shared multi-user facility supported by the Instrumentation and Facilities Program of NSF’s Earth Sciences (EAR) directorate (http://www.ctlab.geo.utexas.edu).  Formed in 1997, it was the first research high-resolution XCT facility in an academic science department in the world and provides researchers across many disciplines (earth, planetary, biological, and engineering sciences) access to and support for XCT.  In addition to XCT data acquisition and analysis services, UTCT provides the scientific community with training and education in XCT data manipulation and analysis.  UTCT also actively develops a number of specialized software tools for XCT data processing and quantitative analysis [e.g., 6-8] (http://www.ctlab.geo.utexas.edu/software/). Instruments:  UTCT has three XCT scanners that provide imaging capabilities for a wide range of sample sizes and types.  Two of the scanners are combined in one large lead-walled radiation safety enclosure which was upgraded in 2013 with a new gantry system and PerkinElmer XRD 1621 series 2048x2048 flat panel detector.  Two separate X-ray sources are used to provide two separate XCT system configurations.  The higher energy source is a 450 kV GE Titan with a dual filament selectable spot size (0.4 mm/700 W or 1.0 mm/1500 W) which allows penetration of denser, larger objects (up to 40 cm width, 75 cm height) at the expense of detail and compositional sensitivity.  The lower energy 225 kV FeinFocus FXE 225 microfocal source provides better compositional discrimination for smaller objects (down to ~ 1 cm) at spot sizes from 5 to 30 µm.  Both  Figure 1.

The relative positioning of the metal and sulfide reflects a gravitational field that is offset from the rise direction inferred from ellipsoidal bubbles, suggesting specimen rotation during post-impact solidification.

scanner configurations are capable of cone-beam and helical XCT data acquisition. The third instrument is a Zeiss (formerly Xradia) MicroXCT 400 scanner with a Hamamatsu source capable of energies from 40 to 150 kV.  It was also upgraded in 2013 with new detector components so its imaging capabilities now approach those of the newer Zeiss Versa systems.  Like most Zeiss XCT systems, it has a unique detector configuration (similar to a synchrotron XCT setup) where magnification is achieved through the use of visible light (microscope) objectives placed behind the scintillator.  This allows for much sharper high-resolution imagery, down to 0.2 µm/voxel for appropriately sized specimens.  This system is capable of imaging samples up to ~4 cm in size using its largest 0.4X macro objective. Planetary Applications: UTCT has imaged and analyzed a wide variety of planetary samples including meteorites, Apollo samples, and terrestrial impactites. Two recent studies utilizing XCT in the study of an impact-melt L-chondrite and the CM chondrite Murchison are highlighted in Figures 1 and 2.    Summary: Three XCT systems provide scanning capabilities for a vast range of sample sizes and compositions, allowing the facility to deliver exceptional data to its user base. In addition to its scanning capabilities UTCT has a large collective knowledge on the best practices for scanning, which they use both in-house and in their outreach capacities. By supporting a large knowledge base of software packages, developing specialized and customized software for quantitative analysis, and providing scanning services, UTCT is able to provide the community with unparalleled planetary material analysis.

The long axes of the chondrules lie on a great circle and the short axes are clustered, consistent with a foliation fabric.  The weak clustering of the long axes indicate that the chondrules are also weakly lineated, suggesting that impact was cause of the deformation. (Modified from [2]). 3000.pdf
