One of the most important and debated variables pertaining to ancient hydrological activity on Mars is the timescale over which it operated. In this study we constrain the timescale over which fluvial processes operated to input sediment into Milna Crater (23.4 S, 12.3 W; Fig. 1). To do so we (i) calculate the timescale of sediment deposition by considering fluvial sediment input into the entire crater while accounting for nonfluvial input.  Fig 1.

Methods:  We use CTX, HiRISE, MOLA, and THEMIS data coregistered in ArcMap 10 for all measurements. Methods are more thoroughly described in [6]. To estimate the timescale for which there was active fluvial sedimentary deposition in Milna, we calculate the time to fill the crater with its current volume of sediment.  To calculate the volume of sediment in Milna we take the difference between the current volume and the theoretical volume calculated from the equations in [7]. We assume a porosity of 0.31 [8]. We calculate the percentage of nonfluvial fill by calculating the fill of an adjacent, similarly sized crater. To calculate the influx of sediment we calculate the volume of sediment in bedload [9] and include a component in suspended load of 1.25 times the bedload component based on terrestrial measurements [10,11,12] and assume the system is not sediment limited. We place constraints on the channel dimensions through which sediment was delivered to Milna by comparing to the dimensions of inner channels found in valleys in the region surrounding Milna. We consider a range of sediment sizes and model flow assuming various channel beds (gravel, sand, and bedrock). Fig 2. A. There is a large fan with several lobes that are incised by sinuous valleys in the southeast corner of Milna just below the inlet valley. B. Annotation of top panel. Solid lines denote scarps, dotted lines denote valleys. Note the fan that superposes a valley, the incision of previously deposited fans in several locations, and that the valleys are sinuous and branched. Note also the stacked scarps visible at this (CTX) resolution in Fan Complex D, and Fans C & E.  There are also stacked scarps in the dissected area west of Fan B not associated with a discrete lobe. CTX image.  Results:  Milna (Fig. 2) has a volume of 50 km3, preserves many fans and sinuous valleys, and has an inlet and outlet valley, indicating that it was once filled 2587.pdf

with fluid. We then quantitatively estimate the timescale to deposit sediment into Milna under the assumption of continuous deposition. We bracket the deposition timescale between 15-4700 terrestrial years, using the broadest possible range of model assumptions. However, using more reasonable model assumptions [see 6] we find that the range is likely to be 75-365 terrestrial years. We then place the fluvial activity in Milna into regional and global context in order to estimate the percentage of the time fluid flows capable of significantly transporting sediment were operating (i.e. the intermittency, see [13]). Milna drains directly into the Paraná Valles system, which has been calculated to have been active for 105-106 years during the late Noachian [14,15,16,17]. By spreading the total flux duration into Milna (i.e. ~102 yr) over the total length of activity in Paraná Valles, we obtain an intermittency of fluvial activity of ~0.01-0.1%. In a similar way, we compare the erosion rate of the drainage area sourcing Milna (Fig. 1) to average Noachian erosion rates. The average thickness of the sedimentary erosion over the entire drainage area needed to produce the fill observed in Milna is 2.2 m. Since average Noachian erosion rates were on the order of 10-5-10-6 m/yr [18], this again yields a ~0.01-0.1% fluvial intermittency factor. Discussion: We compare our calculations of the hydrological activity in Milna to the predictions of two climate scenarios: (i) a climate capable of periodic flooding events sustained over ~105-106 years [e.g. 16,19] and (ii) punctuated flooding events triggered by giant impacts [e.g. 20]. Matsubara et al. [19] developed a global hydrologic routing model to constrain the ratio of precipitation to evaporation using what they call an "X-ratio," where X is the ratio between net evaporation off a lake and runoff depth in its contributing drainage basin. The "Xratio" depends on the frequency, duration, and depth of precipitation delivered by storms, evaporative loss during runoff, and the ratio of the drainage area to the surface area of the lake. Matsubara et al. [19] find a range in the ratio of precipitation to evaporation under which lakes are sustained over long time periods, similar to the extent of lakes in the Great Basin region in the western United States during the Last Glacial Maximum. We apply this range of the "X-ratio" to the Milna system, under the assumption of one day-long storm per martian year delivering 0.5-5 cm of rainfall (the fluid flux required to create the sediment flux required by our preferred model [6]). Under this scenario we calculate evaporation rates of 0.16-17 m per terrestrial year, which is similar to typical terrestrial evaporation rates over a wide range of climates (~meters per year [21,22]). This implies that a sustained climate capable of periodic flooding events is compatible with the observations we make at Milna. Impacts are thought to create transitory climates under which liquid water could be mobilized. Using models from [20], assuming a ~100 km radius bolide under a 1 bar CO2 atmosphere, ~10 m of water per unit area would be mobilized in the Milna drainage area, or a total of ~3 × 1011 m3 of water. This is an order of magnitude less than the absolute minimum volume of water we calculate is required to transport the sediment observed in Milna (~4 × 1012 m3, [6]). Thus, 10 bolides of this size would be required, which is unlikely since most of the giant impact basins were formed prior to formation of Paraná Valles [17,23]. Similar difficulties exist when considering smaller bolides [6]. Thus, flux generated by giant impacts alone is unlikely to be responsible for the morphology seen at Milna. Conclusions: We find that the total integrated fluvial activity in Milna took place over ~102 yr. Considering both the timescales of fluvial activity in the adjacent Paraná Valles and estimates for global Noachian erosion rates, we calculate an intermittency factor for fluvial activity of ~0.01-0.1% during 105-106 yr near the Noachian-Hesperian boundary in the Paraná Valles region. These values are comparable to arid climates on Earth where the majority of fluvial sedimentary transport takes place during floods with multi-year to decadal recurrence intervals. Our calculations of intermittency help to quantitatively reconcile the divergent estimates of the short and long timescales of fluvial activity on Mars reported in the literature.
