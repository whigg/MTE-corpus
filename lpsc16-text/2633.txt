Many authors [e.g., 2-4] suggest this provides evidence supporting a long-lived, clement, precipitation-supporting late Noachian climate. Others [e.g., 5,6] suggest that Noachian Mars was cold and dry, valley networks being carved by transient flows of meltwater from large, regionally restricted ice-bodies. Previous studies have noted that Arabia Terra, lying between the southern highlands and the northern lowlands, is ancient, yet has few valley networks. This observation supports a 'dry and icy' scenario, as atmosphere modelling [6] suggests that Arabia should show significant differences between 'warm and wet' (high precipitation) and 'dry and icy' (low precipitation) Noachian climates. Here we describe an ~100 km long, 1-2 km wide, branching, flat-topped ridge system (Fig.1), recentlynamed Aram Dorsum, in the western Arabia Terra region of Mars. We have mapped the system (Fig.2) using CTX (6m/pixel; [7]) images, DEMs and other data. We interpret the ridge system to be fluvial in origin, preserved in positive relief due to infill and differential erosion; this working hypothesis is used as a conceptual framework for the study. Importantly, Aram Dorsum is but one of several recently-recognized, similar-scale features found in Arabia Terra [8,9], showing that Arabia Terra is not as poorly dissected as previously thought. As Aram Dorsum has been well-studied as a 2018 ExoMars Rover landing site, it forms a typeexample for the inverted channel systems in the region. Observations: The Aram Dorsum main channel system is sinuous to meandering and contains multiple channels. These are laterally and also vertically separated, as shown by cross-cutting relationships and traces of older, now buried, channels alongside and underneath the main channel system. In the west of the study area (Fig.2), the channel system is a well-defined, sinuous, single thread channel. In the east, the pattern is more consistent with an anastomosing, or multi-thread channel, sometimes separated by lozenge-shaped 'islands'. Importantly, the channel system is set within extensive, low relief, lateral deposits and multiple contributory branches feed into it (Fig.2).  Aram Dorsum has been exposed from beneath both regional and local overburden materials, which unconformably superpose it. The whole system was buried after (perhaps significantly after) formation then, much later, exhumed. In our mapping, the URO and LRO units correlate with the etched terrains units NMe1 and NMe2 mapped by [10], showing that Aram Dorsum is at least middle to late-Noachian in age. This is supported by crater counts of the local, undivided overburden material (LO, Fig.2). LO has a crater retention age of 3.6+/-0.1 Ga and superposes Aram Dorsum.  Fig.1. Aram Dorsum ridge system.

The main channel system (ADM) is set within smooth, low-relief, channel-marginal units (CMM and DCM) that are overlain by local and regional overburden materials. CMM is also present around the four (or more) smaller, tributary inverted channel systems feed into the main trunk. Throughout the area, small erosional windows form flat-bottomed pits (FBP). Most FBP contain surfaces similar to CMM and DCM; it is likely that FBP are inliers of CMM or DCM. This interpretation is supported by HiRISE observations, which show that both the CMM and FBP contain small (10-20m) polygonal fracture patterns. A HiRISE survey shows that these textures correlate almost exactly with units mapped from CTX as CMM, DCM or FBP.  Interpretation: Aram Dorsum is morphologically similar to inverted channel systems on Earth [e.g., 11].

this was a relatively long-lived, aggradational fluvial system, rather than an erosional outflow or bedrockcarved fluvial channel. Interestingly, the system shows little evidence for unconfined lateral channel migration, so there must have been significant bank stability.  Aram Dorsum was probably once a sizable river and, as just one example of many [8,9] similar systems, is an exemplar for the middle part of a regional sediment transport system that could have extended from the southern highlands to the northern lowlands. Like Aram Dorsum, many of these other recently-recognized fluvial systems have an origin more consistent with precipitation-driven surface runoff than transient meltwater flows [8,9]. Their presence suggests that fluvial dissection in the Noachian was probably a more globally consistent process than previously thought.  ExoMars: In 2018, the European Space agency will launch the Exo-Mars Rover to search for evidence of past life on Mars. Although Oxia Planum was chosen as prime 2018 site, Aram Dorsum is still in consideration for a 2020 backup launch. A principal science objective for the Rover [12] is to search for signs of past and present life on Mars, by drilling into the subsurface. The Aram Dorsum region, being a relatively flat and hazard-free region containing buried and then exhumed, mid-Noachian fluvial/floodplains sediments provides an excellent opportunity for biosignature concentration and preservation [13] and so for ExoMars to meet its science goals.
