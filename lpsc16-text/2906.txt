SUBSURFACE FRACTURES, TIDAL STRESS AND OPENING OF CONDUITS AT THE DAMASCUS TIGER STRIPE ON ENCELADUS  K. L. Craft,1 D. A. Patthoff2, A. R. Rhoden3 and E. S.

Four sets of ridges at Enceladus's south polar region, informally named tiger stripes, exhibit morphologies such that two ridges flank a central trough, with typical dimensions of about 130 km in length, 2 km in width and a trough depth of about 500 m [1]. The troughs are believed to extend from fractures that reach into Enceladus's interior and subsurface liquid layer. The Cassini spacecraft's flybys of Enceladus observed jets of ice and dust emanating from these fractures [1,2]. Researchers have theorized that stresses acting on the moon as it orbits Saturn open and close the fractures enabling interior volatiles to release and form the plumes observed [e.g. 3,4]. Here we present results of an initial finite element modeling investigation on tidal forcing interaction with subsurface fractures as a mechanism for opening and closing conduits at the Tiger Stripes on Enceladus.  Methods: Our analyses focused on a point on the Damascus Tiger Stripe at 80°S and 54° E, shown in Figure 1 below.      Figure 1. Damascus tiger stripe with circle denoting the section of the fracture location analyzed in this study at 80°S and 54°.E  This location has been observed on numerous flybys to host an active jet [5]. Tidal stresses acting on the fracture surface location were calculated using the program, SatStressGUI, for different orbital positions. SatStress and SatStressGUI have been used previously for multiple tidal stress determinations [6-8]. Viscoelastic SatStressGUI models were performed here, initially for a thin ice shell case of 10 km, with the uppermost 2 km of a higher viscosity and the lower 8 km with a lower viscosity.   Tidal stress results indicate the maximum tensional principal stress, σ1 ≈ 80 kPa, occurs at about 180° (apoapsis) in the orbit and the max compressional stress of σ3 ≈ -80 kPa occurs at about periapsis. These stresses act perpendicular to the fracture trend at these orbital positions. Figure 2 below depicts the principal stresses in the south polar region for the thin shell scenario.   Figure 2. Principal stress in the south polar region due to tidal forces at apoapsis. Stresses shown occur at the surface for a thin ice shell (10 km thick) approximation. Ticks show the orientations of the principal stresses. Background contour plot shows the maximum tension value.   To investigate how these stresses act to open and close a tiger stripe fracture, we employ a finite element code, FRANC2d (FRacture ANalysis Code) [9]. FRANC2d calculates displacements/deformation due to imposed loads, specified boundary conditions, and material properties for a 2D body of certain geometry as shown previously in investigations of fracturing on Europa [10]. We begin with a model space 20 km across and 10 km deep (thin shell case), representing an ice shell of density, ρ = 900 kg/m3, Poisson's ratio, ν = 0.3 and Young's modulus, E= 5e9 Pa. A layer of icy regolith is represented in the uppermost 100m by a material with ρ = 300 kg/m3, Poisson's ratio, ν = 0.15 and Young's modulus, E= 1e7 Pa based on terrestrial sand values (with a lowered density). Boundary conditions such that the bottom edge is constrained in the vertical, y, direction and right and left edges are held stationary in the horizontal, x, direction.

emplace a gap element fracture from the base of the ice shell up to the neutral buoyancy point of 9 km (assumes pure water ice shell and ocean water) and pressurize the fracture hydrostatically. Gap elements prevent fracture sides from overlapping during loading. The fracture is then propagated up to the base of the regolith layer and a small internal pressure of 3 Pa is applied to represent a small about of force from flowing volatile release [Fortes, 2007]. A gravitational force of 0.11 m/s2 acts on the shell and tidal stresses are applied at elements containing the fracture. Further analyses will also investigate a thick ice shell case of 30 km. Results and Discussion: Tidal forcing results indicate a fracture at the location 80°S and 54°E on the Damascus tiger stripe will open about 16 cm at 940 m depth to 3 cm just below the regolith layer when undergoing maximum, ~ 80 kPa, perpendicular tensional tidal stress. For the maximum compressional stress of -80 kPa, the fracture still opens about 15 cm at 940 m depth to 2 cm below the regolith layer. Figure 4 shows a deformed mesh 10x exaggerated view of the model under 80 kPa of tensional stress.   Results show that the fracture in the shallow surface remains open during compressional stressing, only closing about 1 cm from the tensional state. This appears due to the opening of the hydrostatic fracture beneath. Further work will investigate the sensitivity of fracture opening to ice shell thickness, proximal fracture interactions (multiple tiger stripes), proximities of basal fractures and internal crack pressures variations due to volatiles and phase changes. The fracture openings and timings of openings will be compared further to observations of vent releases and plume material quantities.
