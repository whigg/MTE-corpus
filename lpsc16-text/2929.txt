CHEMICAL AND ISOTOPIC FRACTIONATION DURING EVAPORATION OF SYNTHETIC AOA- and FOB-LIKE MATERIALS.  R. A. Mendybaev1,2 and F. M. Richter1,2, 1Department of the Geophysical Sciences, 2Chicago Center for Cosmochemistry, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL (ramendyb@uchicago,.edu).   Introduction:  Forsterite-bearing Type B (FoB) Ca-, Al-rich inclusions (CAIs) have igneous textures and consist of pyroxene, spinel, åkermanitic melilite, anorthite and abundant forsterite grains, which distinguish them from other types of CAIs (e.g., [1–4]). Chemically, they are enriched in magnesium and silicon compared to Type A and Type B CAIs. Some FoBs (e.g., Vigarano 1623-5, Allende CG-14 and TE) are characterized by very large mass-dependent isotopic fractionations in magnesium, silicon and oxygen isotopes (with 25Mg and 29Si up to ~18‰ and ~7‰ in CG-14 [1] or ~30‰ and ~10‰ in 1623-5 [3], indicating high degrees of melting of forsterite-rich precursors and evaporative loss of these moderately volatile elements. Most FoBs, however, show only small isotopic fractionations, and are characterized by continuous forsterite-free outer mantles surrounding forsteriterich cores. Based on textural, chemical (Fig. 1) and isotopic characteristics, Bullock et al. [4] argued that FoBs could have formed only by partial melting of forsterite-rich amoeboid olivine-rich aggregates (AOAs), which are believed to be aggregates of solar nebular condensates (e.g., [5, 6]).  Here we present the results of our experiments in which forsterite-rich compositions were evaporated in vacuum and in hydrogen-rich gas at various temperatures in order to test the proposition that AOAs are precursor of FoBs.  Results and Discussion:  Fig. 2 shows MgO and SiO2 contents of AOAs and FoBs along with compositions of residues produced by evaporation of AOA-like (FUN1, FUN2 and FUNC) and FoB-like (CAI4) melts in vacuum at 1900ºC. It shows that, after initial, faster evaporation of Si relative to Mg (FUNC) or Mg relative to Si (FUN1), evaporation trajectories of AOAlike melts converge to a single trend which evolves toward the Type A and Type B CAIs and away from typical FoBs. The same trend was also observed when extremely Mg-rich (60 wt% MgO and 30 wt% SiO2) or Si-rich (50 wt% SiO2 and 30 wt% MgO) melts were evaporated at the same conditions [7]. Another important feature of Fig. 2 is that chemical compositions of FUN and FUN-like CAIs (C1, CMS-1, CG-14, 1623-5) plot on or very close to the evaporation trajectories of synthetic AOA-like melts. Silicon, magnesium and oxygen isotopic compositions of the experimental evaporation residues with chemical compositions close to those of C1, CMS-1 and 1623 are within few permil of those measured in the inclusions [3, 710]. Fig. 2 shows that chemical compositions of residues produced by evaporation of FoB-like melt (CAI4) follow the same trend established by evaporation of significantly Mg- and Si-rich compositions. The CAI4 evaporation produces residues with chemical compositions very close to those of C1 and CMS-1 FUN CAIs, but with significantly less isotopic fractionation: e.g., 25Mg ~ 8‰ and 29Si ~ 7‰ in the evaporation residue compared to 25Mg ~30‰ and 29Si ~ 15‰ in C1 and CMS-1.

   Fig. 3. Backscattered electron images of evaporation residues: a) the starting material was evaporated in vacuum at 1600ºC for 2 hr followed by cooling to 1500ºCº at 60ºC/h; the furnace temperature was then dropped to 1000ºC at which the sample was annealed for ~10 hr and then reheated to 1300ºC and cooled to 900º at 30ºC/hr (total weight loss ~4%); b) the starting material was cooled in vacuum from 1500ºC to 900ºC at 30ºC/hr (total weight loss ~1%);c) the starting material was cooled in 1 atm hydrogen from 1500ºC to 1350ºC at 50ºC/hr, then to 1200ºC at 25ºC/hr and to 1100ºC at 10ºC/hr (total weight loss ~13%); d) sample with the same initial cooling history as sample shown in panel c (weight loss ~12.5%), but later the sample was annealed at 1300ºC in 1 atm hydrogen for ~215h (additional weight loss of ~11.5%). Scale bars in panels a and b are 1 mm, and in panels c and d are 2 mm.  Fig. 3 shows typical textures produced when an AOA-like starting material with a chemical composition close to that of 1623-5 FUN CAI was cooled at subliquidus temperatures in vacuum (panels a and b) and in 1 atm hydrogen (panels c and d). When heated and cooled in vacuum at subliquidus temperatures, very little weight loss was observed: ~4% for sample cooled from 1600ºC (Fig. 3a) and less than 1% for sample cooled from 1500ºC (Fig. 3b). Fig. 3a and 3b show that there are no textural differences between the inner and outer parts of these once partly partially molten droplets. The sample shown in panel a consists of melilite-rich (with forsterite + pyroxene + spinel) and melilite-poor parts (as 1623-5 FUN CAI). It has a somewhat more coarse-grained texture than the sample shown in panel b, which consists of forsterite, pyroxene and spinel. Lack of melilite in this sample is due to the difficulty of rystallizing melilite from melts heated significantly above the melting temperature of melilite, which destroy its nucleation sites [11-13]. Formation of melilite in the sample shown in panel a, which was heated to even higher temperatures, is due to annealing at 1000ºC, which recreates melilite nucleation sites and makes its crystallization possible.  When the same AOA-like starting material is melted at the same temperatures as in vacuum experiments but in 1 atm of hydrogen, significant weight loss caused by evaporation of silicon and magnesium is observed. Moreover, a forsterite-free outer mantle consisting of pyroxene and spinel, similar to that in natural FoBs [4] was observed in all experiments when partially molten droplets were exposed to hydrogen (Fig. 3c and 3d). Formation of forsterite-free mantles in hydrogen-rich gas is caused by faster evaporation of magnesium and silicon from the surface of the partially molten droplet compared to their diffusion rates in the droplet. Evaporation of magnesium and silicon from such droplets in a low-pressure, hydrogen-dominated, solar nebular gas would result in both chemical and isotopic fractionation. The thickness of forsterite-free mantle in experimental charges was observed to vary from ~10 µ to ~100 µm depending on temperature and cooling rates.  Conclusions:  The experimental data presented here suggest that AOAs are very plausible precursors of FOBs: 1) high-temperature evaporation of AOAlike compositions produces residues with chemical and isotopic compositions like those observed in FUN (and FUN-like) FoBs;  2) subliquidus evaporation of AOAlike compositions in 1 atm hydrogen produces residues with textures and chemical compositions very similar to those of typical FoBs. In a low-pressure, hydrogendominated, solar nebular gas, evaporation of magnesium, silicon and oxygen will also result in their isotopic fractionation.  References:  [1] Clayton R. N. et al.
