Introduction: Spectral analysis is a effective method to  study the geochemical composition of the moon. The latest lunar explorations have obtained multispectral data [1] and hyperspectral data [2, 3]which have a global coverage. However, almost all of the spectral analyses are based on mineral absorption features. Here we carried out a trial to do spectral analysis directly using spectral features of  lunar samples. Data: This article gets the sampling line coordinates by using the NASA planetary data system to provide the Apollo Moon landing point image data sampling route, with the correction of data interferometer of Chang'e-2 interference imaging [4] and India M3 data [2]. We carry out a data fusion of Chang'e-2 CCD data and India M3 MAP (Maximum A Posteriori) data. We select Apollo 15, Apollo 16 62231 standard of LSCC measured rock bidirectional reflectance spectrum and M3, Chang’e-2 to calibrate the cross[5-8]. Methods: We adopt the analysis methods of the Moon rock type spectrum characteristics. Spectral of 87 lithologic classes, 285 pieces of rock samples of the 36 stations covered by the Apollo Moon landing site are collected. We analysise the typical rock absorption reflection characteristics of each sample by using the corrected M3 data, and establish the typical rock standard spectral library (Figure 1). Bordered by Descartes crater, the studied area surrounding Apollo16 landing area are covered by melted anorthosite (55%) in the north, breccia in the south (with dissipating of pink spinel troctolite) and granitic basalts distributed zonally from north to south. Then results can be obtained by comparing Apollo 623 rock samples, then complete lithology profile around Apollo16 landing sites can be completed.  Results: Based on the spectral of the samples collected, we get the rock distribution in the Apollo 16 region through band matching of all the bands (Figure 2). The main rocks in this region  is anorthosite  with melt, oriented and glass-coated impact melt rock, glasscoated and high-shocked anorthosite, and vesicular glass with anorthosite clast, while other rocks are distributed sparsely. The distribution of the rock types indicates a complex impact history in this regon. The methods of this paper have implications in understanding the lunar rocks classification and the Moon of magma evolution and the following impact events.
