Introduction:  JAXA’s Hayabusa2 spacecraft flew by the Earth at an altitude of about 3,090 km for a gravity assist maneuver on December 3, 2015. During the period before and after this Earth swing-by, we performed near-infrared spectroscopic observations of the Earth and Moon using NIRS3 instrument onboard the Hayabusa2 spacecraft for its calibration and scientific objectives. The NIRS3 is a point spectrometer having the spectral range of 1.8-3.2 µm (∆λ ~ 20 nm) and the FOV of 0.1º × 0.1º [1]. Its primary scientific objectives are identification and mapping of hydrated minerals on the C-type asteroid (162173) Ryugu. We presents the initial results from the NIRS3 observations of the Earth and Moon. Observing condition:  From October through December 2015, we performed NIRS3 observations of the Earth and Moon for 10 days and 2 days, respectively, in total. On October 15, the first light from the Earth was detected and NIRS3 boresight was roughly identified within the uncertainties of +/-0.04º. Although no observation was done at the date of the closest approach due to the constraints of spacecraft attitude, NIRS3 obtained disk-resolved spectra from the Earth and Moon before and after the swing-by. The observing parameters such as exposure time were set at the same values with those expected for the asteroid observations. Since the Hayabusa2 flew over the Earth from north to south, the northern and southern hemisphere regions were observed before and after the swing-by, respectively. The solar phase angle was changed between 40º and 70º. Finally on December 21, scan observations that targeted on the Earth with smaller grid intervals were performed in order to determine the NIRS3 boresight more precisely. Results:  NIRS3 obtained more than 2,500 and 200 reflectance spectra of the Earth and Moon, respectively. The representative spectra among them are shown in Fig. 1. These spectra were converted to reflectance unit by using the calibration coefficients derived from the on-ground tests and the thermal components have not been removed. From the reflectance spectrum of the Earth, we find two broad absorption features at 1.8-2.1 µm and 2.2-3.2 µm. These are due to atmospheric water molecules. Also two fine absorption features that may be related to carbon dioxide can be found at 2.0 µm and 2.07 µm. On the other hand, there is no clear absorption feature in the reflectance spectrum of the Moon. But a broad and weak absorption feature that resembles those found by Chandrayaan-1/Cassini/Deep Impact observations [2,3,4] can be seen at 2.7-3.2 µm.   Fig. 1. The representative reflectance spectra of the Earth (a) and Moon (b) obtained from NIRS3 at November 26, 2015.  Summary:  Through the Earth and Moon observations, we could get the data required for NIRS3 calibration and also comfirm its good health and observing performance. After this, we are planning to acquire the calibration data regularly once a month by using the internal calibration lamp. Then, we will start the asteroid observations from 2018 when the Hayabusa2 arrive at Ryugu.   References: [1] Iwata T. et al. (2015) Space Sci. Rev., submitted. [2] Pieters C. M. et al.
