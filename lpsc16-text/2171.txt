Introduction: Olivine is a ubiquitous mineral on planetary surfaces, is among the first formed mineral from a crystallizing magma. Olivineis also one of the first minerals to alter during secondary processes, making it key to studying the origin and evolution of planetary bodies. Olivine has been mapped from orbital spectroscopy on the surface of Mars with a range in compositions from Fo91 to Fo31, with Fo68 being the most common throughout the highlands and Nili Fossae region [1]. Observations from rovers and meteorites found on Earth, show that olivine is the first mineral to crystallize from Martian magmas [2-4] and has a similar range in chemistry in Martian rocks and the Martian crust [2-4]. Olivine is also found in sedimentary rocks at Gale Crater, making up a significant portion of sandstones analyzed by MSL Curiosity [5]. Olivine weathers out of rocks rather quickly and has been used to track alteration time scales for surficial Martian rocks [6]. Oxidation and alteration of olivine is known to occur in the Earth's mantle via metasomatism, during ascent by reaction and contamination with the basaltic magma, or after eruption by oxidation with the atmosphere or alteration by reaction with a fluid [7-11]. Further, olivine shocked at high-pressure is known to turn brown by oxidation of olivine and the formation of nano-phase iron oxides [12-14]. Here we present olivine oxidation experiments to investigate how oxidation affects mineralogy, mineral chemistry, and magnetic properties. Although current Mars missions do not yet have magnetometer or Raman instruments, the results from this work are directly applicable to the NASA Insight and ESA EXO Mars missions, which will both carry geophysical instruments; as well as to the NASA Mars 2020 rover, which will carry two Raman spectrometers on the SHERLOC and SuperCam instruments. Future XRD work on the experimental run products will be comparable with results from the MSL Curiosity ChemMin instrument. Methods: Gem-quality olivine crystals from both San Carlos, AZ and an unknown location within the North China craton were purchased. The single crystals were handpicked to exclude any olivine that had indications of pre-existing alteration. Each crystal was then measured using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) (see below) to ensure that there was no ferromagnetic signature, confirming that the olivine was not altered before the experiments. Following previous experimental work [15], olivine crystals were then placed in a box furnace at either 900 or 600 °C, in air. Samples were removed from the furnace after 12 hours to 26 days. Two samples were removed simultaneously for reproducibility.  Vibrating sample magnetometer: The magnetic hysteresis properties of each oxidized sample were measured using the Princeton Measurements Corporation Vibrating Sample Magnetometer 3900-04 at SIU. The unoxidized olivines exhibit no detectable ferromagnetic signal above 10-10 Am2 (the detection limit of the vibrating sample magnetometer). Raman Spectroscopy: Spectra were acquired from the oxidized samples on a Bruker Optics, Inc. BRAVO Raman spectrometer, which uses dual laser (758 and 852 nm) excitation and a patented fluorescence mitigation strategy involving successive heating of the laser. With a scan time of 10s and wavenumber range of 300-3350 cm-1, each sample was run five times and the spectra were averaged. The BRAVO produces baseline-subtracted data. Results: In response to the oxidation experiments, olivine crystals show a darkening and the formation of a dark black and red outer crust becomes evident. Figure 1 compares an unaltered olivine and an olivine oxidized for 26 days at 900 °C. Experiments conducted at the higher temperature showed even more evidence of oxidation compared with the lower temperature experiments. The longer the experiments were run, the darker the olivine became. Some olivines fractured 2171.pdf

 Figure 2. Raman spectra of oxidized olivines SC-14 and SC-15 (bold green lines) compared against untreated San Carlos olivine (light green line at bottom) and other phases that are potential oxidation products. The sample treated at 600° resembles untreated olivine, even after 625 hours of heating. The SC-15 sample treated at 900° contains significant hematite and a suggestion of enstatite. Other heat-treated samples may contain clinohumite or quartz. during the experiment, consistent with an increase in volume due to oxidation.  Raman Results. Raman spectra of unaltered olivines show only the characteristic doublet at ca. 822 and 854 cm-1 [17] along with other minor peaks that are also present in numerous examples of forsteritic olivine on the rruff.info web site. There is no detectable alteration in the unaltered crystals. At 600 °C altered crystals show evidence for peaks associated with hematite as the dominant alteration mineral with potentially minor magnetite, and clinohumite as well, but the olivine peaks still dominate the spectra even after 625 hours of oxidation. For the 900 °C experiments, alteration minerals including hematite and possibly magnetite dominate the spectra. There is potentially clinohumite as well, and forsterite is still present in the spectra, though to a much lesser extent. After 625 hours, there is minimal evidence for enstatite and quartz, as would be expected from oxidation of olivine to Fe-oxides [11]. Raman spectra of these minerals are shown in Fig. 2, with forsterite samples SC-14 and SC-15 heat treated at 600°C and 900°C, respectively, for 625 hours. VSM results. Before oxidation, olivine showed a paramagnetic signature and had no detectable ferromagnetic signal. For the 900 °C experiments, there was a change to a ferromagnetic signature after only 12 minutes (our shortest run time). For the 600 °C experiments, the change to a ferromagnetic signature did not occur until oxidation occurred between 125 and 625 minutes. Further, when hysteresis data is compiled into a Day et al. [16] plot (Fig. 3), the nucleation of high-coercivity hematite causes most samples to exhibit more single-domain like behavior with increased heating times and temperatures. The magnetic hysteresis loops, show a combination of ferromagnetic contributions from a 'soft' magnetic mineral (magnetite) and a 'hard' magnetic mineral (hematite). Implications: Hematite dominates the alteration products seen in the Raman spectra; however, the minor amount of magnetite that is also being produced by oxidation dominates the magnetic properties. Olivine oxidation on the surface should be dominated by hematite; however, small amounts magnetite should also be present and can contribute to a magnetic signature. Additional further characterization of these samples will include Mössbauer spectroscopy to better understand the distribution and mineralogy of the altered samples.
