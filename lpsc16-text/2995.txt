We have verified a substantial drop in thermal conductivity of regolith materials below ~100K. Recent theoretical work [4] and published measurements on meteorite samples [5] suggest thermal conductivity in this low temperature range should be highly dependent on the crystalline structure of the material, and should be very different than values extrapolated from higher temperatures.   The Cause:  This effect results from the fact that the mean free path of a phonon through a given material controls the thermal conductivity. According to elastic wave theory [6,7], phonon heat transfer through crystalline solids should be proportionate to specific heat (cV), phonon velocity (v) and phonon mean free path (l) as:                      λ= 1/3 cvvl  where  is thermal conductivity. This results in an increase in thermal conductivity with decreasing temperature, as mean free path will increase negating the specific heat decrease. In crystalline materials, this results in very high thermal conductivities at low termperatures. However, in polycrystalline materials, such as those typically found on planetary surfaces, the growth of the mean free path is limited by the size of the crystals that the material is composed of.      In silicate materials the onset temperature where mean free path can no longer grow should occur at approximately 100K. Below that temperature, thermal conductivity will then decrease proportionally to specific heat capacity (which drops at T3). Measurements of thermal properties of regolith at this low temperature range (< 90K) do not exist in literature. Figure 1 illustrates past assumptions of thermal conductivity at these low temperatures (dashed "old") and revised theoretical expectations from [4]. Thermal conductivity is expected to be as much as an order of magnitude lower than past models have assumed. Here we report initial results for Lunar regolith simulant down to 15K that support the revised theory.    Figure 1: The thermal conductivity of particulate basalt [10] fit to past theory (dotted, labeled "old") and as expected based on updated solid state theory (solid, "new").  Importance: As temperatures below 100K are present in nearly every airless body in the solar system, this data is incredibly important in interpreting thermal measurements and predicting surface and interior temperatures (especially those further than ~1AU and for shaded polar regions of Mercury and the Moon where temperatures as low as 20 K are observed [8,9]).      This research was conducted now for its importance to measurements by the Diviner Lunar Radiometer (aboard the Lunar Reconnasance Orbiter). Initial thermal models for the perminantly shadowed regions [3] have been found to disagree with measurements. Thermal inertia of this material is much lower than expected. This could either be due to a unique thermal or physical property of these materials, such as the presence of a volatile, or simply due to the effect we are measuring here.     This is especially important for a plausible constraint on lunar geothermal heat production from small craters  measured to get as cold as ~20K [8,9,10].

on both the geothermal heat flux of the Moon and the thermal inertia of the near surface material. While there might be multiple causes for the low thermal inertia, we now believe that this temperature dependent effect must be accounted for before any claims can be made reguarding thermal measurements of heat flux and cold trapped volatiles.      Experiment and Results: For this study, we measure thermal conductivity using a heated needle running down the center of a 2cm radius sample cell. Thermal conductivity is deduced from a temperature transition after a constant heat is turned on and before a heat diffusion front reaches the sidewall. The cell sits upon a cryo-cooler unit allowing it to reach temperatures of 15 K. A thermal shroud with a multi-layer insulation blanket that cuts down the radiation from the bell jar is thermally anchored to the first stage of the cryo-cooler, regulated at 100 K. An inner thermal shield of a much smaller size is mounted to the 2nd stage. The sample cell is hung from the shield with two G10 rods, can be regulated at T = 15 K with a heat switch engaged to the 2nd stage.  We performed measurements of 500 micron glass spheres and NU-LHT-2M Lunar simulant, which has been designed specifically to mimic lunar highlands materials. This material has been processed by a plasma melter to create a > 30% pseudo-agglutinate component to mimic production of agglutinates from impact processes. It has a mix of amorphous glasses (5%) and polycrystalline material (65%) that should also serve as a reasonable proxy for the lunar polar regions, which are principally highlands composition.    The resulting thermal conductivity measurements between 15 and 205K for the NU-LHT-2M sample are shown in Figure 2, together with the thermal conductivity of 500 micron Dragonite glass beads. Thermal conductivity values of the simulant are lower than the ones of the glass beads which reflects the smaller grain size [11]. The sample density of ~1700kgm-3 is consistent with the predictions. Even with a substantial crystalline component, the dramatic drop in thermal conductivity at low temperatures shows that the poly-crystalline component of the mixture dominates the bulk thermal properties of the material. The data show a strong upward trend at temperatures above approximately 150K. This is theoretically expected due to radiation between regolith grains, which increases conductivity as T3. In a separate request, we were granted and have received 30 grams (15 grams of Apollo 1110002 and 15 grams of Apollo 16-60500) samples from the Curation Analysis and Planning Team for Extraterrestrial Materials (CAPTEM) for this study. These two samples will serve as mare (Apollo 11) and highlands (Apollo 16) end members for this study. These samples are currently in  storage at JPL awaiting further research funding.  This preliminary measurement has been supported by JPL internal and SSERVI Vortices.
