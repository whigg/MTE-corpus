Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 (cdalou@umn,edu)   Introduction  One of the most remarkable observations regarding volatile elements in the solar system is the depletion of N on Earth relative to chondrites [12]. The origin of this depletion remains the topic of vigorous debate, but points to large-scale differentiation events such as sequestration in Earth's core or large-scale blow off of Earth's early atmosphere.  The formation and high stability of iron nitrides at HP-HT [3-4] suggest that  N could have been retained by the core-forming metal segregated from the magma ocean [1-5]. As the behavior of nitrogen during early planetary differentiation processes is poorly constrained, we address the effects of oxygen fugacity, pressure and temperature and melt composition on the solubility and partitioning of N between Fe-C-N metal alloy and two basaltic melts of different composition. Methods: We used two starting compositions: a Martian basalt (based on the Adirondack-class Humphrey basalts [6]) and MORB (based on primary normal MORB [7]). Nitrogen was introduced as Fe4N and/or Si3N4. Up to 16 wt% of Fe4N was added to obtain 1 wt% N in the starting material. Si3N4 was used chiefly to control fO2 during experiments, owing to its strong reducing effect: 6 FeO + Si3N4 = 6Fe + 3SiO2 + 2 N2.  Experiments were conducted in a piston-cylinder apparatus at variable oxygen fugacities, 1, 2, or 3 GPa, and 1400 or 1600˚C. Graphite capsules were used to ensure reducing conditions and to avoid Fe and N diffusion into metallic capsules. Major element and N concentrations of samples were analysed on a JEOL JXA-8900 EPMA at the University of Minnesota. The analytical procedure included separate acquisitions for major elements and N and were subsequently processed together using the PROZA algorithm in ProbeforEPMA. Exponential background models for N were fitted to both samples and standards respectively. Data were filtered to exclude artifacts from surface roughness. Results:  Sample description. All experimental charges are composed of a graphite-saturated mafic melt coexisting with variable amounts of an Fe-C-N metallic phase. Depending on fO2, the metallic phase forms variable amounts of compositionally homogeneous blobs ~10 to 200 µm in diameter. Silicate melts quench to chemically homogeneous glasses that are, in most cases, large pools well separated from the metal blobs. No bubbles have been observed, suggesting that neither C nor N saturation was attained during the experiments.  The oxygen fugacity of each experiment was calculated relative to the IW buffer based on the activity coefficients of FeO in silicate melts and Fe in Fe-C metal, following the procedure of [6]. In our samples, fO2 is between IW-0.5 and IW-3.5.  Nitrogen content in molten Fe-C-N alloy. The N content in molten Fe-C-N alloy varies from 0.85 ±0.43 to 3.55 ±0.72 wt%. Within error, N contents at constant P and T in the Fe-C-N alloy are constant across the fO2 used in this study, and does not vary significantly as a result of silicate melt composition (Fig. 1). An increase of 200ºC at constant pressure decreases the average N content values modestly, from 2.30 ± 0.29 wt% to 1.74 ± 0.17 wt%. N content in the Fe-C-N alloy increases from 1.09 ± 0.10 wt% to 2.30 ± 0.29 wt% between 1 and 2 GPa at 1400ºC, and from 1.74 ± 0.17 wt% to 3.41 ± 0.17 wt% between 2 and 3 GPa at 1600ºC.

N concentrations in molten Fe-C-N alloy and silicate melt (Humphrey basalt, diamonds; MORB, crosses).  Nitrogen content in silicate melt. N contents in silicate glasses show large variations from 0.05 ± 0.003 to 7.49 ± 0.93 wt%. The N content in Humphrey basalt and MORB glasses increases with decreasing fO2 (Fig. 1). In slightly reduced glasses (IW -0.75), a temperature increase of 200ºC does not have a significant ef fect on N content (0.15 ± 0.03wt% and 0.14 ± 0.03wt% at 1400ºC and 1600ºC, respectively). In contrast, an increase of 200ºC in highly reduced glasses (~IW -3) decreases N content from 7.49 ± 0.93 wt% to 4.86 ± 0.07 wt%, suggesting that the temperature dependence of N solubility increases with decreasing fO2. N content in silicate glasses increases with increasing pressure between 1 and 3 GPa; this increase is also observed up to 4 GPa [5-8]. Above 4 GPa, [5] suggest that N content in glasses remains constant with increasing pressure.

Comparison of N partition coefficients between molten Fe-C-N alloy and silicate melt in Humphrey basalt and MORB (this study), FeO-Na2O-Al2O3-SiO2 [8] and carboneous chondrite [5] systems. fO2 data of [8] were recalculated following the procedure of [6].  Nitrogen partitioning between metal alloys and silicate melts. Nitrogen partition coefficients between metal alloy and silicate melts in our study are compared to those of [5-8] in Fig. 2. In agreement with [8], we have found that N partition coefficients between metal alloy and silicate melts decrease with decreasing fO2. While N partitioning is most strongly dependent on fO2, the partition coefficients decrease with increasing temperature and pressure at similar fO2, in agreement with [8].  [5] have shown that N partition coefficients between Fe-Ni-N metal alloy and silicate melt increase with increasing pressure from 1.8 to 14.8 GPa. However, from 1 to 4 GPa, this study and [8] show no evidence of N partition coefficients increase with increasing pressure. Differences between [5] and the present study may be related to the compositional differences of the metal phase. Regardless of pressure and temperature conditions, N content is higher in Fe-Ni-N alloy of [5] than in Fe-C-N alloy (this study and [8]). This feature cannot be related to Ni content in the metal phase, since increasing Ni content decreases N solubility in the metal phase [5]. Instead, differences between [5] and the present study are likely related to the the presence C in our study and [8]. Discussion: At slightly reduced conditions (ΔIW 0.5 to -2), N is more compatible in the core-forming metal than in the silicate magma ocean (Figs. 1, 2). In contrast, at intermediate (ΔIW -2) to highly reduced (ΔIW -3.5) conditions, N becomes more compatible in the magma ocean (silicate) than in the core-forming metal phase (Fig. 2).  Towards the late stages of the Earth's accretion, magma ocean redox conditions were most likely close to IW -2 [9], and more reduced at shallower depths [10]. Therefore, at shallow depths, N is most likely to be retained in the magma ocean rather than partitioned into the core-forming metals. At depth, however, [5] suggests it is possible that N was trapped in the metal phase during core formation in a C-free system. Further studies on the pressure dependence of N partition coefficients (in the presence of C) are necessary to determine the possibility of N partitioning into the core-forming metal during core formation and subsequent N sequestration into the core. C partition coefficients between core-forming metal and silicate melts increases from slightly to highly reduced conditions [11-12]. Under those conditions, C is very siderophile (DCmetal/silicate ≥ 1000). In comparison, N is only relatively siderophile at slightly reduced conditions (DNmetal/silicate ~ 20). Therefore, sequestration of volatiles in the core affects C more than N, and lowers the C/N ratio of the bulk silicate Earth (BSE). Consequently, the high C/N ratio of the BSE cannot be the result of core formation, unless another process is involved, as for instance the accretion of a C-rich late veneer.
