It  is a bowl-shaped, near circular, simple asteroid impact crater with an average diameter of ~1810 m, circularity of ~0.95 and depth of ~135 m, and relatively pristine in morphology [1, 2]. The crater was formed on a basaltic target (Deccan Traps) by an oblique impact of a chondritic impactor that struck the pre-impact target from the east at an angle between 30 and 45o to the horizon [2, 3]. The age of the crater is not clearly established and could be 570±47 ka [4] or ~52±6 ka [5]. Our previous studies on the Lonar crater show systematic variations in rock-magnetic, paleomagnetic and AMS properties of the target rocks from the crater rim and surrounding with reference to the direction of impact from the east [6]. In the present work, we report the first order reversal curves (FORC) analyses of the Lonar impact-melts and  spherules and discuss their significance with the evolution of Lonar crater.   Fig. 1: Photgraph of Lonar basaltic impact crater  Sample Description and Measurements: mm-sized fragments of impact-melt and in-situ impact spherules from Lonar crater were recovered from trenches dug (~47 cm deep pit) on ejecta blanket close to the SE of the crater rim (19°58.356′N, 76°31.072′E). These impactites are characteristically black, have vitreous luster and highly vesicular surface. The impact-spherules have a variety of geometric shapes including rod, ellipsoidal, dumbbell and teardrop (Fig. 2). Secondary infillings of quartz are sometimes found in the vesicles. The FORC meassurments of impact spherules, impactmelts and target rock chips (mass: ~5 to 20 mg) were performed using Princeton Measurements Alternating Field Gradient Magnetometer  2900 (AGM Micromag). The FORC distributions yield information about the microcoercivity distribution (Hc) and magnetic interactions (Hu) within a sample [7, 8]. The FORC data were processed into FORC diagrams using the VARIFORC protocol of [9] within the FORCinel software of [10]. All FORC data were processed with the following VARIFORC parameters: Sc0=3.5, Sc1=7, Sb0=3, Sb1=7, and λv,h= 0.1. The FORC diagrams can enable discrimination between mixtures of grains with variable domain states and identification of the presence or absence of magnetostatic interactions because grains with different domain structures and interactions plot in different parts of the FORC diagram.    Fig. 2: Impact-melt pieces and spherules (teardrop, rod, and spindle shape) recovered from Lonar ejecta   FORC Results:  The FORC diagram of impact-melt chip display closed concentric contours between ~10 and 60 mT with substantial vertical spread dsitributions (below ~20 mT) suggesting the presence of interacting finer SD magnetic grains (Fig. 3a). The degree of magnetic interactions decreases for larger Hc values which probably reflects the increasing dominance of the intrinsic anisotropy over magnetic interactions with increasing coercivity [11]. In the case of  impact spherules, the FORC diagrams show evidence of mixtures of SD and MD grains (i.e. PSD-type) but with higher Hc values (Fig. 3b). Here, the SD-like moments progressively shifts to lower coercivities and that the MD-like magnetization diverges increasingly toward the Hu axis [8, 12]. Most of the target basalt (both unshok & shock) display PSD grain-size distribution FORC (Fig. 3c, 3d, 3e). For some shock basalts, there is a disappearance of the closed-contour structure suggesting PSD-MD grain-size transition (Fig. 3f). The observed shockinduced magnetic hardening nature (with high Hc values) for teardrop spherule and shocked ejecta (Fig. 3b, 3e) is consistent with the laboratory shock experimental studies [13].    Fig. 3: FORC diagram of Lonar: (a) Impact-melt, (b) Teardrop shperule, (C) Unshock basalt, (d) 'W' shock basalt, (e) Shock ejecta basalt, and (f) 'E' shock basalt  Discussions and Conclusions: High pressures and temperatures involved during impact cartering event results in melting and/or vaporization of target rock and projectile with a final opening of transient crater [14, 15]. The voluminous amount of material driven out of the transient crater is a mixture of shocked rock fragments and molten materials, which contrast in physical state, temperature and deformation. Impact-melts crystallized soon after the impact (but cool slowly) and eventally may contain finer SD magnetic grains whereas spherules undergone intense (superheated) melting followed by highvelocity ejection and chill rapidly in the impactgenerated vapor plume atmosphere before landing at the impact site resulting in both finer and coarser magnetic grains with higher coercivity (Hc) values. This shock-hardening behavior is also evident for shocked ejecta rocks. The FORC analysis are thus a potential method for characterizing various aspects of impact melting and shock pressure suffered by target rocks during impact crater formation.
