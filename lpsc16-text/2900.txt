Bishop4,  1Planetary Science Institute, Tucson,AZ, 2U.S. Geological Survey, Denver, CO, 3Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Laurel, Maryland, 4SETI Institute, Mountain View, CA.Introduction:  Water is expressed in martian spectra  mainly at  two wavelengths  in  the  near  infrared:near  3-microns, the O-H stretching fundamental,  andnear 1.9 to 2.1 microns with an OH stretch + H-O-Hbend combination  (hereafter  called the 2-micron  absorption).  A third location, the first overtone of the OH stretch, near 1.4 microns may also appear.  The 3micron  absorption  shows  strongly  in  every  CRISMMars spectrum we have examined except when freshCO2 frost  covers  the  surface  with  sufficient  depth.Where present, the 3-micron water absorption is saturated, indicating the presence of water in the percentrange but shows little variability in band depth acrossthe surface.  The pervasive fine grained dust on Marscreates  increasing  scattering  at  shorter  wavelengths,weakening or masking the apparent 1.4-micron waterabsorption  in  Mars  reflectance spectra.   That  leavesthe 2-micron water absorption often as the most diagnostic absorption for detecting larger amounts of waterin  the  optical  surface.   Frequently the  2-micron  absorption  is  stronger  than  the  metal-OH combinationbands in the 2.2- to 2.3-micron region.Historically, the 2-micron water absorption has received little attention as a feature to diagnose mineralogy.   However,  with  available  spectral  libraries,  wecan  examine  if  this  feature  might  be  diagnostic  ofmineralogy.  Different  mineral  groups have differenthydrogen bonding, shifting the position and width ofthe water absorption (Figure 1).  Analysis of availablespectra  obtained  in  dry environments  [1]  show thatsome  minerals  or  mineral  groups  can  be  uniquelyidentified.   Along with  the  wavelength  position  andwidth of the absorptions plotted in Figure 1, the shape,including asymmetry and shoulders from overlappingwater  absorptions  further  separate  absorptions  fromdifferent minerals, improving discrimination. We use the new CRISM Map-projected TargetedReduced Data  Record (MTRDR) image cubes [2]  toenable a new sophistication in detection and mappingof materials using the 1.9-micron water feature.   Wehave developed a new version of Tetracorder [3] thatexpands  capabilities  and  wavelength  range  allowingfor more sophistication of the expert system for identification  and  mapping  of materials  in  CRISM  data.The new system includes automated curved continuato detect trace compounds whose spectral features aresuperimposed on other spectral features.  For example,curvature of the 2-micron pyroxene absorption createsa false positive water absorption detection if straightline continua  are used.  Curved continua  reduces thefalse positives, enabling weaker water spectral featuresto be detected.Results:  We  have  analyzed  over  200  CRISMscenes, and find diverse signatures of water using the2-micron absorption.  We find water bearing zeolitesand sulfates are most common in the scenes mappedso far.  Also abundant are hydrated silica, and smectiteclays.  An example result is shown in Figure 2, wheremixed  zeolites  and  sulfates  dominate.   The  results,like those shown in Figure 2, can be further sub-diviedinto the specific zeolites and specific sulfates indicatedby the absorption positions and shapes.We find water rich materials are commonly foundwherever  there  are  erosion  slopes.   The  top surfacelayer  appears desiccated, consistent with Feldman etal. (AGU 2015 abstract).  We find diverse water-bearing mineralogy eroding from slopes, often in complexmixtures as shown in Figure 2, or mono-minerologiesin other locations.The latest mapping results will be presented at themeeting.References: [1] Clark  R.
