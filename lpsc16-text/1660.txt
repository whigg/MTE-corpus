Email: cyril.grima@gmail.com Introduction:  Titan's  landforms  are  similar  to those on Earth, shaped by aeolian, pluvial, fluvial, lacustrine,  tectonic,  impact  and  possibly cryovolcanic processes [1]. In that respect, investigating the properties of Titan's surface is a key to better understanding surface-atmosphere  interactions,  climate  dynamics, and  internal  activity. The surface is being probed by NASA's  Cassini  spacecraft  with  an  imager,  a  spectrometer and a Radar. The Radar has a nadir-looking altimeter mode at high sampling rate compatible with the application of the novel Radar  Statistical  Reconnaissance (RSR) technique that has been recently validated in Antarctica and on Mars with radar  sounders at VHF frequencies (20-60 MHz) [2, 3, 4]. RSR utilizes the surface signal  randomness to constraint  the observed terrains in terms of surface permittivity and vertical/horizontal  roughness.  The  purpose  of  this work  is  to  evaluate  the  feasibility of the  RSR technique  with  the  Cassini  RADAR  specificities  with some applications over the Titan's seas. The Cassini RADAR:  The Cassini RADAR is an active 13.8 GHz (2.2-cm wavelength)  multiple-beam instrument  with  observation  angles  arranged  acrosstrack [5, 6]. It is a part of the science payload for the NASA's Cassini  spacecraft  touring the Saturn's  system and  it's  icy moons  since 2004 [7].  The Cassini RADAR can  operate  sequentially  in  several  modes: Radiometer  (Receive-only),  scatterometer  (off-nadir transmission/reception),  altimeter  (nadir transmission/reception),  and  imager  (synthetic  aperture  radar).  The  transmission  sequence  is  a  packet (a.k.a. burst) of ~15 consecutive chirps at fix rate. The burst repetition frequency is adjustable to adapt the instrument to various targets and observation configurations. Radar Statistical  Reconnaissance  (RSR):  The RSR is a systematic method to constrain  quantitative surface properties from the radar surface return. It has been recently demonstrated with the High Capability Radar Sounder (HiCARS, 60-MHz central  frequency, 15-MHz bandwidth) airborne radar data in Antarctica [3, 4]. The RSR relies on a physical description of the surface echo assuming  a  stochastic  behavior  for  the surface  geometry.  Analytically,  the  surface  echo strength detected by the radar  antenna is the summation  of  two  fundamental  components,  the  signalreflectance and  scattering  [e.g.  8].  The contribution  of surface  permittivity and  deterministic  structure  (e.g. thin  deposit  or  layering)  is  dominant  in  the  reflectance, while scattering is mainly a function of the surface roughness and random internal  geometries of the near-surface (e.g. a pile of blocks from a collapsed terrain).  Firstly, the RSR aims to extract the reflected and scattered components of the signal by best-fitting the histogram of a set of surface echo amplitudes with a theoretical  stochastic model (homodyne K-statistics [9]).  The correlation coefficient of this fit is a confidence factor to estimate the terrain compliance to the model  assumptions.  The  scattering,  reflectance  and correlation  coefficient  give a  first  qualitative insight into the surface properties. Once deduced from the fit, they can  be used in  a  backscattering  model  to constrain the surface properties: Root mean square (RMS) heights, correlation length, and permittivity. Fig.  1.  (top)  Location  of  the  Cassini  RADAR burst's footprints over Ligeia mare (background from the imaging mode) for Flyby T91. The red and green color coding indicates the samples used to obtain the surface echo amplitude histograms (bottom). The red (resp. green) fit is consistent with a coherent power of -21.6 dB (resp.  -20.4 dB)  and  a  coherent/incoherent   power ratio of +16.4 dB (resp. +28.0 dB) at an altitude of  4150 km.  The  two  histograms  correspond  to  a slightly different  roll  angle  of the spacecraft  but are also coincident with different scattering properties for the sea's surface. Fig.  2.

RSR  application  to  the  Cassini  RADAR: The RSR is applied to the altimeter  mode of the Cassini Radar where the signal is transmitted in the nadir direction. In that configuration the received surface signal holds both the coherent and incoherent part of the backscattered power, thus bringing more information about the surface than an off-specular signal (incoherent only). We study the signal statistics for both pulseand  burst-derived amplitude  histograms.  The  Titan's seas  are  favored  targets  for  application  of the  RSR. Their  supposed  homogeneity in  terms  of  roughness /composition  at  the scale of the radar  footprint  provides a more suitable configuration for application of theoretical  stochastic  models.  The  Cassini  RADAR obtained valid data in altimetry-mode over three Titan seas: Ligeia, Punga, and Kraken. Preliminary results: The highly overlapping footprint  of the  contiguous  pulses  could  violate  the  assumption  of  statistically  independent  signal  returns that is needed to apply the RSR. However, the pulsederived  and  burst-derived  (weak  overlapping  footprint) surface amplitude histograms do not show significant  differences.  The gain  pattern  of the  Cassini RADAR has a 3-dB beamwidth of 7 mrad (0.35°). Observations tend  to show that  slight  variations  of the spacecraft  roll  affect the power components and surface properties extracted by the RSR. However, those variations are also coincident with different scattering properties of the surface as highlighted by the imaging mode of the Cassini RADAR (Fig. 1). Even if the the Mares appear as the more specular  surfaces on Titan at 2.2-cm wavelength,  the extracted coherent and incoherent components do not comply with the application domain of the Small Perturbation back-scattering Model (SPM) for very smooth surfaces. Despite that, the roughness properties at Ligeia can be constrained. If the permittivity of the surface is assumed to equal ~1.7 (Methane-dominant) [10, 11], the RSR technique converges to an  RMS height  of ~1.5 mm,  in  agreement  with  [12]  and  [13],  and  a  correlation  length probably in the order of ~100 mm at the scale of the radar  wavelength  and footprint,  respectively (Fig.  2). The application of more generic back-scattering models (e.g., the integral  equation method) will constrain those results in the future. References: [1] Aharonson  O.,  et  al.
