Email: cyril.grima@gmail.comIntroduction:  Titan's  landforms  are  similar  tothose on Earth, shaped by aeolian, pluvial, fluvial, lacustrine,  tectonic,  impact  and  possibly cryovolcanicprocesses [1]. In that respect, investigating the properties of Titan's surface is a key to better understandingsurface-atmosphere  interactions,  climate  dynamics,and  internal  activity. The surface is being probed byNASA's  Cassini  spacecraft  with  an  imager,  a  spectrometer and a Radar. The Radar has a nadir-lookingaltimeter mode at high sampling rate compatible withthe application of the novel Radar  Statistical  Reconnaissance (RSR) technique that has been recently validated in Antarctica and on Mars with radar  soundersat VHF frequencies (20-60 MHz) [2, 3, 4]. RSR utilizes the surface signal  randomness to constraint  theobserved terrains in terms of surface permittivity andvertical/horizontal  roughness.  The  purpose  of  thiswork  is  to  evaluate  the  feasibility of the  RSR technique  with  the  Cassini  RADAR  specificities  withsome applications over the Titan's seas.The Cassini RADAR:  The Cassini RADAR is anactive 13.8 GHz (2.2-cm wavelength)  multiple-beaminstrument  with  observation  angles  arranged  acrosstrack [5, 6]. It is a part of the science payload for theNASA's Cassini  spacecraft  touring the Saturn's  system and  it's  icy moons  since 2004 [7].  The CassiniRADAR can  operate  sequentially  in  several  modes:Radiometer  (Receive-only),  scatterometer  (off-nadirtransmission/reception),  altimeter  (nadirtransmission/reception),  and  imager  (synthetic  aperture  radar).  The  transmission  sequence  is  a  packet(a.k.a. burst) of ~15 consecutive chirps at fix rate. Theburst repetition frequency is adjustable to adapt the instrument to various targets and observation configurations.Radar Statistical  Reconnaissance  (RSR):  TheRSR is a systematic method to constrain  quantitativesurface properties from the radar surface return. It hasbeen recently demonstrated with the High CapabilityRadar Sounder (HiCARS, 60-MHz central  frequency,15-MHz bandwidth) airborne radar data in Antarctica[3, 4]. The RSR relies on a physical description of thesurface echo assuming  a  stochastic  behavior  for  thesurface  geometry.  Analytically,  the  surface  echostrength detected by the radar  antenna is the summation  of  two  fundamental  components,  the  signalreflectance and  scattering  [e.g.  8].  The contribution  ofsurface  permittivity and  deterministic  structure  (e.g.thin  deposit  or  layering)  is  dominant  in  the  reflectance, while scattering is mainly a function of thesurface roughness and random internal  geometries ofthe near-surface (e.g. a pile of blocks from a collapsedterrain).  Firstly, the RSR aims to extract the reflectedand scattered components of the signal by best-fittingthe histogram of a set of surface echo amplitudes witha theoretical  stochastic model (homodyne K-statistics[9]).  The correlation coefficient of this fit is a confidence factor to estimate the terrain compliance to themodel  assumptions.  The  scattering,  reflectance  andcorrelation  coefficient  give a  first  qualitative insightinto the surface properties. Once deduced from the fit,they can  be used in  a  backscattering  model  to constrain the surface properties: Root mean square (RMS)heights, correlation length, and permittivity.Fig.  1.

The red and greencolor coding indicates the samples used to obtain thesurface echo amplitude histograms (bottom). The red(resp. green) fit is consistent with a coherent power of-21.6 dB (resp.  -20.4 dB)  and  a  coherent/incoherent1660.pdf

power ratio of +16.4 dB (resp. +28.0 dB) at an altitudeof  4150 km.  The  two  histograms  correspond  to  aslightly different  roll  angle  of the spacecraft  but arealso coincident with different scattering properties forthe sea's surface.Fig.  2.

(bottom) Coherent/Incoherent power ratio(Pc/Pn) in function of the surfacecorrelation length (l) by application of the SPM.RSR  application  to  the  Cassini  RADAR: TheRSR is applied to the altimeter  mode of the CassiniRadar where the signal is transmitted in the nadir direction. In that configuration the received surface signal holds both the coherent and incoherent part of thebackscattered power, thus bringing more informationabout the surface than an off-specular signal (incoherent only). We study the signal statistics for both pulseand  burst-derived amplitude  histograms.  The  Titan'sseas  are  favored  targets  for  application  of the  RSR.Their  supposed  homogeneity in  terms  of  roughness/composition  at  the scale of the radar  footprint  provides a more suitable configuration for application oftheoretical  stochastic  models.  The  Cassini  RADARobtained valid data in altimetry-mode over three Titanseas: Ligeia, Punga, and Kraken.Preliminary results: The highly overlapping footprint  of the  contiguous  pulses  could  violate  the  assumption  of  statistically  independent  signal  returnsthat is needed to apply the RSR. However, the pulsederived  and  burst-derived  (weak  overlapping  footprint) surface amplitude histograms do not show significant  differences.  The gain  pattern  of the  CassiniRADAR has a 3-dB beamwidth of 7 mrad (0.35°). Observations tend  to show that  slight  variations  of thespacecraft  roll  affect the power components and surface properties extracted by the RSR. However, thosevariations are also coincident with different scatteringproperties of the surface as highlighted by the imagingmode of the Cassini RADAR (Fig. 1). Even if the theMares appear as the more specular  surfaces on Titanat 2.2-cm wavelength,  the extracted coherent and incoherent components do not comply with the application domain of the Small Perturbation back-scatteringModel (SPM) for very smooth surfaces. Despite that,the roughness properties at Ligeia can be constrained.If the permittivity of the surface is assumed to equal~1.7 (Methane-dominant) [10, 11], the RSR techniqueconverges to an  RMS height  of ~1.5 mm,  in  agreement  with  [12]  and  [13],  and  a  correlation  lengthprobably in the order of ~100 mm at the scale of theradar  wavelength  and footprint,  respectively (Fig.  2).The application of more generic back-scattering models (e.g., the integral  equation method) will constrainthose results in the future.References: [1] Aharonson  O.,  et  al.
