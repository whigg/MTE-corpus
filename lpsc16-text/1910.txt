Ralph.lorenz@jhuapl.edu  Introduction:  The leading hemisphere of Titan was recognized to be brighter than the rest at both radar and near-infrared wavelengths from lightcurve data even before Titan's surface was imaged (e.g. [1]). The terrain responsible was the first to be named on Titan - Xanadu.   This region is apparently old, retaining a relatively large number of impact craters, and heavily tectonized, featuring numerous mountains [2]. It also has some of the best-developed fluvial networks on Titan. A key current question is how Xanadu is differentiated from the Shangri-La dunefields to the west : why does sand not continue migrating into Xanadu. Topographic blocking is one possibility, but seemingly unlikely since Xanadu is actually low in elevation overall [3,4]. Another possibility [5] is that fluvial transport sweeps sand away to the north or south. Xanadu has not only high backscatter, but unusually low emissivity [3] indicating a substantial volume scattering component [4].   Observations during the T77 Cassini flyby (figure 1) give a new perspective (figure 2) on this distinctive terrain through altimetry measurements. These not only provide topographic information, but also yield radiometric data (emissivity and backscatter).  Backscatter at nadir provides independent information from that measured at higher incidence in SAR, since different reflection mechanisms can dominate.  References: [1] R. D. Lorenz and J. I.

Location map showing the T77 altimetry swath on a basemap of SAR and VIMS data. In addition to the optical and SAR boundary of Xanadu at 140oW, note also a small bright feature seen in low-resolution HiSAR at 155oW (arguably part of Oahu Facula - the bright/dark boundaries in ISS data, on which that feature was named, are not so obvious in the SAR data).  The width of the yellow line reflects the spacecraft altitude as it receded westwards and the altimeter footprint grew in diameter, a factor that needs to be taken into account in interpreting altimeter data [8].   Figure 1. Profiles along the equator at the Shangri-La / Xanadu boundary. Top-to-bottom plots show relative brightness in the ISS mosaic map; microwave emissivity and backscatter (dB) sensed at nadir, the threshold height (m), and the range span (m) in the altimetry echo.  The microwave properties do not have as well-defined an 'edge' as the near-infrared reflectivity. It is also noteworthy that while there is a large-scale anticorrelation of emissivity and backscatter (as one might expect from Kirchoff's Law), on the local scale of mountains often the two properties are positively correlated.  As noted further south from SARtopo, the mountains are superposed on a lower base level than the dunefields to the West - here there is a ~150m drop. Strikingly, this drop is further East than the nearinfrared boundary. The feature at 155 oW has striking contrast in nadir backscatter but little topographic expression.
