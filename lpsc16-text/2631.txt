AN EXCESS SIGNAL IN THE TAIL OF THE PSF OBSERVED IN THE PANCAM R7 FILTER ON BOARDTHE MARS EXPLORATION ROVERS: CHARACTERISATION AND CORRECTION Simone J. Jakobsen1,Kjartan M. Kinch1, Morten B. Madsen1, James F. Bell III2, Danika Wellington2, Austin Godber2. 1Niels BohrInstitute, University of Copenhagen, Øster Voldgade 5-7, 1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark; (simonejj@nbi.ku.dk),2School of Earth and Space Exploration, Arizona State UniversityIntroduction: The Panoramic Camera (Pancam) isa stereoscopic, multispectral camera system mountedon the masts of the Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit(MER A) and Opportunity (MER B) [1].During preflight standalone calibration activities in2002, a discrepancy was noted between reflectancespectra extracted from Pancam images of the calibrationtarget (caltarget), to equivalent spectra obtained with aspectrometer. In the longest wavelength filter (R7 at1009 nm), the Pancam observed lower contrast betweendark and bright caltarget regions, than expected. At thetime, this was thought to be due to partial transparencyof caltarget materials at longer wavelengths [1]. However, the effect is observed not only in caltarget images,but is also seen in-flight, in images of Martian terrain.The effect is typically small enough to be within thestated uncertainty of the Pancam system (10% absolute,3% filter-to-filter)[2]. But, in specific cases the effectmay be dramatic: for instance very dark shadows canshow an artificial increase of a factor of ∼2 in radiancein the R7 filter, relative to the neighbouring filter (R6 at934 nm).Here, we describe the observed effect, propose anexplanation of its physical origin, and construct amethod to correct for it.Characterising the effect: In order to determinethe nature of the R7 filter effect, we made use of simple images of a broad spectrum light source on a darkbackground obtained during preflight calibration. Weselected an image in each filter in order to use them asa means to compare the throughput. By using these images as estimates of the point spread function (PSF), wecould directly compare the shape of the PSF betweenfilters, by assuming that the distribution of the light incident on the filters is approximately the same.The raw images were calibrated according to the usualMER calibration procedure described in [2]. The sourcearea within 260 pixels from the source center were normalized and radial profiles were calculated over thesame area by finding the average radiance per pixel ineach bin, with the bins defined as 130 concentric annuli,each with a width of 2 pixels. The resulting radial profiles were used as estimates of the PSF in each filter (seeFigure 1).Comparing the light distribution in the different filtersfor the right eye of Pancam (filters R2 at 754 nm, R3 at803 nm, R4 at 864 nm, R5 at 904 nm, and R6 at 934 nm)showed us that the shape is more or less the same for allFigure 1: The figure shows the radial profiles used as estimates of the PSF inthe different filters.

Only the R7 filter showed a visibly differentdistribution with a higher contribution in the tail region,as seen in Figure 1.Unlike the R2-R6 filters, the Pancam R7 filter is a longpass filter, relying on the rapidly declining sensitivity ofthe CCD itself to provide the long-wavelength cutoff. Incontrast, in the conceptually similar Mastcam system onMars Science Laboratory (MSL) all filters are bandpassfilters [3]. Since the described effect is only observed onMER, not on MSL, this leads us to believe that the effectarises from light at wavelengths very close to the edgeof the silicon band gap at 1100 nm, beyond the cutoff ofthe longest-wavelength filter on the MSL Mastcam.The hypothesis: We propose that at the longestwavelengths, we get additional reflection from the backside of the CCD. Figure 2 shows how we expect someof the light hitting a pixel to be transmitted through thebulk silicon of the CCD and part of it being backscattered and registered in neighbouring pixels, ultimatelyresulting in a more broad distribution of the light thanshould be expected.We expect the scattering to be Lambertian as a goodestimate, and the amount of the radiation reaching thepixel layer to be dependent on the absorption depth insilicon at the wavelength dominating the effect. Thismakes it possible for us to limit the number of parameters needed in our model.Correction method: In order to eventually be ableto correct for the effect, we first sought to simulate theeffect using our hypothesis.

Figure 2: This figure shows how we expect some of the light hitting asingle pixel to penetrate through the CCD, get backscattered from the backsideof the CCD, and be registered in neighbouring pixels. The model parameter Adescribes the strength of the effect. X is the distance from the central pixel tothe pixel registering the backscattered part of the light. C is the thickness of theCCD.adjacent filter (the R6 filter), that does not exhibit anyexcess signal, as a template for how the light shouldbe distributed initially, hereby constructing an algorithmthat recreates the effect. In this way it became possibleto reproduce the R7 filter image from the template image. This was done by constructing the model:ymod = A∗ exp(−B∗√C2 + x2)∗C/(C2 + x2)3/2, (1)where A is a parameter describing the strength of theeffect, B is the absorption coefficient in silicon for thedominating wavelength, and C is the thickness of theCCD. ymod is the fraction of the signal in a specificpixel to add to neighbouring pixels at distance x. Fromthis model an algorithm was constructed that simulatesthe effect described by the model in each pixel, therebytransforming the template image into the R7 filter imageusing a fitting routine.In order to correct for the effect, the inverse problemwas treated using an iterative process. For each iteration the inverse algorithm using the best fit parametersfor the model was applied to the original R7 image bymaking a guess for the corrected version of the image.The first guess was the R7 image itself. After each iteration, the output image was used as the new guess untilthe output converged towards the final result.To test the final version of the correction on more complex and independent data, we made use of caltarget R7images obtained during the mission. This way we couldcheck whether or not the correction could take care ofthe contrast issues observed in such images. The algorithm was applied 11 times to be sure to achieve a resultthat was truly converging.Results: The fit used to identify the correct form ofthe model by simulating the effect, gave us a value forthe parameter A of 0.182 pixels2, a value for the parameter B of 0.031 pixels−1, and a value for the parameter Cof 25.5 pixels.Figure 3: This plot shows the spectra for the white, grey, and black regionsof the caltarget including the datapoints obtained from the correction of the R7filter data, showing an increase in black/white contrast. The spectra have beenscaled so that the spectrum representing the grey region matches the spectrumobtained with a spectrometer.When applying the correction to the caltarget R7 filterimage, which was used as an independent dataset, weagain observed that the output converged quickly withonly minor improvements from iteration # 2 to iteration # 11. The correction increased the black/white contrast in the R7 filter spectrum, bringing it closer to whatwas expected based on measurements made with a spectrometer (as seen in Figure 3).Discussion: In order to evaluate our hypothesis forthe nature of the effect as posed by the model, we convert the parameter B to a penetration depth giving usa value of 1/0.031pixels−1 ∗ 12 microns pixels−1 = 388microns, where 12 microns is the physical size of a pixel[1]. This value can be evaluated based on informationabout penetration depth i silicon. Comparing this to a table of the penetration depth in silicon at different wavelengths, we see that this implies that the dominatingwavelength is just above 1080 nm, which fits well withour expectations that the effect is related to wavelengthshigher than the MSL cutoff [4]. Converting the value ofthe C parameter to a thickness of the CCD in microns,we get a value of 25.5 pixels∗12 microns pixel−1 = 306microns. This fits reasonably well with the value of >400 microns listed by the manufacturer, given that theparameters are not tightly constrained by the fit.Further work includes examining the effect on the results when introducing additional wavelengths to themodel, as well as introducing the correction on missionimages, to determine its performance on actual data.References: [1] J.
