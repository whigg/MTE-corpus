Overview: Against expectations, New Horizons' images of the surface of Pluto and Charon show seemingly young surfaces. On Pluto, images of an equatorial region south of the informally named Tombaugh Regio reveal a mountain range with peaks as high as 3,500 meters [1], see Fig. 1. The low concentration of craters on these mountains suggests an age of ~100 million years [2]. In contrast, the dark region, informally named, Cthulhu Regio, is saturated with craters indicating an age of ~4 billion [2]. The variation in crater abundances indicates that Pluto is geologically active [1-3]. Other evidence for geologic activity includes a fault cross-cutting ridges, smooth lightly cratered plains with flow fronts, and a pair of apparent stratovolcanoes [3]. Similarly, Charon possesses very few craters and a spectacular system of troughs. Both observations suggest the possible presence of active cryogeysers and cryovolcanoes likely driven by a vigorous mantle convection regime [3].  While Pluto and Charon seem to be quite active, Ceres and the much larger Callisto seem to lack modern endogenic activity, even though all of these bodies are likely to possess water ice mantles. Our study investigates the factors that determine planetary convective vigor with the aim of defining a universal criterion for geologic activity.  Determining planetary vigor: The Rayleigh number is a non-dimensional parameter that assesses the vigor of thermal convection in a fluid layer under the influence of gravity and a downward-increasing thermal gradient. The Rayleigh number is essentially the ratio between the time scales for conductive cooling and buoyancy-driven overturn of the viscous fluid.  The conventional expression for the Rayleigh number [4] requires knowledge of the temperature difference between the top and bottom of the convecting layer. Because the thermal gradient in Pluto is a priori unknown, but the surface heat flow can be estimated at about 3 mW/m2 from internal heat production, we employ a version of the Rayleigh number based on surface heat flow [4]:      (1) where α is the volume coefficient of thermal expansion, ρ is fluid density, g acceleration of gravity (0.66 m/sec2 on Pluto), L is the depth of the convecting   Fig. 1: An image of Pluto taken from the New Horizons spacecraft.

This version of the Rayleigh number is related to the more standard version Ra through the Nusselt number Nu, Raq = Nu Ra.  The Nusselt number is the ratio between the total heat transported by both convection and conduction to conductive heat transport only and is given by:   � Nu =RaRac⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ βfor Ra > Rac   (2) The critical Rayleigh number Rac that marks the onset of convection is of order 103, depending on detailed boundary conditions, and β has been measured to be 0.31 over a wide range of Ra [5]. Equations (1) and (2) together define the "parameterized convection model" which has been widely used to model thermal evolution of planetary mantles [4, 6]. The most critical variable in these models is the viscosity of the convecting fluid.  Unlike ideal liquids, the viscosity of a hot, creeping solid is a sensitive function of both deviatoric stress σ and temperature T and is often parameterized by the form [7]:     (3)   � Raq =αρgL4κ kηqs  � ηeff =σ1−n2A eQ RT2431.pdf

where Q is the activation enthalpy for creep and R is the gas constant. A is a constant that, along with Q, and n, must be determined experimentally. Because the effective viscosity depends strongly on both the temperature and stress in the convecting system, which vary widely from place to place, it is important to understand how to define them in a meaningful way.  Schubert and Straus [8] shown that the best choice is to use the mean temperature and buoyancy stress for accurate estimates of convective vigor, a choice that we follow here. As they stand, equations (1)-(3) do not define a closed system and more information is required to compute Ra, even given the heat flow and material properties of the convecting fluid.  The system can, however, be closed by recognizing that the mean temperature in a convecting fluid is determined by the surface temperature, TS, heat flow qS and the temperature drop across the cold (surface) boundary layer, whose thickness is itself determined from the Nusselt number.  We thus set:      � T = TS +qS Lk(Nu +1) (4) where we have ignored the adiabatic increase of temperature in the convecting layer, a valid approximation for a thin layer.  Further adding an equation for the average deviatoric stress in convecting plumes,     (5) Equations (1)-(5) now define a closed, if highly nonlinear, system that can readily be solved by numerical methods to define most of the properties of the convecting layer from the properties of the fluid, the surface heat flow and surface temperature.  Application to Pluto's icy mantle: With our parameterized convection model and a temperature dependent rheology for pure water ice, we deduced a barely critical Rayleigh number of ~1600 for Pluto's mantle and <1000 for Charon, suggesting that a water ice mantle alone may be insufficient to support vigorous convection in these bodies [3].  However, in the outer solar system, other volatiles may have condensed that could affect the rheology of the mantle [3]. Spectral data shows ammonium hydrates on the surface of Charon [9]. With these surface observations, it is likely that some amount of ammonium condensed within the interior of Pluto and Charon. At temperatures above the eutectic (176 K), Durham et al. [10] showed that NH3 could lower the viscosity of water ice up to 4 orders of magnitude, depending on its abundance. Our model indicates that, with 5% NH3, the mean temperature of the mantle of Pluto is at the eutectic and its Ra ~ 104 [3]. The presence of NH3 dramatically increases the vigor of convection for the two bodies and suggests that ammonia-water slurries could be the basis for Pluto's volcanism [3].  Planetary activity on the surface of exoplanets: The advantage of this new parameterized convection model is the ability to determine whether a planet has a convecting mantle solely from the surface heat flow, the inferred mantle composition, and the mantle thickness; these parameters are easily obtained from the planet's radius and bulk density. It is this quality that makes our model ideal for investigating the geologic activity of exoplanets.  However, as it stands now, the model is incomplete, as it does not take into account the adiabatic gradient within the convecting mantle. While this is fine for small bodies such as Pluto or Charon, bodies the size of Earth or larger require the incorporation of the adiabatic gradient within the convecting mantle.  To include the adiabatic gradient, we add:    � dTdz adb=αgTcp  (6) as an additional term to Eq. 4., yielding: �   � T = TS +qS Lk (Nu + 1) +α gTcpL2 −LNu + 1( )⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎞ ⎠ ⎟      (7) Note that the T dependence is what makes this implicit. Solving Eq. 7 for   � T , we produce an equation that incorporates the adiabatic gradient.   � T =TS +qS Lk (Nu + 1)1 − α g2cpNuNu + 1( )⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟  (8) Using Eq. 8 to determine the temperature at the core of the convecting cell, we can now apply our model to large exoplanets. However, if the mantle is very deep, we will have to include the planet's curvature. Conclusion: Our results indicate that ammonium plays a pivotal role in producing the geological activity on Pluto's surface. Furthermore, our model can be extended to determine the endogenic activity within exoplanets of various size and composition. References: [1] Stern et al. 2015, Science 350.
