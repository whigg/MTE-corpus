Introduction: The study of Shergottites has provided important constraints on Martian mantle magma dynamics and source reservoirs for shergottites as a whole. The martian basalt Northwest Africa 10299 is one of the latest finds and is the subject of this study. New EMP and LA-ICPMS results reveal distinct pyroxene compositions as evidence for a complex crystallization history. Comparisons to other olivine-phyric and basaltic shergottites [1, 2], add to our growing knowledge of the igneous processes within the Martian crust. Petrography: The majority of NWA 10299 consists of elongated prismatic grains of clinopyroxene (~60%), with interstitial prismatic plagioclase grains (~33%: Fig. 1). The plagioclase, however, is completely transformed to maskelynite, with some associated melting. The remaining ~7% contains olivine, sulfide, ilmenite, and chromite, including ~4% merrillite (Fig. 1). Other features include fine-grained aggregates of silica and feldspar observed between clinopyroxene crystals and melt pockets. The highly evolved, Fe-rich pyroxenes do not show obvious breakdown textures. Methods: Major- and minor-element compositions were determined with a Cameca SX-100 electron microprobe at the University of Tennessee. The microprobe was calibrated daily using both natural and synthetic standards. WDS elemental X-ray maps were collected for Al, Ca, Fe, and Si using a 15 keV, 30 nA beam, and a step size of 1 µm. Trace-element concentrations were determined using an Agilent 7500 ce inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometer (ICPMS), combined with an Excimer 193 nm ArF GeoLasPro laser ablation system, at Virginia Tech. Results: The zoning of pyroxene observed in Fig. 1 is evident in major- and trace-element compositions. Pyroxene rims in NWA 10299 are characterized by compositions of Wo19En23Fs59, approaching pyroxferroite [3]. We also observe distinct core populations: augitic cores with avg. Wo33En42Fs24 and pigeonitic cores with avg. Wo12En54Fs34 (Fig. 2).  Figure 2. End-member components of NWA 10299 pyroxene. Arrows represent fractionation paths.  Figure 1.

As shown on Fig. 3, augitic pyroxenes range between 0.4-0.7 Fe afu and 0.012-0.020 Mn afu, whereas pigeonitic pyroxenes range between 0.6-0.8 Fe afu and 0.020-0.025 Mn afu; consistent with other Martian basalts [4]. The rims, however, range from 0.8-1.6 Fe afu and 0.025-0.040 Mn afu. These compositions represent extensive fractionation [e.g., 5, 6, 7], similar to low-Ti lunar basalts.  Figure 3. Molar Fe and Mn values for NWA 10299 pyroxenes compared to Lunar basalts.  NWA 10299 pyroxenes display exclusive highfield strength element (HFSE) compositions, as revealed by LA-ICPMS (Fig. 4). Pigeonitic pyroxene typically display ~300 ppm V, while augitic pyroxene typically contain ~500 ppm V. The rims however, span from ~500 to 50 ppm V and up to 30 ppm Zr, while the cores are typically less than 5 ppm. This does not represent a simple fractionating system, i.e., one starting from pigeonite cores; the other from augite cores.  Figure 4. Zr (ppm) vs. V (ppm) diagram for NWA 10299 pyroxenes. Arrows represent possible fractionation paths.  Crystallization Sequence: The crystallization sequence of NWA 10299 is interpreted based on mineral textures and REE compositions. Augitic pyroxene and rims share similar CI-chondrite [8] normalized heavyREE patterns and concentrations, e.g., 2x chondrite, and are enriched compared to the pigeonitic pyroxene, at ~1x chondrite (Fig. 5). These ranges compare favorably to other Martian shergottites [2]. Irregularly shaped pigeonitic patches, some mantled by Mg-rich augite (Fig. 1), suggests crystallization at depth and then resorption on the way up to the surface, without reequilibration of the pyroxene. Latestage crystallization includes olivine + SiO2 or olivine forming after pyx-plag fractionation.  Figure 5. Average pyroxene CI-Chondrite normalized REE patterns for NWA 10299. Range for Martian shergotties from Treiman and Filiberto [2].  Summary: Three stages for sherggottie development has been proposed [1, 2, 9]: (1) formation of a parental magma, (2) magma ponding and development of a staging chamber, and (3) magma ascent to the near surface. QUILF assessment [10] suggests that the pyroxenes are not in equilibrium. fO2 determinations at 1000°C and 5 kbar yield QFM-2.7 and QFM -3.1 at 10 kbar. This range is in good agreement with other shergottites [11]. This model serves as a template to apply to this new meteorite. Radiogenic isotope compositions will further discriminate between enriched Martian mantle reservoirs versus crustal assimilation [12, 13]. References: [1] Howarth G. H. et al.
