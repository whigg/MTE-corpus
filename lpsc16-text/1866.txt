Introduction:  The VIR [1] (Visible Infrared Mapping Spectrometer) instrument onboard Dawn mission [2] produced more than 4.5 millions spectra of Ceres' surface in the 0.25-5.0 !m spectral range from January 2015 to July 2015. These observations, taken with ground spatial resolution varying between 90 km/pixel - 1km/pixel span a wide range of phase angles (7°120°) and observations geometries allowing the investigation of Ceres' average photometric properties. Moreover this gives the possibility to compute a photometric correction of the dataset in order to remove the effect of observation geometries on the measured spectra and highlight intrinsic albedo variability.  Average spectrophotometric properties:  Ceres' surface as observed by VIR is relatively dark with a modeled geometric albedo at 0.55 !m of 0.088 ±0.006 [3], as derived from photometric analysis and assuming opposition effect parameters from [4]. This value is in good agreement with previous derivation by [5], giving a value of 0.087 ±0.003. The modeled full-disk reflectance phase curve computed by means of Hapke's model [6], when compared to others asteroids (fig.1) places Ceres between the brighter S-type and the darker comets and C-type (Mathilde). When normalized at 0° phase angle (fig.2) the phase curve show a moderate back-scattering behavior, again between comets (back-scattering) and S-type asteroids (forward-scattering), being almost identical to the C-type Mathilde.   Figure 1. Modeled full-disk reflectance (FDR) as a function of phase angle ! for several asteroids and comets (from [7,8] and references therein). Ceres' FDR is reported with black diamonds.    Figure 2. Modeled full-disk reflectance (FDR) as a function of phase angle !, normalized at 0° phase angle, for several asteroids and comets (from [7,8] and references therein). Ceres' FDR is reported with black diamonds.  Photometric correction:  the photometric correction is computed for each wavelength applying Hapke model [6] as described in [7], with the inclusion of multiple scattering and adopting a two parameters Henyey-Greenstein [9] single particle phase function. Since the lowest phase angle in the investigated dataset is 7°, the opposition effect surge cannot be modeled and value from [4] are assumed across the whole spectral range. By means of the photometric correction the measured reflectance is reported to standard geometry (incidence angle=30°, emission angle=0° and phase angle=30°).  Albedo maps:  reflectance reported to standard geometry (albedo) is used to produce maps of the surface at the wavelengths of the VIR spectral range. The different pixels are reprojected  according to their footprint on the surface. The albedo reported in the maps is computed as the median among the values from overlapping pixels. In fig.3 we report an example at 0.55 !m centered on Ceres' equatorial region. An extended  1866.pdf

 bright region around Dantu crater can be recognized opposed to a darker area in the 180°-225° latitude range. Large albedo values are also measured in Oxo, Haulani, Juling and Kupalo craters. Occator bright spot can be recognized despite the low spatial resolution, and appear surrounded by dark material. Apart from these isolated bright regions the overall albedo variability is below 15%, compared to the previous estimate of 12% measured from HST data [5], indicating that Ceres' photometric properties are fairly uniform at large scale. Similar albedo maps can be produced across the whole VIR spectral range, allowing to characterize global spectral variability across the surface. Nonetheless, by means of data acquired during High Altitude Mapping Orbit (HAMO) and Low Altitude Mapping Orbit (LAMO) phases, it will be possible to investigate the albedo properties of selected regions at larger spatial resolution.
