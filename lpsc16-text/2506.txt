Introduction: The origin of lunar magnetic anomalies has remained a puzzle since the Apollo program [1]. Recent studies have interpreted the magnetization directions of the Moon's anomalies to estimate the amounts of true polar wander [2, 3].  However, the magnetic anomalies clustered around the South PoleAitken basin (SPA) have so far escaped detailed study. The field structures are complex in this region, but its large extent makes it essential for understanding the Moon's magnetic history. Here we isolate discrete anomalies in and around SPA and for the first time estimate their magnetization directions. Using three-axis Kaguya and Lunar Prospector magnetometer data, we find a large diversity in magnetization directions and implied lunar paleopoles.  The diversity provides critical constraints on the formation of these anomalies, and helps rule out magnetization by impact-related fields. In addition, the directional diversity implies large amounts of true polar wander on the Moon, and/or that the orientation of the lunar dynamo was highly variable. We also propose that very short timescale true polar wander events could have been captured by SPA ejecta or sesquinary impactors, immediately after the SPA impact, over ~104-106 year timescales. Methods: The strongest magnetic anomalies in the northern SPA region are divided into seven study areas, using the mapping software and methods of [4] (Figure 1). We use magnetometer data from two independent sources: Lunar Prospector (LP-MAG) and SELENE/Kaguya (K-MAG). To best capture the Moon's crustal field, all data used for analysis are collected in either lunar wake or while the Moon was in the Earth's magnetotail (wake/tail).  We use two different algorithms to invert for source body characteristics. Both methods produce nearly the same results, despite large differences in their approaches. The first is a regression for the least squared error (Defined Dipoles, Constant Magnetization algorithm, DD-CM), which completely searches a given parameter range using less than eight manually placed dipoles as the source bodies. A more objective approach (Gridded Dipoles, Variable Magnetization algorithm, GD-VM) does not place dipoles manually, at the expense of exploring a much larger parameter space, establishing a 0.25° × 0.25° grid of dipoles covering the entire study area [4]. Magnetic moment is allowed to vary among the dipoles. Results: Best-fit magnetization directions and derived paleopoles for all datasets, across all study areas, are calculated from minimum RMS error best-fit directions (Figure 2). Directions of all areas except area 2 are similar for both the GD-VM and DD-CM algorithms. For area 2, the inclination is similar but its declination is different by 30 degrees, suggesting that this area's direction is not as well constrained.

specifically excluding the SPA anomalies examined here. Using methods similar to our DD-CM algorithm, they find that paleopoles cluster into two groups (Figure 3b). When compared with the mean SPA paleopoles locations calculated by combining the DD-CM and GD-VM methods and reversing all poles into one hemisphere (Figure 3a), we find still wider dispersion in the distribution of paleopoles. The paleopole of Area F, just outside the SPA basin, falls into the polar cluster identified by [2], while the paleopoles of areas V and 5 fall within the mid-latitude cluster. However the areas 1, 2, 3, and 4 all fall outside of the two clusters. 0°30°60°180°SPA paleopole summary, this study Paleopoles from Takahashi et al. (2014)Figure Y.

Discussion: The wide variation in magnetic paleopoles across SPA's magnetic anomalies presents a puzzle. A long-standing hypothesis associates the lunar magnetic anomalies in this region with antipodes of the Imbrium and Serenitatis basins [6]-[8]. However the deposition of impact ejecta would take place over a short period of time (flight time is ~1 hour [9]), during which the ambient field direction is likely to be nearly constant. This implies that the magnetic anomalies at each antipode should have the same magnetization direction, which is not observed. Other than SPA ejecta deposits (below), we conclude that intrusive bodies, such as dikes [10], are a more plausible explanation.  Our paleopole estimates could imply large amounts of true polar wander, but no suitable geophysical theory presently exists to reconcile these diverse directions. For example, [11] finds the present lunar pole has changed by only ~36° from its earliest axis, and [12] infers up to ~6° of paleolatitude change has occurred based on polar hydrogen deposits. Neither model can produce the large paleopole changes implied by the anomalies studied here (see also [13]). The alternative interpretations to true polar wander on long timescales are complex geometry dynamos or large amounts of secular drift.  Unfortunately, for both of these hypotheses, we have little information about the nature and behavior of the Moon's dynamo.  The diverse directions may argue against the hypothesis that they formed from iron-rich SPA ejecta [14], if the Moon did not substantially reorient during ejecta cooling. However, iron-rich material from the SPA impact may have recorded, via thermo-remanent magnetization, rapid reorientation of the Moon in the aftermath of the SPA impact, over the timescale for free precession damping (~105 years [15]). Some SPA ejecta material may have also produced iron-rich sesquinary impactors [16-18] across the Moon, which further recorded orientation changes.   The wide variety of viable hypotheses and large number of unknowns highlight the complexity of interpreting the origins of lunar magnetic anomalies and their paleopoles. The hope for the future lies in a better understanding of the extent of true polar wander, as constrained by lunar gravity, topography, and hydrogen deposits [11, 12], and improved models of dynamo geometry in bodies with small cores.
