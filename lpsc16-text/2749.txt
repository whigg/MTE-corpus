 Investigations Into The Sources of K and Th Decoupling Across Terrestrial Bodies D. Susko1, S. Karunatillake1, D.R. Hood1, A. Barbato1 1Louisiana State University (Davidsusko@gmail.com)   Introduction:  On the planetary crust of the terrestrial bodies Mars and the Moon, K and Th have stronger spatial covariance than any other elemental pair detectable by Î³-spectra [1]. We refer to this behavior as "coupling" between these two elements. At certain regional locations on Mars and the Moon, however, these elements decouple. On Earth, K and Th tend to decouple in certain environments due to varying contributions from igneous processes and aqueous alteration. Unlike the relatively constant abundances of the major elements, K and Th, as minor or trace elements, can act as a fingerprint of geologic processes [2].  The Gamma-Ray Spectrometer (GRS) on the Mars Odyssey Orbiter provides us with the mass fraction maps of 9 elements (Al, Cl, Ca, H, Fe, Si, S, K, and Th) at decimeter depth sensitivity for the surface of Mars, ranging from roughly 45o N to 45o S [3]. Elemental mass fraction maps of similar depth resolution are provided by the Lunar Prospector Orbiter's GRS and reports a total of 8 elements (Mg, Fe, Al, Ca, Si, Ti, K, and Th)[4]. Using principal component multivariate analysis we show that on global crustal scales on both bodies, K and Th show stronger coupling than any other two elements. This initial analysis motivates further investigation into the geochemistry of terrestrial rocks at regional scales, in an attempt to constrain what geologic processes lead to the decoupling of K and Th on terrestrial bodies. Because the Moon lacks endogenic H2O, variations in the K/Th have to be igneous in nature [2]. The surface of Mars, on the other hand, falls in between the two end members of a "dry" moon and "wet" Earth. Mars once had considerably more water on its surface, and as such, crustal rocks could have been exposed to aqueous alteration processes that decouple K and Th at regional or local scales. We analyzed terrestrial rocks sampling distinct crustal regions, by creating a terrestrial geochemistry repository, and categorizing data sets into 11 classes based on igneous origin or alteration environment. These categories included 1) oceanic igneous crust, 2) continental granitic pluton, 3) plume-driven volcanism through oceanic crust, 4) plume-driven volcanism through continental crust, 5) extensional rift-volcanism, 6) oceanic-oceanic convergent margin volcanism, 7) oceanic-continental convergent margin volcanism, 8) back-arc extensional volcanism 9) sub-aqueous altered volcanoclastic rocks, 10) sub-marine altered MidOcean Ridge Basalts (MORBs) and 11) clastic sedimentary rocks.  Terrestrial Repository:  These classes are not meant to be exhaustive, but rather a representative examples of each process. The first class is representative of  typical unaltered oceanic crust, is sourced from depleted Mid Ocean Ridge Basalt mantle, a composition which makes up roughly 30% of bulk silicate Earth [5]. This represents largely pristine compositions of basalt. The second class is a composition from the Antarctic Dry Valleys, where tectonic uplift exposes a granitic pluton [6]. This class represents the igneous composition underlying continental crust on Earth. The 3rd and 4th classes are both derived from mantle hotspots originating from the lower mantle. Mantle plumes often undergo diverse assimilations, fractionations, and other processes across thousands of km path through mantle and crust. The Hawaiian-Emperor hotspot punctures basaltic ocean crust and composes class 3 [7], [8], while Craters of the Moon volcanism intersects granitic and sedimentary continental crust and composes class 4 [9].  Rift volcanism caused by extensional plate tectonism does not usually involve an introduction of large amounts of volatiles such as H2O. Rocks from the East African Rift Zone (EARZ) composed class 5 [10]. Convergent tectonism often does include an introduction of large quantities of volatiles in the form of H2O at destructive plate margins such as subduction zones. Classes 6 and 7 represent situations for subduction between two different types of crusts. Class 6, is island-arc volcanism during oceanic-oceanic subduction, such as in the Marianas Island volcanics [11]. Class 7 is represented by continental-arc volcanism during oceanic-continental subduction such as in the Northern Andean mountain range of South America [12]. Class 8, back-arc extensional volcanism, is also a result of subduction, but occurs further away from the plate margin after many of the volatiles have already been removed by the continental-arc volcanism. In the case of the Wyoming Craton Leucite Hills lamproites, magmatism and extrusive volcanism resulted from remelting ancient, crustal basement rocks as the North American Plate subducted the eastward moving Farallon Plate [13].  The last three classes represent non-igneous processes usually tied to aqueous interactions. Class 9, sub-aqueous altered igneous rocks, are represented by samples from Oregon's Crater Lake. These rocks have been exposed to an aqueous environment of mostly neutral pH conditions [14]. Class 10, sub-marine altered igneous rocks are samples from MORBs at the surface and represent alteration conditions at high water-to-rock ratios [15]. The 11th and final class, is composed of coarse-grained sand-stone from the Pilbara   Craton, Australia, shows the behavior of K and Th in silica samples that have undergone extensive weathering and change of rock type [16]. Fig. 1: The compositions from the 11 classes plotted on a K/Th ratio vs K ppm plot in order to analyze the behavior of K/Th in relation to the abundance of K [2]. Data sets which plot horizontally across the graph, such as the Wyoming Craton rocks from the back-arc extensional volcanism class, represent a coupling of K and Th, showing that as K increases, the K/Th ratio remains largely constant. On the other hand, when data sets which plot vertically or obliquely, such as the Hawaiian hotspot from the plume-driven volcanism through oceanic crust class, it represents a decoupling of K and Th.  Fig. 2: The Mars Odyssey GRS data is plotted against the terrestrial PUM composition, class 1,and submarine altered MORB, class 10.   Chemical weathering of Samples: Calculating a Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA = 100*[(Al2O3)/ (Al2O3 + CaO + Na2O + K2O)]) [2], shows how the K/Th ratio varies with the degree chemical alteration of the rock. Rocks with higher CIA have had greater exposure to chemical weathering. At neutral pH levels for most water-to-rock reactions on earth the Al phase is resistant and remains in the sample after other elements weather out [17]. K is usually among those elements removed from the sample during extensive weathering, meanwhile Th remains constant, or even in some cases increases with CIA. Generally, this behavior leads to decoupling and a decrease in the K/Th ratio[2]. Preliminary Results:  The most evident classes which show coupling of K and Th among the terrestrial classes in Fig. 3 are Classes 2, 5, 8, and 9. Classes with evidently decoupled K and Th are 3, 6, and 7. The coupled classes are representative of dry tectonic processes such as uplift and extension, as well as the subaqueous alteration of rocks in Crater Lake Oregon. The decoupled classes are those with the highest level of volatile introduction, such at subduction zones in the Mariana's Island-arc volcanism and at the subduction zone of the Nazca plate under the South American Plate. Interestingly, decoupling also occurs at locations where magmatism is generated deep within the mantle for hotspots at the Hawaii-Emperor Chain  On Mars, major volcanism is attributed to magmatic upwelling hotspots similar to the Hawaii volcanic chain. Regional to local scale decoupling of K and Th observed the surface of Mars [2] is sometimes found within the vicinity of volcanic provinces [18], and may in part be attributed to deep mantle processes which have lead to the decoupling of K and Th during planetary differentiation. Our preliminary results also favor a lack of the presence of oceans on Mars.  It is unlikely Mars experienced high degrees of sub-marine alteration on its surface, since we do not observe decoupling behavior of K and Th on the scale we observe from the terrestrial class 10, sub-marine altered MOR basalts.
