DEVELOPMENT ON MULTI-TURNED TOF SIMS WITH A FEMTO-SECOND LASER FOR POSTIONIZATION: FIRST APPICATION TO EXTRATERRESTRIAL MATERIALS.  K. Terada1, Y. Kawai1, M. Toyoda1, M. Ishihara1, J. Aoki1, H. Yabuta1, T. Suwa2 and R. Nakamura1, 1Osaka University (terada@ess.sci.osakau.ac.jp), 2The University of Tokyo.  Introduction:  Isotopic compositions provide us an important clue to decipher the origin and evolution of the Solar System. So far, Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometers (SIMSs), which have high spacial resolution (1~10 µm), have been used for isotopic measurement of individual minerals and/or presolar grains [1-4]. In general, a few nA primary beam with acceleration voltage of 10-13 kV is focused to sputter an area 1-10 µm in diameter on the sample surface. Then, secondary ions are extracted with acceleration voltage of 10-13 kV, mass-separated by Magnet and/or flight-tube of TimeOf-Flight (TOF), and finally detected on a single or multi-collector system. The weakest point of this analytical method is that secondary ion yield is very low (less than 1 %). As a result, a large amount of sputtered atoms and molecules that are neutral are wasted. This disadvantage is an important issue that should be addressed especially for scarce and fine particles such as returned samples from Moon/asteroids/comets and/or stardusts collected from primitive meteorites. To overcome this weakness of SIMSs, post-ionization method using high-intensity laser has been proposed [5-9]. Here we report on our recent progress of a development of multi-turned TOF-SIMS with a femtosecond laser for post-ionization and also report the first application for presolar SiC grains from Murchison meteorite.  Instrumentation:  Figure 1 shows a schematic view of the multi-turned TOF-SIMS developed at Osaka University. This mass spectrometer consists of a Focused Ion Beam (FIB) system with a liquid metal Ga ion source, a femto-second laser for post-ionization of sputtered neutrals, a MULti-Turned time-of-flight Mass spectrometer (MULTUM) and MicroChannel Plate (MCP) detector. Whole system of this instrument was originally designed by Ishihara et al. [5]. We adopted a Ga ion gun of a FIB system (SMI3050, SII NanoTechnology Inc., Tokyo, Japan) as a primary ion beam for sputtering. The acceleration energy of 69, 71Ga+ was 30 kV, and of maximum current density was 30 A/cm2. The lateral resolution of secondary electron image was 4 nm at 30 kV. The primary ion beam is chopped into packets (1 kHz) in accordance with timing of pulsed femto-second laser.    Fig.1 Schematic view of multi-turned TOF SIMS with a femto-second laser.  We adopt a femto-second laser system (Solstice, Spectra Physics Inc.) as a high-efficiency post-ionization of sputtered neutral atoms and molecules. The laser produced a 40 fs pulse width at 780nm. The pulse energy was 3.5 mJ and the repetition rate was 1 kHz. In order to achieve high secondary yield, the femto-second laser was focused (diameter: 150 µm) and irradiates the sputtered particle’s plume c.a. 300 µm just above the sample surface. Then, particles were ionized by nonresonant multiphoton ionization scheme which enable to ionize various elements simultaneously [5]. The ionized atoms and molecular in this way are injected into the mass analyzer. MULTUM is the mass analyzer originally designed at Osaka University [10]. It performed ultrahigh mass resolving power of 250000 (full-width at half maximum: FWHM) after a flight pass length of 1500 m (1200 flight cycles) [11]. In this study, we set mass resolution about 5000. It is noted that one of the merits of TOF mass spectrometer is to measure the various elements simultaneously. This is a great advantage for the analysis of the scarce and fine particles. Finally, the ionized particles were analyzed by MCP detector. The amplified analogue MCP output was sampled by a digital oscilloscope (Wave Runner 104MXi, LeCroy; maximum sampling rate was 10 GS/s).   1958.pdf

Experiments and Results: Figure 2 shows a correlation between the laser power density and the multiplication factor of secondary ion signal (in comparison with those without the post-ionization). Here, sample is the Pb-plate. Although it was known that secondary signal intensity saturates around 1014 W/m2 [5-6], we found that multiplication factor again increases drastically in the range larger than 1014 W/m2 (0.4 PW/m2 in Fig 2), which corresponds to Keldysh parameter of 0.4. We currently attain the multiplication factor of c.a. 10000.  Fig 2. Correlation between Laser Power Density and Secondary Ion Intensity. Under this analytical condition, we tried to analyze the presolar SiC grains collected from Murchison meteorite. Figure 3 shows the wide-range mass spectra of presolar SiCs from 15 to 200 Da. This is an advantage of TOF spectra that can attain to measure the various element simultaneously, although most of mass peaks are originated from systematic peaks from instrumentation itself such as Ga ion source and residual atmosphere in the vacuum chamber.   Fig 3. Wide range Mass spectra of Presolar SiCs Then, we carefully investigated the Si peaks of which masses are 28, 29 and 30 Da and successfully detected isotopic anomaly of Si of a few hundreds permil that are consistent of those of typical mainstream SiC [4].  At the conference, we will discuss advantage and/or disadvantage of current system of multi-turn TOFSIMS with a femto-second laser and future prospects.
