THE MARTIAN NORTH POLAR WATER CYCLE.  A. J. Brown1 and W.M. Calvin2 , P. Becerra3, S. Byrne3,1SETI Institute, 189 N.

We have identified regions and periods of 'net de position' and 'net sublimation' on the summer north polar cap. Regions of the cap undergo a 'mode flip' fromsublimation to deposition mode and the timing ofmode flips is latitude dependent. We show how thisprocess explains late summer brightening of the northpolar cap.Methods: The Compact Reconnaissance ImagingSpectrometer for Mars (CRISM) is a visible to near-infrared spectrometer on the MRO spacecraft that is sensitive to near infrared (NIR) light from ~0.39 to~3.9μm [1]. The MARs Color Imager (MARCI) is asuper wide angle, fish eye lens camera with 1024 pixels-wide CCD [2]. As in previous studies of the springtime recessions of the north and south poles [3,4] weproduced 1000x1000 pixel mosaics of all the CRISMmapping data available for each summer two week period (equivalent to one period in the MRO planning cycle). We used MARCI images to track visual changesand cloud activity during the summer period to ensureatmospheric effects did not affect our observations.H2O index: We tracked the variations in the H2Oindex [4-6] over the parts of the cap that receivedCRISM coverage throughout the summer period overfour Mars Years. The index is based on the depth of thewater ice 1.5μm absorption band. It is high when waterice is present, and grows with the water ice grain size.When deposition of fine grained ice occurs, the H2Oindex decreases, because finer grained ice scatters lightback to the observer more readily and in turn decreasesthe depth of the 1.5μm H2O absorption band [7]. Previous work on brightening of the north polarcap albedo: A long standing problem of the Martianclimate is the summer brightening of the north polarcap. This was first reported by Kieffer [8] using IRTMdata, and subsequently observed with TES by Titus andKieffer [9]. Bass and Paige [10] used Viking IR thermal mapper (IRTM) and Mars Atmospheric Water Detector (MAWD) measurements to determine the peakamount of water vapor above the north polar cap. Theyfound that the lowest visible albedo was observed between Ls=93-103 and water vapor was released afterLs=103. They found the visible albedo increased afterLs=103, and the temperatures were too warm for re-de  Figure 1 – Changes in H2O index for MY28 showing netdeposition in red colors and net sublimation in blue.

They suggested that the center ofthe cap would be an area of preferred deposition of H2Oice because it was colder than the rest of the cap. Theypresented a model of the NPRC ice cap as a cold trapfor water vapor. Under this model, sublimation of water ice during spring and summer builds up water vaporin the atmosphere until Ls=103, after which time thewater vapor is deposited as fine grained H 2O ice accumulated on top of the cap, as temperatures cool in latesummer.Results: Using the comprehensive, multiple yearvisible and near infrared mosaic dataset supplied bythe MRO spacecraft, we have been able to confirm andextend the Bass and Paige model for water depositionon the North polar cap. We have also established forthe first time the summer cycle of water ice absorptionband signatures on the north polar cap.Variations in H2O index: Figure 1 shows four H2Omosaics from Mars Year 28 that show the deposition orsublimation of water ice for that two week period astracked by changes in the H2O index.

periphery where water ice is undergoing net sublimation and red in the interior where the cap is undergoingnet deposition of water ice over this time period.'Mode flips': We also show that in a key region inthe interior of the north polar cap, the absorption banddepths grow until Ls=130, as reported in [5], followedby a period when they begin to shrink, until they areobscured at the end of summer by the north polar hood(Figure 2). This behavior is transferable over the entirenorth polar cap, where in late summer regions 'flip'from being net sublimating into net condensation modeas the weather cool (Figure 3). This transition or 'modeflip' happens earlier for regions closer to the pole, andlater for regions close to the periphery of the cap. Forsome parts of the periphery of the cap, there are re gions where water ice absorption band depths have notbeen observed to decrease over the time we have ob served them, suggesting that they may remain in netsublimation mode during the entire summer season andonly go into condensation mode in winter.Figure 2 shows individual spectra at 'Point B', a re gion on Gemini Lingula, the 'tongue' of the north polarcap. These spectra show that this region undergoes a'mode flip' around Ls=130.Total deposition of water ice during summer.Under the assumption that the shrinking of grain sizesis all due to the deposition of fine grained water ice,we have approximated the total amount of water icedeposited on the cap each summer, which equates to 70microns of deposition over the Ls=132-168 late summer period. This amount is considerably more than the~6 microns of deposition of water ice on the south polar cap during the summer period as reported in [11].Conclusions: We have used CRISM mapping observations of the Martian north polar cap to quantifythe deposition of water ice in summer. We have ana lyzed changes in albedo and water absorption bandmaps for the entire north polar region as a function ofspace and time. We identify 'net deposition' and 'netcondensation' regions and periods and present a unifiedmodel of how these regions change over the course ofan entire Martian boreal summer. These two identifiedmodes are illustrated in Figure 3.Figure 2 – CRISM MSP spectra over Ls=90-156 periodon Gemini Lingula, showing a 'mode flip' reversing the NIRalbedo decrease to increasing after Ls=130.Figure 3 – Cartoon representation of deposition/sublimation 'mode flips'. Dates given are relevant for the GeminiLingula region (where the arrows point in the right image).Take home messages: 1. We have identified regions and periods of 'net deposition' and 'net sublimation' on the Martian summer north polar cap.2. Regions of the cap undergo a 'mode flip' fromsublimation to deposition mode and the timing ofmode flips is latitude dependent. Subtle discrepanciesbetween the expected and observed latitudinal dependence remain for future investigation and will be discussed at the conference.3. Studies such as this one have revealed the pathforward for science studies into the transport of waterin the Martian climate cycle. Using CRISM andMARCI, we have now quantified the annual spring andsummer amounts of water ice deposition for both polesby direct observation. These figures are crucial to ourunderstanding of the construction and ongoing stabilityof the caps under today's climate. However, there is aclear and pressing need to understand the fall and win ter 'dark side' of the Martian polar region that is impenetrable to passive instruments like CRISM and MARCIand instead requires multi-wavelength lidar instruments such as the recently proposed ASPEN concept[12].References: [1] Murchie, S. et al (2007) JGR 112doi:10.1029/2006JE002682 [2] Malin, M.C. et al. 2001JGR 106 17651 [3] Brown A.
