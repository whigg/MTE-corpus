Introduction:  Cosmogenic nuclide studies of lunar and Martian meteorites have contributed significantly to our understanding of these objects.  By measuring a combination of cosmogenic stable- and radionuclides, it is possible to determine a number of important properties of those meteorites. Most lunar meteorites have complex cosmic ray exposure histories, having been exposed both at some depth on the lunar surface (2π irradiation) before their ejection and as small bodies in space (4π irradiation) during transport from the Moon to the Earth. On the other hand, we have not yet observed evidence of complex exposure history for Martian meteorites. These exposures were then followed by residence on Earth's surface, a time commonly referred to as the terrestrial ages. In addition to their complement of galactic cosmic ray (GCR) produced nuclides, some lunar and Martian meteorites contain nuclides produced by solar cosmic rays (SCR). Unraveling the complex history of these objects requires the measurement of at least four cosmogenic nuclides. The specific goals of these measurements are to constrain or set limits on the following shielding or exposure parameters: (1) the depth of the sample at the time of ejection from the Moon or Mars; (2) the transit time (4π exposure age) from ejection off the lunar or Martian surface to the time of capture by the Earth; (3) the terrestrial residence time; and (4) the SCR effect and atmospheric ablation history. The sum of the transit time and residence time yields an ejection age. The ejection age in conjunction with the sample depth on the Moon or Mars can then be used to model impact and ejection mechanisms. We report here results for the cosmogenic radionuclides, 10Be (half-life=1.36x106 yr), 26Al (7.05x105 yr), 36Cl (3.01x105 yr), and 14C (5,730 yr) in a new lunar meteorite, Oued Awlitis 001 (OA 001) and a Martian meteorite, Northwest Africa 10134 (NWA 10134). High SCR effects are observed in both meteorites. Sample Description:  OA 001 is a very fresh anorthositic melt lunar meteorite with a pale yellow-brown, translucent fusion crust [1, 2]. OA 001 consists of two pieces (382 and 50.5 g) that fit exactly onto one stone having an approximate size of 7.7x6.6x3.5 cm. We received 304 mg for cosmogenic nuclide studies. This sample had exposed fusion crust. The thickness of our sample is ~3 mm including fusion crust. NWA 10134 is a small disk-shaped stone (4x4x1 cm) and completely covered by black fusion crust [3]. The recovered mass is 25.4 g. NWA 10134 is an enriched mafic shergottite [3]. We received a 381 mg of piece, with fusion crust, for cosmogenic nuclide studies. The maximum distance from fusion crust is less than 3 mm. Experimental Procedures:  10Be, 26Al, and 36Cl measurements. To eliminate weathering products, each sample was etched twice with 0.2 N HNO3 solution in an ultrasonic bath for 10 minutes. The weight loss was found to be 5.3% for OA 001 and 5.8% for NWA 10134 respectively. Each sample was then dissolved in an HF-HNO3 mixture along with Be and Cl carriers. After taking aliquot for chemical analysis by ICP-OES, Al and Mn carriers were added. Be, Al, Cl, and Mn were chemically separated and purified for AMS measurements.  The AMS measurements for these nuclides were performed at the PRIME lab, Purdue University [4]. 14C measurements.  Each sample was pretreated with 85% H3PO4 to remove weathering products, which are typical of meteorites recovered in this environment. The residue was then washed and dried before melting in a flow of oxygen to recover 14CO2 in presence of a dead-C carrier. The AMS measurements for 14C were performed at the University of Arizona NSF-AMS facility [5]. Results and Discussion:  Major chemical compositions of OA 001 and NWA 10134 are shown in Table 1 along with Northwest Africa 482 (NWA 482) for comparison (see below). Cosmogenic radionuclides, 10Be, 26Al, 36Cl, and 14C concentrations (dpm/kg) of OA 001 and NWA 10134 as well as NWA 482 are shown in Table 2. Oued Awlitis 001.  The concentrations of 10Be and 36Cl, and their nuclide ratios, in OA 001 indicate that the observed radionuclides are produced by 4π irradiation in space during transition from the Moon to Earth [e. g., 6]. The high 14C activity in OA 001 indicates SCR production. The excess 14C in OA 001 is 43±15 dpm/kg, assuming a 4π GCR production rate of 65 atom 14C/min/kg. If this excess 14C was produced by SCR, the production must have occurred at a depth of less than 1 g/cm2 in the preatmospheric body of OA 001; the ablation depth must be less than 3 mm [e. g., 5]. The existence a large amount of SCR produced 14C suggests that the size of the recovered meteorite is  nearly the same as its preatmospheric size, independent of whether it was a 2π or the 4π exposure. The 4π production rate of 10Be at near surface of OA 001 is calculated to be ~18 atom/min/kg based on the chemical composition of OA 001 and a radius of 3-4 cm [e. g., 7].  The 10Be 4π exposure age of OA 001 is 0.30±0.02 Myr. Using this exposure age, the saturation value of 26Al in OA 001 is 343±20 dpm/kg. After accounting for the GCR production near the surface, ~65 atom/min/kg (3-4 cm radius), OA 001 has an 26Al excess of ~280 dpm/kg - this must be have been produced by SCR at depth of ~1 g/cm2 [8]. The preatmospheric depth inferred from SCR-produced 26Al is in good agreement with the ablation estimation using SCRproduced 14C. Many lunar meteorites have SCR effects, but OA 001 is notable in having such a high concentration of SCR products. OA 001, along with Calcalong Creek [9] are at the upper end of SCR-produced nuclides among lunar meteorites. The ejection depth of OA 001 is >800 g/cm2 on the Moon. Wittmann et al. [2] suggested that OA 001 might be launch paired with NWA 482, which has similar texture and compositional properties. We assign NWA 482 a 4π exposure age of 0.9±0.2 Myr and a terrestrial age of 60-120 kyr [10].  The dissimilarity in ejection ages indicates that OA 001 and NWA 482 are not launch-paired. NWA 10134.  The high 26Al and 14C in NWA 10134 are certainly due to SCR production as in OA 001. The ablation depth is less than 1 g/cm2. The cosmogenic nuclide production rate of NWA 10134 is difficult to estimate due to the small preatmospheric size and disk-shape (4x4x1 cm). Our best estimation of the 10Be production rate is ~16 atom/min/kg so its 10Be exposure age would be 3.0±0.2 Myr. This age is matches other enriched mafic shergottites. We could not calculate terrestrial ages of either OA 001 or NWA 10134 because of the high SCR-produced 14C, but it must be much short since there is no significant decay of 14C. The atmospheric entry velocity and/or entry angle of lunar and Martian meteorites must have been much lower to retain SCR produced nuclides. It interesting that we have found SCR effects in more than 11 lunar meteorites and 8 Martian meteorites but only several ordinary chondrites. Although we have observed SCR produced 26Al in many lunar and Martian meteorites, this is the first time we observed SCR produced 14C in these meteorites. Acknowledgements: We thank A.
