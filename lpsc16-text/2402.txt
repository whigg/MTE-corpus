These satellites were imaged by NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft as it flew through the system in July 2015 [1]. Most imagery was obtained with the LOng Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) framing camera, with addition images during close encounter taken by the Multispectral Visual Imaging Camera (MVIC) pushbroom imager in the Ralph instrument. Nix and Hydra are larger than the other two and were discovered before the imaging sequence was planned, and were thus imaged more often than Styx and Kerberos. We will present initial shape models and rotational poles for the four small satellites. Fitting Methods:  We initially fit the rotational periods of the small satellites using only approach photometry [2]. We then simultaneously fit the shape and rotation for each of the objects, holding the period constant. We used a custom rendering code that precisely simulated the camera performance, including the pointspread function. We used the same renderer, but summing the images, to forward-model the lightcurve. The renderer calculates the luminosity for each polygon using the bidirectional reflectance formalism of [3]. No surface roughness was assumed for initial fits, but can be incorporated in the future. We assumed that the satellites had a fixed rotational pole and period during the encounter, and we parameterized the shapes using the octantoid formalism of [4]. This formalism is especially useful because its lowest order shape perfectly describes a triaxial ellipsoid.  Styx: New Horizons obtained only a single epoch of resolved images for Styx, but a rich set of unresolved photometry was obtained for several months during the approach to Pluto. We attempted to fit all these data using an ellipsoidal shape model for Styx. The best fit ellipsoid is 19 km along the long axis and an approximate axis ratio a:c ≈ 2:1. This fit is inclined 90° to Pluto’s pole. However, this is not a perfect fit to the photometry, and so has room for future refinement. Nix:   Nix was the best-imaged of the four small satellites, with a day-side flyby that passed through near-opposition (6°) and images up to 300 meter/pixel resolution. In addition, Nix was bright enough that we could extract photometry from both the hazards search images and optical navigation images with shorter exposure times. In addition to the LORRI images, New Horizons obtained a panchromatic MVIC image of Nix at closest approach (at 450 meters/pixel). These images showed a prolate body with an elliptical profile. Our current best-fit shape for Nix is a slightly elongated body with a triangular cross-section. The pole of Nix is inclined 123° to Pluto’s pole, making it both retrograde and extremely susceptible to precession and perturbations from Charon. These perturbations could explain the apparent ≈10% change in the rotational period of Nix seen between the New Horizons flyby and earlier Hubble Space Telescope observations [2]. Kerberos:  New Horizons obtained two resolved epochs of Kerberos in addition to approach photometry. In the images, Kerberos appears to be a very elongated prolate body. Both these images and the lightcurve fit very well to ellipsoid with major axis 19.5 km long and an approximate axis ratio a:c ≈ 2:1. The best-fit pole for Kerberos is inclined 96° to Pluto’s pole, with a rotation period that is slower than the other small satellites, but still much faster than the orbital period. Hydra:  Hydra is a similar size and brightness to Nix, and thus has similar photometric coverage. However, Hydra was on the opposite side of Pluto to Nix and was therefore imaged at a lower resolution, with the best images at 1.1 km/pixel. Those best images were obtained as part of a mosaic, and Hydra appeared in the overlap of four images, producing three fullbody images, and one clipped. Unfortunately for shape modeling, Hydra can be seen to rotate in the mosaic images without much change in apparent shape, implying that it was being viewed pole-on. When combined with the complex shape that is apparent in these best images, the viewing geometry of Hydra makes fitting its shape very difficult. Preliminary shape models for Hydra indicate a flattened body with approximate dimensions 65 x 45 x 25 km. Hydra’s pole appears to be inclined 100-120° to Pluto’s pole. However, both the shape and pole are still very poorly constrained. References: [1] Stern S.A. et al. (2015) Science, 350, 292–300. [2] Showalter, M.R. et al. (2015) DPS 47, Abstract #102.09.
