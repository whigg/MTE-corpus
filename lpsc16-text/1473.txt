Introduction: Gamma ray spectrometers (GRS) have been used to map the elemental compositions of the surface materials of Mercury, the Moon and Mars [1-9].  The first Lunar GRS Th, K, and Fe maps were produced by the Apollo 15 and 16 missions, however, they provide only limited coverage of the lunar surface [10]. Since 1998, global maps detailing the elemental abundance of naturally radioactive elements (such as Th) and major refractory elements (such as Fe, Ca, Ti) have been constructed using data from Lunar Prospector, Kaguya, and Change-2 GRS  [2-4, 7], and are already released to the public.   Here, we present an investigation of the Si distribution based on the 4934 keV Si gamma ray peak (Fig. 1) due to the thermal neutron interaction 28Si(n,)29Si, which occurs between galactic cosmic rays and surface material containing Si. Our results are the first to detect Si concentrations at global scale similar to those discovered in lunar samples. Methodology: These types of remote-sensing spectral measurements allow to characterize the dominant elemental composition of the upper tens of centimeters of surface materials over the area of a given footprint. We processed Kaguya GRS data using the gamma ray data analysis program Aquarius developed by IRAP (The Research Institute in Astrophysics and Planetology, CNRS, France) using a grid of 10 degrees in longitude and latitude.  4900 49504850 Energy (keV) Si (4934 keV) Figure 1. Gamma-ray peak for the 4934 keV Si using  Aquarius program developed by IRAP Gamma ray emission at 4934 keV is proportional to the Si abundance of the surface material; however, the neutron intensity on the lunar surface also has an influence on the line strength. Hence, a correction of the KGRS Si data for the emission of low energy neutrons (< 0.1 eV) was performed that were first characterized by Lunar Prospector [11]. We also took into account the topography dependence of the thermal neutron flux [12]. Firstly, a Si peak analysis was accomplished by the Aquarius program and then, GRS data were corrected for altitude and thermal neutron density as mentioned above. Finally, a normalization process was performed using archived Si data of samples returned by the Apollo program (Fig. 2 & 3). 5 10 15 20 25 30 Si (% )BX Maximum MBAS Average MBAS Minimum MBS Maximum S&RB Average S&RB Minimum S&RB Maximum BX Average Figure 2. Si abundance wt% (Y axis) obtained by various samples. MBAS, S&RB, and BX are mare basalts, soil and regolith breccias, and polymict breccias, respectively. AMET refers to Antarctic lunar meteorites. Highland rocks are listed by individual rock type name as anorthosite, norite, and troctolite (data from [13]).  Linear regression model of Si based on M3 spectral reflectance mosaic [14]: For the Si linear regression model using spectral parameters, the continuum slopes, band depths, widths and minimum wavelengths of the absorption troughs near 1 µm and 2 µm were computed for a latitude range from 60°S to 60°N. These regression models were used to construct nearly global cpm (count per minute) maps of Si with a resolution of 20 pixels per degree.    Figure 3. Si calibration curves used to obtain a conversion to wt% of cpm values as derived from regression analysis between M³ spectral parameters and original KGRS cpm data. Sample-based abundances were taken according to [16] from the six Apollo and three Luna sample-return landing sites. The regression-based cpm Si map was used for calibration to the elemental abundances inferred in [16] which are based on returned lunar samples for the nine Apollo and Luna sample return sites. The small range of Si abundances of only a few wt% across the landing sites did not allow for a robust estimate of both parameters of the linear calibration curve, so that we used a linear calibration curve with zero intercept. Latitudes beyond ±60° were excluded due to the low signal-tonoise ratio of the M³ data at high latitudes. The Si abundances estimated with our method are systematically higher than the LP GRS Si data [12] but are consistent with typical Si abundances of lunar basalt samples (in the maria) and feldspathic mineral samples (in the highlands) as given in [13]. The construction of a nearly global map of lunar Si abundances has been achieved by a combination of regression-based analysis of KGRS cpm data and M3 spectral reflectance data, and it includes a calibration with respect to returned samplebased wt% values.  This study shows that the Si abundance on the Moon ranges from about 17 to 28 wt% (Fig. 4). Further investigation is needed to determine whether locally high Si abundances of around 30 wt% are due to calibration artifacts.  Figure 4. Si distribution obtained by a combined regression-based analysis of KGRS data and M3 spectral reflectance data superimposed on shaded relief data derived from LRO LOLA [17].  Highland terrains have a higher Si content (24-28 wt%) when compared to mare regions (17-21 wt%) consisting of mafic rocks and intermediate surface types (20-24 wt%).  Figure 5. Latitudinal density plot of the lunar Si distribution between 60°S (left) to 60°N (right). Each data point represents a grid cell of 0.05 x 0.05 degree. Point density is measured within a 0.5° latitude by 0.1 wt% neighborhood.  Lunar samples obtained by the Apollo program show significant variations in the contents of Si, with the widest range documented for the Apollo 17 samples [13]. The Si abundance exhibits an asymmetric distribution between the northern and southern hemisphere (Fig. 5). The Si map obtained by Kaguya GRS will provide an important aspect in both understanding mineralogical distribution and evolution of the lunar surface since its formation.
