THERE IS FLOWING WATER IN STREAKS IN GUSEV CRATER ON MARS.  T. A. Krupa,chlorophylgreenrevelation12.14@gmail.comIntroduction:  There are a tremendous number of dark streaks in the region where the Spirit rover landed in Gusev crater on Mars. The streaks  are  on the order of about 1.5 km long and 40 m wide. The   SAGA   computer   Geographic   Information System (GIS) was used to analyze some of the streaks in   Gusev.   HIRISE   image   PSP_001513_1655   ­   the Columbia   Hills   region   ­   was   used   along   with   the corresponding  DEM   that   specifies   ground   elevation (altitude) coordinates for each pixel in the image. 3D images   of   streaks   were   made   by   draping   the   25 cm/pixel HIRISE image over a 3D terrain mesh created from   the   corresponding   1m/pixel   DEM.  Results: All the analyzed streaks gave similar results. The following results are for the streak that's directly to the left of the Spirit rover landing site.A GIS slope analysis shows that terrain inside the streak slopes at a greater angle than terrain outside the streak.Fig. 1  Terrain inside streak slopes at a greater angle.A GIS profile curvature analysis shows that terrain inside   the   streak   is  more   concave   and   convex   than terrain outside the streak - there are sharper peaks and valleys within the streak.Fig.2 Terrain in streak has sharper peaks and  valleys.  There are numerous small mounds in the streak. The mounds are on the order of about 0.5 meters high and     12  meters  wide.  The  mounds   aren't   visible   in normal images. But they can be seen in 3D images if the terrain height is stretched. In the following images the terrain height is exaggerated by a factor of 40.Fig. 3   3D image of top portion of streak1685.pdf

Many mounds in the streak have dark peaks; and dark linear features extend from the dark peaks down toward the base of the mounds.   Fig.4  Dark peaks and downward oriented linear features A computer GIS channel network algorithm with parallel processing was used to determine if the dark linear features on the mounds could have been formed by flowing water. The algorithm detected the pathways where water would flow if  water was present  in  the streak.   The   channel   analysis   revealed   water   flow channels   that  are   superimposed  on  these  dark  linear features on  the  mounds  ­  as   seen  in   this  animation: https://anonmgur.com/up/a0306e35ab58ba4786cb2a24d93b5562.gifFig.5 Channels co­localize with dark linear features   The   close   correlation   between   the   shapes   and positions  of   the  water   flow channels  and  the  shapes and positions of the dark linear features indicates that the dark linear features  on the mounds were formed by flowing water.It   is  possible that  the mounds are pingos.  Pingos are   found   on   Earth   in   the   far   North   where   the temperature is often below freezing. Pingos are formed from repeated freezing and thawing of water saturated soil in contact with underground ice. In warm weather the ice in the soil can melt and flow down the mounds eroding channels into their sides.      The dark shade of the streaks is mainly due to the dark peaks and dark water flow channels on the mounds.  A Mars Express/HSRC true color image [1] shows that most of the streaks in this region are green. This means that the dark peaks and dark water flow channels on the mounds are really green.
