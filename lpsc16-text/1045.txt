NEW RECORD IN 2015 FOR NOCTILUCENT CLOUD DETECTION WITH COMBINATION OF DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY AND MOBILITY. Mark S. Zalcik(1), Michael P. Noble(2), Austin A.

The observers in question, MN and MZ, had widely-differing totals: 30 active nights for MN, who traveled and conducted digital photography, and 11 for MZ, who observed from a more narrowly-situated set of observing sites and photographed NLC less frequently.  During the 2015 NLC season a new record was achieved, with the respective totals being 44 and 19, respectively.  Amazingly, the network-wide NLC CAN AM observing network total active nights for all of North America was 50, with MN noting NLC on 44 of those nights!  The high level of activity as witnessed by MN was partly due to much more favourable weather in 2015 compared with 2012.  MN's active-night total in 2014 was only 20 nights, the season being plagued by poor weather.  As with 2012 and 2014, MN traveled extensively outside Edmonton to obtain clear skies when tropospheric conditions in Edmonton were unfavourable.  The area encompassing the alternate sites in 2015 was approximately 24 000 square km.   Overall, 2015 was an above average year for NLC incidence, but many of the displays were faint, such feeble displays being more easily detectable with a digital camera compared with the naked eye.  Photographic data from the AUGO 2 camera at the Athabasca University Geophysical Observatory, part of the global network of groundbased digital cameras (Dalin et al., 2008), indicate a record year as well, with 32 active nights.  Record highs were also established by the automated cameras at Vilnius, Lithuania, 35,  and Novosibirsk, Russia, 32 (P. Dalin, pers. comm.).  The observations of MN suggest that many NLC occurrences may be visible to ground-based observers, but perhaps a large proportion of the displays are too faint to be easily seen with the naked eye.  Also, any one observing site is at the mercy of the local weather, and so efforts to take weather out of the equation by driving to clearer skies seem to meet with favourable results.
