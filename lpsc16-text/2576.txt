 PLANETARY LEARNING THAT ADVANCES THE NEXUS OF ENGINEERING, TECHNOLOGY, AND SCIENCE. M. P. Milazzo1,?; J. Clark2; R. Anderson1; T. Gaither1; R.G. Vaughan1. 1USGS Astrogeology Science Center; 2Northern Arizona University; ?(moses@usgs.gov) Introduction: Planetary Learning that Advances the Nexus of Engineering, Technology, and Science (PLANETS) was selected as one of 27 projects to support the NASA Science Mission Directorate Science Education Cooperative Agreement Notice (SE-CAN) [1]. Our goal is to to develop and disseminate out-of-school time (OST) curricular and related educator professional development modules that integrate planetary science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. We have created a partnership between planetary science subject matter experts (SMEs), curriculum developers, science and engineering teacher professional development experts, and OST teacher networks. The PLANETS team includes the Center for Science Teaching and Learning (CSTL) at Northern Arizona University (NAU); the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Science Center (Astrogeology), and the Boston Museum of Science (MOS). PLANETS aims to increase public awareness and use of NASA resources by creating science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) educational curricula in the context of planetary science. Although the materials developed by PLANETS will be aimed at middle school students, all materials will be made available for free to the public. Alignment with National Standards: PLANETS addresses three national goals of the 2013 Federal STEM Education Strategic Plan (FSESP) [2]: 1. Improve STEM Instruction through professional development for OST educators. 2. Increase and sustain youth and public engagement by providing engaging STEM content for OST experiences. 3. Better serve historically under-represented groups in STEM fields by focusing efforts for dissemination of materials in areas serving underrepresented students. In addition to the alignment with the Federal STEM Education Strategic Plan, PLANETS curricula and activities are aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) [3]; the state-sponsored science and engineering equivalent to the Common Core mathematics and English language arts/literacy standards (Table 1). Teams and Relationships: PLANETS consists of planetary and Earth scientists, science educators, STEM education scientists, engineering curriculum developers, professional developers, and internal and external project evaluators. PLANETS is led by PI, Joëlle G. Clark of CSTL at NAU. The Boston MOS partner is led by Christine Cunningham; USGS Astrogeology Science Center is led by Moses P. Milazzo. This collaboration between teams with experts in all relevant aspects of STEM, STEM education, and STEM educator development will be especially effective. PLANETS leverages existing NASA-supported curriculum development efforts at the MOS by expanding the partnership to strengthen the emphasis on planetary science in their high quality Engineering Adventures (EA) and Engineering Everywhere (EE) curricula and to create additional modules. PLANETS also incorporates experience and data from past, current, and future NASA missions through inclusion of SMEs at Astrogeology who participate in planetary missions. Astrogeology houses one of NASA's Regional Planetary Image Facility (RPIF) nodes, and Collaborator Hagerty at Astrogeology is NASA's RPIF Network director. The RPIF network provides a vast store of historical documents and data sets that may be utilized in the development of PLANETS curricula, and serves as an international avenue for dissemination of PLANETS OST materials. Science Questions: NASA's Planetary Science Division (PSD) asks five fundamental questions [4]: 1. How did the Sun's family of planets and minor bodies originate? 2. How did the solar system evolve to its current diverse state? 3. What are the characteristics of the solar system that led to the origin of life? 4. How did life begin and evolve on Earth and has it evolved elsewhere in the solar system? 5. What are the hazards and resources in the solar system environment that will affect the extension of human presence in space? Each of the OST activities developed will be driven by a realistic motivating question intended to engage students and encourage them to want to learn. For example, NASA/JPL's developing Europa Mission will provide motivating science questions that are timely, relevant, and exciting to learners of all ages. In particular for middle school students, their activities will track engineering and science activities during development of the mission. In this way, middle school students who  Table 1: participate in the PLANETS curriculum based on the Europa Mission will be well aware of the mission and its development throughout their secondary education. These fundamental questions occur at the intersection of many sciences (e.g. astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, geology, and geophysics) and are addressed primarily through spacecraft missions that involve all engineering disciplines (e.g., aerospace, biological, chemical, electrical, mechanical, software, and systems engineering). Understanding of these disciplines requires a strong mathematical background. Thus, the PSD questions logically feed into STEM education. We will develop curricula based on some of these questions. Table 1 provides an example of how these curricula will be developed, the specific curricula to be developed will be presented at the meeting. Evaluations: The proposed work includes pilot studies of the OST curricula, which will solicit feedback from active educators. SMEs on the PLANETS team will also observe OST units in action during evaluation, and will make appropriate revisions to the science and engineering content. Summative evaluation by our partner institution, Magnolia Consulting, will focus on how final curricular and professional development products are being implemented. Open Data: A primary goal of this project is to serve as many children and educators as possible — particularly those from groups under-represented in STEM fields. To do this, ensuring easy, widespread access to the curricula is critical. All units, curricula, and supplemental materials will be made available for free download via the MOS and Astrogeology websites. References: [1] NASA Science Mission Directorate.
