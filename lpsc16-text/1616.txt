Introduction:  The crater size-frequency distributions (CSFDs) of small craters on dark deposits on the Moon were first studied in preparation for the Apollo missions. The subdued appearance of the dark mantling material in Taurus Littrow was interpreted to indicate that it was young [1,2]. This observation was one of the motivations for the selection of Taurus Littrow as the Apollo 17 landing site. However, the glasses collected during the mission and interpreted to originate from the dark mantle deposits (DMDs) have ages similar to fragments of the underlying and adjacent mare basalts (ca. 3.7 Ga)[3]. Thus, [3] proposed that the paucity of craters with diameters <500 m, particularly those with diameters of 100-200 m, must be caused by an abnormally high rate of degradation due to the thick, unconsolidated nature of the DMDs. Indeed, DMDs have decreased radar returns at both 3.8 and 12.6 cm wavelengths compared to adjacent highland and mare units, suggesting that they contain no large rocks (~1-50 cm diameter) for at least 1-5 meters in depth [4-6]. The challenges encountered during the interpretation of the Taurus Littrow (TL) DMD are relevant to CSFD measurements on other possible pyroclastic deposits [7-10]. For example, pyroclastics may be present at both the Compton-Belkovich Volcanic Complex and Lassell Massif based on their morphologic, spectral, and radar characteristics [5,9,11]. However, it is problematic to date small occurrences of these deposits with CSFDs owing to their apparent sensitivity to either degradation and/or target property effects [8,9,12]. At both locations, CSFDs of small craters are subparallel to the nominal equilibrium condition. We interpreted these CSFDs to indicate the influence of a continuous resurfacing process such as mass-wasting, for which pyroclastic deposits would be particularly vulnerable. Because of these challenges, such deposits are often dated indirectly by bracketing the age via CSFD measurement of adjacent stratigraphic units [10,13]. A bracketing approach is also necessary in cases where the DMD may be too thin to have effectively reset the crater chronometer. Approach: We revisit the CSFDs of the TL DMD, using Kaguya Terrain Camera (TC) [14] and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Wide Angle (WAC) and Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) [15] data, because radiometric ages are available for it and its related mare basalts, to serve as ground truth for our investigation. The same area was investigated before and after the Apollo 17 mission [3,16]; however, that work was    Figure 1.

(bottom) Our CSFD measurements are similar to those derived by [3].  done prior to the establishment of a calibrated lunar chronology [17,18]. We used the mare basalt map of [19] to select new count areas within the old mare (unit S5, 3.70±0.04 Ga [19]) surrounding the Apollo 17 landing site, as well as in two adjacent younger mare deposits (units S11, 3.55+0.05-0.09 Ga and S15, 3.44+0.03-0.06 Ga [19]). CSFDs were measured on WAC and TC data sets, with counts on NAC imagery to follow. Radiometric ages of mare basalts at the Apollo 17 landing site are consistent with the absolute model ages of [19], including 3.7-3.8 Ga [20], 3.563.84 Ga [21], and 3.59-3.79 Ga [summarized by 22]. Orange glasses associated with the DMDs [23,24] were determined to be 3.48 to 3.66 Ga [25,26]. Results and Discussion:  Qualitatively, we observed the same morphologies as [3] for the small craters in the DMD: subdued appearance and shallower depths [see also 27]. The dark albedo and subdued crater rims make it challenging to measure the crater diameters on the TC mosaic. Some craters also appear to be partially filled with DMD material and/or basalt flows. Our CSFDs (Fig. 1), are also similar to those presented in Figure 2 of [3]. However, using the lunar chronology [17], we are able to fit ages and provide a refined interpretation of the origins of the differently sloped portions of the CSFDs. Our analyses suggest that the apparent deficit of small craters on the DMD is caused by two effects. First, the DMD is older than the surrounding mare, and seems to overlie an even older mare unit with an age of 3.83 Ga (Fig. 2). Because the DMD is older, equilibrium is achieved at larger crater diameters (~250 m) than for the younger mare. The youngest adjacent mare (S11), which exhibits a 3.17 Ga age in our work, has a production population down to ~140 m diameters. Thus, the CSFDs of the units have different slopes over different diameter ranges, so that they cross at crater diameters of ~150 m. Second, the level of saturation reached in the equilibrated branch of each area is different likely due to the faster degradation of craters in the DMD with respect to the adjacent mare surfaces, as suggested by [3]. An interesting new result of applying the calibrated lunar chronology is that a resurfacing event at 3.63 Ga can be fit in the S5 NW count area (Fig. 2). This resurfacing age is consistent with the radiometric age of the orange glass sampled by Apollo 17. Using the method of [28], we estimate the thickness of the DMD and its overlying regolith at the S5 NW count area to be ~2640 m. This is consistent with an estimate of 20 m by [3], and the inference of [6] that the western part of the mantle deposit is thicker than at the landing site (10-14 m for DMD plus regolith [29-31]). Implications:  Our study indicates that it is possible to derive reliable absolute model ages from thick DMD deposits that are consistent with radiometric ages of nearby samples. Thin DMDs are more problematic and may require bracketing to constrain their ages [10,13]. As part of our ongoing study, we will measure CSFDs on thinner areas of the TL DMD to investigate the effects of deposit thickness on the interpretation of  CSFDs and absolute model ages.
