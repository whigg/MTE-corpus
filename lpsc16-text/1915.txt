Ionospheric perturbations at 100700 km were recorded by GPS tomography, vertical ionospheric sounders network and by SuperDarn stations. The equivalent of CMB is estimated as 500(±100) kT TNT [1]. According to tomography evidence the electron density was disturbed within 200700 km at 0639UT at 51-57°N along 40°E [2]. Intense TEC perturbations were reported from GPS stations Nizhniy Novgorod, Ekaterinburg, Novosibirsk, Norilsk, Irkutsk and Alma-Ata within 0600-1000UT. Perevalova et al. [3] have presented the results of GPS ionospheric measurements in Ural region that show intense TEC variations within first minutes after CMB or even under the flight stage. In the current work we elaborate the hypothesis of the radiative forcing as the source of such variations. Radiative forcing model: The process of the radiative forcing from the bolide on the lower ionosphere was not taken into account in the past. Our analysis of the evidence allows to implement rather simple physical model estimating the disturbances in the lower ionosphere caused by enhanced radiation. The model includes following physical processes: drag and ablation of the meteor in the atmosphere [4,5], gasdynamics of vaporized meteor substance and ambient air as well. The latter was simulated as a sequence of multiple serial cylindrical explosions. Each explosion was considered within the framework of 1D cylindrical radiation gasdynamics equations.  Further processes under analysis include the far distance  thermal radiation transfer in standard atmosphere ATMCIRA and, finally, the excitation of the lower ionosphere described by 22 components plasmachemical model, including the set of minor short-lived constituents [6]. Thermodynamical and optical properties were calculated for bolide substance assumed to be LLhondrite (chemical mixture on the base of 16 elements Fe-O-Mg-Si-C-N-H-S-Al-Ca-Na-K-Ti-Cr-Mn-Ni) [7].  First verification of the model was evaluated on the luminosity curves in visible range (ground-based observations) and in IR range (satellite observations).  Calculations were carried out for the body flight stage from 60 km to 30 km altitudes.  The setup of simulation was as follows: total energy was 500 kT TNT, trajectory declination is 17°, initial velocity is 20 km/sec, initial radius is 10 meters. Under these assumptions the total flash energy in our model  is 5.5⋅1012 J,  with 3.1⋅1012 J in visible range (1.1÷3.1 eV). The last one coincides well with the magnitude 3.7⋅1012 J estimated from satellite [1]. In IR range (0.03÷1.1 eV) the radiation flux on the ground was 3.7 kW/m2 from our model and it is 3.6 kW/m2 in satellite measurements [1].  In Fig. 1 we present the comparison of luminosity curves (in relative units) estimated at various ground   Fig. 1 Comparison of simulation light curves (lines) and observation data digitized from [8] (circles).

points [8] with the results of simulation. Circles denote measurements, lines – simulation (red – Beloretzk, blue – Kurgan).   Spatio-temporal variations of the electron density were calculated at altitudes 90-150 km in the region with size 400 km along the trajectory and 300 km across the trajectory. In Fig. 2 the time distribution of TEC variation (in TECU) along the body trajectory is presented. It is clear that the radiative forcing from the CMB significantly disturbs the lower ionosphere. The maximal simulated ∆TEC (0.15 TECU) coincides very well with GPS measurements in Ural region (~ 0.15 TECU) [3].  Fig. 3-6 summarize the spatio-temporal distributions of energy flux and TEC perturbation. The residual between energy deposition and TEC local maxima we explain by solar terminator effect.   Summary:  It is shown that ionospheric perturbations over the ground zero of Chelyabinsk meteor blast (CMB) have been caused by enhanced radiative forcing on the ionosphere. The elaborated model gives the luminosity curve coinciding with the experimental one.  TEC perturbations have been calculated under lower ionosphere plasma-chemical model with encouraging agreement with TEC measurements too, even without dynamical processes. References:  [1] Brown P.
