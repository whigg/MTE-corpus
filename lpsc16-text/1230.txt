Angles of Repose of Granular Beds using a Soft-Sphere Discrete Element Method (SSDEM)Paul Sa´nchez and Daniel J. Scheeres, Colorado Center for Astrodynamics Research, University of Colorado, Boulder,CO 80309-431 (diego.sanchez-lana@colorado.edu)Introduction:During the last decade, SSDEM codes have beenused to investigate the behaviour and evolution ofgranular asteroids and their surfaces as well as theinteractions of the latter with man-made probes andspacecrafts. This codes simulate the motion of particles that interact through soft-potentials when theyoverlap and can reproduce the dynamics of real granular materials with certain limitations. Due to the complexity of simulating non-spherical shapes, most codesdeal only with spherical particles. These particles feela repelling forces that keeps the overlap to a minimum,and also surface-surface frictional forces; additionally,rolling friction attempts to mimic the effect of nonsphericity in their motion. This paper analyzes the effect of the coefficients of dynamic friction and rollingfriction in the angle of repose of a granular bed in orderto better understand their influence in our simulations.These and other numerical experiments are carried outas calibration runs so that we can find the realm ofapplicability of the simulation method and model parameters in the context of small planetary bodies, theirsurfaces and the upcoming sample retrieval missionsto asteroids.Simulation Method:The particles in the SSDEM code that we have used[1, 2, 3] interact through soft potentials and these interactions are of three types: normal, tangential androtational. The first produces normal forces that keepthe particles apart when they overlap. The second isrelated to surface-surface friction and it is essentiallya stick-slip interaction that satisfies the local Coulombyield criterion. The third is similar in form to surfacesurface friction, but it appears as a winding spring thatopposes the relative rotation of particles in contact.Normal Forces: In the SSDEM the motion of theparticles is integrated numerically through the discretization of their equations of motion. The timestep (δt) that is used for this integration depends onthe material parameters of the particles; the harder theparticles, the smaller the time step. During this timestep, each particle is assumed to move under constantforces. When the particles overlap, a repelling force isapplied at the contact point (fn). This force is a function of the overlap and, in spherical particles, it is applied along the line of centres of the overlapping particles. Usually, either linear or hertzian spring-dashpotmodels, with a elastic constant kn, are used [4]. Multiparticle contacts are allowed as well as enduring contacts.Tangential Forces: (Surface-surface friction) Whentwo particles are in contact, in a SSDEM code, they areallowed to slide. However, as frictional forces shouldoppose this motion, a truncated tangential springdashpot system must is implemented. As the initialpoints on contact in each particle move apart due to thelatter’s relative rotation, a spring is stretched. Whenthe restoring force of this tangential spring reaches thevalue µkfn, the frictional force is not increased anylonger so that the local Coulomb criterion is satisfied(µk is the coefficient of dynamic friction) [5].Rolling and Twisting Friction: Rolling and twistingfriction in a SSDEM code are used to mimic the behaviour of non-spherical particles. The implementation is similar to the surface-surface friction method,but instead of a tangential force that produces a torqueon the particle, this kind of friction produces a torquethat opposes rolling or twisting motion. This torque isa function of the particles sizes (reduced radius Rr),their moments of inertia, angularity and, more importantly, their relative rotation. The particles in contactare allowed to rotate relative to one another, but thiswinds a spring that produces a torque that opposes it.When this torque has reached the value µrRrfn whereµr is the rolling friction coefficient, the torque is notincreased anymore and the particle rotates [6].Numerical Experiments:For our experiments we have decided to run a series of simulations to find the influence of µk and µrin the dynamic and static angles of repose. The formeris the maximum angle at which the granular bed canbe tilted before the onset of an avalanche, the latter isthe slope that results when the avalanche has stopped.In our simulations we use a granular bed formed by30000 spherical particles with a size range between 6and 13 mm. These particles have a density of 2500kg m−3 and are contained in a box of 20x50 at its baseand 60cm high. The particles that touch the base of thebox are randomly distributed and glued to it. The beditself has a height of ≈ 17 cm. Initially the particlesare placed inside the box, given a random initial velocity and let fall under a 1g gravitational field, withoutfriction. The value of µk and µr are varied between 0and 1 in steps of 0.1. In total, we have ran 121 sets ofparameters. Cohesive forces were not added in thesesimulations to limit the size of the parameter space.To find the static angle of repose we need to inclinea box with periodic boundary conditions. As studiedby [7], friction between the particles and the walls canincrease angle at which granular flow starts.1230.pdf

We mimic the inclination of the box by changing thedirection of gravity; this change happens in steps of 3◦every second. When the dynamic angle of repose hasbeen reached, the particles flow continuously and donot stop. As a test, we also ran some simulations inwhich the inclination was continuously changed at aconstant rate of 5◦ per second (not in steps); these simulations rendered results with greater precision whenanalyzed together with the original results.Figure 1: Granular bed in a box with periodic boundaries. µk = 0.5 and µr = 0. The images show theparticles when they have started to flow and a secondafter, when the flow has been stablished.Fig. 1 shows images of one of our simulations(µk = 0.5, µr = 0). Fig. 1 (top) shows the granular bed as the particles have just passed the static angleof repose and start to flow. Fig. 1 (bottom) shows thebed with a fully developed granular flow. The imagesshow the motion of the particles and the expected velocity gradient. Fig .2 shows the variation of the staticangle of repose for different values of µk and µr. Eachline represents a value of µr and we have plotted onlytheir upper bound. As explained above, the inclination was carried out in steps, so this is the precision ofthe measurements. These results are similar to thosefound by [9] and reconfirm that the code follows standard implementation of the SSDEM.The problem of a vertical column that collapses under the effects of gravity was also studied. Initial runsindicate that the resulting slope of the granular bedranges from 0 to≈ 18◦ for µr = 0 and µk in the abovementioned range. These results agree with the findingsof [8].Given that DEM codes are used to study the interaction of exploration pods, projectiles and landing padswith the regolith-covered surface of asteroids, it is also0	  10	  20	  30	  40	  50	  60	  0	   0.1	   0.2	   0.3	   0.4	   0.5	   0.6	   0.7	   0.8	   0.9	   1	  Sta$c	  Angle	  of	  Repose	  [˚]	  Surface-­‐surface	  Fric$on	  Coeﬃcient	  0	   0.1	   0.2	   0.3	   0.4	   0.5	   0.6	   0.7	   0.8	   0.9	   1	  Figure 2: Variation of the static angle of repose ofthe granular bed with the coefficient of surface-surfacefriction (µk).

We find that the codeworks as expected and in agreement with previoussimulation efforts. Further exploration of the parameter space, as well as other geometries and tests, regarding penetrometry at low speed impacts are planed.References: [1] P.
