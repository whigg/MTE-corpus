The in situ sampling to determine the composition, rock types, and ages of SPA materials are critical information that will greatly advance our understanding of the Moon. It is the chronology of the lunar far side, including the timing of the SPA impact event and ages of the subsequent large craters and basins within SPA, however, that has relevance to understanding the heavy impact bombardment of the Moon and inner Solar System, with implications for early Solar System dynamics [3,4] that are a large part of the Decadal Survey’s high science priority. Determining this chronology from complex impactite rock samples requires that samples be returned to Earth for detailed isotopic, compositional, and mineralogical analyses. Many rock fragments must be analyzed by a variety of isotopic chronometers to establish their ages with sufficient  precision that is required to answer key scientific questions. These ages must also be placed within the context of the petrogenesis of individual lithologies. Recent Results: The GRAIL mission provided a framework of geophysical measurements that highlight the unique aspects of the SPA terrane [5] and that provide context for compositional remote sensing. Compared to other lunar crust, SPA has relatively high density and low porosity. These characteristics are consistent with the mafic mineral and compositional enrichment associated with the SPA basin interior, known from remote sensing [6-11]. These characteristics have been interpreted to reflect the presence in the SPA crust of a thick, differentiated impact-melt sea [12-14]. That material makes up the substrate of the SPA basin interior, which has been excavated and reworked into basin floor deposits by numerous subsequent large impacts [15-18]. Some of the reworked materials will have had their isotopic chronometers reset by the subsequent impacts, but much of the excavated rock materials are expected to have retained the isotopic and geochronologic record of the formation of SPA, itself. Also fundamental to reconstructing the chronology is that the SPA event set or reset the ages of rocks over an enormous area of the farside and the remnants of this event are distant from the Imbrium-dominated Apollo sample zone. Together, age determinations on a statistically significant number of impact-melt rocks and breccia will define the SPA chronology. This chronology may include, in addition to SPA itself, a number of younger basins and large craters (e.g., Apollo, Leibnitz, Schrödinger, and Orientale). It is likely that all sites within SPA may contain a modest percentage of impact melt material from other basins. Unlike the nearside sample sites, where Imbrium dominates the sample suite [19,20], no single basin (other than SPA) is expected to dominate the regolith [15,16]. Of keen interest is how the SPA chronology differs from the nearside Apollo melt-rock chronology, which will greatly improve our understanding of the early impact flux in the inner Solar System. (e.g., were these large lunar impacts made by the leftovers of terrestrial planet formation, asteroids/comets liberated via a dynamical instability in the giant planet region, some combination, or neither?) Recent studies have also investigated the presence and distribution of volcanic rocks in the SPA interior. One of the attractive aspects of SPA basin for sample return is that we expect impact-melt rocks produced by SPA to still be present in the interior of the basin, and the interior deposits are still accessible in that they have not been completely covered over by maria, as have many of the key nearside basins such as Imbrium, Serenitatis, and Crisium. Although a few geologically young impact craters have excavated through the mare basalts and into the impact-melt rock substrate of these nearside basins, SPA contains many such locations where substrate materials are expected in the surface regolith. Nevertheless, mare volcanism did occur within SPA, including relatively younger (mare) lavas [21,22] and older, buried lavas (cryptomare) [17,23, 24]. It is important to determine how much the volcanic materials have contributed to the mafic signature of the SPA interior, and recent datasets including LRO, the Kaguya spectral suite, and Chandrayaan M3 data are key to ongoing detailed studies [18]. Compositional investigations indicate that the SPA interior composition results from mixing of basalts (e.g., regolith with ~13-17 wt.% FeO) with mafic impact melt (e.g., 11-15 wt.% FeO) [25]. The volcanic rocks are a key scientific target in their own right as their compositions and ages will help to determine global mantle heterogeneity, the nature, timing, and extent of primordial lunar differentiation, and post-differentiation magmatic and thermal 2818.pdf

evolution of the interior (e.g. overturn of lunar magma ocean cumulates).  One of the most enigmatic morphological features on the Moon is the “Mafic Mound,” which has been investigated through orbital measurements [26]. Recent results [26] suggest an ancient volcanic origin, possibly associated with the SPA impact-melt sheet, making this area of the basin interior of special interest. Locations exist where the regolith is expected to contain a mixture of Mafic Mound materials, mare and cryptomare volcanics, and yet still be dominated by SPA substrate impact-melt breccias.  New Questions of Basin Chronology:  Several new or recent areas of research are relevant to SPA sample-return science, and all would benefit from the determination of the age of SPA. Ongoing studies of early Solar System dynamics and the heavy bombardment era as recorded on the Moon [e.g., 3, 4, 27,28] reinforce the importance of determining the extent and timing of the early bombardment, and in particular, addressing questions that remain about the timing from the study of lunar samples and impact basin stratigraphy. For example, Spudis et al. [20] have called into question the age of Serenitatis basin formation, reasoning that it must be significantly older than the age of the prominent Apollo 17 impact melt breccias. This is consistent with the seemingly-ancient crater count on its ejecta [29]. If Serenitatis is older than Nectaris, then the late heavy bombardment may be an artifact of our near-side sampling bias. The SPA chronology includes the age of SPA formation, which is the old-age bookend for most of the recognizable basins on the Moon, and large crater and basin ages within SPA that will provide a new set of dates for the relative basin stratigraphy of the Moon. While it is crucial to determine the age of SPA, it is not as critical to determine which basin or large crater contributed melt to the sample. While models of the regolith present estimates of what components are in the regolith [15,16] and can be used to infer what is in the sample and in what proportion, it is most important to know the timing of such large events. Key questions addressed by SPA sample return include: Did the late heavy bombardment occur in one or multiple stages [4,28], and what were their intensities? Although the relative chronology has been studied [20, 30,31] the absolute chronology of basins >3.9 Ga is poorly known. Radiometric ages are needed from basins that span this age range independent from the Imbrium-dominated nearside materials sampled by Apollo. The SPA basin provides this “blank slate” to clearly record the impact history of the lunar far side. Another area of investigation that is relevant to SPA sample-return science is the timing and origin of major magmatic events on the Moon [32-36]. The SPA impact event may have had such an effect as to cause melting in the lunar interior approximately antipodally to SPA [32,33]. The resulting magmatic episode could be responsible for a locus of ages at 4.32 Ga, recorded by zircons [34], or 4.36 Ga, recorded by Rb-Sr and SmNd isotopic systematics [35], or even the initial stages of mare magmatism at ≈ 3.8-3.9 Ga [36]. If the age of SPA is tied to these intervals of magmatic production on the Moon, it would constitute a paradigm shift in our understanding of post-magma-ocean lunar magmatism and magmatism on other planetary bodies.
