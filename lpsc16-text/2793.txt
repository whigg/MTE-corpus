(tstephan@uchicago.edu)   Introduction:  After several years of designing and building the Chicago Instrument for Laser Ionization (CHILI) [1, 2], we presented the first analytical results from presolar grains last year [3]. CHILI is a resonance ionization mass spectrometry (RIMS) instrument designed to achieve unprecedented performance with regard to sensitivity (~40 % useful yield), lateral resolution (~10 nm), and number of photoionization lasers (six, allowing measurement of isotopic compositions of several elements at once). As an initial demonstration, we had analyzed presolar SiC grains for the isotopic compositions of Sr, Zr, and Ba, three elements that are particularly important for understanding the s-process in asymptotic giant branch stars [3]. Subsequently, we focused our interest on the analysis of Fe and Ni isotopes and developed a unique laser timing scheme that facilitates measuring all stable isotopes of these elements simultaneously whilst avoiding isobaric interference at mass 58 u. First results for Fe and Ni isotopes measured with CHILI in presolar SiC grains are reported in an accompanying abstract [4]. Complementing previous reports [1-3], the following gives a summary of the measures taken to make such analyses possible, reviews recent technical developments with CHILI, and outlines improvements currently in preparation or underway. RIMS analysis of Fe and Ni:  Measuring all Fe and Ni isotopes usually suffers from unresolvable isobaric interference between 58Fe and 58Ni. Chromium-54 and 64Zn also have to be considered since they interfere with 54Fe and 64Ni, respectively. Therefore, in secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) analysis of presolar grains, only 56Fe, 57Fe, 60Ni, 61Ni, and 62Ni are measured directly, whereas 54Fe is corrected for 54Cr, assuming solar 54Cr/52Cr ratios, 58Ni is corrected for 58Fe, assuming solar 58Fe/56Fe ratios, and 64Ni is not measured at all [5]. RIMS usually circumvents isobaric interferences by only ionizing elements that do not have isotopes with the same nominal mass. We developed resonance ionization schemes using three lasers each for simultaneously ionizing Fe and Ni (Fig. 1). Nickel usually requires four lasers since a significant fraction of the neutral atoms are in a low lying excited state just above the ground state. When removing sample material by using a 351 nm UV desorption laser, slightly less than half of the neutral atoms are in the ground state and therefore not accessible for the chosen ionization scheme (Fig 1). The sensitivity is thus relinquished by about 30-50 %. Isobaric interferences between 58Fe and 58Ni are avoided by delaying the Ni ionization lasers by 200 ns compared to the Fe ionization lasers. This time difference corresponds to a mass difference of ~0.5 u in the time-of-flight mass spectra at the specific mass range. As shown in Fig. 2 (top three spectra), Fe and Ni peaks are clearly resolved, and both 58Fe and 58Ni can be measured simultaneously. We applied this method to eleven presolar SiC grains and performed the first simultaneous analyses of all stable Fe and Ni isotopes in presolar grains. As an example, one mass spectrum from a presolar SiC is also shown in Fig. 2 (bottom). These analyses already outperform all previous measurements of Fe and Ni isotopes, with RIMS [7] and SIMS [5], with regard to analytical precision [4]. Developments achieved over the last 12 months: New reflectron.  The first design of the reflectron in CHILI's time-of-flight mass spectrometer turned out to have some imperfections, and the reflectron was poorly aligned with the rest of the system. We therefore redesigned and replaced the reflectron, and performed a precise mechanical alignment. This successful operation allowed us to increase the acceleration voltage for the photoions and lead to higher mass resolution, higher transmission, less noise on the detector, and an overall increase in instrument stability. Electromagnetic interference mitigation.  To minimize electromagnetic interference, passive shielding and an active electromagnetic field cancelation system were installed in the CHILI laboratory. Raw data acquisition.  We developed software for single shot data acquisition, recording detector arrival times for each individual photoion. Data evaluation.  We developed software for evaluating such raw data, which turned out to be necessary for a proper correction of fluctuating signal intensities, which could lead to major dead time effects [6]. Current developments:  In order to finally achieve the performance CHILI is designed for, several technical developments are underway that should be finished within this year. Since CHILI already outperforms previous instruments, these developments are done in parallel to analyzing more samples. Motionless blanking.  CHILI has not achieved the high lateral resolution it is designed for. This is mostly 2793.pdf

due to the fact that the Ga primary ion beam is swept over the sample when blanking the beam. Together with Orsay Physics, the manufacturer of our liquid metal ion gun, we have begun a collaborative effort to develop a motionless blanking system for our gun. Neutral background.  This redesign will also prevent neutrals, which are produced in the gun, from reaching the sample and causing substantial background signals. Multiple reflection prisms.  We are about to finish the design of a pair of prisms that will let the laser light pass eight times through the analysis chamber in order to significantly increase the sensitivity.

The first three spectra are measured on a stainless steel sample, first, by only using three lasers that were tuned for resonance ionization of Fe, then, by using three lasers tuned for Ni. The third spectrum, eventually, was measured using all six lasers combined. The fourth spectrum shows an Fe-Ni spectrum from a presolar SiC grain [4]. In order to avoid isobaric interference at mass 58 u, firing of the lasers tuned for Ni was delayed by 200 ns compared to firing of the Fe lasers. This time difference corresponds to a mass difference of ~0.5 u in this mass range. This can be seen in the two mass scales shown; the upper mass scale was calibrated using the Fe mass peaks, the lower mass scale was calculated from the Ni mass peaks. 2793.pdf
