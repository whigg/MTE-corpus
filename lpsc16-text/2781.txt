EARTHQUAKES ON COMETS AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES. Leszek Czechowski,  University of Warsaw, Faculty of Physics, Institute of Geophysics, ul. Pasteura 7,02-093Poland (lczech@op.pl/Fax: +48-22-5546882)Introduction: Comets are believed to built of soft materials like snow and dust. The recent landing of Philae on the comet 67P/CzuriumowGierasimienko indicates a different situation. According to [1]  "thermal probe did not fully penetrate the near-surface layers, suggesting a local resistance of the ground to penetration of  >4 megapascals, equivalent to >2 megapascal uniaxial compressive strength".  Here we consider the hypotheses that elastic properties of comet's nuclei could be similar to elastic properties of dry snow, namely Young modulus is assumed to be 106 - 108 Pa. Methods and results:  We considered a  simple model of two spheres (with radius 1400 m each) connected by cylinder (with radius of 200 m and length of  200  m).  Density is  470  kg  m-3.  This shape corresponds approximately to shape of some comets.  A few vibration modes are  possible.  In present  research  we consider 3  modes: bending, lengthening-shortening  along  axis  of  symmetry, and torsion. Typical periods of are given in Table 1.

The maximum values of acceleration of the surface resulting from this impact are given in Table 1. Note that these values are higher than acceleration of the gravity of the comet. Consequently, these vibrations could be an important factor of surface  evolution,  e.g.  they  could  trigger  landslides. It  could be alternative mechanism to that presented in [4] (i.e. fluidization).
