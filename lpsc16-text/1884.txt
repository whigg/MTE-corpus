Introduction: Gassendi crater (110 km, 17.55°S 39.96°W) has a fractured floor and is located just north of Mare Humorum on the western nearside of the Moon. The Gassendi region, as well as the crater, contains a number of unusual features which have long provoked controversy. These include smooth plains, irregular depressions, moat-like wall boundaries, and possible volcanic constructs on the floor of Gassendi [1,2] and a cryptomare deposit [3]. We analyzed Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) Wide Angle Camera (WAC), Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) imagery and DTM topo data and a variety of other spacecraft data, to investigate the geology, the composition and the origin of geologic units within the Gassendi crater. Previously we examined the NE volcanic depression in detail [4], this abstract focuses on the NW and SW volcanic depressions. The goals of this study include the following: 1) Identify and map the distribution of volcanic features within Gassendi, 2) Determine the composition of any buried mare basalts, 3) Determine the origin of these volcanic features. Methods: Both LROC WAC and NAC images were used in this investigation [5]. Both high and low incidence WAC imagery was used [6]. The high resolution (0.5 m/pixel) NAC images were critical for the study of the smallest volcanic features. Topographic data were provided by the LROC GLD100 [7] digital topographic model (DTM). Images from the Clementine mission’s five-color UV-VIS digital image model (DIM; [8]) were used to produce an image cube centered on the Gassendi area. This calibrated image cube served as the basis for the production of a number of other data products, including optical maturity (OMAT) images and FeO and TiO2 maps [9, 10]. Fivepoint spectra were extracted from the calibrated and registered Clementine UV-VIS image cube. Results and Discussion:  The geologic map of the Mare Humorum region, I495 [11] shows two depressions on the floor of Gassendi. These are marked “NW” and “NE”, representing the northwest and northeast depression on Figure 1. The southwest (“SW”) depression was later identified by Hawke et al. [12]. These depressions are thought to be drained lava lakes based on the morphologic and geochemical evidence [1, 2, 4, 12, 13].   Figure 1. Three depressions on the floor of Gassendi crater, see black arrows. The NE and NW depressions are indicated on the I-495 map with contour lines that have interior tick marks [11]. The SW depression was identified by [12]. LROC GLD100 [7]. North is up in all figures. Northwest Depression. Schultz [1] described several features of possible endogenic origin in the NW portion of the floor. These included an irregular depression partly surrounded by a 22-km scarp which may be a lava terrace. The NW drained lake exhibits a lava terrace along its southern edge (Figure 2) and is more clearly defined in NAC images (Figures 2A and 2B). The northern edge of the depression is less clearly defined, thus an areal extent for this depression is difficult to derive. The elevation of the terrace top is constant along its exposed length with the exception of the western edge which rises in elevation due to the influence of a 2.3 km impact crater. The maximum depth of this lake was ~90 m. Geochemical evidence for the presence of volcanic deposits in the NW floor is similar to that observed for the NE depression [13]. The FeO abundance is elevated and in the range of 12 to 16 wt.%. Likewise, the TiO2 abundance is in the 2 to 3 wt.% range which is higher than the background.  Southwest Depression. The SW depression (Figure 3) also exhibits a lava terrace at several locations [4, 12]. This is the smallest of the three identified areas at about 50 km2 (approx. 10 km x 5 km). The western scarp is well defined and the southern boundary is non- 1884.pdf

The southern boundary is disrupted by several craters that impacted the depression after it was formed, thus is approximated in Figure 3. The maximum terrace to floor depth is 72 m. This area exhibits enhanced FeO and TiO2 values. The FeO abundances range from 12 to 16 wt.%. The floor has an enhanced TiO2 abundance of 2-3 wt.%. These higher-thanbackground geochemical values indicate the presence of volcanic material. Some areas on the western boundary exhibit evidence of multiple layers of scarps, possibly indicating several episodes of recession. One of the best examples is in the northwest corner of the depression. Curved lava terraces are visible on NAC images. The scarp at the highest elevation is nearly continuous; whereas the lower elevation scarps are incomplete. Origin & Formation Processes. We postulate a similar origin for each of the 3 lava lakes within Gassendi crater. As a floor fractured crater, conduits may have opened in the fractures to allow magma to enter the floor, then subsequently drain back into the source region. The main requirement for a post fill drainage event is an enclosed basin. If the basin is tilted or has a neighboring topographic low then the contained basalts are more likely to migrate to the lower portion. The 1959 eruption of Kilauea Iki crater on Hawaii’s big island may be an analog for the Gassendi lava lakes. During the entire event there were 17 eruption episodes that filled then subsequently drained the lava lake [14-16]. Nearly twice as much lava was erupted than was available in the magma budget, indicating that the lava was recycled between the lake and the magma chamber at depth. The NE depression is the best lava lake candidate with the lowest elevation; the NW and SW depressions are also topographic lows so may have been able to contain erupted lavas to create lava lakes that later drained. Gassendi Crater Interior. Large parts of the W central and NW floor exhibit FeO values (12-14 wt.%) higher than those of the surrounding floor material (812 wt.%), providing additional evidence for mafic materials inside the depressions. A number of small impact craters excavated even more FeO-rich material. These craters range from 1 to 1.4 km in diameter, and LROC images show that they have very faint dark haloes. The maximum FeO abundances measured for the dark haloes range from 14.4 to 14.8 wt.%. These values fall within the range of FeO abundances (14-18 wt.%) determined for the mare units in the southern, SE, and SW portions of the crater floor.   Figure 3.
