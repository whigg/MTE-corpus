Introduction:  Coronae (e.g., Fig. 1) are large tectono-magmatic features on Venus characterized by a quasi-circular graben-fissure system (that may be underlain by dykes [e.g., 1, 2, 3]) and topographic features which may include a raised central dome, central depression, raised circular rim or circular moat [4]. Although common on Venus, similar features appear to be very rare on Earth. Three possible analogues, based on recognition of giant "circumferential" dyke swarms with a quasi-circular or quasi-elliptical geometry and spanning arcs of 50⁰ to 120⁰, were identified in the first global terrestrial survey of giant dyke swarms [5]. In two of the cases, a roughly coeval giant radiating swarm focuses near the centre of the circumferential system. Subsequently, two dramatic examples of giant circumferential swarms associated with large igneous provinces (LIPs) and spanning arcs of ~180⁰ have been reported [6, 7], as well as possible segments of circumferential swarms in which small swarms, without a clear arcuate pattern, crosscut coeval giant radiating swarms [e.g., 8]. We briefly review key examples from our current inventory of terrestrial giant circumferential dyke swarms and possible segments of circumferential swarms. We then summarize their characteristics that may be helpful in understanding coronae on Venus. Lake Victoria swarm of Kunene-Kibaran LIP:  The Lake Victoria giant circumferential swarm [Fig. 2; 6, 9, 3], with an outer diameter of >600 km, is part of the 1380 Ma Kunene-Kibaran LIP event of East Africa. It has a circular pattern with an arc of 160⁰. There does not appear to be an associated giant radiating dyke swarm. However, within the circumferential swarm are numerous coeval sills, layered intrusions and granitoids. It is unclear whether the "dykes" are vertical. Geophysical modelling suggests inward-dipping cone sheets [9], whereas field descriptions indicate the presence of subvertical dykes [6].  High Arctic Igneous Province (HALIP) circumferential swarm:  The HALIP giant circumferential swarm [7] is part of the 125-80 Ma HALIP which extends from the high Arctic islands of Canada, across northern Greenland, to Svalbard and the Franz Josef Land archipelago. It is unusual because of its very large size (outer diameter of ~1700 km, arc ~180⁰) and because it is the first identified by means of a continental reconstruction. Its centre is slightly (~200 km) offset from the focus of a HALIP giant radiating swarm. Blekinge-Dalarna swarm of Rogaland event:  Ernst and Buchan [5] suggested that Blekinge-Dalarna dykes, which follows the eastern edge of the high-grade Protogine Zone in southern Sweden over an arc of ~60⁰, might be a circumferential swarm with an outer diameter of ~1000 km, although at the time it was not certain that the dykes were coeval or that the arc was primary. However, precise U-Pb dating has confirmed the presence of ca. 950 Ma dykes along the length of the swarm [10]. Paleomagnetic directions along the swarm [11] indicate the arcuate geometry is primary. Kochikha swarm of Siberian Traps LIP:  Ernst and Buchan [5, 12] proposed that Kochikha dykes of the 250 Ma Siberian Trap LIP form a giant circumferential swarm with an elliptical shape (300-600 km in diameter). Its centre is near the focus of a giant radiating swarm comprising the Ebekhaya and Maimecha subswarms as well as linear feeder zones to volcanic flows of the Noril'sk area. The Kochikha circumferential dykes cut volcanic rocks and are, therefore, younger that the Ebekhaya and Maimecha radiating dykes which are not observed to cut the volcanics. Dykes in the western portion of the circumferential swarm are subvertical [13, p.193]. Clarence Head swarm of Franklin LIP:  The 715 Ma Clarence Head swarm is part of the Franklin magmatic event of northern Canada based on precise dating [8]. It is representative of several examples where a relatively small dyke swarm without a clear arcuate geometry is roughly perpendicular to dykes of a giant radiating swarm, and, hence, could represent a segment of a giant circumferential swarm [8]. The Clarence Head swarm is 5 or 10 Myr younger than the Franklin radiating swarm and ~ 1000 km from the its focus. Lüliang swarm of Xiong'er Volcanic Province:  The ca. 1780 Ma Lüliang dyke swarm of the North China Craton [14], although too short to display a clear arcuate pattern, is perpendicular to approximately coeval dykes of the giant radiating Taihang swarm. The Lüliang dykes could form a component of a giant circumferential swarm with an outer diameter of ~1200 km. The two swarms and similar-aged Xiong'er volcanics may be components of a LIP [14]. Characteristics of terrestrial giant circumferential swarms and comparison with Venusian coronae:  Terrestrial giant circumferential dyke swarms have several characteristics similar to those of Venusian coronae. They are quasi-circular or quasi-elliptical  with diameters up to 1700 km (HALIP), broadly comparable with the largest corona on Venus (Artemis, diameter of 2400 km). In some cases they are associated with a giant radiating swarm, similar to cases on Venus where coronae are associated with radial fracture systems. When both swarms are present their centres may coincide (e.g., Siberian Traps event), or may be offset (e.g., HALIP).  Where there is evidence concerning the age relationship between giant circumferential and radiating dykes swarms on Earth, the circumferential component is more likely to be the younger. Similarly, the grabenfissure system of coronae is usually interpreted as younger than the radiating graben-fissure system, if present, with the radiating fractures thought to be associated with uplift above a rising diaper and circumferential fractures related to subsequent gravitational relaxation as the diaper cools [15]. As noted above, Venusian coronae are usually associated with circular topographic features. Such features may have been present in the case of terrestrial circumferential swarms, but will have been lost to erosion which is severe on Earth and essentially absent on Venus. As yet, little analysis has been done to see whether such paleo-topography is detectable in the terrestrial sedimentary record. Giant radiating dyke swarms are often associated with rifting. Therefore, circumferential systems that are linked to radiating swarms may also be rift related. In the BAT region of Venus, coronae are often located along rift systems [e.g., 16]. Conclusions:  Terrestrial circumferential dyke swarms have a number of the characteristics of Venusian coronae, suggesting that they may have similar origins. However, investigation is needed to increase the number of known circumferential swarms and to better define the characteristics of circumferential swarms and coronae [e.g., 17] before a more definitive conclusion can be reached.
