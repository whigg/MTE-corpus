Introduction:  Flank vents are common features on polygenetic volcanoes, indicating that magma has propagated away from the central conduit and/or magma chamber [1].  The distribution of volcanic vents about a central caldera can provide information on magma propagation and stress orientation in a volcano [1-3]. In addition, the morphology and morphometry of flank vents and associated deposits provide a proxy for eruption style, effusion rate and magma properties such as gas content [2, 4].  They have been documented extensively on terrestrial volcanoes such as Mt. Etna and Fernandina volcano (Galapagos Islands) [2, 3].  Similar features are observed on Martian volcanoes.  Olympus Mons, the largest shield volcano on Mars at ~22 km high and ~600 km across, represents ~3.5 Ga of volcanic activity [5-8].  Located northwest of the volcanotectonic Tharsis Province, Olympus Mons is shrouded in 1 - 2 m of dust preventing detailed compositional analysis [8].  Consequently, morphology, morphometry and spatial relationships offer the best chances at understanding the developmental history of Olympus Mons.  The first vent on Olympus Mons was identified using THEMIS VIS (18 m/pix) [9].  A variety of volcanic features and flow morphologies have since been identified and mapped using HRSC, providing evidence of widespread effusive eruptions during the Amazonian [4].  Higher resolution imagery has allowed for the identification and characterization of smaller volcanic features. Methods:  We used image data from CTX (~5m/px), HiRISE (~0.5m/px), and THEMIS IR (~100m/px).  We mosaicked 159 CTX images covering Olympus Mons to identify and map the distribution of vents.  For topography, morphometry and simple spatial distributions, we used MOLA (~300m/px) and HRSC DTMs (~50m/px).  We supplemented the Tharsis Small Volcanic Vent Catalogue to locate other possible vents [10].  We have confidently identified 60 flank vents and 84 arcuate graben.  Using ESRI ArcGIS 10.3, we performed an average nearest neighbor analysis to determine the clustering of vents.  Figure 1:  CTX image of low shield (~90 m high) on northeast flank of Olympus Mons.  Illumination is from the left and north is up. White arrows denote flow from vent.  Red arrows illustrate the diversion of flow around vent indicating emplacement subsequent to vent edifice creation.  Subsequent flows have not buried vent indicating the vent formed during waning volcanic activity.  Observations:  We observed and mapped 60 flank vents and 84 arcuate graben on the flank of Olympus Mons.  Flank vents are identified as positive topographic features with flows emanating from their summits.  In many cases, vents have diverted subsequent flows around them (Fig. 1).  Vents average < 2 km across and < 100 m high.  Slopes are < 3°.  Vents generally occur >200 km from center of the volcano (Fig. 2).  Vents display various morphologies, including low shields, fissures and cinder/spatter cones.  Average nearest neighbor analysis reveals the vents are clustered.  Observed graben are subtle topographic features concentric about the center of the edifice.  They are generally < 30 km in length and < 200 m wide.  Graben are not visible in HRSC DTM profiles suggesting depths ≤ 10 m, below the vertical detection limit of HRSC DTMs.  Majority of graben display little or no modification by lava.  Some graben crosscut flows emanating from flank vents.   Figure 2:  Distribution of vents and graben as a function of distance from the volcanic center.  Green dashed line approximates edge of summit caldera complex.  Red dotted line approximates location of basal escarpment.  The occurrence of vents on the lower flank of Olympus Mons supports the idea of vent migration downslope as magma source regions subside [5,7,11].  Graben display bimodal distribution, possibly an artifact due to the escarpment.  Discussion:  Our results suggest that Late Amazonian resurfacing was primarily effusive.  Graben formed during and subsequent to waning volcanic activity.  The development of Olympus Mons, including Late Amazonian resurfacing, is similar to that observed on Ascraeus Mons [12, 13]. Late Amazonian Volcanism.  Despite limited edifice construction, flank vents played a significant role in Late Amazonian (< 1 Ga) resurfacing on Olympus Mons.  Vent morphology suggests primarily low volatile, low viscosity effusive eruptions.  Embayment relationships show vent edifices were constructed prior to and/or concurrent with widespread Late Amazonian resurfacing.  Since the observed vents have not been buried, they likely formed during waning volcanic activity.  A handful of cones, interpreted as cinder or spatter cones, suggest a few explosive eruptions have occurred.  Lack of observed phreatomagmatic cones imply a lack of water/magma interaction at the time of resurfacing. Late Amazonian Tectonism.  The distribution of graben mimics that of flank vents.  However, graben occur preferentially on flow aprons to the southwest and northeast.  Observed graben crosscut lava flows indicating their formation post-date the flows on the lower flank.  This does not rule out earlier graben which may have been destroyed during resurfacing.  Arcuate graben imply extensional stresses on the lower flank which agrees with a modelled concentric stress field [11,12].  The stresses may be due to gravity spreading, magma propagation to the lower flank or flexure of the lithosphere due to the edifice.  Similar graben are observed on Ascraeus Mons, where lithospheric flexure has been proposed as their formation mechanism [13].  Recent work inferring paleoslopes from emplaced lavas that flowed off Tharsis indicate that Olympus Mons flexed the lithosphere downward in the Late Amazonian [14]. Development of Martian Shields.  Development of Olympus Mons is similar to that proposed for Ascraeus Mons.  Flank vents and arcuate graben are also observed on Ascraeus Mons, with graben occurring off the main shield [13].  Olympus Mons, like the Tharsis Montes, displays SW-NE oriented flow aprons.  Olympus Mons underwent an initial shield building phase, flank failure which created the basal escarpment, a pulse of Late Amazonian volcanism resulting in the formation of flow aprons and minor deformation on its lower flank owing to extensional stresses [14].  Olympus Mons displays unique differences from Ascraeus Mons, such as a basal escarpment and the location of observed graben. Ongoing and Future Work:  A manuscript of this work is in progress.  At present, we are modelling to account for some observed features.  More detailed spatial analyses of vents to determine small scale clustering is also being pursued. References:  [1] Nakamura, K.
