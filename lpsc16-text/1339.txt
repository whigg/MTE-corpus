In Chang’E-3 landing mission, a 2- and 3-way lunar radio total-count-phase ranging and Doppler technique was developed and tested at X-band of 8470MHz by radio science experiment team of Chinese lunar and deep space mission. The technique concept is originally coming from Descanso of JPL/NASA[1]. Figure 1 shows the structure and antenna configuration of Chang’E-3 lander. This method, called Lunar Radio-phase Ranging (LRR) can become a new space geodetic technique to measure the station position, earth tide and rotation, lunar orbit, tide and  liberation, by means of independent observation, or to work together with Lunar Laser Ranging. Also, it can be used in future planetary lander mission.   Figure 1 CE-3 lander: the parabolic high gain antenna works at X-band for up and down link in the radio ranging experiments.   Figure 2, 2-way and 3-way radio link concept between the Earth and the Moon Experiments:  In the preliminary experiments, an up link deep space tracking station at JIAMUS of northeast of China, for VLBI antenna of Chinese VLBI network joined the observation. Figure 2 shows the open loop 2- and 3-way radio link concept.  All stations are equipped with H-maser clock. For the 3-way link, we obtained 1sps continuous total-count-phase ranging data on the successful landing day and in the extended mission period, with a resolution of 0.5 millimeter or better.  Here we only show the first result from a 2-way observation only.   Figure 3, An example of O-C for 2-way radio phase ranging by JIAMUSI station with a coarse coordinate for lander. Dash-line is the elevation angle.  Figure 3 shows an example of O-C for 2-way radio phase ranging by JIAMUSI station. The observation was carried out from UTC 23:42:00 of Nov. 13 to 02:28:40 of Nov. 14, 2014. A lander position of (19.501°W, 44.126°N) was used to calculated the theoretical ranging with a model resolution or accuracy of 0.5mm. Also, a LE430/DE430[2] lunar and planetary ephemeris with principal axes for the Moon was adopted to calculate the lunar orbit, physical liberation and lunar lander position using the latest IERS standard.  Data Processing:  When processing the data, we also followed the idea of LLR technique of rejecting the low elevation angle (<20°) measurement, where the non-linear large atmospheric and ionospheric delay 1339.pdf

below this truncate angle over the station might destroy the precise estimation. Also we calculated the atmospheric delay series by using a Saastamoinen-NMF model based on the metereological data recorded at the ground station during the tracking period. Additionally, an IONEX GIM global ionospheric TEC product released by IGS-GNSS of IERS was used to calculated the ionospheric delay between the ground station and lander. After carefully removing the media effects, the position of lander was estimated with some fixed parameters, EOP from IERS products, lunar liberation fromLE430/DE430, solid earth tide model of the ground station from IERS standard. The estimated coordinates for lander position are read as 19.50456°W and 44.1210°N with a fixed radii of 1734.7680km at landing area. The radii can be estimated better based on multi epoch data.     Figure 4, residual of the 2-way Ranging for Figure 3 after fitting the landing position.  The final fitting residual for the 2-way relative ranging is given in Figure 4.  The residual series show wave-like variation with time scale of 5~20 minutes, and amplitude range of ±18mm for 2-way or ±9mm.  It is mainly from the atmospheric disturbance. An arclike drift still appears in the residual figure, which may come from underestimation data analyzing method. This problem will be solved in the near future by processing the multi epoch observation data.  References: [1] http://descanso.jpl.nasa.gov/  monograph/series1/Descanso1_C03.pdf.
