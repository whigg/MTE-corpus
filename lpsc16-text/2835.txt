ELEVATED RADIATION ENVIRONMENT AT WORSWICK HOTSPRINGS.  J. C. Rask1 1A.E. Wood & Associates, PO Box 228 Moffett Field, CA, 94035, jon.c.rask@nasa.gov  Introduction:  We report on a systematic characterization of the radiation environment and water temperatures of Worswick Hot Springs (Figure 1), which is in support of companion biochemical and microbial investigations of iron respiration in the 'extreme' microbial systems found at the field site. We have discovered localized areas of elevated radiation that are approximately 4 to 5 times greater than background radiation. Additionally we have observed that both the radiation environment and the temperature of the spring waters vary over time.  Background: Radioactive hot springs are well documented in many locations around the world [1-3, 5, 6, 12, 13, 18, 24] and radiation resistant microbes have been found in them as well [10]. Examples of some of the earliest discoveries of radiation in and around hot springs in the United States were made on public lands, namely at Hot Springs National Park in 1904[3], and at Yellowstone National Park in 1906[21]. Follow-on reports document the sources of radiation to be Radon gas within the hot spring waters [4, 20]. It is unknown if radon gas is present at Worswick. Future investigations that explore for Radon at Worswick may be warranted. Field Site: Worswick hot springs is located at 1827 feet altitude in the southern Soldier Mountains of Idaho at GPS coordinates 43˚33.869 N, 114˚47.814 W. The field site is approximately 73 miles straight east of Boise, ID, or 15 miles straight north of Farfield, ID. Worswick hot springs contains multiple small hot spring sources that form two streams (Stream A and Stream B), which flow into Worswick Creek.  Methods:  Radiation Measurements: A Bicron Micro Analyst micro-r-meter (Bicron NE, Saint-Gobain Industrial Ceramics, Inc.) capable of sensing x-rays and gamma-rays (0-5000 µR/hr), was operated in the field to gather radiation data at twenty-four field locations around and above the region of each stream channel identified in Figure 1. The micro-r meter was held within 10 centimeters of flowing cold or hot spring water at all twenty-four field locations. Radiation levels, measured as µR/hr, were read from the instrument and recorded in the field. Temperature measurements: A digital hand-held infrared thermometer (Oakton WD-39642-00 Mini-Temp Tester) was operated in the field, and was held as close as possible (approximately 25 cm or less) to flowing cold or hot spring water at all measurement locations. Temperature (measured in ˚C), were read from the instrument and recorded.  Radiation and Temperature Observations:  We observed more radioactivity along Stream A. In May 2015, radiation variability ranged from 12 µR/hr (background) to ~50 µR/hr, as compared to the radioactivity of the area around Stream B, which ranged from 12 µR/hr to 20 µR/hr. Several elevated point sources of radioactivity were identified in Stream A, whereas no significantly elevated point sources of radioactivity was observed in Stream B. In September 2015, similar elevated trends were observed, however new point sources of elevated radioactivity were observed along Stream B. The highest water temperature observed in Stream A was 78.8˚C. The highest water temperature observed in Stream B was 77.0˚C.  Summary:  While it is clear that many different hot springs around the world are radioactive in nature, we have been unable to find a record that documents the presence of an elevated radiation environment around Worswick Hot Springs, despite detailed characterization of its waters [17, 19] and local hydrothermal systems [8, 9, 11]. Although the regional geology has been well described [14-16] and evidence of features within the Idaho Batholith containing radioactive materials have been observed [7, 22, 23], we believe our work represents the discovery of radioactivity at Worswick Hot Springs.  Future work will include continued characterization of the radiation environment and temperatures of the waters. Efforts to determine the source of the radiation and correlations with the microbial studies will also be made.
