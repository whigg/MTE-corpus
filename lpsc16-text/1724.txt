Introduction:  Recent identification of fluviallacustrine deposits at Gale crater by the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover Curiosity has confirmed that Mars hosted liquid water at the surface and subsurface for thousands to millions of years [1]. Pivotal to these paleoclimate reconstructions are the phyllosilicate and sulfate bearing deposits found at Gale crater, and similar deposits identified at Columbus crater, Jezero crater, and Terby crater [2-5]. Iron-saponite has been confirmed in the drill powder from the Sheepbed mudstone at Gale crater, while 205 candidates for closedbasin crater lakes were added to the catalogue of potential paleolakes on Mars [6-7]. This increasing knowledge of the diversity of phyllosilicates and sedimentary environments requires a greater understanding of in-situ clay mineral formation to help unravel the evolution of mineral assemblages on Mars. This study presents data describing phyllosilicates in the saline mudflats of Bolivian salars on the Altiplano as an analogue to processes which may have occurred on Mars.  The Andean plateau is a large (200,000 km2) intermontaine basin that experienced significant aridification due to regional uplift and rise of the east Cordillera [8-9]. The salars are remnants of large paleolakes that have evaporated due to climate change, analogous to the transition on Mars from a wet to dry climate 3.73.2 Ga [10]. The basin is characterized by high sulphur concentrations, low ozone, low pressure, high solar radiance, high elevations (3500-4200 m), rapid temperature fluctuations, and a hyperarid climate [10-11]. Methods:  The mudflats of six salars in the Potosi region of Bolivia (Canapa (CAN), Hedionda (HED), Ramaditas (RAM), Honda (HON), Chiar Khota (CHKT), and Challuncani (CHU) were sampled to the water table or ice layer by excavation. Coarse fragments were removed by wet sieving (0.125 mm) and the clay sized fraction (< 2 µm) was separated by centrifugation.  Mineralogy of the clay-sized fraction was determined via X-ray diffraction (XRD) of oriented slides. The oriented slides were analyzed as dry powders, then as ethylene glycol solvated mounts, and then heat treated to 400°C and 550°C. Reflectance spectra were also collected on the dried (60°C), ground powders of the clay-sized fraction using the ASD TerraSpec 4 from 350-2500 nm. Lastly, the morphology of the clay-sized fractions was analyzed using the FEI Quanta 650 FEG-ESEM.  Results: Coarse Fragments. Coarse fragments from the sediments were dominated by igneous rocks and minerals (CAN and CHU), or chemical precipitates of gypsum (HED, HON, and CHKT) or calcite (RAM and HON).  The coarse fragments in CAN were well-sorted, rounded, 1 mm grains, while the coarse fragments in CHU were poorly sorted, angular to subangular, 1-8 mm grains.  X-ray Diffraction. All of the XRD patterns from the clay-sized fraction contained two broad peaks centered around 6°2Θ and 25°2Θ, which may be due to allophane, imogolite, and/or biogenic opal [12-13]. To characterize the nature and contribution of phyllosilicates to each diffraction pattern, the height (H) and full width at half max (FWHM) were modeled for the peak centered around 6°2Θ using the spectra collected at 400°C as the background to distinguish collapsible minerals from the amorphous content (Fig. 1). On average, the H/FWHM of the Bolivian clays was an order of magnitude smaller than measured reference smectites (data not shown) indicating either limited short range atomic order or small crystallite size. The higher mean H/FWHM for CAN (163), HED (166), HON (91), and CHU (233) separated these salars from RAM (48) and CHKT (44), both of which contained samples that appeared to be mostly amorphous silica with no clay reflections present and a H/FWHM of 0.

The reflectance spectra of the majority of the < 2 µm fraction resembled saponite with absorption bands at 1410 nm (OH overtone), 1910 nm (H2O combination) and 2310 nm (Mg-OH vibration) (Fig. 2). Samples from CAN and CHU also had weak Al-OH absorptions at 2210 nm. Similar to the XRD patterns, spectra from RAM and CHKT clays  resembled amorphous silica or allophane with weak, broad absorption features from 2200-2300 nm.  Figure 2.

Microscopic examination of the clays via SEM revealed the sediments to be rich in diatom frustules (Fig. 3). Mudflat sediments from CAN, HED, HON and CHU that were characterized by a large H/FWHM and strong near-infrared absorption features contained diatom frustules that were highly weathered and coated with fine-grained material. Conversely, for the < 2 µm fraction from RAM and CHKT, only small amounts of fine-grained material was present and the diatom frustules were well preserved.  Figure 3.

Discussion and Implications for Mars: The clays present in the mudflats of the Bolivian salars are likely of both detrital and authigenic origin. In CAN and CHU where igneous fragments are present in the sediments, both Al- and Mg- rich clays have been identified. The Al-rich clay resembles montmorillonite, which may have formed from weathering of the surrounding volcanic rocks or by precipitation. The Mgrich clay, common in almost all sediments, is likely authigenic Mg-smectite formed from the dissolution and replacement of diatom frustules. Previous analysis of these salars found little to no clay forming on the diatom frustules in RAM and CHKT, which resulted in the conclusion that strict geochemical thresholds of amorphous silica saturation and a pH of 8.2 controlled clay formation [14]. However, while the average H/FWHM was low and the reflectance spectra weak for RAM and CHKT, some of the samples did contain significant amounts of phyllosilicates suggesting the conversion process may be slower in these lakes, but not absent (Fig. 1). Therefore, abiotic geochemical conditions alone may not be all that is required for authigenic phyllosilicate formation.  In addition to saline lakes, replacement of diatom frustules by authigenic K- and Fe- bearing smectites has been characterized in the deltaic muds of the Amapá coastline of northern Brazil [15]. Laboratory incubation of cultured diatoms in these anoxic muds displayed complete conversion to phyllosilicates within 20-23 months [15]. This rapid conversion of diatom frustules in marine waters in association with high detrital inputs has previously hindered the study of authigenic clays in marine environments. The ubiquity of diatom frustules in association with authigenic phyllosilicates suggests biogenic silica may play  a larger role in phyllosilicate formation than previously expected, perhaps by providing a nuclei or template for growth or providing silica . The rate of dissolution of diatom frustules is reduced with decreasing temperature, pH, pressure, salinity, and increasing Al concentration of the solution [16]. It is proposed that these factors of diatom dissolution explain the slow phyllosilicate formation, low H/FWHM, and high amorphous content in Bolivian salars, especially for CHKT and RAM, as well as the overall lack of authigenic clays in freshwater systems. The significance of biotic processes that may be required for phyllosilicate formation need to be examined given the use of Earth analogues in understanding planetary processes and the widespread distribution of clays on Mars.
