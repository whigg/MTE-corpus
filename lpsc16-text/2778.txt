Introduction: Calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) in chondrites preserve a record of the earliest Solar System processes [1]. They show anomalies in a variety of isotope systems when compared to the bulk chondritic composition [2]. These anomalies have been attributed largely to incomplete homogenization of distinct nucleosynthetic components in the nebular reservoir sampled by CAIs. In recent years, we have reported the isotopic compositions of an unprecedented number of elements from a single suite of Allende CAIs  [3-6]. This work has shown that these Allende CAIs have uniform isotopic compositions in the mass range of ~46 to ~164 amu that are still distinct from terrestrial or bulk chondritic values, suggesting that they originated from an isotopically homogeneous nebular reservoir. However, it is important to determine the isotope compositions of CAIs from other primitive chondritic meteorites to ascertain the degree of isotopic heterogeneity in the broader CAI-forming region in the early Solar System. Recently, [7] reported the Sr, Ba, Nd, and Sm isotope compositions of four CAIs from four different desert chondrites (two CV3, one CK3, and one CK5 meteorite). These authors attributed the slight variations in isotopic composition that they observed in this sample set to varying contributions from terrestrial weathering. The goal of this investigation was to determine the isotope compositions of several other key elements (specifically Zr, Cr, and Ti) in these CAIs that are less likely to be affected by terrestrial weathering and that considerably expand the mass range being investigated for these samples.  Samples and Analytical Methods: We analyzed Zr and Cr isotope compositions of the same set of four CAIs that were previously studied by [7]. We additionally plan to measure their Ti isotope compositions in the near future. As described by [7], "Marge" and "Lisa" are from two different CV3 carbonaceous chondrites; "Bart" is from the CK5 chondrite, while "Homer" is from a CK3 chondrite. Bart, Lisa, and Marge show flat Group III REE patterns whereas Homer shows a modified Group II REE pattern. Since we had previously only reported the Zr isotope compositions of a subset of our original suite of Allende CAIs [4], we also measured the Zr isotope compositions of the remaining CAIs from this suite (166, 167, 170, and 175) for the sake of completeness. CAIs 166, 167, and 175 are fine grained inclusions that show Group II Rare Earth Element (REE) patterns [8], suggesting formation from a fractionated reservoir in the nebula [9]; CAI 170 is a coarse-grained CAI that has a flat Group III REE pattern [8] that can be explained by condensation from a solar nebula of CI composition.  The CAIs were separated from their respective meteorites and a small fragment was mounted in a polished section for petrographic analyses. The major fraction of each CAI was digested in a Parr bomb, followed by multiple treatments with aqua regia. Chemical separation for a suite of elements was done following the methods outlined in [3]. The CAIs, as well as BCR-2 and Allende whole rock samples (used as internal laboratory standards), were chemically processed to separate Zr from the rest of the matrix using protocols adapted from those described in [9]. Subsequently, Cr purification was accomplished using the procedure modified from [10]. Zirconium and chromium isotopes were measured on the Neptune Multicollector Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (MC-ICPMS) at Arizona State University (ASU) using methods similar to those described previously [4,6]. Purified zirconium samples and standards were analyzed at a concentration of 100 ppb and data were internally normalized to 94Zr/90Zr (= 0.33381; [11]) to correct for mass dependent fractionation. The external reproducibilities (2SD) based on repeat analyses of the NIST 3169 isotopic standard over the course of this study for ε91Zr, ε92Zr and ε96Zr are ±0.14, ±0.14, and ±0.31, respectively. Each sample was analyzed 3 to 5 times during an analytical session. The errors reported here are either the 2SD of multiple analyses or the external reproducibility (2SD) of NIST 3169 standard (the larger of the two).  Purified chromium samples and standards were analyzed at a concentration of 800 ppb. Measurements were done in high resolution mode to avoid polyatomic interferences [12]. The intensities of 50Cr, 52Cr, 53Cr, and 54Cr were measured, along with 49Ti, 51V, and 56Fe to monitor and correct for isobaric interferences. The Cr isotopic data are reported relative to the NBS 979 standard after internal normalization to 50Cr/52Cr (=0.051859; [13]). Our external reproducibility is ±0.04 and ±0.08 (2SD) for ε53Cr and ε54Cr, respectively, based on repeat measurements of terrestrial rock standards over the course of this study. The Nb/Zr and Mn/Cr ratios were measured using a Thermo quadrupole ICPMS at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). 2778.pdf

Results and Discussion: The Zr isotopic composition of the CAIs analyzed here is shown in Fig. 1. No mass independent anomalies in ε91Zr are resolvable. However, all analyzed CAIs except Homer show excesses in ε96Zr that are identical within the analytical errors, with an average value of 2.05 ± 0.38 (2SD); this is indistinguishable from the average value based on our 8 previously analysed Allende CAIs [4]. Homer shows a slightly, but resolvably, lower ε96Zr of 0.99 ± 0.40. The average ε96Zr value reported here for CAIs (with the possible exception of Homer) is consistent with the most recent reports from other laboratories [14, 15]. Our complete Zr data set [4; this study] suggests that the CAI-forming region was mostly homogenous with respect to Zr isotopes. The enrichment in the r-process isotope 96Zr is consistent with the model proposed by [3, 16] to explain the systematic r-process enrichments and depletions observed in the isotopes of Sr, Mo, Ba, Nd, Sm, Gd, and Dy in the same set of Allende CAIs studied here.   Figure 1: Mass independent Zr isotopic composition of the CAIs analyzed here. The grey region shows the range of Zr isotopic composition previously reported for 8 Allende CAIs [4].  As evident in Fig. 1, Homer shows a resolvable excess in ε92Zr; it also has a higher higher Nb/Zr ratio compared to the other CAIs analyzed here. Taken together, the four non-Allende CAIs define a slope in a 92Nb-92Zr isochron plot that corresponds to an initial 92Nb/93Nb ratio of  (1.31 ± 0.72) × 10-5. This value is consistent with the Solar System initial 92Nb/93Nb ratio defined by an equilibrated ordinary chondrite and a eucrite clast [17], but does not agree with the higher initial 92Nb/93Nb ratio of ~10-3 suggested by earlier studies [18, 19]. The Cr isotopic compositions determined here for the four non-Allende CAIs are shown in Fig. 2; the ε53Cr show a significant range from -0.60ε to -0.01ε, and the ε54Cr values show a smaller range from 3.7ε to 4.7ε. Some of the variation in ε53Cr is due to the presence of radiogenic 53Cr from the decay of 53Mn. As such, we have subtracted a radiogenic 53Cr component that was estimated using the initial Solar System 53Mn/55Mn value of (6.28 ± 0.66) × 10-6 [20] and the Mn/Cr ratios measured in these samples (corrected data are shown as red symbols in Fig. 2). As suggested for the Allende CAIs [6], it is possible that the observed large variation in ε53Cr is the result of addition of Cr to the CAIs from their host matrix. If true, the implication then would be that the Cr isotopic composition of the CAI-forming reservoir in the nebula is homogenous as well. Titanium isotopic measurements of these non-Allende CAIs will be performed and will be used to assess this possibility further.     Figure 2: Chromium isotopic compositions of the 4 non-Allende CAIs studied here (solid colored circles) and of the Allende CAIs analyzed by [6] (open colored symbols); blue symbols are measured values, while red data indicate ε53Cr values that have been corrected for radiogenic 53Cr from decay of 53Mn. For comparison, previously published data for CAIs from Vigarano and Allende (grey circles, not corrected for radiogenic 53Cr) [20-24].
