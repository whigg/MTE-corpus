Introduction:  Geothermal heat flow (or to be more precise, the heat flux density) is an important quantity that constrains the thermal state of a planetary interior and, in turn, the thermal and chemical evolution of a telluric body. At present, in-situ measurements of surface heat flow are only available for the Earth and the Moon, and while a large number of measurements have been performed for the Earth, insitu measurements for the Moon have so far only been returned by the Apollo 15, and 17 missions [1]. The lack of direct measurements is mainly driven by the technical difficulties associated with drilling boreholes of sufficient depths.  For Mars, the InSight Discovery-class mission will conduct a direct measurement of the Martian planetary heat flow in 2018. The heat flow measurement planned with the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (HP3) is designed to measure a profile of thermal conductivity at 50 cm depth intervals to a final depth of up to 5 m, while simultaneously determining the thermal gradient over the same depth range [2]. For Mars, boreholes have to be deeper than on the Moon, because the presence of atmospheric gas in the regolith increases its thermal conductivity [3]. At the InSight landing site, this increase is expected to be a factor of two to five with respect to the lunar values [e.g., 4], which allows surface temperature perturbations to propagate deeper by a similar factor. Furthermore, insolation driven interannual variability affects the stability of the subsurface thermal gradient on Mars.  In this study, we focus on the influence of insolation changes driven by dust loading of the Martian atmosphere using a 5 Mars years (MY) time series of atmospheric dust opacity data spanning the time from MY 27 at Ls 90° to MY 32 at Ls 90° that was derived from Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity solar images. This dataset represents the longest continuous measurement of Martian atmospheric dust opacity available to date [5]. We address the influence of the observed interannual variability as well as the influence of global dust storm events similar to the MY 28 global storm on the subsurface thermal regime. Model:  We investigate the changes to the subsurface temperature field induced by insolation variations on interannual timescales. The subsurface temperature field is calculated by solving the one-dimensional heat conduction equation:      where T is temperature, t is time, z is depth, cp is heat capacity, and ρ(z) and k(z) are the depth dependent density and thermal conductivity of the regolith, respectively. The above equation is solved using a constant heat flow Fb at the bottom of the computational domain, while at the surface, we prescribe the radiative balance:    where A is the surface albedo, S is the total solar radiative flux including scattered radiation, R is the thermal radiative flux from the atmosphere towards the surface, T is the kinetic temperature of the surface, k(z0) is the thermal conductivity of the top regolith layer, ε is surface emissivity, and σ the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.  The downward solar (S) and atmospheric thermal IR (R) fluxes have been calculated using the atmospheric dust optical depth values measured by the Opportunity rover camera between MY 27 and MY 32.   Figure 1: 880 nm dust optical depth through Mars years MY 27 - MY 32 as obtained from measurements performed by MER-B Opportunity.  Dust optical depth measurements serve as input parameters to the KRC model [6], and the resulting solar and IR fluxe time series are used to calculate the surface boundary condition for the subsurface temperature model by periodically repeating the data. 1945.pdf

The heat conduction equation is solved together with the boundary conditions using a finite element method, which was implemented using the commercial COMSOL Multiphysics® 4.4 package. In order to guarantee dynamic equilibrium, the models are usually run for about 400 Martian years. Results:  Surface temperature perturbations propagate to depth depending on their periodicity, and penetration depths on diurnal, annual, and interannual timescales differ significantly. In order to determine the average annual heat flow as a function of depth, subsurface temperatures need to be averaged for a full Martian year, thus averaging out perturbations on shorter timescales such as the diurnal and annual temperature waves. In Fig. 2, we show results for two conductivity endmember cases considering a low conductivity case with average k close to 0.025 W m-1 K-1 (Fig. 2a) and a high conductivity case with average k ≈ 0.05 W m-1 K-1 (Fig. 2b).  Figure 2: Annual average heat flow as a function of depth for MY 27 to MY 32. A background planetary heat flow of 20 mWm-2 has been assumed. a) Heat flow for the low thermal conductivity model. Perturbations drop below 3 mWm-2 at a depth of 1 m. b) Same as a) but for the high thermal conductivity model. Perturbations drop below 3 mWm-2 at a depth of 2 m.  In the low thermal conductivity case, perturbations to the subsurface (planetary) heat flow (here prescribed to be 20 mW m-2) are below 2 mWm-2 for depths below 1 m for MY 27/32, MY 30, and MY 31, reflecting differences in surface temperature forcing associated with interannual variability of atmospheric dust loading. Cooling of the surface during the MY 28 global dust storm results in increased heat flow near the surface, and the perturbation propagates to depth in the following year, where the average annual background (planetary) heat flow is perturbed by up to 1.5 m Wm-2 to a depth of 2 m. Heat flow below 3 m is within ±1 mWm-2 of the planetary background flow (Fig. 2a). In the high conductivity case, as expected, perturbations reach to greater depth. During MY 27/32, MY 30, and MY 31 the background heat flow is perturbed by 2 mW m-2 to a depth of 2 m, while surface cooling during the MY 28 event leads to an increase of more than 5 mW m-2 up to  a depth of 1.5 m in MY 28 and 2.5 mW m-2 at a depth of 3 m during MY 29 (Fig. 2b). Conclusions: Our results show that the background planetary heat flow is superposed by dust storm induced perturbations of less than 1.5 mW m-2 at depths below 2 m if regolith thermal conductivity is low and around 0.025 W m-1 K-1. For larger thermal conductivities (around 0.05 W m-1 K-1) perturbations decay to values smaller than 2.5 mW m-2 at depths below 3 m. Overall, the influence of interannual variability on subsurface heat flow is found to be moderate following a global dust storm. Moreover, the heat pulse associated with global dust storm events can only be observed in the subsequent Mars year (MY 29), while heat flow returns to pre-storm values thereafter. Regional dust storms are of shorter duration and even smaller magnitude, thus a smaller effect is observed for such events.   [1] Langseth M. G. et al. (1976) LPS VII, 3143–3171. [2] Spohn T. et al.
