Introduction: Studies of the lunar crust composition, its lateral and vertical heterogeneities are crucial to constrain the magmatic and thermal evolution of the Moon [1]. To address this, several studies have been conducted on the central peaks of impact craters using various remote sensing datasets: Clementine data [2], Diviner Lunar Radiometer data [3], Kaguya Multiband Imager data [4] or the Moon Mineralogy Mapper data [5]. The final overall goal of this study is to evaluate the lunar crust organization and compositional variations around the crust-mantle boundary at a global scale. Here, the reflectance data of the Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M³) are used to study the composition of a pre-selection of 10 craters central peaks scattered on the lunar surface. These craters were selected based on their spectral coverage with M³ data and their proximity values to the crust-mantle interface (between +10 km and −10 km), as described in [6] and calculated in [7]. M³ is a hyperspectral imager with the best spatial resolution (140 m/pixel or 280 m/pixel) and spectral range available, with 85 spectral channels spanning from 430 to 3000 nm [8]; allowing for optimal accuracy in determining surface mineralogy. With such a large amount of information, automatic processing of data is important to be able to study a wide area of the lunar crust. The mineralogy of the central peaks extracted from the M³ analysis will also be analyzed with other datasets to provide information about the peaks’ morphology (LROC images) and topography (LOLA data). This method will be applied to a wider selection of craters in the near future. Method:  Spectral data processing. We have developed a custom-made IDL routine that automatically removes a linear continuum on the M³ reflectance spectra and defines the band centres locations. The routine first identifies the continuum tie points, by maximizing the area of lunar mafic minerals and plagioclase absorption bands at 1000 and 2000 nm. The tie points are searched for in fixed intervals (620–1100 nm; 1100–1660 nm; 2420–2700 nm) on a smoothed spectrum in order to limit the noise influence on the tie points position. This approach is similar to the automatic detection of band centres from [9]. Continuum removal is performed by dividing the initial spectrum by the continuum interpolated spectrum. The two band centres location are extracted from the minimum reflectance of a 4th order polynomial fit around the absolute minimum (400 nm interval) of the original spectrum in the corresponding band. An example of a spectrum treated with this technique is shown in Figure 1-C. The intervals where the tie points and the band centre are searched for are optimized for the mafic minerals and plagioclase. Reflectance data from < 620 nm were not considered because of the low signal-to-noise ratio recovered in this part of the spectrum [10]. Reflectance data beyond 2700 nm were not looked into: the thermal calibration is not optimal in this spectral domain [11] and hydroxyl and water signatures, which are able to significantly change the location of the tie points, have been detected [8]. Mineralogic mapping. A good way to study large numbers of spectra is to generate spectral parameters maps such as the integrated band depth for the 1 and 2 microns absorption bands of the mafic minerals (Figure 1-B). Compositional variations are easily viewed with coloured compositions of these spectral parameters. Parameters maps are then exported in ArcGIS and combined with other datasets to infer the context of the detections. Preliminary results: Figure 1 shows a M³ mosaic of Compton crater (A). A portion of the M³ mosaic (covering the central peak of Compton crater) is used as the input of the spectral fitting routine (square in A). A RGB colour composite mosaic with three of the output spectral parameters is shown in B. This colour composite highlights pyroxene mixtures in green, orthopyroxene in purple, high-calcium pyroxene in yellow and plagioclase in red [9]. Compton crater is one of the list of pre-selected craters that we use as test cases to develop the algorithm. Its central peaks appear in yellowish green and purple in the selected colour composite. A spectrum has been taken on the central peak (green cross in Figure 1-A). It displays diagnostic absorption bands of low-iron orthopyroxenes [12], whereas the yellowish green coloured central peak is composed of highcalcium pyroxenes. Discussion and further work: Table 1 shows Compton crater proximity values to the crust-mantle 1970.pdf

The square shows the emplacement of the central peak, where the parameters maps (colour composite in B) has been calculated with our spectral fitting method. R: 1000 nm absorption band centre position; G: 2000 nm absorption band centre position; B: 1000 nm absorption band area. This colour composite highlights pyroxene mixtures in green, orthopyroxene in purple, high-calcium pyroxene in yellow and plagioclase in red [9]. The pixels were the reflectance at 730 nm is lower than 0.045 were discarded and mapped in black. C: M³ orthopyroxene spectrum obtained with the custom-made routine. It comes from Compton crater central peak (green cross in 1-A). (1) The original spectrum (thick black line) is smoothed (red line) to allow the tie points research. After the tie points are found (gray vertical segments), the continuum is modelled as linear segments between the tie points (green lines). (2) Spectrum after continuum removal (thick black line). After the band minima are found (dotted blue lines), a polynomial fit (orange curve) ± 200 µm around the band minimum of the 1000 nm absorption band and ± 400 µm around the band minimum of the 2000 nm absorption band is performed. The minimum of this polynomial fit is the band centre (dashed orange line). boundary, as calculated from GRAIL [13] and Clementine crust thickness models [14] and crater laws (e.g., [15]). These models give different crustal thicknesses at this location, based on various assumptions on the crust properties (e.g., porosity, number of layers). Mission Crust thickness model Proximity value (km) Clementine Model 1 +15.45 Model 2 +7.30 Model 3 +16.69 GRAIL Model 1 +0.38 Model 2 +0.84 Model 3 +8.09 Model 4 +7.64 Table 1: Proximity value to the crust-mantle boundary, calculated from Clementine and GRAIL crust thickness models [13,14]. If the proximity value is positive, the mantle material should not have been excavated by the impact. On the contrary, if the proximity value is negative, the impact potentially exposed material from below the crust-mantle boundary in the central peak of the resulting crater [6]. Further work should be focused on adding modes for spinel detection. The routine will then be used to study additional craters displaying a proximity value close to the crust-mantle boundary, to investigate whether this pyroxene signature is linked to an increase of the mafic content of the lunar crust with depth as proposed by [2], or simply linked to vertical and lateral heterogeneities [3]. Other craters that have been selected to test our approach include Bailly, Bel’Kovich, Clavius, Compton, Fabry, Korolev, Humboldt, Milne, Petavius and Schwarzschild. Results of the spectral fitting on these craters central peak or peak ring, and combination of the results with other datasets will be detailed during the conference.
