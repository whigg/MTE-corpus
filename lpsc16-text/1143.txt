Crater Detection via Convolutional Neural NetworksJoseph Paul Cohen, Henry Z. Lo, Tingting Lu, and Wei Ding at the University of Massachusetts Boston ({joecohen,henryzlo, ding}@cs.umb.edu, lutingting@buaa.edu.cn)IntroductionCraters are among the most studied geomorphic featuresin the Solar System because they yield importantinformation about the past and present geologicalprocesses and provide information about the relative agesof observed geologic formations. We present a methodfor automatic crater detection using advanced machinelearning to deal with the large amount of satellite imagerycollected.The challenge of automatically detecting craterscomes from their is complex surface because their shapeerodes over time to blend into the surface. Bandeira [1]provided a seminal dataset that embodied this challengethat is still an unsolved pattern recognition problem tothis day. There has been work to solve this challengebased on extracting shape [2] and contrast [1, 3] featuresand then applying classification models on those features.The limiting factor in this existing work is the use ofhand crafted filters on the image such as Gabor or Sobelfilters or Haar features. These hand crafted methodsrely on domain knowledge to construct. We wouldlike to learn the optimal filters and features based ontraining examples. In order to dynamically learn filtersand features we look to Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) which have shown their dominance in computervision [4]. The power of CNNs is that they can learnimage filters which generate features for high accuracyclassification.CNNs are organized as a computation graph wherethe input image has computations performed on it andproduce an output, then this output has computationsperformed on it, and this is repeated until an output layerwhich contains a prediction. There are many componentsto these networks but the most significant part to discussis the convolutional layer and the fully connected layer.First we talk about a convolutional layer becausethis is the interface between the input image and thenetwork. In Figure 1 the process of a convolutionallayer is shown. A sliding window is ran across theinput image with a convolution applied at each position.Each pixel is multiplied by the corresponding filtervalue and summed together which results in a singlevalue. A picture is formed from the results of theseconvolutions. This design is important because spatialinformation is maintained to be used later in the network.In this example the filter values appear to be a sobelfilter however the filters learned will be much different.During the learning process the values of the filters willbe altered to minimize classification error of the entirenetwork.Next we talk about a fully connected layer.

These layers contain many nonlinearunits. A nonlinear unit is a transformation hθ(x) whichproduces a single value where θ is a vector of weights.The most modern practice is to use a rectified linearunit (ReLU): hθ(x) = max(0,∑i=0 θixi).

Each layer is identifiedwith a letter and lines show processing from left to right.We combine the convolutional layers with fullyconnected layers in a specific configration that hasachieved good performance on crater detection in Figure2. Layer (a) is a 15x15 input image. Each candidateexample is scaled to this size. Layers (b) and (c) areconvolutional layers with 20 filters each of size 4x4.Each filter is passed over the filter in a sliding windowfashion with a stride of 1 pixel. Unlike similar networkswe don’t use a pooling layer as it achieved poor results.Layer (d) is a fully connected layer where each elementof this layer is the result of hθ(x) with unique θs foreach element. Layer (e) has just two outputs; eachcorresponding to a class. A softmax regression is used1143.pdf

2Figure 3: A crater and non-crater candidate are processedby the first convolutional layer. Eight filters withinteresting activation patterns are shown to the right ofeach candidate image in false color. Values are scaledand then colored to make these values visible and tomaximize contrast within each square with blue = lowand red = high.so that the results can be interpreted as a probabilitydistribution between craters and non-craters.The filter and θ values throughout the network areinitialized randomly and incrementally modified usingstochastic gradient descent to minimize classificationerror [4]. The term epoch is a training cycle that includesevery training example. We omit the discussion on howtraining works for space.We can visualize the filters learned for craters to gaininsight into what features are important to classification.We visualize 8/20 filters for layer (b) on a crater andnon-crater image in Figure 3. The filters, althoughcrude, can be seen to show vertical edges as well assegmentation. The filters are learned based on what isnessary to minimize classification error on the trainingdata so they do not directly relate to what a crater is butmay be focusing on what is not a crater.EvaluationWe use Banderia’s [1] dataset1 to evaluate and compareour method. It originates from the nadir panchromaticimagery footprint h0905 0000 that was captured by theHRSC aboard the Mars Express spacecraft. This datasetis composed of 6 tiles (1700x1700 pixels each) withresolution 12.5m/pixel. A domain expert has labeled3658 craters across all tiles. Banderia utilized Urbachand Stepinski’s [2] highlight and shadow algorithm toavoid brute force sliding window candidate generationand reduce the total number of candidates that mustbe evaluated. This pre-processing step results in 2022craters and 2888 non-craters across all tiles. The resultsof this pre-processing is what has been used in prior workand is used in our evaluation as well.Prior work has used the F1-Score andcross-validation to evaluate their methods. TheF1-Score is the harmonic mean between precision andrecall: F1 = 2·precision·recallprecision+recall . 10-Fold cross validationis a testing procedure where the dataset is randomlydivided into 10 sections and then each section is selected1http://kdl.cs.umb.edu/w/datasets/craters/Region Urbach‘09Bandeira ‘10Ding ‘11CNNWest (1 24+1 25) 67.89 85.33 83.98 88.78Center (2 24+2 25) 69.62 79.35 83.02 88.81East (3 24+3 25) 79.77 86.09 89.51 90.29Table 1: F1-score via 10-fold cross validation.West 1 24 Center 2 24 East 3 24West 1 25 Center 2 25 East 3 25Figure 4: Labels of each crater dataset tile.as a testing set while the remainder is used as a trainngset with the resulting F1-Score averaged together.Our results are shown in Table 1. The scores wereobtained from the respective papers with the exceptionof “Urbach ’09” which was obtained from [1] where itis used as a baseline comparison. Our CNN approach istrained for 500 epochs during each fold evaluation. Ourproposed CNN method obtains a higher score than allexisting methods. We conclude that convolutional neuralnetworks have a large potential to significantly changethe way crater detection is performed. We believe furtherimprovements to the design of the computation graph canincrease performance much higher.References[1] L. Bandeira, W. Ding, and T. F.
