ROCK SURFACE CRUSHER DRIVEN WITH SOLENOID BY PLANER MOTION FOR LUNAR EXPLORATION.  K. Furutani1 and H. Kamiishi1, 1Toyota Technological Institute, 12-1, Hisakata 2-chome, Tempaku-ku, Nagoya 468-8511 Japan, furutani@toyota-ti.ac.jp   Introduction:  Many drilling or coring devices have been developed for in-situ inspection in future lunar scientific exploration. A weathered rock surface should be removed and smoothed to investigate its composition precisely. To avoid the tool damage, sharp or thin tools are inappropriate. Therefore, the percussive crushers are preferable [1-4]. Large amplitude of the tool vibration is needed for smoothing a rough surface. Although the ultrasonic vibration applies a large impact, its amplitude is too small. A solenoid is good for generating a large vibration amplitude and impulsive force [5]. However, ridges remained by one-direction feeding of a workpiece.  This report demonstrates the performance of twodimensional feeding during crushing to decrease the ridges. Structure of Percussive Crusher:  Fig. 1 shows a structure of a percussive crusher with a solenoid. It measures 59 mm × 60 mm × 129 mm excluding a sensor attachment, and weighs 490 g. Frames were made of aluminum alloy (JIS A2014/ ASTM 2014). The solenoid was composed of an E- and I-cores with a 200-turn coil. A sinusoidal voltage was applied at an amplitude of 24 Vp-p and a mechanical resonant frequency of 50 Hz. The current varied from 1.5 to 2.0 A by the gap length between the core and upper frame. The average and peak power consumption was 6.0 and 25.7 W, respectively. A thrust force was applied with two coil springs with each spring constant of 0.5 kN/m. A 10-mm square tool bit with 1-mm pitch pyramids was made of cemented carbide. The tool holder was skewed by 11.4º not to overlap the trails of the pyramids in addition to non-skewed one.  Fig. 2 shows an XY stage for planer motion. It measures 171 mm × 70 mm × 128 mm and weighs 1.8 kg. A stage with a combination of a stepping motor with a feedscrew and a slider-crank mechanism driven with a stepping motor reduced with a strain wave gearing were used for feeding in the x- and y-directions, respectively. A slide guide was made of polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE). A control program was written in LabVIEW. Control points were randomly generated just before the beginning of each motion, and the feeding trajectory was generated by a linear interpolation with a grid of 0.05 mm. The top of the pyramids were 20 μm and the vibration frequency was 100 Hz. Consequently, the tops struck continuous trails on the rock at a feeding speed less than 1 mm/s.  The structure was mainly made of duralumin (JIS A2017/ ASTM 2017). The crusher was lifted or thrusted onto a workpiece with a combination of a stepping motor and a slide screw in the vertical direction.

slide screw and a nut are made of stainless steel (JIS SUS304/ AISI 304) and brass, respectively. Machining demonstration:  A terrestrial basalt block (Shizuoka, Japan), which has a similar structure and strength to a lunar mare basalt rock with dimensions of 20 mm × 20 mm × 10 mm was used for a workpiece. Figs. 3 and 4 show examples of the trajectories only in one direction and in the x- and y-directions, respectively. The stroke of the tool was 20 mm, and machined area was 5 mm wider on each side. Fig. 5 (a) shows the surface before machining. Pores which are originally contained were observed. Series of bumps were observed on a workpiece machined by the onedirection feeding as shown in Fig. 5 (b). No trail was observed by the planer motion as shown in Fig. 5 (c). Table 1 shows the comparisons of the arithmetic average surface roughness and maximum height. The planer motion and the tool skew did not allow only isometric and small roughness but also more removal amount due to removing debris. Acknowledgement:  The authors wish to thank Mr. Y.
