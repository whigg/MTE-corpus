SHORT-LIVED RADIOISOTOPE INJECTION INTO THE SOLAR NEBULA: FIRST 3DCALCULATIONS OF SHOCK INTERACTIONS WITH ROTATING PRESOLAR CLOUDMODELS. Alan P. Boss & Sandra A. Keiser, DTM, Carnegie Institution (boss@dtm.ciw.edu).The presence of live 60Fe during the formation ofchondrites [1,2] has long been seen as the strongestargument in favor of the injection of 60Fe and othershort-lived radioisotopes (SLRIs) into the presolarcloud [3] (or the solar nebula [4]) by a shock waveemanating from a Type II supernova (SNe) thatsynthesized the SLRIs. However, recent work haslowered the inferred initial abundances of 60Fe [5]to values that are more consistent with the galacticbackground abundance rather than a nearby supernova [6]. This explanation might require the highlevels of initial 26Al found in chondrites to be derived from a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star wind, whichis expected to be rich in 26Al and poor in 60Fe[6]. Scenarios have also been advanced for accounting for the inferred levels of both 60Fe and 26Althrough supernova injection into giant molecularclouds [7,8,9], though abundance problems remain.The presence of live 26Al in refractory inclusions (e.g., CAIs) was the original motivation forthe SNe trigger hypothesis. The fact that the FUNrefractory inclusions show no evidence for live 26Al,coupled with the significant 26Al depletions foundin some CAIs and refractory grains, implies thatthese refractory objects may have formed prior tothe injection, mixing, and transport of 26Al into therefractories-forming region of the solar nebula [10,11, 12]. The 26Al data alone, therefore, seem to require the late arrival of SLRIs derived from a SNeinto the inner region of the solar nebula, as opposedto injection into a giant molecular cloud.Detailed hydrodynamical modeling has shownthat SNe shock waves are the preferred means forsimultaneously achieving triggered collapse of thepresolar cloud and injection of SLRIs carried bythe shock wave [13]. WR star winds are likely toshred cloud cores rather than induce collapse [13].These studies also showed that injection into a rotating cloud can increase injection efficiencies by asmuch as a factor of 10. However, the models [13]were restricted to axisymmetry (2D). Other previous models have studied shock wave interactionswith fully 3D cloud cores [14]. However, these 3Dclouds were not assumed to be rotating. Here weextend the modeling effort to consider rotating 3Dtarget clouds.The rotating presolar clouds are similar to thosepreviously studied in 2D [13]: 2.2 M⊙ cloud coreswith radii of 0.053 pc, rotating with angular velocities of either Ω = 10−14 or 10−13 rad s−1. Theshock waves propagate along the rotation axis atspeeds of vs = 20 or 40 km s−1, shock widths ofws = 3 × 10−3 or 3 × 10−4 pc, and shock densities ranging from ρs = 3.6 × 10−19 to 2.1 × 10−17g cm−3. Most of the clouds were triggered intocollapse. Several of the clouds with Ω = 10−13 collapsed and fragmented into multiple protostars.The figures show the results for two models withvs = 40, ws = 3×10−4, and ρs = 7.2×10−18 in theprevious units. Model H, with Ω = 10−13, formed alarge (∼ 500 AU radius) protostellar disk with spiral arms that might undergo fragmentation, whilemodel L, with Ω = 10−14, formed a smaller diameter (∼ 150 AU radius) protostellar disk with a single protostar. The injection efficiency fi, defined[13,14] as the fraction of the incident shock wavematerial that is injected into the collapsing cloudcore, was fi ∼ 0.03 for both models H and L, identical to fi for the non-rotating-cloud version of thissame model [14]. This differs from the expectationsof the 2D models [13], where it was found that rotation could increase fi by a factor as large as 10.However, the rotating 2D models studied only thestandard shock (ρs = 3.6× 10−20, ws = 3 × 10−3),whereas models H and L considered denser, thinnershocks that are much more conducive to injectionthan the standard shock [13], so that the additionof rotation did not increase the injection efficiencyfurther. Other shock assumptions can result in rotation leading to increased fi, provided the shockis aligned with the rotation axis [13].References: [1] Tachibana, S., et al. (2006), ApJ,639, L87.
