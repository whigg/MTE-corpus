Introduction:  Primitive COs are of considerable interest because they preserve the highest abundances of presolar silicates in their matrices. This is presumably because they experienced low degrees of both metamorphism and aqueous alteration. The insoluble organic matter (IOM) is a sensitive indicator of metamorphism, with IOM becoming less abundant and more ‘graphitic’ with increasing metamorphism [1-5]. Since IOM is the major C-bearing component of chondrites and the C isotopic composition of IOM tends to also change during metamorphism, bulk C abundances and isotopic compositions may be useful preliminary indicators of petrologic type. Similarly, bulk H abundances and isotopes can be useful indicators of the degree of aqueous alteration [6]. Bulk C and H abundances and isotopes in a small suite of CO3s were used to identify DOM 08006 as a potentially very primitive CO3. A subsequent presolar grain search showed that it has the highest matrix-normalized presolar silicate abundance of any chondrite [7]. Hence, we have begun a more extensive survey to look for more very primitive COs, as well as to possibly identify relatively unaltered CMs, like Paris, that have been misclassified.  Methods:  0.5-3g samples were acquired of 17 relatively large and primitive CO3s (Table 1). The samples were crushed to a grain size of <150 µm. Aliquots were then analyzed for the bulk H, C and N (Table 1, Fig. 1) according to [8], for the H, C and N in their IOM (Table 2) according to [9], and for their bulk mineralogy by XRD [10]. Results: The range of bulk C contents and isotopic compositions is considerable, and the meteorites appear to fall into several groups that do not fully agree with their pairings (Table 1). The bulk H abundances and δD values also exhibit a considerable spread (Fig. 1). Most of the meteorites cluster in a single group (H=0.3-0.4 wt.%, δD=-80 to 90‰), but there is a linear trend to higher H contents and lighter isotopic compositions that is most obvious in the two most weathered meteorites (MIL 03442 and MIL 090785) and MIL 090073. The two DOM 08006 samples and ALH 77307 have the highest bulk δD values of any of the COs measured here. IOM abundances and H, C, and N compositions have been determined for a subset of the CO3s (Table 2). The upper ranges of H/C ratios and δD values are higher than previously reported for COs [9].

The XRD measurements show that all the CO3s are dominated by olivine and pyroxene, but also contain abundant amorphous material (23-37 vol.%) and very low abundances of poorly crystalline phyllosilicates (0-3 vol.%) [10]. Neither the abundances of amorphous material nor phyllosilicates appear to correlate with light element abundances or weathering grade. BUC 10943, classified as a CO3, is a typical CM with a petrologic type of 1.4 on the scale of [6]. Discussion:  The high C content of DOM 08006 suggests that it is less metamorphosed that ALH 77307, which would be consistent with the higher presolar grain abundance of DOM 08006 matrix [7] and its lower petrologic type based on the Cr contents of its olivine [12]. However, variations in matrix abundance can also produce a range of bulk C contents. There is no indication that DOM 08006 has ~50% more matrix than ALH 77307 as the difference in their C contents 2667.pdf

would require. On the other hand, olivine Cr measurements for DOM 10104 suggest that it has a higher petrologic type than ALH 77307. Consequently the ~58% difference in C contents between ALH 77307 and the three meteorites in the DOM 10104 group in Table 1 is probably due to variations in matrix contents. The most metamorphosed of the COs is MIL 090785, and based on its C content it has a petrologic type that is similar to Isna (i.e., ~3.7).  Fig. 1. The bulk H abundances and isotopic compositions.  As can be seen in Fig. 1, the variation in H abundances and isotopic compositions of most of the COs suggest two component mixing, with one component of ~0.3 wt.% H and δD≈-80‰ and another whose composition is probably similar to MIL 090785. The MIL 090785-like component is most likely a terrestrial weathering product.  Table 2. IOM elemental and isotopic compositions.

There is a suggestion that DOM 08006 and ALH 77307 form a separate trend but with the same or similar terrestrial component as the other meteorites. If correct, ALH 77307 seems to be more weathered, which may in part explain why it has a lower presolar silicate abundance in its matrix than DOM 08006. One possible explanation for the steeper trend for DOM 08006 and ALH 77307 compared to the other meteorites are higher IOM H abundances and/or higher δD values in the two more primitive meteorites. IOM H/C ratios and δD values can also be used as indicators of metamorphic grade [1, 9]. The higher H/C of DOM 08006 IOM is significantly higher than any other CO3, consistent with DOM 08006 being the most primitive CO identified to date. CO and OC IOM exhibit a very similar range of correlated H/C and N/C ratios. The similarity in IOM H/C ratios between DOM 08006 and Semarkona (Table 2) suggests that they experienced similar thermal histories. However, there is a dramatic difference in their δD values, indicating that they either had somewhat different IOM precursors or that temperature was not the only influence on IOM δD values during parent body processing [9].  IOM contributes 2-7 % of the H in the COs analyzed, with the highest contribution in DOM 08006. However, the IOM compositions do not lie on the extensions of the trends in Fig. 1 (or in a plot of H/C vs. δD). This suggests that there is at least one additional H-bearing component in these meteorites. There is not enough non-IOM C for the component to be organic unless it is much more isotopically anomalous than the IOM. Thus, it is more likely that the component is H in phyllosilicates and/or amorphous material. The bulk H content of DOM 08006 is much higher than for Semarkona (0.123 wt.%, [8]). Yet unlike Semarkona, phyllosilicates were not found in DOM 08006 matrix [12], leaving hydrated amorphous material as the most likely additional H-bearing component. Conclusions: Despite surveying 17 primitive COs, DOM 08006 remains the most primitive CO that we have identified. The elemental composition of its IOM suggests that it experienced similar thermal conditions to Semarkona. DOM 08006 is more hydrated than Semarkona, and it is unclear why presolar silicates are so much more abundant in DOM 08006 matrix. References: [1] Alexander C.M.O'D. et al. (2007) GCA, 71, 4380.
