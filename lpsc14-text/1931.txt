Baragiola1, 1Laboratory for Atomic and Surface Physics, 351 McCormick Rd, Thornton Hall B 113, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22904.    Introduction: Visible and near-infrared spectra of a number of the Transneptunian objects (TNOs, which include Pluto and Charon) and Centaurs have shown that their surface is composed of ices containing primarily H2O, CH4 and N2 with smaller amounts of NH3, CH3OH, C2H6, CO, CO2, and HCN. The relative amounts of different constituents vary among the TNOs observed so far; for instance, solid CO and N2 have been observed on Triton and Pluto, and CO2 has only been reported on Triton [1]. Spitzer’s observations of TNOs in the far-infrared have also suggested the presence of silicates and complex carbonaceous materials [2]. The Ralph visible and infrared spectrometer onboard New Horizons, due to reach Pluto in July 2015, is expected to constrain the surface composition of Pluto and Charon.  The surfaces of TNOs are continually processed by energetic cosmic rays, solar wind and photons. Some known effects of such radiation processing are the production of exospheres via sputtering, and changes in the surface composition via radiolysis. To understand these effects, we have irradiated porous water ice films loaded with methane (two dominant species of TNOs) with 100 keV H+ ions at 40 - 50 K. Irradiations were performed in the presence of ambient methane. We report two main findings from these experiments: (i) ion-induced enhancement of CH4 uptake by water ice and (ii) the formation of new species by radiation chemistry.  Experimental Procedures: The experiments were performed in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber with a base pressure of 10-9 Torr. Water ice films were vapordeposited at 45 incidence onto the optically flat gold electrode of a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) at 70 K. All films were deposited to a column density of 5000 ML H2O (1 ML = 1015 molec. cm-2), measured by the QCM. The 45 angle deposition results in films with ~21% porosity, as per previous estimates [3].  Following water ice deposition at 70 K, the films were cooled to temperatures between 40 K and 50 K and exposed to 13CH4 at ~7 (±1) x 10-7 Torr. The ice films were then irradiated at normal incidence with 100 keV protons from an ion accelerator with a magnetic mass filter. The ambient CH4 pressure was maintained during irradiation for a more realistic simulation of radiation processing of icy satellites and TNOs with surface-bound exospheres.  The ion fluxes were varied between 2 and 200 x 1010 H+ cm-2 s-1. The chemical changes in the films induced by ion irradiation were studied using infrared spectroscopy. Specular reflectance spectra of the films were collected at 35 incidence at 2 cm-1 resolution. The spectra R were divided by the reflectance spectrum R0 of the bare gold QCM substrate. The ratios were then converted to optical depth, -ln(R/R0). The areas of infrared absorption bands were calculated from the optical depth spectra after subtracting polynomial baselines that matched the absorption continuum.  Isotopic labeling was used to differentiate the 13Cbearing species from the adventitious 12C-bearing species that can accumulate in the film from spurious sources. Results and Discussion: I. Ion-induced enhancement in 13CH4 uptake: The QCM showed adsorption of methane within the pores of the water ice film at 40-50 K, following  admission of CH4 gas into the chamber. 0 3 6 9 12 1501020300 50 100 150 200 250010203040   (1015 CH4 eq. cm-2)Fluence (1014 H+ cm-2)13305190140196 13CH4 (100 keV H+) O2 (50 keV H+)  max (1015 CH4 eq. cm-2)Flux (1010 H+ cm-2 s-1)50 K Fig. 1: Top panel: Net ion-induced equivalent CH4 uptake (η) in 5000 ML H2O porous ice films vs. fluence during 100 keV H+ irradiation at 50 K, following a pre-irradation uptake of 78 ML from ~7 x 10-7 Torr CH4 exposure.

The uptake, resulting from the net effect of adsorption and thermal desorption, increased linearly with time and asymptotically approached an equilibrium value at which the adsorption and desorption rates were equal. Once the methane uptake equilibrated (to 384 ML at 40; 78 ML at 50 K), the films were irradiated with varying fluxes of 100 keV H+. Irradiation caused an increase in methane uptake, consistent with previous measurements with O2 and Ar [3]. The films were irradiated until a second, higher equilibrium in methane uptake was achieved. We show this second increase at 50 K as a function of ion fluence in  the top panel of Figure 1. In the bottom panel, the maximum of the irradiation-induced uptake, maxis plotted as a function of ion flux and compared to previous results using O2 [3]. The ion-induced enhancement in CH4 uptake decreases with increasing irradiation  flux.  We postulate two possible causes for the irradiation-enhanced increase in CH4 uptake: (i) the conversion of low- into high-energy binding sites for adsorption competing with pore collapse [3] and (ii) radiolytic dissociation of methane and water molecules, together with the subsequent recombination of radicals to form newer, less volatile species that bind to the ice more effectively than methane. The enhancement is largest at lower fluxes because additional gas can adsorb in the new sites with higher binding before pore collapse.  II. Radiation chemistry in methane-water ice: The amount of methane adsorbed into pores of the ice film at 40 K decreased during irradiation, as shown by the exponential decrease with ion fluence of the area of  the CH4 absorption band at 7.7 μm (1294 cm-1) (Top panel, Fig. 2). At high fluences, the band area of methane is at 8% of the initial value, suggesting processes that re-form methane from radiation products. Methane and water molecules are dissociated into radicals such as C, CHx, OH, O and H as a result of energy deposited by the ions. These radicals react to form other 13C-, H-, and O-containing species, including 13CO2, 13CO, 13CH3OH, and H2. The fluence dependence of the main infrared band areas of these species are shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 2. Other species such as HCO, H2CO3 CH3CHO, C2H5OH, C3H8, C2H6 and C3O2 have also been identified and details will be presented elsewhere.  Astrophysical Implications: These experiments suggest a new mechanism for gas trapping on the surfaces of TNOs with exospheres, such as Pluto [4], which are subject to low fluxes of energetic solar wind and cosmic rays. Further, we show that the radiationinduced chemistry of methane-water ice leads to formation of H2, CO, CO2, CH3OH, and other complex carbon-bearing species, most of which are released during heating to ~170 K, where the  ice film desorbs. In addition, we observe a non-volatile residue of complex carbonaceous species formed by irradiation that remains on the QCM even after it is taken to room temperature. This deposit may help explain reddening observed in the spectra of TNOs. Our results, particularly the identification of new species, should be helpful in the interpretation of spectral data to be obtained by New Horizons beginning in 2015. 1100 40 80 1200 40 80 1200.010.1110  8%residual 13CH4CH3OHH213CO   band area (cm-1)Fluence (1014 ion cm-2)13CO240 K Fig. 2.
