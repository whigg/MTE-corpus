Automated and Accurate: Making DTMs from LRO-NAC using the AmesStereo Pipeline. Zachary M. Moratto1,2, Scott McMichael1,2, Ross A. Beyer2,3, Oleg Alexandrov1,2, andTerry Fong1, 1NASA Ames Research Center, MS 269-3, Moffett Field, CA, USA, 2SGT Inc., and 3Carl Sagan Centerat the SETI Institute (Z.M.Moratto@nasa.gov)There are more than a thousand stereo pairs waitingto be processed from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter(LRO) Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) [1]. With the current rate of manual processing, this backlog of imagerywon't be completed until almost three decades from now.We present the Ames Stereo Pipeline (ASP) [2] softwareas a solution to this problem. ASP is a collection ofutilities that can take imagery and create a Digital Terrain Model (DTM). However the accuracy of this outputDTM is limited by the quality of the camera model provided in ISIS [3] and the spacecraft ephemeris. In thisabstract we present a method we've developed for correcting both errors.IntroductionCreating a DTM from the full observation of an LRONAC image requires compositing the LE and RE images before sending them to ASP. Simply compositingthe two images is incorrect since the LE and RE imagescome from two different optical assemblies that have avarying angle between their boresights, a delta betweentime capture, and a physical displacement between eachother. This accumulates into a slight perspective change.This can be corrected with ISIS's noproj utility, whichprojects the imagery off LOLA into an idealized camera.However even with this technique these projected imagesdisagree by some 40 pixels. The errors in most importantorder are (1) the spacecraft ephemeris has insufficent accurate position; (2) the boresight between optical assemblies of LRO-NAC change with temperature [4] and isnot modeled in ISIS; (3) the ISIS camera model does notmodel the translation between optics.AlgorithmA general outline of our technique follows below. Oursolution can be summarized as bundle adjusting all images and then using the sparse 3D representation of thesurface created by bundle adjustment to perform fittingagainst LOLA. We use the Ceres library [5] to performbundle adjustment. All other functions are performedwith ISIS, CSPICE [6], and Ames Stereo Pipeline.. Preprocess input imagery with lronac2isis,lronaccal, lronacecho.. Apply known position offset between CCDs bygiving custom FK kernels for each image withspiceinit utility.. Capture interest points between all 4 files that constitute a stereo pair (LE1, RE1, LE2, RE2).. Feed measurements to bundle adjustment algorithm parameterized to solve for rotation betweenLE and RE in single observations and rotation andtranslation between observations 1 and 2. Thisproduces 3 transforms that we then apply to eachfile's local ephemeris copy.. Generate sparse point cloud from interest pointmeasurements between all 4 images.. Use ASP 2.3+ utility pc align, an iterative closest point algorithm, to solve for transform betweensparse point cloud and raw LOLA measurements.. Apply transform from pc align to each files local ephemeris copy.. Perform noproj and handmos on ephemeris corrected images to create two images from the original four.. Feed mosaicked images to ASPs stereo utility forDTM generation.ResultsGoing through these efforts creates well-aligned imagerythat agrees with LOLA measurements better than the results created by ASU. From our limited run of 30 stereopairs we see that 90% of errors against LOLA are lessthan 5 meters. More importantly by correcting the relationship between LE and RE CCDs in each observationwe are able to remove the vertical edge seen in previous LRO-NAC DTMs created by ASP. This will benefitfuture hydrological studies that might use this datasets.Future WorkOur goal is to process all LRO-NAC stereo pairs using this method and deliver to the PDS by the end ofthis year. Our current efforts are improving ASP filtering techniques for determining outlier measurements.Once completed, we'll deploy the entire process described here on the Pleiades supercomputer. Our workwas funded graciously by NASA SMDs Lunar AdvancedScience and Exploration Research (11-LASER11-0112).We would also like to thank Mark Robinson and ASU forsupplying the LRO-NAC imagery.References[1] M.

(Center) Shown is the ASPresult with ephemeris corrections that were shown in this abstract. (Right) For comparison we show the DTM thatASU created from the same imagery. Notice it has simliar error characteristics as the ASU result with ephemeris andcamera model correction.Ghaemi, J. A. Schaffner, M. C. Malin, P. Mahanti, A. Bartels, J. Anderson, T. N. Tran, E. M.
