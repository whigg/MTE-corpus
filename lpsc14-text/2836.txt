3-D MORPHOMETRY OF MARTIAN SECONDARY IMPACT CRATERS FROM ZUNIL & GRATTERI W. A. Watters (wwatters@wellesley.edu), A. C. Radford; Dept. Astronomy, Whitin Observatory, Wellesley College We present a statistical study of shape characteristics measured from 3-D elevation models of secondary impact  craters  on Mars,  focusing on clusters  of  secondaries from the geologically recent impacts that formed Gratteri (D = 6.9 km) and Zunil craters (D = 10.4 km). We  find  that  proximal  secondaries  (downrange  distance r < 250 km, impact velocity v < 1 km/s) are sufficiently  well-preserved  to  exhibit  the  expected  features of low-velocity splash craters.  More distal secondaries  (r >  600  km,  v >  1.5  km/s)  exhibit  mean depth/diameter approaching values typical of fresh primary craters.       Characterizing the shapes of fresh and modified secondaries  may assist  with understanding the contribution of secondaries to the cratering record and the estimation of surface ages [1].  Secondary craters on Mars and the Moon can be used to test ideas about how impact crater morphology depends on impact energy [2]. Secondaries can also be used to estimate rates of modification in different materials and geological  settings, since  any given population of secondaries  formed at the same time [3].  Methods. Populations  of  secondary  impact  craters were  identified  in  THEMIS  images  as  belonging  to distinct  crater  rays  radiating from Gratteri  and Zunil craters [3, 4, 5], and captured by overlapping HiRISE images  [6].   Elevation  models  were  generated  from cropped HiRISE stereo images of the craters using the Ames Stereo Pipeline [7] after the images were radiometrically  calibrated,  mosaicked,  and  map-projected using USGS's ISIS software.   Crater rim crests were traced automatically using in-house Python scripts that find  the  maximum  elevation  along  radial  profiles, bridging  discontinuities  by  following ridges  of  local maxima.    We compute the distributions of four quantities: (1) “Tallest rim azimuth”: the azimuth of the line connecting the geometric center of the rim crest outline to the tallest position on the rim.  In low-angle splash craters, this azimuth normally points downrange [8]. (2) “Bottom-center azimuth”: the azimuth of the line connecting the geometric center of the rim crest outline to the crater's lowest point.  In low-angle splash craters, this azimuth points uprange [Ibid.]. (3) Major axis orientation:  the orientation (-90o to 90o) of the major axis of an ellipse that has been fitted to the rim crest outline. In  splash  craters,  rim  planforms  are  usually  aligned with the direction to the source  crater.   (4) We also compute the average crater depth/diameter ratio (d/D), where the depth is maximum crater depth (below ambient surface) plus the average rim height.          Results. Figures 1 through 3 show rose histograms for the three directional quantities described above as measured for a cluster of N = 370 secondary craters in a  ray emanating from Gratteri  Crater,  where  a  thick dashed line indicates the direction to Gratteri itself.  In this  cluster,  all  three  distributions have an excess  of counts  in  the  direction  anticipated  for  splash  craters [8]: that is, the morphological signature of the impact azimuth has been preserved, in a statistical sense.      Fig. 4 shows d/D computed for different clusters of secondaries as a function of increasing downrange distance  from Gratteri  and Zunil.  As expected,  d/D  increases with downrange distance  r.  If the most distal population on this plot has been correctly identified as Zunil secondaries (PSP_006762_1840), neglecting atmospheric drag and assuming ejection angles of between 30o and 45o we find that d/D approaches 0.2 for impact velocities as small as v ~ 1.5 km/s.       The deepest craters in Fig. 4 (largest  d/D) describe an “envelope” of the d/D vs. r relation.  If such a relationship can be established for the most pristine secondary  craters  in  typical  surface  materials,  then  this along with estimates of source crater age might be used to  estimate  an  upper  bound  on  local  rates  of  crater modification in the recent past.     Rays of secondary craters present a natural experiment that can be used to examine how d/D and other shape  characteristics  depend  on  downrange  distance (and impact velocity) [2].  The relationships discussed earlier  for  the  proximal  (r <  250  km)  Gratteri  secondary craters are not clearly visible in the Zunil populations,  some of which are only slightly more distal. This may be a consequence of the  slightly larger expected impact velocity,  or may relate to the effect of materials in which the craters formed or else the different  amounts  of  time elapsed  since  the  source  crater formed, or different rates of erosion and burial.    Going forward,  this work will  address the dependence of downrange distance for other shape characteristics such as planform asymmetry, rim roughness, and cavity and ejecta shape and volume.  With the advent of LROC stereo imagery, a similar analysis can be carried out for relatively fresh lunar secondaries in future. References:  [1] Calef, F.J. et al.

    Fig. 1: “Tallest-rim azimuth”: direction from geometric center of rim crest outline to the highest position on the rim. The rim is statistically taller in the downrange direction,  as  expected.  (Population  of  370 secondaries from Gratteri crater, HiRISE ESP_020922_1635.)Fig.  2: “Bottom-center azimuth”: direction from geometric center of rim crest outline to point of deepest crater cavity elevation (subset of population in Fig. 1). This  rose  diagram indicates  that  the  craters  are  lopsided, with the deepest point uprange of the planform center, as expected for splash craters. Fig. 3: Major axis orientation is preferentially aligned with the impact azimuth, as expected (subset of population in Fig. 1.)Fig. 4: Average depth/diameter for populations of secondary  impact  craters  versus  distance  from  source crater.  A downrange distance of 250 km corresponds to an impact velocity of ~1 km/s, and 600 km to ~ 1.5 km/s.  Vertical error bars represent uncertainty of mean values of d/D.  Horizontal error bars represent standard deviation  of  downrange  distances  of  craters  in  each population.2836.pdf
