ELEMENT REDISTRIBUTION IN METAMORPHISM OF CO CHONDRITES: IMPLICATIONS FOR EMERGING WORLDS.  D. S. Ebel1, M. K. Weisberg2,1, E. J. Crapster-Pregont3,1, 1American Museum of Natural History, Central Park West at 79th St., New York, NY 10024 (debel@amnh.org), 2Kingsborough College, CUNY, Brooklyn, NY 11235, 3Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, Palisades, NY, 10964, USA.   Introduction: The CO carbonaceous chondrites offer the clearest metamorphic sequence of the carbonaceous chondrite groups [1]. This sequence may be distinguished using a variety of criteria [2, 3]. Here, we provide data on inclusion and matrix chemical compositions for large areas of CO samples across petrologic grades from CO3.0 to CO3.7, and for Acfer094 (2ungr). Our analyses shed light on the chemical exchanges resulting from metamorphism, demonstrating apperent element mobility or lack thereof.  Methods: Samples are polished thin and thick sections of CO chondrites, and the ungrouped carbonaceous chondrite Acfer 094, with affinities to the CO group [3-5]. Surfaces were mapped at 1 to 3 µm/pixel resolution for the x-ray intensities of Mg, Ni, Ti, Al, CA (WDS) and S, Si and Fe (EDS) on the Cameca SX100 electron microprobe at AMNH. Conditions were 15KeV, 30 or 20 nA beam current, and 20 or 15 ms dwell time. Hand-drawn inclusion outlines formed the basis for detailed, pixel-by-pixel image analysis. We infer volume % of chondrite components directly from area % measurements [6, 7]. Fine-grained rims , small isolated olivine and metal/sulfide grains are considered part of the matrix. We have previously reported abundances of matrix and inclusions in Colony (CO3.0) and Kainsaz (CO3.2) [8], and Acfer094 (C2ung) [9]. Table 1: Samples. See text for notes.

C2-ung 1 10.453 from MfN  Our analyses now include bulk chemical data for each individual inclusion, and of matrix [10-12]. These data are reported as counts per pixel. We assume that the mean counts/pixel for each element across every pixel in a sample represents the bulk composition of that sample (e.g., for 1.0453329x107 pixels in Acfer094, mean Si/pxl ∝ wt% Si). For comparison of element distributions, we normalize all bulk compositions to bulk Colony composition. The same factor is used to normalize inclusion and matrix abundances. The assumption is that all these CO have identical major element bulk compositions. Table 1 reports the CO samples, origin, type as determined by [13, 2, 3], spatial resolution (microns/pixel), total area mapped and analyzed (mm2), and AMNH sample number. Acfer094 is from MfN, Berlin. Porosity has been reported by [14, 15].  Fig. 1: Change in Mg and Si with petrologic grade (arrows). Solid black  line joins bulk composition with the origin.  Fig. 2: Change in Fe and Mg with petrologic grade (arrows). Symbols as in Fig. 1. Results: The Mg-Si and Fe-Mg relations between CO chondrite matrix and inclusions (clasts) are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Inclusions (clasts) include all chondrules, CAIs and AOAs. Matrix includes isolated olivine and metal grains, and dark inclusions. The Mg/Si ratios of clasts and matrix approach the bulk CO value (~solar, black line) with increasing petrologic grade from Colony (3.0) to Warrenton (3.7), although Ornans (3.4) and Lancé (3.5) deviate slightly from this pattern. No such correlation of Mg/Si ratio with oxidation/reduction is observed in the CV chondrites [15]. In 1206.pdf

the CO chondrites, the mobile element appears to be Mg, rather than Si. In all chondrites, it is known that with increasing petrologic grade, Fe and Mg are increasingly redistributed between inclusions and matrix [16]. In Warrenton (3.7), and in CO 3.4 Ornans (but not in CO 3.5 Lancé), Fe is nearly equilibrated between inclusions and matrix. A reasonable interpretation is that Fe-Mg exchange between inclusions and matrix becomes more complete with increasing petrologic grade. This is qualitatively understood through petrological examination of CO chondrites. Here, we are able to quantitatively demonstrate these changes in chemical balances among components. Another way to understand these data is to calculate the total contribution to element counts across entire xray maps, from refractory inclusions (CAIs and AOAs), chondrules (including Al-rich chondrules), and matrix (Table 2). Normalized to area fraction, chondrule/matrix Fe is 0.45 (Colony) and 0.53 (Kainsaz) for the least equilibrated CO, and 0.99 (Warrenton) and 1.22 (Ornans) for the most equilibrated, with Lancé anomalous (0.62).

Fig. 3 illustrates the spread in inclusion compositions in Colony, matrix bulk composition (orange diamond), and bulk (all pixels, yellow square). A similar spread is observed in Kainsaz (CO3.2). Discussion: Chondrule and matrix compositions differ strongly (Figs. 1, 2, 3), yet CO chondrite bulk compositions are chondritic in major elements. Others have remarked on the fact that CO [10], CV [15, 18], CR[12, 17, 18] and other chondrites [11, 18] consistently have solar ratios of major elements independent from inclusion and matrix compositions or abundances of all components. This suggests that emerging planets formed from planetesimals that accreted locally from dust mixtures of solar composition that were variably processed, producing the heterogeneous inclusion populations observed in different chondrite classes. The chondritic meteorites represent such planetesimals.   Fig 3: Inclusion, matrix, and bulk major element compositions in Colony.
