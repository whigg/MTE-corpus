Introduction: From  analysis of impact craters and surface morphology using Voyager images researchers discovered Saturn's moon Dione has an interesting and unique history [e.g., 1-3]. Two terrains of great interest were identified - "wispy terrain" on the trailing hemisphere and "smooth plains" on the leading - along with the possibility of multiple impactor populations. However, the formation timing and mechanisms for terrains on Dione,  and the bombardment history, could not be reliably determined from the modest Voyager imaging. Cassini ISS cameras  have  provided higher resolution images and global coverage of several of the Saturnian satellites,  including  Dione.  Analyzing  these  images yields new information on the extent and formation of Dione's unique terrains  and its bombardment history. In previous work [4,5],  we presented preliminary results  on  compiling  and  analyzing  a  "global"  crater database  for  diameters  (D)  ≥4  km.  Here  we  now present the complete database and improved inferences for Dione's resurfacing and bombardment history. Methods: The database  is  built  by measuring  the position and diameter of identified impact craters on controlled  Cassini ISS  images of Dione.  Images used have pixel scales ranging from ~200-400 m/pixel  and solar incidence angles between 45-80º.  Therefore, we chose a conservative  D=4 km for the database  minimum to avoid issues related to resolution or incidence angle. The  total area  encompassed by the database is indicated by all colored regions in Fig. 1a. After the crater database is completed, spatial crater density  maps  are  generated  using  a  counting  circle analysis (e.g., Figs. 1b, c). In this analysis, a circle of 10º radius is positioned every 5º in latitude and longitude and the number of craters  within the defined diameter range per circle area is computed. Densities calculated near the area boundary (black lines in Figs. 1b, c) are excluded due to edge effects. Using  these  spatial  density  maps  and  the  original images, geologic units (colored regions in Fig. 1a) are then subjectively defined based upon changes in crater density and  surface morphology (e.g., surface roughness). The crater size-frequency distributions (CSFDs) are then presented for each unit in the relative (R) plot format [6; Fig. 2].  Symbol colors in the R-plot (Fig. 2) correspond to unit colors in Fig. 1a. Results: We  have  identified  7 geologic  units  for Dione (Figs. 1a, 2). The red and orange units have the highest crater density  and  are called  the  "Red or Orange Dense Cratered Terrain (RDCT or ODCT)". The only difference between the two is that the red unit has a higher crater density for D<10 km (Fig. 1b). The yellow unit, which we call the "Average Cratered Terrain (ACT)",  has  a  slightly  lower  crater  density  than  the RDCT/ODCT, but  is  higher than the  other units. The green  unit,  which  covers  most  of  the  trailing  hemisphere, has lower crater density for D<30 km than the ACT,  but  equivalent  density  for  larger  craters.  This unit also contains the "wispy terrain", large  fault  systems,  and  several  impact  basins  (D>100 km);  therefore, we call this the "Fault and Basin Terrain (FBT)". The blue-green unit, which covers most of the leading hemisphere,  has  higher  crater  density  for  D<10  km than the FBT, but lower density for larger craters. This unit also has a smooth morphology, so we call it the "Smooth  Terrain  (ST)".  The  blue  unit,  which  is  the smallest, has a unique crater distribution with a very low crater density for D<10 km increasing up to a very high crater density for large craters. This unit also contains  four  relatively  fresh,  large  (D>60  km)  craters; therefore, we call  it the "Recent Large Craters Terrain (RLCT)". Finally, the purple unit, which is located on Evander basin, has a  low crater density at all diameters. Due to this unit's location we call it the "Evander Terrain (ET)". Discussion:  The RDCT and ET are the only units that do not have a decreasing crater density for  D<10 km (Fig. 2). We suggest this can be explained by either of two possibilities. (1) Some process(es) is increasing small crater density on these two  units and the other units' CSFDs  represent  the  primary  small  impactor SFD. (2) Some process(es) is removing small craters on the other  terrains  and the RDCT and ET CSFDs represent  the  primary  small impactor  SFD.  We note that an evolving small impactor population is NOT the likely answer as both CSFD shapes are seen on terrains of varying relative ages (vertical position in Fig. 2). In  support of  hypothesis  #1,  the  decreasing  small crater density is seen on other inner saturnian satellites: Mimas, Enceledus, and Tethys [7,8]. Furthermore, the ET small crater density could be increased by formation of Evander secondary craters  [8]. However, it  is not clear how the RDCT small crater density would be increased.  No recent  basins  are  found  near this unit, nor is it located  on the hemisphere opposite (trailing) to Evander (leading) where "sesquinaries" (ejecta that escapes  the  satellite,  then  impacts  [e.g.,  9])  are  expected to form [10]. The latter may imply further work should be done on sesquinary formation, especially for basins formed at  high latitudes.  Moreover,  the varia tion seen in the CSFD shape for  D>20 km among the other units cannot be explained. In  support of  hypothesis  #2,  there  is  considerable observational evidence on Dione for processes that effectively erase small craters:  cratering,  tectonism,  and cryovolcanism. In the ODCT, ACT, and RLCT, observations of large craters suggests that subsequent cratering would be the primary process. Meanwhile, within the FBT, observations of faults and recent, large craters implies  tectonism and cratering are the processes acting there.  Finally,  the observations of  volcanic vents and smooth surface [11]  and few large craters  within the  ST,  indicates  that  cryovolcanism  is  the  process. However,  again the reason why the RDCT retained a higher small crater density is not clear. Conclusion: Cassini ISS imaging has allowed us to gather  a  near-global  crater  database  for  D≥4 km for Dione. From the database we have deduced the extent and relative formation age of seven terrains on Dione's surface, two of which appear to be a result of resurfacing by  non-impact processes. However, Dione's bombardment history is still inconclusive, although evolving impactor populations seem unlikely. References: [1] Smith, B.A., et al. (1981) Science 212, p.163-91.
