Such environments could have provided both a source of water and a source of heat for life, though their habitability depends on many other factors [5,6]. One important factor is whether a hydrothermal environment is more akin to acid-sulfate fumaroles (less habitable) or more neutral sinterdepositing hot springs (more habitable). Both have been proposed to explain features of the Columbia Hills [7,8]. Studies of modern terrestrial fumarole and hot spring environments and their deposits can help identify diagnostic mineralogical and geochemical signatures. In this abstract we report preliminary results for a geochemical and mineralogical study of modern fumaroles and hot springs in the vicinity of Lassen volcano in the southern Cascades of California. Lassen has both gas-dominated acid-sulfate fumaroles and water-dominated near-neutral sinter depositing hot springs, both likely originating from the same hydrothermal system [9,10].    Figure 1: Sulphur Works fumarole sample spot, 2012 and 2013. The 2012 deposit was more coarsely crystalline and dominated by alunogen, a mineral that was scarce in the same deposit sampled in 2013. Methods: We collected mineral, rock, and water samples at and near fumaroles and hot springs at Lassen (Sulphur Works (Fig. 1), Bumpass Hell, Devil’s Kitchen, Boiling Springs Lake, Drakesbad, and Growler hot spring) in 2012 and 2013. We also measured water temperature, pH, and other parameters using a Hydrolab sonde (2013). Select mineral and rock samples were hand ground without liquids or heat and analyzed using a Bruker D8 Focus X-ray Diffractometer (XRD) for phase identification. Future work will involve X-ray Fluorescence (XRF), Scanning Electron Microscopy, and water chemistry. Water results: Thermal waters varied in temperature from boiling to near ambient, and in pH from 1.88 (Boiling Springs Lake, 2012) to 8.09 (Growler Hot Spring). While acidic conditions dominate at Sulphur Works, Bumpass Hell, and Boiling Springs Lake (high-T acid sulfate fumarole areas), both acidic and more neutral conditions were observed at Devil’s Kitchen, and only neutral conditions were observed at Drakesbad and Growler Hot Springs (Table 1).

Samples from Sulphur Works, Bumpass Hell, and Devil’s Kitchen contain elemental sulfur, lining fumarole vents. Sulfate minerals dominate further out, and include Fe-sulfates (jarosite, voltaite, rhomboclase), Al-sulfates (alunite, alunogen), Ni/V sulfates, and mixed sulfates (natroalunite). Coatings on rocks in the near-neutral Drakesbad Hot Spring yielded the only examples of gypsum and calcite. At Bumapass Hell the Fe-sulfides pyrite and marcasite (and the negative ORP) indicate reducing conditions.  Some Sulphur Works, Bumpass Hell, and Devil’s Kitchen samples yielded clay minerals.

leaching of feldspars or other igneous minerals, while smectite forms under a wider range of conditions.   Table 2: XRD phases. SW=Sulphur Works, BH= Bumpass Hell, DK=Devil’s Kitchen, DB=Drakesbad. Samples in red collected from same spot in 2012 and 2013. XXX = abundant, XX = common, X = rare to common, + = rare.      The SiO2 mineral assemblage varied widely, and included quartz, tridymite, cristobalite, and an amorphous phase likely consistent with amorphous silica. While quartz is a primary igneous component of the dacitic substrate, it was most abundant in samples lacking feldspar and pyroxene (other dacitic minerals), so it is more likely related to the secondary and precipitated minerals. Cristobalite and tridymite are also SiO2 phases associated with altered volcanics.  Discussion: A year-to-year difference in mineralogy and appearance was seen at a Sulphur Works fumarole visited in 2012 and 2013 (Fig 1). In 2012, cm-scale thin crystals (identified as alunogen by XRD: Table 2) were observed, while a sample collected from the same spot in 2013 had no coarse crystals and minimal alunogen (quartz and tridymite dominated). The 2013 sample likely represents the substrate underlying the 2012 sulfates. The sulfate-rich deposit appears to have been largely dissolved, indicating that such deposits are very ephemeral and unlikely to be preserved in the rock record.  Amorphous silica can form during hydrothermal alteration, either by leaching under acidic conditions or direct precipitation under neutral sinter conditions [e.g. 7]. It is likely that both processes took place at Lassen [e.g. 9]; the amorphous phase in the altered substrate sample from Sulphur Works likely formed by acidsulfate leaching, while the amorphous phase in the rock coating at Drakesbad probably resulted from sinter precipitation. Future SEM analysis of these samples will help confirm the presence of amorphous silica (as opposed to glass or another amorphous phase).  The Lassen hydrothermal system likely represents a 2-phase system, where acid-sulfate steam separates from a hydrothermal reservoir, fueling high- temperature, gas-driven fumaroles at higher elevations, leaving behind more neutral hot water that emerges at hot springs [9,10]. Thus, the same system produces both acid-sulfate fumarole alteration and near-neutral sinter deposition, in contact with the same volcanic substrate. Mars comparison: Ruff et al. [2011: 7] suggest a near-neutral sinter origin for the silica rich deposits observed by the Spirit rover at the Columbia Hills of Gusev Crater, which would be a more habitable environment than the previously envisioned acidsulfate environment. Nearby sulfate-rich soils could still be consistent with acid-sulfate conditions [11,12,13], which would require a diverse suite of hydrothermal environments in a relatively small area. Lassen provides an analog for a single hydrothermal system that can produce this range of deposits; further geochemical and mineralogical studies can help identify unique signatures that can be used to tell the two apart in the ancient rock record.
