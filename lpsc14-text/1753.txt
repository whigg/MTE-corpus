The activity was observed within the last three martian years (MY 28-31) on the slope of a polar pit located in Sisyphi Cavi at -72.5°S and 355°E [3]. With high-resolution image, temperature, and spectral data, as well as spectral modeling, we analyzed the exact timing of activity and presented possible triggering mechanisms, which could initiate present-day gully activity [3].  Background: Seasonal activity of gullies under current climatic conditions on Mars was observed by [1-7]. [2] reviewed the present-day activity of classical gullies (including the gully presented in this work), dune gullies, and other mass wasting processes in the southern hemisphere on Mars. Recent polar gullies in Sisyphi Cavi were also analyzed by [8], who estimated ages of about 20 ka to 20 Ma for the gullies. According to [8], the formation process for the gullies are CO2gas lubricated flows. Data: The investigations presented in this study are based on multiple data sets, including Context Camera (CTX) images with a resolution of ~5 m/pxl and High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) images with 0.25-1 m/pxl resolution from MY 28 to 31. All images of the study region were acquired in spring and summer. Maximum surface temperature data of the study region were measured by the Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) (~3 km/pxl) between ~13:00 and ~15:00 local time. Near infrared spectral data of the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) (18 and 36 m/pxl) and the Observatoire pour la Minéralogie, l'Eau, les Glaces et l'Activité (OMEGA) spectrometer (1.5-4.8 km/pxl) allowed us to measure the strength of the CO2 ice absorption band (1.43 µm) and H2O ice absorption band (1.5 µm), respectively. These band strengths are complex non linear functions of volatiles abundances, grain size/texture, and mixture type [9]. Results: We identified clear modifications of a gully within a polar pit located at ~68.5°S and ~1.5°E in MY 29 and 31 (Fig. 1). Dark material within the channel (Fig. 1b) leads to the formation of new dark deposits (Fig. 1c) between LS 209° and 226° (beginning of spring) in MY 29 flowing ~70 m across the apron. The terminus of the gully channel is marked with a black arrow #1. At LS 247°, once surface ice has disappeared, deposition of material on the apron and within the channel shortens the channel by about 40 m (Fig. 1d; black arrow #2). The white arrow marks new deposition on the gully apron (small knob). Two martian years later in MY 31 at LS 215°, a dark flow-like feature on the apron is marked with a black arrow (Fig. 1e). The black horizontal lines represent the width of the gully apron. At LS 226°, a ~130 m long dark flowlike feature at the western side of the gully apron is detectable (Fig. 1f). This is comparable to the dark flow-like feature presented in Fig. 1c, which occurred at the same season two martian years before (MY 29). At mid-spring (LS 236°), a new deposit at the western side of the gully is visible (black arrows; Fig. 1g). New material was deposited in the area where the dark flowlike feature occurred at LS 226°. The black horizontal lines illustrate a widening of the apron of approximately 7 m [3].  Figure 1: (a) One gully on the slope shows a dark flow like feature (black arrow). (b-g) Sequence of the seasonal changes in gully channel and apron morphology in martian years 29 and 31.   Topographic data, derived from a HiRISE DTM, show that the entire gullied slope is very homogeneous and showing consistent topography and slope angles (Fig. 2; Profile F). The active gully (black arrow; Profile A) and adjacent gullies (Profiles B-E) show comparable morphologies and slope angles of about 15° [3].  Figure 2: HiRISE DTM (ESP_013097_1115) of the southwestern part of the polar pit (Fig. 2a). Fig. 2b shows the southern, equatorfacing slope in detail and Fig. 2c shows the profiles of the slopes of several adjacent gullies.  To identify possible mechanism(s) of the gully activity, maximum daytime surface TES temperatures of the study region were investigated, showing surface temperatures in autumn and winter of ~150 K. In mid spring (LS ~220°) temperatures increase rapidly due to solar insolation and ice sublimation. TES data show maximum surface temperatures up to ~285 K in early summer between LS ~270° and ~310° [1,3]. For spectral analysis we processed data from CRISM (MY 28, and 29) and OMEGA (MY 27, 28, and 29). To understand the temporal evolution of H2O and CO2, the band strengths of these volatiles (ices) in all available datasets in the study region were analyzed. The investigations show that the gully is active when temperatures begin to rise rapidly and volatiles begin to sublimate [3]. Spectral modeling shows that the dark flows are most likely formed by optically thick regolith flows superposed on an underlying CO2 slab ice cover with inclusions of H2O ice and dust [3].   Discussion: New small deposits at the terminus of the gully channel and on the gully apron imply transport of dark material (most likely sand-sized material) within the gully channel due to seasonal activity. This activity can be narrowed down to occur between LS ~218° and ~226° [3]. Three scenarios could trigger this activity: (1) Liquid water supported flows, which is implausible due to very low temperatures (between ~160 and ~180 K) during the active phase [3]. Even briny liqiuid flows require higher temperatures (above ~200 K) [10]. (2) CO2 gas supported (lubricated) flows could be a possible scenario due to the fact that sublimation of the CO2 ice cover starts most likely at times when activity was observed. Investigating the gullies with spectral data, we found that the gully with the dark flows is unique in that it has weaker band strengths of CO2 ice and H2O ice compared to surrounding gullies [3]. Here, the non-icy material of the dark flow lowers the band strengths of CO2 and H2O ices. Other gullies show no dark flows, have the same band strengths as their surroundings, and (in spectral imagery data) cannot be distinguished from their surroundings [3]. If one assumes that the observed dark flows in our study region were formed only by CO2 gas supported (lubricated) flows, the occurrence of only one single active gully is unlikely. Slope angles, profiles, and morphologies of all gullies on the equator-facing slope are similar within narrow limits. Therefore, we would expect activity due to CO2 gas supported flows within all gullies, however, this has not been detected [3]. (3) Dry flows are an alternative scenario but, for the same reasons, one would expect activity in all gullies sharing similar slope properties. One explanation could be that the surface material of the channel slopes and alcove differs from the surrounding gullies, i.e., that the alcove and channel of the active gully comprises outcrops of interbedded layers of sand material, which could be the formation material of the dark flows. Sublimation of the CO2 slab ice cover and the resulting destabilization of the slope material could mobilize the sand material, which leads to an accumulation of material in the interior of the gully. The large dark flow could be triggered when a critical mass of sand material within the gully channel is reached. [11] proposed that sand absorbs ~90% of the solar heat due to low albedo, and conducts it to the underlying CO2 frost, resulting in sublimation of the frost. This mechanism of sublimation of CO2 ice beneath a dry sand layer within the gully channel could support the large flow through the entire gully [3]. Conclusions: HiRISE albedo images show an early darkening of the surface between LS ~199° and ~209° within the gully alcove and channel [3]. New deposits on the apron and at the terminus of the gully channel were identified in spring (between LS ~218° and ~226°) and can directly be linked to dark flows that occurred within the gully channel. In MY 31 about 300-600 m 3 of material were deposited [3]. The temporal occurrence of morphologic changes of the gully linked to the maximum surface temperatures and to the seasonal behavior of volatiles compared to surrounding gullies implies that mass wasting is most likely related to dry flows. The material of the dry flows (sand) is possibly mobilized at the slopes of the gully channel and alcove during the sublimation process of the CO2 ice cover. Furthermore, continued sublimation of CO2 ice within the gully channel could support the mobilization of the dry material (observed dark flows) in the interior of the gully channel.
