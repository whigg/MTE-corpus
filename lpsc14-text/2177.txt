Introduction: The CO2 cycle on Mars involves several interactions between the atmosphere and the surface.  CO2 gas composes 95% of the Martian atmosphere, and approximately 25%-30% of the atmosphere is cycled through the seasonal caps annually [14].  The seasonal condensation and sublimation of CO2 at high latitudes controls atmospheric circulation on a global scale and is thus a critical aspect of the Martian climate.   The retreat of the Martian seasonal caps has been monitored by both satellite and telescopic observations, over a period of several years. Most of these studies  used visible-wavelength images to determine the albedo contrast between the edge of the seasonal cap and exposed regolith [5,6].  While widely used, visible imaging  does have some limitations. Cap edge detection depends on albedo contrast between the polar cap and the soil. This contrast is below reliable detection methods where the CO2 cap is dark, as in the south polar cryptic region [7], or during the advance of the seasonal cap [8]. The visible method also fails to distinguish between CO2 and H2O ices. Kieffer and Titus [9], using the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES), observed a warm and bright annulus around the retreating northern seasonal CO2 polar cap. They concluded that this annulus was most likely water ice, suggesting that TES was able to distinguish between ice types. This has been confirmed by OMEGA [10]. In this study, we focused on the Mars seasonal polar cap edges between 1999 and 2006 (Mars Years 2428) [11] using the techniques of Kieffer et al. [7] and Kieffer and Titus [9].

Thermal Emission Spectrometer:  The first step in monitoring the seasonal cap edge is the construction of a data hypercube, with 2 spatial dimensions (polar stereographic projection at approximately 60 km resolution), 2 temporal dimensions (700 seasons and 2 local times of day), and 1 parameter dimension (albedo and brightness temperature). Data extracted from the TES database are averaged and binned into the hypercube every 12 orbits (approximately 23.55 hours), separated into orbital ascending and descending data, which roughly defines day and night side data. This creates a hypercube of dimensions 90 x 90 x 700 x 2 x 2.  Six of these hypercubes were constructed: 4 complete mapping years in the north and 2 complete mapping years for the southern hemisphere. The hypercubes were constructed so that the seasons start and end in the summer to capture the advance and then the retreat of the seasonal cap. MOC Processing:  These polar mosaics are comprised of Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) GlobalMapping swathes. Images from MOC's daily globalmapping campaign cover the illuminated surface from pole-to-pole with each orbital swath covering ~30 degrees of longitude. These images are typically 6-7 km/pixel in resolution and are acquired approximately every 2 hours, resulting in near-complete global coverage every 24 hours.  The USGS Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers (ISIS) [12,13] was used to calibrate and mosaic the MOC images into a complete view of the polar caps.  Both red and blue-filter observations were used (except where noted otherwise). OMEGA Processing: OMEGA mosaics were constructed using a combination of the OMEGA IDL code provided by the team, and IDL processing code written at the USGS. Determining the Thermal Cap Edge: For most polar cap-edge studies that use images, the cap edge is determined spatially. For this study, we determine the cap edge temporally. This is done by assuming a linear interpolation between data points (either temperature or albedo) and determining a Cap Recession Observations indicate CO2 has Ultimately Sublimed (CROCUS) [7] or frost date as the season when the linearly interpolated data crosses a specified threshold value. IR Cap Detection Technique: For this study, we applied the cap edge detection techniques used by Kieffer et al. [5] and Kieffer and Titus [7]. They made use of the rapid rise in surface temperature that occurs when CO2 ice is removed. For this study, we defined the advancing cap edge, or frost date, to be when the 30 μm brightness temperature drops below 155 K. We define the retreating cap edge, or crocus date, as the date when the 30 μm brightness temperature rises above 165 K. The springtime threshold temperature is set slightly higher due to effects from atmospheric dust  that is common during the cap retreat. Once the frost and CROCUS dates have been determined for each 60 km x 60 km cell, we fit the latitude of the cap edge to a series of sine and cosines which are functions of season and longitude. The sine and cosine fit is effectively a low-pass filter that removes the high frequency artifacts caused by the data being collected only at 12 longitudes per day. VIS cap edge detection technique: MGS TES also has a solar bolometer that can be used to detect the cap edge. We fit an arc-tangent curve to the albedo as a function of season, and define the cap edge as the inflection point.  Because of a lack of albedo contrast between the soil and CO2 in the early spring and a lack of contrast between the water ice northern residual cap and the seasonal CO2 cap, this analysis is restricted to the latitude range of ±60° to ±80°. Once the VIS cap CROCUS dates have been determined, we fit the latitudes of retreat to a quadratic (to account for the mean zonal retreat) and a series of sines and cosines (to account for asymmetries in the cap retreat).  Figure 1: TES derived polar cap edge functions. The visible cap edge is blue while the thermal cap edge is in black.  The thin black lines identify the subsolar latitude and the edge of polar night. Results: The CROCUS and Frost dates can be used to reconstruct the polar cap edges as a function of season. (See Fig. 1.) North polar seasonal CO2 cap: Inter-annual comparisons between TES cap edge functions show very little variation during MY 24-27. Small asymmetries, on the order of a few degrees of latitude, are apparent in both the advance and recession of the seasonal cap. North polar water ice annulus: Comparisons of the visibly and thermally determined cap edges between latitudes of 60°N and 80°N reveal a visible seasonal cap that is always larger than the thermal infrared cap (see Figure 2). This warm and bright annulus that surrounds the retreating CO2 cap was first observed by Kieffer and Titus [7]. They suggested that the warm and bright annulus that circumscribes the IR cap is mostly a mix of exposed H2O and CO2 ices. The length of time that this warm bright annulus persists, and given that its temperatures remain at or below 205 K, is suggestive that the primary constituent is H2O ice.

South polar seasonal CO2 cap: Inter-annual comparisons of TES cap edge functions for MY 24/25 and MY25/26 show some variations due to the global dust storm that occurred in MY 25. Small asymmetries, on the order of a few degrees of latitude, are apparent in both the advance and recession of the seasonal cap.  Comparisons with OMEGA (Fig. 3) shows that the visible cap edge aligns with the CO2 cap edge.  Figure 3: Cap edge functions overlaid on a MOC mosaic (left) and an OMEGA mosaic (right). Magenta indicates CO2 ice while green suggests the presence of H2O ice. Conclusions:  The use of cap-edge functions derived from TES thermal and albedo observations provides a useful tool for comparing interannual variations.  The comparison of the TES cap-edge functions to MOC and OMEGA mosaics provides context for the interpretation of the functions.  For example, the thermal and visible cap edges in the north reflect a compositional change between a CO2 ice cap and an H2O ice annulus.  In the south, where there is insufficient H2O available to form an annulus, the visible cap edge corresponds to the seasonal CO2 ice cap.  The thermal edge of the cap appears interior to the cap in MY 26 but aligns with the visible cap edge in MY 27. References: [1] Tillman et al.
