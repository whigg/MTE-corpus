(koeoep@uchicago.edu)  Introduction: Hibonite (Hib)-rich CAIs like PLAty Hib Crystals (PLACs) and Spinel-HIB inclusions (SHIBs) are among the most anomalous materials that formed in the solar system [1-3]. PLACs are typically depleted in 26Al and show a larger range in nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies in 50Ti and 48Ca than the frequently studied CAIs from CV chondrites, for example [1-3]. In contrast, SHIBs appear to have formed with variable 26Al/27Al ratios and smaller nucleosynthetic anomalies than PLACs [1-3]. Because of their refractory nature and their large nucleosynthetic anomalies, the low 26Al/27Al ratios in PLACs are usually attributed to an early formation, prior to injection and/or homogenization of 26Al in the solar nebula [2,3].  Whereas the Sun and many other, typically less refractory CAIs have 16O-rich compositions (Δ17O=δ17O0.52×δ18O values of about -28‰ and -23‰, respectively; [4-7]), previous studies found that PLACs and SHIBs show a wide spread along the CCAM line from 16O-rich to 16O-poor compositions (Δ17O = -28 to -15‰; e.g., [2]). This spread is hard to reconcile with an early formation of Hib-rich CAIs in a uniformly 16O-rich nebula.  To investigate this problem further, we have obtained more precise oxygen isotope data for 76 of the Hib-rich CAIs extracted from the Murchison meteorite, which were described in [8]. Methods: The CAIs were mounted in 1-inch epoxy rounds and analyzed for oxygen isotopes using an IMS1280 at the University of Wisconsin [9-11]. To allow sampling of individual phases, a ~3×4 µm2 primary Cs+ beam (~20pA) was chosen. By simultaneous detection of oxygen three isotopes using a Faraday cup for 16O and electron multipliers for 17O and 18O, precisions of δ18O and δ17O analyses of a single spot were ~1‰ (2SD, [7,12]). Single crystals were commonly analyzed in two spots, aggregates in two to five spots, which were placed in different phases if possible. San Carlos olivine was used as a running standard and terrestrial Hib, spinel (Sp), melilite (Mel) and corundum (Cor) standards were used for instrumental bias corrections. After oxygen isotope analysis, the SIMS pits were checked with the SEM to verify that only primary minerals had been sampled. Finally, the chemical composition of Hibs was determined by EMPA (Cameca SX-50).  Samples: 36 Sp-free CAIs were analyzed: 25 single Hib crystals (14 PLACs; 9 single Stubby Hib Crystals (SHICs); and 2 crystals that resemble SHIB Hibs in morphology and chemistry, labeled 'SHIB Fragments?'); 10 Hib aggregates; and 1 Hib-Cor CAI. In addition, Sp-bearing CAIs were studied, which we subdivide into (1) 'regular' SHIBs (N=26), which are angular to spherical CAIs consisting of thin (<15 µm) Hib plates and Sp (~5 µm), (2) Coarse-grained SHIBs (CSHIBs; N=7) with Hib and/or Sp grains >50 µm, (3) Platy SHIBs (PSHIBs; N=5), which are Hib plates with Sp margins or a top layer of Sp, (4) a Hib aggregate with a Sp rim and (5) a Mel-Sp-Hib CAI fragment. Results: 73 of the 76 analyzed Hib-rich CAIs plot on or close to the CCAM line, while two SHICs and one PSHIB appear to be highly mass-fractionated (Fig. 1a). Single Hib crystals, Hib aggregates and PSHIBs show a considerable range in Δ17O (~10‰) and many are resolved from the CCAM line (Figs. 1b & 2). While most analyses fall to the right of the CCAM line, only those with the highest Δ17O plot on the left (Fig. 1b). In contrast, SHIBs, the two SHIB fragments, and most CSHIBs form a tight cluster within error of the CCAM line (Δ17O ≈ -22‰ to -24.5‰). The Mel-Sp-Hib CAI fragment plots within the SHIB cluster, while the HibCor CAI plots to the right of the cluster.  Fig. 2 shows that only CAIs with Mg-poor Hibs (≤0.2 cations per formula unit; cpfu) show large variations in Δ17O, while CAIs with more Mg-rich Hibs (mostly SHIBs) have more uniform Δ17O values. Discussion: The results indicate a link between oxygen isotopes and Hib mineral chemistry. Based on these properties, three distinct populations are recognizable: (1) Highly mass-fractionated CAIs with Mg-poor Hibs (F(UN) CAIs), (2) PLAC-like CAIs with Mg-poor Hibs, variable Δ17O and deviations to both sides of the CCAM line (single crystals, Hib aggregates and PSHIBs; the latter two were also grouped with PLACs in [1]), (3) SHIB-like CAIs with approximately uniform Δ17O values and Hibs with a wider range of Mg contents. F(UN) CAIs. The Δ17O values of the highly fractionated PSHIB and one of the stubby crystals (-24.5±1.1‰ and -23.0±0.7‰) are indistinguishable from the SHIB average and similar to 16O-rich FUN CAIs [13 and references therein]. The other fractionated stubby crystal is more depleted in 16O, but its Δ17O value agrees with the BAG measured by [2]. The F(UN) Hibs are among the 2508.pdf

most Mg-depleted grains measured. A noteworthy implication of the F(UN) character of two SHICs is that single Hib crystals can have a melt origin.

The Δ17O values in PLAC-like CAIs range from values as low as the inferred oxygen isotopic composition of the Sun (~ -28‰ in Δ17O; [4]) to values significantly higher than those in SHIBs. It seems unlikely that these refractory objects track the postulated evolution of the solar nebula from 16O-rich to 16O-poor compositions, as this scenario would require a prolonged period of Hib formation that started before and continued until after formation of less refractory CAIs such as SHIBs. However, this scenario is testable, as we would expect to see a relationship between Δ17O, initial 26Al/27Al ratio and the magnitude of nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies in these CAIs. Similarly, hydrous alteration is an unlikely cause for the oxygen isotope variability, for example because we observe significant variation in Hib aggregates, but none in SHIB Hibs, even though their exposure to fluids should have been similar.  Instead, we propose that the variations in Δ17O exhibited by the PLAC-like CAIs may reflect initial oxygen isotopic heterogeneity in the early solar nebula. This interpretation is based on the assumption that, similar to other Mg-poor Murchison Hibs [1-3], our Mg-poor grains belong to the 26Al-depleted population that has large nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies. In this scenario, the deviations from the CCAM line could be a result of heterogeneity and/or mass-dependent isotope fractionation associated with condensation and evaporative melting.  SHIB-like CAIs. The SHIBs and CSHIBs analyzed here show a narrow range of Δ17O, which is in contrast to previous lower precision studies (e.g., SHIBs define a range from -27 to -16‰ in [2]). The difference may in part be due to the smaller spot size used in our study that avoided overlapping with 16O-poor alteration phases in holes and cracks inside SHIBs. The average Δ17O of  -23.3±1.0‰ of our 26 SHIBs is in good agreement with the majority of CR CAIs, Acfer 094 CAIs and some primary minerals in CV CAIs [5-7], which suggests that SHIBs formed in a similar, uniform 16O-rich reservoir. Conclusion: Our precise oxygen isotope data reveal a clear difference between PLAC-like CAIs and SHIBs. The oxygen isotopic compositions of SHIBs resemble other CAIs, while those in PLAC-like Hibs show significant variations. If the Mg-poor Hibs belong to the 26Alpoor, isotopically anomalous Hib population, they may be a record of initial oxygen isotopic heterogeneity in the solar nebula. CAIs with more uniform Δ17O such as SHIBs could have formed at a later stage after homogenization of oxygen isotopes in the disk. References: [1] Ireland T. (1988) GCA, 52, 28272839.
