(Contact: kaureli8@gmail.com)  Introduction:  The surface of Mars exhibits abundant geomorphic evidence for fluvial activity [e.g., 1-10], including paleolake basins, which have typically been classified as hydrologically open (i.e., open-basin lakes, with both an inlet and outlet channel) or hydrologically closed (i.e., closed-basin lakes, with only an inlet channel) [e.g., 2,3,6]. Recent work on martian paleolakes has focused on open-basin lakes, as the presence of an outlet channel requires ponding of water within the basin, necessitating the formation of a large lake at one point in time [2,3,5,6,10].  It is more difficult to definitively say that a candidate closed-basin lake once contained a large standing body of water, as an inlet channel flowing into a topographically closed basin does not require the presence of a lake. Nonetheless, candidate closed-basin lakes provide evidence for fluvial activity on the martian surface, and are an important aspect of the fluvial evolution of Mars. Previous work on cataloguing candidate closed-basin lakes on Mars was primarily completed with Viking Orbiter data [e.g., 2,3], and so has not benefitted from more recent, higher resolution data. Here we present an update on our previous work [11] cataloguing candidate closed-basin lakes within impact craters on Mars. Methods: This work involved a grid-based search of the martian surface from -60° to 60°N across all longitudes. The search was completed using Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) gridded topography [12] overlain on the ~100 m/pixel global daytime infrared mosaic from the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) instrument [13] as a basemap. This basemap was used to identify impact craters that show evidence of fluvial dissection, which were then further investigated using ~6 m/pixel images from the Context Camera (CTX) instrument [14] and/or <50 m/pixel images from the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) instrument [15]. To be included in the catalog, a crater must exhibit a clear inlet channel, or interior crater wall dissection, but no discernable outlet channel. Results: Our results show evidence for 297 candidate closed-basin lakes (Fig. 1), which we have classified into one of three groups based on the morphology of their inlet channel: long inlet channels, short inlet channels, and interior channels. If a single crater exhibits evidence for multiple channel morphologies, it was given the classification of the largest channel length present. For example, a crater with both a long inlet channel and interior channels would be classified as having a long inlet channel. Long Inlet Channels. This group of candidate closedbasin lakes has inlets that are typically >50 km in length, with a morphology that is similar to typical martian valley networks [e.g., 1,4,5,7,8] (Fig. 2A). The channels are often heavily degraded and have evidence for multiple, branching tributaries. The host craters are among the most heavily degraded of those contained in our catalog. We have identified 25 candidate closed-basin lakes with long inlet channels (Fig. 1).  Short Inlet Channels. This group of candidate closedbasin lakes has inlets that are typically <10 km in length, and frequently only a few km long (Fig. 2B). The channels rarely have tributaries, and often have an abrupt, amphitheater-shaped headwall. The host craters are typically morphologically fresh with intact ejecta deposits (Fig. 2B), that in some cases are observed to superpose older valley networks (Fig. 3). We have identified 199 candidate closedbasin lakes with short inlet channels (Fig. 1).  Interior Channels. This group of candidate closed-basin lakes exhibits fluvial dissection of the host crater walls, with no inlet channels crosscutting the crater rim (Fig. 2C). The host craters are commonly morphologically fresh, with often intact ejecta deposits. We have identified 73 candidate closed-basin lakes with interior channels (Fig. 1).  Figure 1.

Discussion: Our updated survey shows that candidate closed-basin lakes are much more common than the ~60 examples from previous analyses using lower resolution data [2,3]. Interestingly, our catalog contains relatively few (25; ~8%) candidate closed-basin lakes that are fed by long, integrated channels that are morphologically similar to typical martian valley networks [e.g., 1,4,5,7,8]. This is especially surprising considering the large number (>200) of identified open-basin lakes with valley networks as inlet channels [6,10]. Valley network activity is thought to have largely ceased near the Noachian-Hesperian boundary [5,79], and our results suggest that during this early period of fluvial activity the formation of closed-basin lakes was much less common than the formation of open-basin lakes. This observation may be explained by a scenario in which craters initially breached by an inlet valley were also likely to have formed an outlet valley as opposed to reaching an equilibrium as a closed-basin lake. Our catalog also gives evidence for a younger period of fluvial activity in the form of candidate closed-basin lakes with short inlet and interior channels (Fig. 2B,C) that can be observed in craters with ejecta that superposes older valley networks (Fig. 3). This is similar to the observations of [9], who used crater degradation morphologies to indicate at least two periods of fluvial activity on the martian surface. Our results support this idea of at least local fluvial activity subsequent to the Noachian-Hesperian boundary. References: [1] Carr, M. (1987), Nature, 326:30. [2] Cabrol, N. and Grin, E.
