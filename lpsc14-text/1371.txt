Introduction:  Pancam multispectral visible/nearinfrared images (432-1009 nm) acquired along the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) Spirit and Opportunity traverses have enabled mapping of surface textures, morphology, and mineralogy vital in constraining the geologic processes that formed and modified these field sites.  Photometric properties of the rocks and soils observed by Pancam were quantified for both rovers using multispectral observations acquired under variable illumination and viewing geometries up to Sol 475 by [1].  Additional Pancam photometric observations were acquired at multiple wavelengths between Sols 500 and 1525 that augment previous Pancam analyses. Spirit data were acquired from the summit region of Husband Hill down to the areas around the eastern margin of Home Plate, and Opportunity data obtained from north of Erebus crater to the rim of Victoria crater (Table 1, Figure 1).  These data sets sampled previously unobserved rock and soil types, such as high-silica deposits, ferric-sulfate soils, volcaniclastic materials, and dark basaltic sands, as well as new exposures of ferric soils and dusts, hematite spherulerich soils, sulfate-rich sandstones, and basaltic rocks.   Method. We used a Hapke radiative transfer model in combination with corrections for diffuse sky illumination and local surface facet orientations derived from Pancam stereo image models, following the methodology presented by [1].  We modeled Hapke parameters of rock and soil units including the single scattering albedo (w), 1-term and 2-term Henyey-Greenstein (HG) phase function parameters, macroscopic roughness ( ), and opposition effect widths (h, when low phase angle coverage was available).  Comparison of Hapke parameters among the units observed by both rovers, parameters modeled from other landing site data sets, and laboratory-based analyses [2,3] allowed for interpretations of physical properties of the geologic materials (Figure 2).   Spirit results. For data sets with sufficient phase angle coverage, typical “gray” rocks (i.e., those with comparatively less dust or soil contamination) tended to be the most forward scattering in 2-term HG models (particularly Torquas rocks, cf. Figure 2), whereas soils were more backscattering.  Conversely, the basaltic sand ripples of El Dorado were very forward scattering at all wavelengths but 432 nm, similar to Viking orbital observations of dark sands [5]. Ferric sulfaterich soils exhibited the largest w values as well as very forward-scattering behavior in 2-term HG models, but were the most backscattering in 1-term HG models.  This contradictory result likely arose from the limited ability of the phase angle coverage (~5-60°) to constrain the scattering behavior and requires further study.  Silica nodules and silica-rich soils exhibited some of the most backscattering behaviors, although progressively less backscattering with increasing wavelength. This behavior may result from greater absorption/lesser penetration (i.e., less multiple scattering) of photons at longer wavelengths. Values of h were better constrained using 1-term HG models, and on average ranged from ~0.07 to ~0.21, albeit with little consistency among units at the different rover locations. Opportunity results.  Spherule-rich soils in the Meridiani data sets were often the most backscattering materials, although soils without spherules and rover tracks were more forward scattering (consistent with lab studies [2]), and dusty soils were less backscattering (Figure 2). Soils inside the dark wind streak on the northern rim of Victoria crater were somewhat less backscattering that those outside the streak [4].  These dark streak sands exhibited larger h values (~0.095) and lower   values than the dustier soils outside the streak, consistent with their greater proportion of basaltic sands of more uniform grain size. Outcrop rocks exhibited the highest w values, more intermediate backscattering behaviors, and h values similar to soils.   Discussion.  Ongoing modeling work will refine these results, in particular issues related to high values of atmospheric opacity (Sols 1240-1245A) or the Sol 1250B dust storm.  The latter resulted in all units exhibiting similar photometric properties owing to dust that temporarily contaminated the Pancam window.   References: [1] Johnson, J.R., et al. J. Geophys.
