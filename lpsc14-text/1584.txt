HOW DEEP AND STEEP ARE SMALL LUNAR CRATERS ? NEW INSIGHTS FROM LROC NAC DEMSP. Mahanti1, M.S. Robinson1, R. Stelling1 1Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera, School of Earth and SpaceExploration, Arizona State University, Tempe,AZ,USA; pmahanti@asu.edu;Introduction: Recent lunar missions (e.g. LunarReconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), Kaguya), carrying highresolution cameras (e.g. Lunar Reconnaissance OrbiterCamera (LROC) Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) [1], Selene Terrain Camera [2]) have acquired images that willlead to a deeper understanding of impact crater formation and degradation. Historical studies of lunar cratermorphology exists for craters in the 10 km diameter(D) range [3, 4, 5, 6, 7], but is somewhat lacking forcraters in the 1 km D range, and rare for crater D below 200 m. Morphology of small lunar craters (SLC;D < 200m) is critical to our understanding of the regolith because such craters are relatively rapidly degraded making their existence somewhat transient in ageologic time-scale. Accurate characterization of thetopology of smaller craters will elucidate (and test ourcurrent models) impact cratering processes for simplelunar craters across the full range of lunar target materials. From an exploration point-of-view investigating themorphology of small craters is relevant as small cratersare common and will be in the exploration path for arobotic and (or) human explorers. Understanding theaverage and full range of crater slopes and depths perdiameter will also inform future engineering design decisions.In this work, we present new results obtained by investigating the shapes of small lunar craters sampledglobally. Specifically, we study the depth-to-diameter( dD ) values and the median wall slope of SLC. Unlikelarger lunar craters (D > 10km), for which studies andcrater catalogs exist [8], a comprehensive listing of suchinformation is nonexistent for SLC. For this work, wederived a catalog of 4477 SLC [Fig. 3] manually selected from LROC NAC based digital elevation models (DEMs) [9]. Measurements of rim-to-rim diameter,rim-to-floor depth, crater rim area, crater volume andmedian wall slope (MWS) at 2 m/pixel were made fromthe DEM. Based on these observations and the DEM uncertainties, fundamental relationships correlated to impact cratering processes are investigated within the context of historical studies.Methods: Data mining from the NAC DEMs is automated after craters are first identified manually fromNAC ortho-photo image, the DEM and a derived slopemap. The rim of the crater as well as the location ofmelt (if any) on the crater floor, was manually identified.Following this procedure, the measurements extractedautomatically via image analysis algorithms. DEMsgenerated from NAC stereo images have resolutions assmall as 2 m/px which allows the topographical investiFigure 1: Depth vs Diameter from observed SLC.

However the footprint of a NAC stereoimage is small (2.5 km wide) and hence the current NACstereo-imaging coverage represents only a small part ofthe total lunar surface. However the geo-spatial sampling of the lunar surface by NAC stereo images is globally distributed (Figure 3). The smallest crater considered for this study is determined by the smallest rasterdeemed large enough for reliable automatic estimationof crater topographic descriptors. In this study we use araster size of 10 px square for the crater diameter whichtranslates to a minimum crater size 20 m, The upperlimit of 200 m was chosen to limit this initial study andallow the project to come to completion in our lifetime.1584.pdf

Figure 3: Global distribution of NAC DEMs used in this study. Some locations have multiple DEMs. The colorbar indicates themedian wall slopeResults: The observed d vs D from SLC is wellfit by both by a power law (d = aDb; R2 = 0.98)and a simple straight line (d = mD + c; R2 = 0.86,Fig. 1). However, the variation trend indicated differssignificantly from the power law of [4]. We note thatin the previous studies [3, 10, 4] D > 200m for mostcraters (in [3], D < 200m for 25 craters out of 204,and these are not fit separately) so the fit to our rangeof D in that study is an extrapolation. SLC are foundto be shallower than expected from [4], with median dDof 0.13 and not 0.2. With increase in D, the median dDdecreases, likely due to a larger asymmetrical spread ofdepth. In general craters with D < 100m appear to bea separate class, possibly due strength properties of theupper regolith relative to larger craters (100m < D <200m).Lower MWS are found with larger diameter craters(Fig. 2) investigated in this work. A MWS of 15◦ isobserved for craters with D < 100m and 11◦ for largercraters (100m < D < 200m). The peak slope in diameter bins decrease as diameter increases and MWSdistribution among craters is also observed to changefrom a bimodal distribution to a more unimodal natureas diameter increases (Fig. 3). Globally, steeper wallslopes are observed in the highland regions rather thanthe mare. From the lunar exploration point-of-view, thedistribution of MWS suggest that rover designs with stable locomotion performance up to 30◦ slope will be effective.Conclusion: A new global dataset of small lunarcraters is obtained from LROC NAC DEMs and analyzed to investigate fundamental morphological descriptors. In addition to filling the missing parts of scalingmechanism statistics, variation in the degradation ratesfor smaller craters is indicated by our results. The effect of data distribution non-uniformity (larger numberof smaller craters) and comparative analysis of mare andhighland craters is currently in progress and is expectedto yield interesting results.References: [1] M.
