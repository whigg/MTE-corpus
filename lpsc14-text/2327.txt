ENDEMIC 64Ni EFFECTS IN ALLENDE Ca-Al-RICH INCLUSIONS.  J. H. Chen1 and D. A.

Sci., Caltech 170-25, Pasadena, CA 91125 ( dap@jpl.nasa.gov).  Introduction:  We have developed analytical techniques for Ni and applied them to a search for evidence for radiogenic 60Ni, in unequilibrated ordinary chondrites, from the possible presence of the 60Fe60Ni short-lived chronometer [1]. There is also extensive work on correlated non-linear isotope anomalies in the Fe solar abundance peak and for isotopes from elements from Ca to Zn, in Allende refractory inclusions (Table 2). These anomalies require multiple nucleosynthetic components but are more pronounced and wellcorrelated for the neutron-rich isotopes of these elements. Both 60Fe and 64Ni are n-rich isotopes, with similar neutron excess η, 0.133 and 0.125 and would be co-produced in supernova explosions. For Ni, small non-linear effects have been reported on CAIs by the now unique and pioneering work by Birck and Lugmair [2], more than 2.5 decades ago. Analytical Procedures:  For 64Ni, in Allende inclusions, it was necessary not only to eliminate 64Zn mass interference but also the major elements Mg, Al, Ca, Ti, which can reduce ionization efficiency or lead to mass interferences, e. g., through formation of fluoride molecular ions. The Allende CAI analyzed in this work (Table 1) have been studied previously for other isotopic anomalies (Table 2). The samples  were first washed in distilled ethanol, then dried and dissolved in HF-HNO3 and HCl using a Teflon capsule under high P and T. We followed the Ni analytical procedures developed in [3]. We have improved the chemistry and removed impurities (mainly Zn, Fe, Ti, K, Ca, Al and Mg). This was important because of the limited amount of Ni in these CAI and small sample size (≤20 mg). Ni isotopes were measured by TIMS, using silica gel as activator. About 2 to 5 μg Ni were loaded on a V-shaped Re filament. With the improved chemistry, we have essentially eliminated Zn in the final Ni samples and verified very low Zn/Ni, using ICP-MS. For TIMS, we measured the 64Zn+/58Ni+ (<1 ppm) by monitoring Zn (at 66 and 68 amu) using an electron multiplier. The 64Ni data for these samples with very low Zn+/Ni+ values required no or a small correction (<2 εu) for isobaric interference from 64Zn.  Results and discussion: We normalize the data to 61Ni/58Ni and calculate (parts in 104) (i, 58), i = 60, 62 and 64. The results are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1 and indicate that all 3 inclusions have excesses in the n-rich 64Ni. In particular, Egg-2 and Egg-3 have very large 64Ni excesses of 32 εu and 55 εu (Fig. 1a). Based on the typical narrow range of instrumental isotope mass fractionation, for our procedures, on the Triton, the large effects for 64Ni in Egg-2 and -3 can be attributed to 64Ni, independently of the specific normalization for isotope instrumental mass fractionation. While Egg-2 has normal 60Ni/58Ni,  Egg-1 and Egg-3 have a small excess and deficit (respectively) of 1 u. For 62Ni (62, 58), Egg-1 shows a hint of excess, (62, 58) =2±1.7, while Egg-2, -3 yield normal values. We note the very large 64Ni excesses for Egg-2 and Egg-3, well beyond the small possible 64Zn interference. In Fig. 1b, we show an expanded scale, including 2 samples (F1 and ALK 111) reported previously by [2], as representatives of the largest effects identified by these workers, in their pioneering study. Our data show possible correlated excesses for 62Ni and 64Ni and possible general isotope anomalies in 60Ni of ±1 u. In Table 2, we summarize data from this and prior work on nonlinear isotope anomalies in the Fe solar abundance peak and for the n-rich isotopes for the set of elements Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni and Zn in CAI.

fully compatible with the observations of correlated effects for the n-rich isotopes in the Fe abundance peak. For Ni and Fe in Egg-2 and -3, there is a general correlation of 64Ni and 58Fe [10]. For non-FUN inclusions, Egg-1 and -3, we observe a general correlated excess in all n-rich isotopes from Ca to Zn [4-7, 9,10]. For FUN inclusions, C1, BG82HB1 and BG82DH8, all show deficits but correlated effects for Ca, Ti and Cr [10-12].  In addition, C1 and BG82HB1 also show the same excesses in 58Fe [10]. On the other hand EK1-4-1 shows unique but very large effects (excesses) in all nrich isotopes except 70Zn (deficit). No sample of EK-14-1 is available for a Ni determination.  We now have evidence for non-linear effects for nrich isotopes for all the elements in the range Ca-Zn, which have stable, n-rich isotopes. As emphasized by Meyer and coworkers, the correlation of these effects, if it extends to 48Ca, requires a low-entropy environment, indicative of  Type Ia supernovae [13,14]. Detailed calculations were provided by Woosley [15] of carbon deflagration supernovae, which may constitute a substantial fraction of Type Ia SNae. These calculations provide substantial overproductions for all n-rich isotopes in the Ca-Zn range for which measurements in CAI are available. Woosley [15] in briefly summarizing isotope effects in CAI indicates that 64Ni should also show effects. From his tables (Tables 3,4A,4B) we observe that 62Ni shows about 1/2 the production of 64Ni. From Egg-2 and Egg-3, we do not find effects in 62Ni reflecting the large effects we observe for 64Ni. This may provide added constraints for the SN Ia. We note that 58Fe, 64Ni and 60Fe have similar neutron excesses [16]. The small effects we observe for 60Ni may reflect the correlated production of 60Fe, 58Fe, 64Ni.  We find it surprising that Fe and Ni, as lower T condensates, show large isotope effects. The possible sources of Ni in CAI are: 1) aggregation of metal-rich materials in the solar bebula before the formation of CAI, 2) direct condensates as multi-element alloys into sub-µm refractory nuggets (RMN) from a cooling gas of solar composition [19, 20], 3) opaque assemblages [17, 18]:  these metal particles were later affected by exsolution, oxidation, and sulfurization [17], leading to redistribution of the refractory metals into metal, sulfide, and oxide phases. The discoveries of large Ni isotopic anomalies in the Allende CAI indicate that FeNi metal grains preserved their isotopic signatures, even after alteration. Acknowledgement.
