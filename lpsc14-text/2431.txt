These deposits are exposed in large concentric spiral troughs thought to be formed by katabatic winds coming off the north pole [2,3], ablation and  sublimation. The NPLD stratigraphy is revealed within these troughs.   We report here the discovery of small, negative relief features identified in HiRISE [4] images,  which we call pits, that appear at certain exposures in the NPLD in the north polar troughs.  Pits exactly like these are not found in other locations on Mars as yet, but similar features are noted for comparison. Some possible formation hypotheses are also discussed.Morphology and Distribution: First identified in a HiRISE stereo pair (PSP_010198_2645 and PSP_010014_2645), the pits are ~1-5 m in diameter, with roughly circular rims that are often slightly depressed (Fig. 1). They are recognized as negative relief features based on the solar azimuth and the lack of reflected light within the shadowed area. The pits appear to be voids in the surface, and are deeper than the surface texture of the exposed NPLD, or the surface texture of the residual ice cap, which have been described as being pitted and cracked at meter scales [5,6]. A digital terrain model (DTM) was made from this stereo pair following the methods described in [7]. The DTM has a horizontal post spacing of 1 m (features >4 m across can be resolved) and a vertical resolution of 10s of cm. The pits are not resolved in the DTM as they are generally too small, and their interiors are unilluminated. Their minimum depth/diameter ratio is 0.53.  The spatial distribution of the pits mapped in the orthorectified images (Fig. 2) appears to be randomly scattered, with no apparent linear alignment or strong correlation with certain layers. In some cases, frost persists in patches around the rims even as the surrounding terrain defrosts during northern summer. Changes in the pits are not observed between the stereo pair used to create the DTM. However, we observe new pits forming in later images at this location.Mapping of the distribution of pits in HiRISE images across the north polar cap is ongoing (Fig. 3). Pits have been found so far only in shallowly sloping exposures of the NPLD in troughs. They have not been found in steep scarps, in the basal unit, nor on the surface of the polar cap except for pits associated with faults (see next section). Comparison to Similar Features: To better understand the unique characteristics of the NPLD pits, we present examples of similar features found in the polar regions and elsewhere on Mars. Although these examples are all of pits,  and most occur in ice-rich units, they differ in significant ways from the meterscale NPLD pits. Similar pits occur atop an escarpment between troughs, located along what is interpreted to be a blind normal fault at 84.4N, 134.6E  (Fig. 4A).  The sizes and general appearances of pits along this fault and others like it [5,6], are like those that are found in the NPLD exposures, except for their linear alignment along the fault trace, and their elongated growth and connection. Fig. 4B shows an example of pits of a wide range of sizes forming in ice-rich terrain north of Alba Mons. They appear to be aligned with underlying fractures or Figure 1.

faults. Their general shape is more oval,  but the smallest pits in this location are roughly circular.Small pits have been observed on the south polar layered deposits (SPLD) (Fig.  4C). These features are slightly larger than the north polar pits, and vary more in size.  The shape of the south polar pits is irregularly conical and the bottoms and sides can be seen in most of the pits. Another difference is that they primarily are seen along the tops of escarpments,  rather than in the sloping layer exposures. Collapse pits in volcanic terrain (Fig. 4D) have been found in several places on Mars [8]. These pits tend to be much larger than the NPLD pits and may occur in chains or be isolated. The walls and floors of these features are sometimes illuminated.Possible Formation Mechanisms: The formation mechanism of the pits is unknown. Wind action should not be ignored, but it is unclear how it could be causing these features at such small scales. The spatial distribution and size of the pits may be due to the sublimation of small pockets of pure ice that become exposed as the NPLD erodes.  In the SPLD, a massive CO2 ice deposit associated with sublimation features has been found with the Shallow Radar (SHARAD) [9] as a reflection-free zone [10]. However, no similar reflection-free zones have been identified in the NPLD, so any putative CO2 ice associated with the pits would be limited in depth to a few SHARAD rangeresolution cells (~10 m). No venting activity or deposits have been observed. Thermokarst may provide a viable explanation, but a triggering mechanism is yet unknown. Impact cratering may also play a role in the formation of these pits, but it seems unlikely based on their morphology and spatial distribution. Some other questions to consider are: Why are the pits so sparsely distributed?; Do they change over time; and Do transitional features also exist?Further Analysis and Implications: Accurate change detection studies will be done with time-series images orthorectified to HiRISE DTMs where available [11]. Mapping the pits in the NPLD will help to characterize their morphology and spatial distribution in more detail. This will better inform discussion of possible formation mechanisms. The discovery of these pits and the study of their formation may provide new insight into the structure of the NPLD, which has significance for the understanding of Mars’ past climate as well as for future exploration.
