Introduction:  It has been observed that landslide distribution along flanks of Valles Marineris is not homogeneous and that the size of observed landslide deposits spans over a large interval. Recently, a new large landslide inventory has been completed by the authors [1] and this allowed us to collect information concerning the landslide position, characteristics and areal extent. Furthermore, in a previous research [2, 3] we have tried to constrain the mechanical properties of the rock masses forming the rock walls and affected by landslides, suggesting rock masses have comparable strengths to their Earth equivalent. Nevertheless, one of the important point that should be solved concerns the factors controlling the spatial distribution of such failures. In fact, they occur along Valles Marineris flanks and other valleys at specific locations. Damaging of the Martian Crust: Mechanical properties of the heavily cratered Martian upper crust could have been controlled by different factors: lithology, "tectonic" stresses, weathering, water circulation and cratering. The upper crust is made of a thick  megaregolith composed of breccia overlying an impact fractured basement rock [4][5][6]. Breccia lenses and loosely packed ejecta layer could be interlayered with fractured and unfractured bedrock as well as with thick basaltic lava cover. The Martian crust has been subjected to meteoroid impacts and because of the heavy bombardment at some areas it is considered to be near crater-saturation. These impacts resulted in a fractured crust covered by breccia layers (1 to 3 km thick) and impact ejecta overlain by Aeolian, aqueous and unconsolidated regolith [7]. Numerical models [8], laboratory impact experiments [9] and seismic data [5] all support the idea that fractured zones exist around craters and extend both radially and at depth below the crater to a distance equal to half the crater diameter. This damage zone presents poor mechanical properties [3], affecting the hydrology [6] and the slope instabilities along the valley flank on Mars. In particular, the position of the cutting slope with respect to the crater position should control the landslide size and the corresponding volume. Considering that the craters are very frequent and evenly distributed on Mars' surface, we make the hypothesis that the control of shock damage zone on landslide size can regulate the volume frequency distribution of Martian landslides. Methodology:  Slope stability analysis was performed with a 3D Janbu simplified method [10] for a 6.5 km high slope with a slope gradient of 23.4° (Figure 1). For this study, we limited the analysis to a crater diameter size of 30 km. For this crater size, the shock damage fractured zone was assumed to be 60 km wide and 15 km deep (Figure 1). The position of the crater was defined by fixing a distance from the base of the slope to the center of the crater. For each position, we performed a grid search of the most critical spherical surface inside the fractured zone (Figure 2).      Figure 1. Assumed 3D model geometry inclusive of the simple slope profile and of the damaged rock mass zone around the impact crater.   Figure 2. Cross section of a 3D model showing the intersections of the bedrock damaged zone and of the computed failure surfaces for two different crater positions. Cross section is passes through the crater center (see Figure 1).  Then, we randomly generated a uniform distribution of 10,000 values of distances, and we assigned a landslide  volume to each distance using the empirical relationship obtained through the stability analysis. From these volumes, we derived logarithmically binned, noncumulative size probability density distributions of synthetic "landslides" (p = dN/dV/N) as a function of landslide volume V (dN = number of landslides with an volume between V and V+dV, N = total number of landslides). This distribution was finally compared with the distribution presented in [1], with areas converted in volumes according to [11]. Strength parameters have been chosen to cover the intervals estimated in [2][3] for Valles Marineris rock wall failures. These values can be considered reasonable if we assume a roughly homogeneous mass of highly fractured rock (fracture frequency: 20 m-1 to 100 m-1) [5][8][9]. Results:  The stability analyses show that the volume of the most critical circular surfaces decreases with the distance, following a sigmoidal function (Figure 3). This behavior is explained by the fact that the unstable volume is controlled by the portion of the slope with fractured rock. For small distances, the entire slope is composed of fractured rocks, and the unstable volume is maximum. Increasing the distance, the fractured portion progressively reduces, and finally disappears (see Figure 2). Comparing the different strength scenario, we observe that the volumes are larger when the cohesion is larger (Figure 3). These larger volumes present deeper surfaces that are required to overcome the higher cohesion [12]. The probability density distribution of synthetic landslides obtained by assigning a volume to a uniform distribution of crater positions shows a behavior similar to the distribution obtained from the landslide inventory [1].    Figure 3. Empirical relationship between the volume of the most critical circular surface and the distance from the slope toe, at varying rock mass cohesion (interval of values  from [2] [3]). Least-square sigmoidal fit functions are shown (Adj R2 = 0.99, 0.98 and 0.95 with a cohesion of 5, 0.5 and 0.1 MPa, respectively).   Figure 4. Probability density plot of volume for the Martian landslide inventory and the synthetic distribution for craters with a 30 km diameter.  The distribution of synthetic landslides is limited to a restricted range of volume (4 to 300 km3) with respect to actual landslides. This can be due to the fact that in this first trial we considered only 30 km craters, and the conversion from areas to volume in the landslide inventory by a function defined for terrestrial bedrock landslides which could be unsuitable for Mars.  Conclusion: In conclusion, we cannot discard the hypothesis that the landslide size distribution is controlled by the distribution of crater shock damaged zones. We will test more this hypothesis  by completing the analysis for other crater sizes at slightly variable slope angles, and by considering the observed crater size distribution.
