PRESERVATION AND MOBILIZATION OF ICE-RICH MANTLING DEPOSITS IN NEREIDUM MONTES, MARS.  Daniel C. Berman, David A. Crown, and Frank C. Chuang, Planetary Science Institute, 1700 E. Ft. Lowell Rd., Suite 106, Tucson, AZ 85712; bermandc@psi.edu.  Introduction: The Martian mid-latitudes are regions where the surface has been significantly modified by periods of volatile-driven activity [e.g., 16]. Recent research has focused on small-scale landforms observed in high-resolution images, including gullies, arcuate ridges, and lobate flows (or viscous flow features), as well as widespread icecemented mantling deposits [3] interpreted as relicts from geologically recent (i.e., Late Amazonian), obliquity-driven ice ages [e.g., 2,7].  The preservation of mantling deposits varies throughout the mid-latitudes as a function of latitude, topography, and environmental conditions [e.g., 8,9]. In the southern hemisphere, regions such as eastern Hellas show evidence for preserved and degraded mantling deposits on the surfaces of lobate debris aprons [10,11]. Current mapping of ice-rich debris aprons in the southern mid-latitudes has identified Nereidum Montes as a region with large numbers of ice-rich flow features [12-14] as well as extensive preservation of mantling deposits. This study focuses on variations in these deposits across the mid-latitudes, and comparisons between deposits in Nereidum Montes, eastern Hellas, and other regions on Mars with high concentrations. Nereidum Montes: Nereidum Montes is a mountainous region along the northern rim of Argyre basin (~35°-45°S, ~300°-332°E). Within this region, features such as gullies, arcuate ridges, and lobate flow features, as well as preserved mantling deposits with various textures are observed in CTX images. We suggest these features have formed by mass-wasting, fluvial, and glacial processes related to the melting and/or mobilization of ice contained within the mantling deposits [e.g., 15,16]. Ice-related features:  Textures representative of the mantling deposits include smooth, knobby, and dissected [2,11,17]. As the mantle is progressively removed by erosional mechanisms such as sublimation, smooth textures transition to knobby and dissected textures with remnants left behind, including isolated knobs and outcrops of layered fill. An earlier study by [5] suggested a relationship between mantling deposits, gullies, arcuate ridges, and crater floor deposits in Newton Basin. In that study, a sequence of events was suggested (Fig. 1) including the deposition, mobilization, sublimation, and melt of the ice-rich mantle resulting in the formation of these features as observed in their end stages (model step 5). In Nereidum Montes, CTX and HiRISE images reveal extensive preservation of the mantle and additional evidence for previously unobserved intermediate stages in the model. These include “pasted-on” smooth mantle material in alcoves on the walls of a crater (model step 2; figure 2). Figure 3 shows gullies and arcuate ridges, but unlike in the Newton Basin examples, the mantling deposits behind the ridges is still present (model steps 3-4). Downward flow of the mantling deposits likely formed the arcuate ridges as moraine-like features. Sublimation removes some of the fill, but much of it remains. Gullies and their debris aprons superpose the mantling deposits, representing the last stage of activity, the melting of the wall deposits and subsequent fluid flow incision forming the gully channels (model step 5). Larger tongue-shaped lobate flows, such as those discussed by [6] and in Greg crater by [18], are observed throughout the southern mid-latitudes [see also 19]. They are also prevalent in Nereidum Montes and some retain some mantle fill (Fig. 4) which may have contributed to their formation. Previously identified lobate flows showed only the moraine-like ridges left behind by flow material that since eroded away. Discussion and future work: The suite of icerelated features in Nereidum Montes is similar to those found in other mid-latitude regions, but appear more widespread, better preserved, and/or potentially younger than in other mid-latitude regions such as eastern Hellas or Newton Basin. Further investigations of Nereidum Montes using high resolution images will likely provide additional evidence for extensive deposition and mobilization of ice-rich materials. Age constraints for these features from crater counts would also be useful for comparison with other regions and relation to climate models. References: [1] Malin M.C. and Edgett K.S.
