The small  meteor events,  for example meteor showers are caused by sand sized grains and almost all of them disintegrate and never reach the Earth's surface. However, they are observed on thy sky as paths radiating when they entry to the higher atmosphere. They can be analyzed  chemically  from spectrograms of  pictures  and videos of meteor surveillance cameras and have a large documented data.  Large meteor events are well documented from physical and chemical analysis of pieces. 'Medium' sized  meteor  events  are  not  well  documented because they overwhelm and overflow the usual meteor shower surveillance cameras and it  is  hard to find any pieces from falling, because of small amount of fallen mass. Let we try to document a new event.Our earlier work (Vizi et al. 2012)[1] documented the falling camera images which were used to identify the touchdown region of the meteorites. In the case of the Košice meteorite fireball and falling event, all steps from webcam pictures of fireball throughout collection at the falling site and the  petrological analysis of the pieces have been documented in this way.The Pilis Event on 24th August, 2013: There was a  fireball  event  above  Slovakia  and  Hungary  on 2013.08.24. 21:02 UT. As we documented with tables and calculations in our earlier work (Vizi et al.)[2], we have collected web camera sources from the internet, nine photographs and one video record and some well documented descriptions from witnesses, like Molnar. Images were taken by eight web cameras, two of them were ski  webcams of  ski-truck  at  slopes,  one  was a meteorological  webcam  and  others  were  panoramic webcams. The video is a record of a car dashboard camera. The place was near to Radom, Poland, but only approximately  known.  The  image  sources  were  Cerna Hora, Nadejkov, Medvedin, Ondrejov, Paprsek, Stitna nad Vlari, Temelin, Vsetin (Slovakia). [3] In Hungary the sky was covered by clouds, so only the strong lightning of the final explosion was observed for example at Dorog, or Pilisszentlélek, both in  Hungary. One well documented witness wrote she heard a serial of sonic booms, the first sound come 160-170 seconds after the last  light  at  Perbal,  Hungary.  Several  significant  information  were collected  by Biro,  Molnar  and  Tepliczky. [4]Early, quick processing conception by Vizi (2011)[1] was carried out in order to select at least two well computable webcam pictures which are relatively long distance observations from each other both in km-s and in  angle of view. Google Earth and other maps were used to calculate the positions. GPS positions of cameras were identified first, which was a bigger task for several hours. Finally Medvedin and Temelin were selected for first quick computing.

The early begin  of  fireball  is missing in Temelin, because of the local start of the exposition, but from other full long fireball orbits it was usable especially to pinpoint the end of fireball and the end of the orbit. Other cameras were processed later by Hegedűs and Csizmadia [2][5]Video  processing can  be  used  to  determine  the start, orbit and the end of the fireball light, the brightness (from the known distance), the timing of the event (frame by frame) and form this info the estimated time of the fireball by Vizi. The only available info was: car video which was taken near the town Radom, Poland [4]. The position of camera was calculated from direction of fireball, the angle of the turn of the road and from several available objects, like the settlement early warning  traffic  sign  table  and  reflective  lane  guide plastic bollards of road, concrete fence and its corner on left side, lamps of lighting poles. The searching was successful on Google Earth and Street View. The position of the video camera: 51.258840°N 21.095921°E, azimuth. 21° frames, 7frames/s, fireball 3s. The quick  approx  results  (Vizi): Initial 100kg, speed Solar 14km/s, at atmosphere 20km/s fall 47.67°N 18.96°E fall 1-5 kg (no pieces certificated until now)Numerical Processing: As published [2] the initial mass range:12-230kg, probable 49kg. Absolute brightness is -8.5 +/- 1.5 mag. Min terminate mass is 0,51 kg. Fall: 47°37' 10" = Uncertainty: 5' 57" and 19°01' 28" Uncertainty: 5' 28"; in decimal the fall is: 47.617915°N 19.025647°ESpeed of Meteor: According to our calculations [2] the atmosphere contact speed was 14,5 +/- 2,5 km/s Orbit of the Pilis Meteor in the Solar System: According to the plane of orbit and the acceleration effect of Earth's gravitation the Pilis meteor came on an orbit from the inner part  of  Solar  System approaching the near vicinity of the Sun.Analytical: Can we estimate any analytical information  from available  pictures  until  we haven't  fallen pieces? Considerations: If light is generated by thermal process  then  colors  are 10000K cyan,  6000K white, 5000K yellow, 4000K orange and 2500K red,  which would also be assigned to the following emission centers  in  the  electromagnetic  spectrum.  A  wavelength range between 400 and 500 nm (blue region) is associated with Fe, dominantly. This region also contains Ca (at  398,  423  and  448  nm). The spectral  area ranged between 580 and 630 nm is related to Na, respectively. Absence of the olivine-induced green color (due to the chondritic  material)  may also  indicate  the  cometary formation  of  the  Pilis  meteorite  (Refs),  however,  its origin  is  still  a  matter of  further  discussion.  Let  we look  at  the  fireball  picture  made by  a  Canon  EOS 1100D on a webcam network, optimized for humans We are continuously searching for new data and meteorite pieces. We are in connection with local restaurants, post offices and mayors at fall place.Conclusion:  Last few meteor events and the new detection possibilities implied: it is necessary to collect the available web cameras, its positions and it seems to be necessary to investigate the building up a network - which is a combined surveillance system both for small and bigger meteor events, - with meteor cameras to record and analyze time and timing, orbit and direction, spectrum of fireball and the falling position.References: [1] Vizi et al., (2012) Summarized Analysis and Conclusion of Fireball-Meteorite 2010. 02.28.
