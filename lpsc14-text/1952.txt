Introduction:  Carbonaceous  chondrites  are  aunique  archive  of  the  early  history  of  the  solarsystem  and  are  affected  to  different  degrees  bythermal and aqueous metamorphism on their parentbodies.  In  this  study  we  analyzed  the  chemicalzoning of chondrule minerals in the CO3 chondriteKainsaz,  using  diffusion  modeling  to  obtaininformation  about  the  thermal  history  of  the  COparent body. As the metamorphic peak temperaturesof CO3 chondrites are supposed to be relatively low,chemical zoning in minerals may be preserved frompre-accretion processes like chondrule formation.  Itis  one  of  the  most  important  challenges  todistinguish if certain element and isotope signaturesfound  in  minerals  and  mineral  aggregates  wereformed before or after accretion into the parent body.We developed a strategy to distinguish between thesetwo cases and found a new method to determine thepeak temperatures of parent body metamorphism bycombining diffusion modeling with modeling of thethermal evolution of the parent body.  Analytical  Methods: We analyzed 17 fayaliticolivines and 5 chromites in  7 type II chondrules ofthe CO3 chondrite Kainsaz.  Chemical  analyses andEBSD  measurements  were  performed  using  aCAMECA  SX50  electron  microprobe  and  a  LEO(Zeiss)  1530  Gemini  FESEM (GMG  Institute,Ruhr-University Bochum), respectively. Chemical  zoning  and  thermometry:  Weobserve concentric but anisotropic zoning of Fe, Mg,Ca  and  Mn in  olivine.  The  chromite  crystals  alsoshow concentric  zoning  in  Fe and  Mg,  but olivineand chromite are rather homogeneous in Al and Cr,which  indicates  high  equilibrium  temperatures  of1300-1400  °C  [1]  that  probably  reflect  theircrystallization  temperatures  during  chondruleformation. The Fe-Mg exchange between olivine andspinel is temperature dependent and can be also usedas geothermometer [2]. As every analyzed chromitecrystal is in direct contact to an olivine crystal, thezoning  in  chromite was probably controlled by theFe-Mg  exchange  between  olivine  and  chromiteduring the thermal  history of these chondrules. Theolivine  crystals  on  the  other  hand  are  typicallysurrounded  by mesostasis,  so that  we interpret  theconcentric zoning in olivine to be dominated by thechemical exchange with the mesostasis. We appliedvarious  calibrations  for  the  Fe-Mg  exchangethermometer, e.g. [2], using the rim composition of Fig. 1: Diffusion profile of Fe in olivine. the olivine and the variable composition across thechromite.  We obtained for the core of the chromitetemperatures  approaching  the  crystallizationtemperature  as  obtained  from  the  Al  thermometer[1].  Towards  the  rim  the  apparent  temperaturedecreases  continuously and  reaches  a  minimum  atthe chromite rim of around 500-800 °C, dependingon which calibration is used for the geothermometer.Therefore  the  observed  Fe-Mg  zoning  reflectsresetting of this thermometer at lower temperatures,consistent  with  an  earlier  interpretation,  where  theFe-Mg  exchange  between  spinel  and  olivine  wasused  as  an  indicator  for  the  extent  of  thermalmetamorphism on the parent body [3].Diffusion modeling: We simulated the zoning inolivine and spinel with a one-dimensional diffusionmodel  introducing  Γ=∫Ddt as  a  fitting  parameter,where  D is the respective diffusion coefficient, e.g.,DFeMg for olivine. The value of Γ quantifies the totalextent of compositional change of the initial profilesby diffusion  processes,  which  is  directly related  tothe  thermal  history  of the  mineral.  The  measureddiffusion  profiles  were  modeled  usingcompositionally  dependent  diffusion  coefficientsaccording  to  [4],  [5],  [6]  and  [7]  and  thecrystallographic  orientations  of  the  profilesdetermined by EBSD measurements. Olivine.  The  quality  of  the  fits  and  theconsistency between the zoning profiles measured fordifferent  crystallographic  orientations  and  differentelements in olivine strongly indicate that the zoningin  type  II  chondrule  olivines  was  formed  bysolid-state diffusion (Fig. 1). The total variation forthe  obtained  values  of  Γ is  within  a  factor  of 10:1.6*10-12 m² and 2.1*10-11 m² but the abundance ofthe Γ values form a Gaussian distribution as could beexplained  by the  accumulation  of  various   errors,1952.pdf

e.g.,  produced  by  cutting  effects  and  the  fittingprocedure  (Fig.  2).  Therefore  our  results  stronglyindicate that  the chemical  zoning in  these differentolivine crystals were produced by the same thermalhistory consistent with a value of log (Γ [10-12 m2]) =0.91 ± 0.29.Chromite.  We fitted  the  Fe and  Mg zoning  inchromite with log (Γ [10-12 m2]) values of  0.67 ± 0.1and  additionally  simulated  the  profiles  employingthe olivine spinel thermometer [2] as a temperaturedependent boundary condition. By this procedure wecan  directly  couple  the  simulation  to  the  thermalhistory  as  the  form  of the  profile  depends  on  thecooling  rate.  The  measured  profiles  cannot  bereproduced  assuming  a  simple  cooling  historystarting from the crystallization temperature but areconsistent with slow cooling from low temperaturesas expected during parent body metamorphism. Parent  body  modeling: We  calculated  thethermal  histories of parent  bodies internally heatedby 26Al decay in different depths of parent bodies ofdifferent  sizes and with different properties using aone-dimensional numerical model. To test the rangeof  possible  thermal  histories  for  the  observeddiffusion profiles, the integrated diffusion coefficientover  time  (Γ)  was  calculated  for  every  thermalhistory.  Plotting  the  Γ  values  against  the  peaktemperatures  of  the  calculated  thermal  historiesreveals  that  there  is  a  unique  relation  between  Γvalue and peak temperature. This relation is valid forall  thermal  histories  and  almost  independent  fromburial  depths,  parent  body  sizes  and  materialproperties of the parent body. However,  as  the  relation  between  Γ  value  andpeak  temperature  strongly  depends  on  the  useddiffusion  coefficient,  it  needs  to  be  definedindividually for each respective diffusing process. Discussion:  The  combination  of  ageothermometer  and  diffusion  modeling  for  thechromite  crystals  indicates  formation  during  slowcooling  on  the  parent  body,  but  this  result  isdependent  on  the  assumption  that  the  olivine  rimcomposition is roughly constant and buffered by theFe-Mg  exchange  with  the  mesostasis,  which  mayalso depend on temperature.  The profile shapes areconsistent with this assumption and the quality of thefits and the reproducibility of the fitting parameter Γfor different crystals in different Type II chondrulesstrongly indicate  that  the zoning  developed mainlyin  the  same  environment,  hence  after  accretion  insitu within the parent body. As there is a unique relation between  Γ and thepeak temperature for parent body metamorphism, Γobtained from the diffusion profiles can be now used Fig 2: log(Γ) values for olivine diffusion profiles.to  estimate  the metamorphic  peak  temperature ofKainsaz,  which  is 765±34K.  The  Γ  values  of thechromite  diffusion  profiles  indicate  a  peaktemperature  of  646±11K,  but  this  temperatureestimate  might  be  incorrect,  since  we  used  theFe-Mg  interdiffusion  coefficient  for  aluminousspinel.  Replacing Al to a large extent by Cr withinthe spinel  structure should have some effect on thediffusion properties, but which is not determined yet.Thus the peak temperature determined by zoning inolivine  is  more  accurate  and  is  in  very  goodagreement  with the  peak  temperature  estimate  of726±29K  obtained  by  Raman  spectroscopy  ofcarbonaceous matter [8]. Conclusions: The  combination  of  diffusionmodeling  with  numerical  modeling  of the  thermalevolution of the parent body provides an independentestimate  of  the  peak  temperature  of  parent  bodymetamorphism with high accuracy depending on theaccuracy of the diffusion coefficients. Once the peaktemperature is calibrated in  this way, any chemicalzoning  observed  in  other  objects  can  be  nowevaluated based on the known thermal history of theparent  body  and  pre-accretion  features  can  beidentified.
