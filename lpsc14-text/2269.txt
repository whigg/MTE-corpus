The collector was exposed to the interstellar duststream in two periods in 2000 and 2002 with a total exposureof ∼ 1.8 × 106 m2 sec. Approximately 85% of the collectorconsisted of aerogel, and the remainder consisted of Al foils.The Stardust Interstellar Preliminary Examination (ISPE) wasa consortium-based effort to characterize the collection in sufficient detail to enable future investigators to make informedsample requests. Among the questions to be answered werethese: How many impacts are consistent in their characteristics with interstellar dust, with interplanetary dust, and withsecondary ejecta from impacts on the spacecraft? Are the materials amorphous or crystalline? Are organics detectable? Anadditional goal of the ISPE was to develop or refine the techniques for preparation, analysis, and curation of these tinysamples, expected to be ∼1 picogram or smaller, roughlythree orders of magnitude smaller in mass than the samplesin other small particle collections in NASA's collections —the cometary samples returned by Stardust, and the collectionof Interplanetary Dust Particles collected in the stratosphere.Methods:The ISPE consisted of several interdependent projects.More than 30,000 volunteers carried out track identificationin aerogel [2] by searching stacks of digital optical imagesof the aerogel collectors, using an online virtual microscope.Sample preparation [3] consisted of extraction of candidatetracks from aerogel in "picokeystones" using techniques developed specifically for Stardust, and extraction and mounting of Al foils on foil "stretchers" for subsequent SEM scanning. Seven laboratories participated in crater identificationin foils [12], using automated SEM imaging and a combination of automated and visual identification. We carried outFourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy [4] ontwo diffraction-limited, synchrotron FTIR beamlines at theAdvanced Light Source (ALS) and the National SynchrotronLight Source (NSLS). Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscopy (STXM) [5] was carried out at ∼ 30 nm spatial resolution on STXM beamlines at the ALS. Synchrotron-basedX-ray Fluorescence (XRF) Spectroscopy [6,7,8] was carried out at 100-400 nm spatial resolution on two XRF beamlines at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF)and an XRF beamline at the Advanced Photon Source (APS).Synchrotron-based X-ray Diffaction (XRD) [9] was carriedout at ESRF in parallel with XRF analysis. Laboratory-basedinterstellar dust capture analog experiments [10] were conducted at the Heidelberg Dust Accelerator. We did numerical modeling of interstellar dust propagation and kinetics[3,11] to support the interpretation of track and crater observations. We did elemental and isotopic composition measurements of craters [12] by SEM/EDS, Auger spectroscopy, andNanoSIMS. Crater cross-sections were extracted with focusedion beam (FIB) microscopy with a FEI Nova 600 FIB-SEM atthe Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), and subsequently ana2269.pdf

Final reports of the ISPElyzed with a JEOL 2200FS TEM at NRL. We carried out Oisotopic analysis on sections of two of interstellar dust impactcandidates, using the NanoSIMS at the Carnegie Institution ofWashington.Results:In a scanned area of ∼ 250 cm2 of aerogel, we identified71 tracks. Most of the tracks had trajectories that were consistent with an origin as ejecta from impacts on the solar panels.XRF and STXM analyses of a subset of the tracks showed thepresence of Ce, which is consistent with the Ce-rich cover glassof the solar panels, confirming this origin. Twenty five tracksshowed trajectories consistent with an origin either in the interstellar dust stream, or as secondary ejecta from impacts onthe deck of the Sample Return Capsule (SRC). Because of theextremely limited amount of sample, we chose to analyze 13of these tracks. Most were rejected as interstellar candidatesthrough X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Spectroscopy (XANES)at the Al K-edge, which showed the presence of Al metal, orby the detection of F, consistent with measurements of the anodization layer in samples removed from the Stardust SRC atthe National Air and Space Museum. We identified three particles that have a likely interstellar origin. Two particles, Orionand Hylabrook, were captured at low speed: comparison oftrack morphology with experiments carried out at Heidelbergindicate capture speeds �10 km sec−1. These particles atleast partially survived capture in the aerogel. XRF and XRDanalyses show the presence of crystalline olivine in both, andan additional spinel component in one. Both particles containsignificant Fe-bearing phases that may consist of reduced ironnanoparticles. Both particles have low overall densities, <1g cm−3. The third particle, Sorok, was apparently capturedat very high speed (�10 km sec−1), based on a comparisonof track morphology with laboratory experiments. No residual particle survived impact. While no organic matter wasidentified in any of the three particles identified as likely ofinterstellar origin, infrared spectroscopy did identify organicmatter in a contaminant particle of similar size, demonstratingthe necessary sensitivity.We identified 25 impacts in ∼5 cm2 of the Al foils. Fourimpacts contained projectile residues consistent with impactsof extraterrestrial projectiles. These particles show a diversity of composition and structural complexity. EDS analysisshows the presence of Mg-rich silicates, sulfides and Fe, Nimetal, in varying proportions. The morphology of one crateris indicative of a particle with two centers of mass.Discussion:The observed low densities of Orion and Hylabrook, theircapture speeds, and their specific trajectories are all consistentwith the hypothesis that a large fraction of interstellar dustparticles in the picogram size range consist of low-densityparticles, perhapfs agglomerates with a fractal-like structure[11], that are efficiently repelled by solar photon pressure asthey enter the heliosphere. Such particles would be slowed anddiverted from the nominal interstellar dust radiant in a directionthat is consistent with our observations. This would also beconsistent with our observation that the flux of particles in thissize range is much lower than expected. Particles with a ratioof solar radiation force to gravitation force β > 1.6 wouldnot have penetrated the solar system to the Stardust spacecraftorbit, so could not have been collected. However, as shown bythe high-speed particle Sorok, it appears that not all particleshave such characteristics. Therefore, from the point of viewof future mission planning for an interstellar dust collector, thenews is mixed: the flux is lower than expected, but a significantfraction of the particles have characteristics that allow them tobe captured nearly intact. Missions would maximize particlestatistics by carrying out exposures during solar minimum.It is known from astronomical observations that most silicates in the ISM are amorphous. While the presence of crystalline materials in Orion and Hylabrook was unexpected, it isnot inconsistent with the astronomical observations, becauseparticles in this size range and larger compose �1% of themass of ISM dust, and self-shielding in such particles canprotect crystalline materials from the effects of amorphizingradiation.On the other hand, the flux of very small (∼200-300 nm)particles in the foils was larger than expected. Although thetrajectories of these particles are not well-constrained, it isthought that these are statistically likely to be interstellar inorigin. We carried out O-isotopic analysis on FIB sectionsof two candidates, using the NanoSIMS at the Carnegie Institution of Washington. Astronomical observations show thatlocal galactic oxygen is ∼ 25% richer in 17O, on average,relative to the Solar System[12]. NanoSIMS meausrementsof FIB cross-sections of two interstellar candidates revealedO-isotopic compositions consistent with solar values, withinerrors. While a deviation from solar values would have beenan indication of interstellar origin, the converse is not true.We conclude that the number of∼1 pg particles that werelikely captured in the aerogel is extremely limited, perhaps onthe order of 12. Because no future interstellar dust collectionmissions are even in the planning stage, the Stardust interstellardust collection is likely to be the unique for at least two decades,and perhaps longer. It follows that the collection must betreated with extreme care. No isotopic measurements havebeen carried out for the particles captured in aerogel. Beforeany destructive analyses (isotopic analysis, ultramicrotomy forTEM analysis) can be considered, it will be necessary to carryout a major effort to validate end-to-end sample preparationand analytical techniques with sufficiently high statistics thathigh confidence in the protocols can be established.References: [1] Tsou, P., et al.
