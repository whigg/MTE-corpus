Introduction:  Maps of Mercury’s surface composition, derived from MESSENGER X-Ray Spectrometer (XRS) data, reveal large-scale variations in major element abundances [1]. The Mg/Si map (Fig. 1) has near-global coverage and a large dynamic range. The lowest Mg/Si values (~0.2) are found for the volcanic smooth plains within the Caloris impact basin. With this new Mg/Si map we confirm previous results [2], that showed large expanses of smooth plains on Mercury have low and relatively uniform Mg/Si compared with older, more heavily cratered terrains. The highest Mg/Si values (~0.8) are found for the low-reflectance ejecta deposits that surround the Rachmaninoff impact basin, and in a large (>5×106 km2) region centered at ~30°N, 290°E. This large high-Mg region (HMR) is also distinctive in other elemental abundances, with the lowest Al/Si and highest S/Si and Ca/Si ratios observed on the planet’s surface [1]. In this study, we discuss possible causes of Mercury’s compositional variations and the origin of the HMR in particular. Possible HMR origins: We consider three different, and potentially linked, scenarios to explain the HMR: (i) HMR material represents volcanic products from early, very high-degree partial melting; (ii) the HMR represents mantle material excavated by a large impact basin; and (iii) Mercury’s large geochemical terranes are evidence of a heterogeneous mantle. High-degree partial melting. The oldest parts of Mercury’s surface, which partly overlap with the HMR, are estimated to be about 4.0–4.1 Ga (cf. the age of the oldest lunar crust is ~4.5 Ga), according to one model of crater production [3]. As such, Mercury’s earliest crust (e.g., produced via magma ocean solidification) can no longer be observed, either because of its removal during a catastrophic event [e.g., 4] or because it has been obscured by younger material. The large Mg/Si variations may represent lavas that were produced by variable levels of partial melting from a peridotitic mantle source [e.g., 2, 5]. In this scenario, the HMR (and other high-Mg exposures) would be among the oldest crustal materials, produced by the highest degrees of partial melting, that can still be observed on Mercury’s surface. Younger lava flows, produced from lower degrees of partial melting, would have given rise to the lower-Mg regions. However, it may be impossible to relate the different compositional groups, by any fractional crystallization process, to a common source [6]. Mercury’s compositional variations are instead thought to be evidence for a differentiated mantle [6]. Mantle excavation. Crustal thickness estimates (Fig. 1) and topography measurements [e.g., 7] show that the HMR coincides approximately with an area of relatively thin crust and low-standing terrain. A second possible scenario is that the HMR’s low-lying, thin, and ancient crust is evidence of a large (~2400 kmdiameter) and poorly preserved impact basin. In this case, the HMR could represent ultramafic material excavated from Mercury’s mantle (mixed with some amount of crustal materials). Although this hypothetical basin has not been identified from MESSENGER images and topographic data [8], several of the planet’s large impact basins are not associated with typical topographic lows because they may have been modified by viscous relaxation [9] or lithospheric deformation [10]. Fault distributions [11] do not suggest the presence of an impact basin, but morphological degradation and resurfacing since the formation of such a feature may have obscured such evidence. A number of other ancient impact basins, mostly obscured by plains volcanism, have also been proposed [e.g., 12]. If the high Mg content, together with the high S and Ca and low Al contents of the HMR are indicative of excavated mantle material, it may be feasible to estimate the bulk mantle composition. With partial melting experiments and/or modeling it should then be possible to match Mercury’s volcanic rock compositions as products of such mantle material. Heterogeneous mantle. It is possible that Mercury’s thin mantle did not experience convection, or that convection ceased early in the planet’s history [13]. In such a situation, it is also possible that lateral or radial heterogeneities in composition remained unmixed. Regions with higher abundances of heat-producing elements would have melted earlier and to higher degrees than regions with fewer of these elements. The HMR may be an area that contains an abundance of such elements (e.g., some of the rare earths), given one interpretation of thermal neutron count rates from MESSENGER’s Gamma-Ray and Neutron Spectrometer [14]. Sulfides are likely to be the dominant rareearth-element- (REE) bearing phase on Mercury, an inference consistent with the HMR’s high S/Si values. By analogy with the Moon’s Procellarum KREEP Terrane [15], it is possible that late-stage melts within 1866.pdf

Mercury’s crystallizing magma ocean were enriched in incompatible, heat-producing elements and became sandwiched between the earliest crust and deep mantle cumulates. Lateral variations in the thickness of this layer across the planet may have arisen due to crustal thickness differences. If little or no mantle convection occurred since the episode that concentrated heatproducing elements around the HMR, this heterogeneity may have been preserved to promote high-degrees of partial melting. However, there is no direct evidence that Mercury had a lunar-like flotation crust [5], and so a trapping mechanism for the residual melt layer is not obvious. If our impact basin scenario is correct, a layer rich in heat-producing elements may have been excavated, and there may be no need to invoke a laterally heterogeneous mantle.
