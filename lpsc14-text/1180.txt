Introduction:  In August 2013, the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agengy (JAXA) launched an extreeme ultraviolet (EUV) imaging spectrometer aboard the Spectroscopic Planet Observatory for Recognigiton of Interaction of Atmosphere (SPRINT-A), nicknamed “Hisaki”, and formerly known as EXCEED (Extreme ultraviolet spectroscope for Exospheric Dynamics).  One of the prime scientific goals of the mission is to study the connections between the Io torus, the Jovian aurorae, and the middle magnetosphere in order to determine how mass and energy flow through the Jovian magnetosphere. In order to eventually determine the connection between Io’s volcanic activity and changes in the Io torus and Jupiter aurorae, and thus better understand the mechanisms by which Io supplies the Jovian magnetosphere with plasma, we are monitoring the activity of Io’s volcanoes using NASA’s Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF).  Large temporal variations in the Io torus have previously been attributed to postulated variations in Io’s volcanic activity (Delamere et al., 2004; Brown and Bouchez, 1997).  If this correlation can be demonstrated with simultaneous torus and volcanic observations, we will have established an important link in the chain between Io and the Jovian magnetosphere.  Here we report preliminary results of our monitoring program. Observations:  Several of the observations are scheduled during Jupiter occultations, when Io is in Jupiter’s shadow and the volcanoes are seen without interference by reflected sunlight.  During these events, we can obtain one-dimensional spatial resolution across Io by plotting Io’s total brightness as a function of time as it passed behind Jupiter (figure 1).  From this, we can determine the brightnesses of individual volcanoes on the Jupiter facing hemisphere of Io.  Since Loki is the most powerful volcano on this hemisphere, it is the volcano whose brightness we are able to measure most often, and thus have brightness information over a long period of time (figure 2).  We have Figure 2: 3.5 micron brightness of Loki measured primarily from Jupiter occultation observations. Figure 1: Brightness of Io as a function of time during an occultation disappearance lightcurve on September 16, 2013.  Io was in eclipse during the disappearance, and the large drop in brightness at 13:49 is due to Loki disappearing behind Jupiter. 1990 1995 2000 2005Date of Observation (year)0501001502003.5 micron brightness, GW/mic/strIRTF 3.8 micronsIRTF 3.8 micronsIRTF 3.5 micronsIRTF 3.5 micronsNIMS 3.5 micronsNIMS 3.5 micronsWIRO 4.8 micronsWIRO 4.8 micronsWIRO 3.39 micronsWIRO 3.39 micronsNew Horizons c/a1180.pdf

also been able to measure Kanekehelli in this manner (Rathbun and Spencer, 2010). During observations that do not take place during Jupiter occultations, Io’s brightness is mostly due to reflected sunlight.  On these occasions we will be looking for any major eruptions that are bright enough to be visible in reflected sunlight.  During the New Horizons flyby of Jupiter, we determined that an eruption at Tvashtar (figure 3) began at least 42 days before the flyby (Rathbun et al., 2013).  We used a shift-andadd technique to combine very short exposure (0.06s) images to increase spatial resolution and signal to noise ratio. A list of all completed and proposed observations are given in table 1.  They are spread in time to get good coverage of Io at all longitudes.  Dates for the sunlit observations will not be known until the observing schedule is released.  Table 1:  Dates of IRTF observation in 2013-14.
