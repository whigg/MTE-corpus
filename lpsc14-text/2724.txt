Introduction: The NEOWISE project was selected to be reactivated after a 31 month hibernation period in order to continue surveying for asteroids and comets at 3.4 and 4.6 microns.  The mission has recently reached its operating temperature of ~75 K, ensuring background-limited performance.  Now that the original solid hydrogen refrigerant has been exhausted, the temperature is achieved passively by pointing at zenith.  The mission has begun regular delivery of asteroid and comet candidates to the Minor Planet Center, including the first new near-Earth object (NEO) discovery, 2013 YP139.  As with data from the prime mission, the infrared images from the reactivated NEOWISE mission will be useful for characterizing physical properties such as size and albedo for minor planets.   Methods: The project began life as the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE; principal investigator E. Wright of UCLA), a NASA Medium-class Explorer mission that surveyed the entire sky in four infrared wavelengths (3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22 microns) [1].  The mission's primary scientific objectives were to find cool stars and ultraluminous infrared galaxies.  However, NASA's Planetary Science Division provided the resources needed to archive and publicly serve all of the single exposures, to create tools to support solar system science queries, and to actively mine moving objects out of the data in near-real time.  These tools are collectively known as NEOWISE [2]. During the fully cryogenic portion of the prime mission, the NEOWISE project extracted detections of >158,000 minor planets, including >34,000 new discoveries.  Among the detections were ~700 NEO (of which 135 were new discoveries) and 160 comets, including 21 new cometary bodies.  During the 3-band and post-cryogenic mission phases, >13,500 minor planets were observed, including 116 NEOs [3],[4].  The first known Earth Trojan, 2010 TK7, was found on the first day of the NEOWISE post-cryogenic survey phase [5].   All data products from the NEOWISE prime mission, including the single-frame images and extracted source lists, have been delivered on scheduled.  These images and detections are available through NASA's Infrared Science Archive (IRSA) hosted at the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center at Caltech.   To date, NEOWISE data have been used for dozens of peer-reviewed publications across many areas of planetary and space science.  The restart of NEOWISE will result in the delivery of an additional three years of survey data.  Data releases of images and sources will be made annually through IRSA.  Candidate minor planet position-time associations ("tracklets") are being delivered to the Minor Planet Center on an ongoing basis.  After three years, precession of the orbital plane will make it difficult to keep scattered light out of the telescope's boresight, representing a natural end to the mission.   Figure 1 shows that the image quality and detector performance following the restart are essentially unchanged from before hibernation. As with the prime mission, the NEOWISE observing cadence results in 1-2 day long observational arcs.  Therefore, groundbased follow-up is essential for securing orbits.  Visible light observations are needed in order to derive albedo.  The NEOWISE NEO candidates are posted on the Minor Planet Center's NEO Confirmation Page in order to distribute them to follow-up observers. During the three years, based on the performance during the prime mission's post-cryogenic survey phase, NEOWISE should detect ~2000 NEOs at infrared wavelengths, and thousands of more distant asteroids. Acknowledgements: This publication makes use of data products from NEOWISE, which is a project of  Figure 1: Some of the first images from the NEOWISE restart indicate that image quality and sensitivity are consistent with the prime mission's performance.  Detections of Main Belt asteroid (872) Holda are shown by creating a coadd without outlier rejection. Blue = 3.6 microns; red = 4.6 microns. 2724.pdf
