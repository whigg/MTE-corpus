 FORMATION SCENARIOS OF THE MOON: THE MESSAGE FROM TUNGSTEN ISOTOPES.  Christoph Burkhardt1 and Nicolas Dauphas1, 1Origins Laboratory, Department of the Geophysical Sciences, The University of Chicago, 5734 South Ellis Avenue, Chicago, Il 60637, USA (burkhardt@uchicago.edu, dauphas@uchicago.edu). Introduction: While canonical giant impact models indicate that  the Moon is mainly made from impactor material [e.g., 1], the absence of isotope anomalies between the Moon and the Earth suggests that the Moon is mainly made out of terrestrial material [e.g.,  2]. An easy way out of this lunar isotope crisis is to assume identical isotope compositions for the impactor and the protoEarth [3]. This seems plausible, as the impactor and the protoEarth likely formed at similar heliocentric distances. However,  the within error  identical  182W/183W ratios of the terrestrial and lunar mantles [4] have been used to argue against such a scenario. The W isotope composition in a body is altered by the decay of 182Hf to 182W (t1/2= 8.9 Myr) and thus depends on the nature and timescales of accretion, core formation and mantle differentiation [e.g., 5]. It is considered an unlikely coincidence that a canonical Moon-forming impact produced identical W isotope compositions for the lunar and terrestrial mantles. Instead, W isotopes have been used to argue for a Moon predominantly derived from protoEarth  material  [2,5]  or  isotopic  equilibration  of the Moon and the Earth mantle in the aftermath of the giant impact [6]. Here, we investigate these qualitative claims by an advanced mass-balance that explores the Hf-W parameter space for  the impactor  and the protoEarth using the Hf/W ratios and the W isotopic compositions of the bulk silicate Earth and the Moon. Our mass-balance indicates that from a W isotope perspective, making the  Moon mainly out  of  impactor  material  is  as likely as making it primarily out of protoEarth mantle material. Approach: The two observable constraints of the Hf-W system, the Hf/W ratio and the W isotopic composition of a reservoir are defined relative to a chondritic reference (CHUR) as: f=(Hf/W)reservoir/(Hf/W)CHUR-1   and εW=[(182W/183W)reservoir/(182W/183W)CHUR-1]×104, such that for a chondritic bulk planetary body at any time t after the start of the solar system f =εW=0. The terrestrial and lunar mantles have within uncertainties identical  W  isotope  compositions  (εWMoon  =+2.0±0.1 [4] and εWBSE =+1.9±0.1 [5]) and Hf/W ratios (fMoon,mantle= 25.7±3.3 and fBSE= 25.4±4.2, based on re-evaluation of literature estimates and using the chondritic Th/Hf and  U/Hf  ratios  of  [7]).  We assume that  the  Moonforming  impact  was  the  Earth's  last  major  accretion event,  followed  only  by  accretion  of  a  late  veneer (0.33% of the mass of the Earth, 0.023% of the mass of the Moon [8]). We further assume that the impactor and the Earth have chondritic bulk compositions and that  both  bodies  have  identical  silicate/metal (mantle/core) mass fractions, which seems plausible if they came from about the same heliocentric distance. The Moon is made out of protoEarth mantle, impactor mantle, impactor core and late veneer material. Of the impactor material in the Moon, a fraction is from the impactor core and the rest is from the impactor mantle. Metal  in the lunar core  probably corresponds to impactor core material (the lunar core represents ~2% of the mass of the Moon). The mass-fraction of the Earth derived  from  the  impactor  is  kept  constant  at  0.11 (mars-sized impactor). Finally  k is the fraction of the impactor  core  re-equilibrating  with  the  Earth  mantle before being absorbed into Earth's core, i.e., k=1 indicates full equilibration of the impactor core with the target mantle and k=0 indicates no re-equilibration. For a given impact scenario and knowing fBSE, εWBSE, fMoon,  εWMoon, the mass-balance equations can be solved numerically  for  fimpactor,mantle,  εWimpactor,mantle,  fprotoEarth,mantle,  εWprotoEarth,mantle. All our simulations consider that the lunar core is made of impactor core material, which is suggested by all impact simulations [1,9,10,11] and is consistent with the near-terrestrial Fe/Mg ratio of the lunar  mantle,  which  indicates  that  no  iron  reduction took place. Results and discussion:  Canonical impact: Solving the mass-balance for a canonical Moon-formation scenario (2/3 of the Moon derived from a Mars-sized impactor) and  k=0.5 returns the impactor mantle and protoEarth mantle W isotope compositions and Hf/W ratios displayed in Fig. 1a,b. The dots represent 1000 outcomes of the calculation when uncertainties on the observables (i.e., input parameters) are propagated using a Monte-Carlo simulation and the black crosses are the mean values. The inferred protoEarth and impactor mantles  have  considerably  higher  εW  values  than present-day terrestrial  and lunar  mantles.  The  εW of the protoEarth mantle strongly depends on the degree of re-equilibration of the impactor core. Varying k between reasonable estimates of 0.2 and 0.8 [12] yields protoEarth mantle εW values between +3 and +7. The εW of the impactor mantle is +3 to +7. Non-canonical  impact: A  non-canonical  impact scenario in which the Moon is mainly made from protoEarth material was proposed by [10] to overcome the lunar isotope crisis [2]. For tungsten, such a scenario is  not  significantly  different  from the  canonical  model discussed above, except that the Hf-W systematics of the impactor can be less well constrained, because less impactor material ends up in the Moon. Mass-balance results for  a scenario with the Moon being made by two thirds of protoEarth mantle material and all other parameters the same as in first scenario (i.e., k=0.5) are shown in Fig. 1c,d. Such a scenario also requires mixing  protoEarth  and  impactor  materials  with  specific compositions to match the observed lunar and terrestrial mantle values. Even if one assumes that the impactor core did not equilibrate with the protoEarth mantle (i.e., fixing k to 0),  which  seems unlikely [12,13],  deriving  100% of the lunar mantle from the protoEarth mantle does not resolve the W isotope conundrum because (i) the lunar mantle equilibrated with its core,  which was derived from the impactor core, and (ii) the proportions of late veneer  material  in  the  lunar  and  terrestrial  mantles were different. These two factors are sufficient to induce a significant shift in the lunar mantle composition, such that very specific protoEarth and impactor compositions are again required. Conclusions: From the above observations it is evident that W isotopes do not provide strong constraints on which of the proposed models of the Moon-formation is correct. Both the canonical model of making the Moon mainly out of impactor material and the newer models in which the majority of the Moon is derived from the protoEarth mantle, require special conditions to explain the similarities in Hf/W ratios and  εW values of the lunar and terrestrial mantles. However, it should be noted that although special conditions are needed, the chances of producing postimpact  planetary  bodies  with  mantle  εW  ~2  do  not seem too implausible. Simulations of planetary accretion result in planetary mantle  εW values with a limited spread and a peak at εW ~2 [14,15]. Thus, from a dynamical perspective,  producing bodies with mantle εW ~2 might be a natural outcome of planetary accretion. This view is supported by the fact that the mantle εW of Mars is also nearly indistinguishable from the terrestrial and lunar mantles (εW=2.6), despite having a very  different  Hf/W ratio  and  accretionary  history [7,15].  Our results indicate that future high-precision measurements of lunar samples may reveal significant 182W differences between the Earth and the Moon. References: [1] Canup, R.M. and Asphaug, E.
