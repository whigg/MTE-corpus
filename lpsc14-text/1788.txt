Introduction: In situ analyses from the laserinduced breakdown spectrometer (LIBS) that is part of the ChemCam instrument on the Mars Science Lab Curiosity rover sample ~200-450 µm diameter spots at stand-off distances from 2-7 m [1]. The basaltic source rocks at Gale Crater contain phenocrysts with sizes that are roughly on the same scale as the LIBS beam. Thus, the beam is generally too large to sample individual grains, and too small to obtain a representative bulk analysis [2], presenting obstacles to geochemical interpretations. In this project, we develop methods to determine when the laser samples a single phase, a pair of phases, or more than two phases, and to use cation ratios to evaluate their compositions. Why Use Cation Ratios? Typically 30-50 laser shots are fired at each location, and multiple locations on each target are lased. Averaging all the shots acquired at any given location obscures useful information that can be revealed by using cation ratios based on individual shot data and by considering mineral stoichiometry. For example, when the beam lases a mixture in which two different phases with constant compositions occur in variable proportions, selected cation-cation plots must show straight mixing trend lines whose slopes and intercepts characterize their composition accurately. Figure 1 shows a plot of molar Ca/(Ca+Na) (plagioclase composition) for a target called McGrath with propagated errors [3] based on RMSEP values from [4]. The best fit line for these data passes through the origin (y intercept is 0.00±0.04), implying that only one phase in this rock contains Na and Ca - likely a feldspar. The slope is the anorthite composition of the rock, 0.62±0.23. The trend demonstrates unequivocally that all the Na and Ca cations in this location are in a single phase - a conclusion that cannot be made on the basis of an averaged analysis.  Methods: Using software developed in [3], ChemCam data from sols 13-360 were first converted to moles. The program then queries every individual shot to determine if a single phase was analyzed using stoichiometric criteria; currently, the program searches for Fe oxide, feldspar, pyroxene, and olivine. The software can plot any combination of summed cations on either axis of an x-y graph, and also outputs errors on x, y, slope, and intercept based on Deming regression [5].  Results for Single Minerals: In the data from sols 13-360, there are only 171 analyzed spots (out of >70,000 shots on unknowns) in which Si/(Ca+Na+K) is between 2 and 3 (±0.19, which is the average error on that ratio) and all the other cations total to <10 mole% (an arbitrary cut-off). This ratio is diagnostic of feldspar group minerals. Interestingly, a majority of the targets are soils. All analyses with feldspar stoichiometry also contain other cations (Fe, Mg, Ti), suggesting some contamination, perhaps resulting from Fe cement [6] or finely disseminated Fe oxide. There are no single shot analyses possessing olivine stoichiometry where Si/(Fe+Mg) is 0.5±0.24; in fact, all shots with that ratio contain other cations totaling >20 mole% of the cations present. So there are no  Figure 3. Histogram of plagioclase compositions calculated for all ChemCam locations where Ca/(Ca+Na) has R>0.70.  Note that the data closely resemble those for feldspars from SNC meteorites and from CheMin analyses [7].  Figure 4. Slopes and intercepts of plots of Ca/Ca+Na and K/K+Na. Vertical red lines indicate a zero intercept, or locations where there is only a single feldspar present. Points plotting to the right of the line have excess Ca or Na in the second phase, points plotting to the left of the red line indicate locations with two coexisting feldspars. recognizable single olivine analyses in this data set within its current accuracy. This suggest that phenocrystic olivines, if present, are likely somewhat smaller than the ChemCam beam. For pyroxene, there are 106 spots where the value of Si/(Fe+Mg+Mn+Ti+Ca) is between 1.00±0.29 and the other cations total to <20 mole% of the cations present (Figure 2). These lie in the range of the pigeonite-augite field expected in Mars pyroxenes from orbital and SNC meteorite data. Taken collectively, the single shot tests show that instances where a ChemCam shot hits a single mineral species of one of these common mineral groups are extremely rare. This could imply that the grain size of rocks in Gale Crater is significantly smaller than the 400 µm LIBS beam. It may further be a reflection of current accuracy of ChemCam. As its science team continues ongoing work to broaden its calibration training set and improve accuracy of elemental analyses, more pure mineral shots may be recognized. Mineral Pairs: There are many occurrences in the ChemCam data where ratios of elements form linear trends with positive slopes indicating mixing between two species. The matlab routine described in [3] was used to seek out such trends for a large number of cation ratios. As seen in Figure 1, ratios for which cations form a linear array and pass through the origin represent single phases with constant compositions that are mixed with a second phase. In all cases, a linear mixing trend in, for example, Ca/(Ca+Na) must be accompanied by a linear mixing trend in another variable such as Mg/Mg+Fe. Figure 3 shows the Ca/(Ca+Na) contents of all locations probed by ChemCam where a line plotted through Ca/(Ca+Na) has a Pearson correlation coefficient (R) > 0.70 (i.e., a linear trend).  Also useful are cases where the intercepts of linear cation mixing trends do not pass through the origin.  For example, a plot of Fe (x axis) vs. Si (y axis) with a positive intercept requires that some Fe be present in a non-silicate, likely an Fe oxide. Figure 4 shows a graph of all the slopes and intercepts for which the Pearson coefficient is >0.70 taken from plots of Na/(Na+Ca) and K/(K+Na). These data suggest that there are many two-feldspar rocks in Gale Crater.  Future work: Chemical compositions of mixtures of minerals can be determined by using known cation ratios based on stoichiometry of common rock-forming phases. Every improvement in the accuracy of ChemCam analyses will enhance our ability to use LIBS data to measure mineral compositions in the common cases where the laser samples a pair of phases. Work is in progress to develop logic trains to routinely determine mineral compositions from ChemCam analyses. References: [1] Maurice S. et al. (2012) Space Sci. Rev., 170, 95-166. [2] McCanta M. C.
