 IONIAN PATERA VOLUMES AND IMPLICATIONS FOR FORMATION MECHANISM.  A. G. Davies1, O. L. White2,3, P. Schenk2.  1Jet Propulsion Laboratory-California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91109, USA (Ashley.Davies@jpl.nasa.gov), 2Lunar and Planetary Institute, USRA, Houston, TX 77058, USA, 3NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA 94035, USA.  Introduction: Volcanic caldera-like structures called paterae are a ubiquitous geomorphologic feature on the jovian satellite Io [1].  Paterae are the source of most of Io's volcanic thermal emission [2].  However,  little work has been done to measure their depths and calculate their volumes of material removed [e.g., 3-7], a necessary quantity if the formation mechanism is to be understood.  In addition to shadow measurements to estimate patera depth, recent work [8, 9] has created new stereo and photoclinometric products from Voyager and Galileo image data.  We are using these products to systematically measure the depths and wall slopes of paterae across Io's surface.  Paterae volumes are then calculated.  As noted in [10] this work will allow the global characteristics of paterae to be studied, and formation models [6, 11, 12] can be tested, refined, or replaced.    Difficulties: There are many difficulties in processing spacecraft data of Io to extract the desired parameters due to the high radiation environment impacting the Galileo imaging system, uneven longitudinal and latitudinal coverage, and wide ranges of phase angles and spatial resolutions [13].  Additionally, the widely-differing albedos of surface units in and around numerous paterae make photoclinometry (PC) difficult, although assuming a patera shape and assigning albedo brightnesses to different units allows profiles to be constructed [6].  A description of PC methodology for deriving paterae topography is given in an attendant LPSC abstract by White and Schenk [9].   Methodology: We have so far examined 23 paterae (Table 1).  In short, the examples in Table 1 are from low-Sun PC images that have corresponding high-Sun albedo images that are used to directly gauge the differences in shading at low and high Sun angles.  These albedo images are generally of a similar resolution to the PC images, with the exception of that used to make the Haemus DEM (not included in Table 1), which is quite blurred (high Sun images are rare at the poles).  Mean diameters have been calculated from a range of profiles taken across the paterae; patera areas are calculated using long and short diameters and by regarding patera shapes as either rectangular or elliptical.  All slopes are measured from the slope maps that are created alongside the PC DEMs.  A fuller description of the methodology used is given in [9] and [14].  Patera depths were also calculated from stereo products.    Mobilisation and removal of volatiles:  Some high resolution observations by the Galileo SSI camera show slumping of material that appears to have slid off tilted crustal blocks, suggesting upper surface layers that are not as coherent as the bulk material comprising the mountains.  Io's upper surface appears to consist of a mixture of sulphurous compounds and silicate material, both as pyroclastics and lava flows.  If most paterae are formed by the repeated injection of silicates at the base of this relatively unconsolidated layer, the sulphurous material can be mobilized and excavated.  Assuming an upper-crust ratio of 70% SO2 to 30% S,  we have calculated the minimum total volumes of silicates needed to form the paterae in our study through heat exchange between intrusion and overlying volatiles. Results:  Table 1 shows results for paterae depth, estimates of paterae volume and the energy needed to heat and melt  the paterae volume of sulphur and SO2.  The evacuation of this material might form a patera by unroofing of the silicate intrusions that are the heat source [e.g., 7].  Table 1 also shows the volume of silicate magma that is needed to yield its heat to mobilise the sulphurous materials.  The volume has been increased by 10% to account for the fact that part of the volatiles are replaced by the silicates themselves.  The depth of the initial volatile layer appears shallower than it actually is because part of the patera has filled with silicates. Conclusions:  1.  Depths of 23 paterae determined using the nominal PC method average 1.1 km (± 0.4 km).  With stereo, depths average 1.4 km ((± 0.4 km).  Rough volume estimates (corrected removed volume) range from ~170 km3  to ~7430 km3.   2.  The heat that has to be supplied to mobilise the sulphurous materials (heating them to melting point and then melting them - no further heating is so far included) comes from silicate (basalt) intrusions, and requires 8 x1019 to 3 x 1021 J for the paterae in Table 1. 3.  Initial estimates of minimum silicate volumes needed to mobilise the volumes of sulphurous material to form these paterae range from ~14 km3 to ~640 km3, likely supplied in a series of intrusive episodes. 4.  Our results support the idea of a ubiquitous volatile rich layer on Io that is of order ~1 km thick. References: [1] Radebaugh, J. et al. (2001) JGR, 106, 33005-33020. [2] Veeder G. et al.
