Introduction: Our research group is studying White Sands New Mexico (WSNM) gypsum rich sand dunes as an analog study area for the gypsum rich dunes in the northern polar region of Mars called Olyumpus Undae [1]. We have prepared visible/near infrared (VNIR) spectra of field samples from WSNM in order to characterize their spectral properties and provide ground truthing for orbital detection of gypsum-bearing material on Mars. In order to interpret our spectra of the WSNM samples, we prepared and measured VNIR spectra of pure samples of gypsum and dolomite as well as mixtures of these two minerals [2]. Samples: Samples were collected from the WSNM field site from 4 dunes and nearly all samples from the WSNM area are dominated by gypsum with ~2-5 wt.% quartz [1,3]. We focus here on samples from dune 3 that contain carbonate in addition to gypsum and quartz. Samples were prepared in two ways for this study: 1) grains from the white sand sample collected at flag 7 were sieved to <45, 45-90, 90-150, 150-250, 250-355, 355-495, 495-1000 and >1000 µm, and 2) grains were sorted by color from the coarse material collected from ripple crests 1 and 2. XRD analyses of the 90-150 µm fraction of the flag 7 sample show 2.2 wt.% quartz mixed with gypsum, while analyses of the >1000 µm fraction indicate gypsum, quartz, dolomite and calcite are present [3].   The gypsum is from Thuringia, Germany, and the dolomite from Selasvann, Norway. Size separates were prepared by gently crushing and dry sieving the mineral grains to <45, 45-90, 90-150, 150-250, >250 µm [2]. The 45-90 µm grains were then wet sieved as well with methanol to remove the finer grain fraction. Mixtures were prepared by combining the 90-150 µm size fraction of gypsum and dolomite to create samples with 10, 20, 50, 80, 90, and 95 wt.% gypsum [2]. Reflectance spectra: VNIR reflectance spectra were measured using an ASD spectrometer under ambient laboratory conditions from 0.35-2.5 µm. Dune 3, Flag 7 Field Sample: Gypsum dominates the VNIR spectral properties of most dune sand at WSNM (Figure 1). Features characteristic of gypsum spectra include the major triplet between 1.446 and 1.535 µm, bands at 0.995, 1.204, and 1.945 µm, and a doublet from 2.217 to 2.267 µm (Figure 2). Only the >1000 µm size fraction is different and exhibits a band at 2.32 µm consistent with dolomite. Our mixture study showed that samples containing 80-90 wt.% dolomite exhibited spectra having features due to both gypsum and dolomite (Figure 2) as in the spectrum of the >1000 µm fraction (Figure 1). We also noted that the spectral brightness decreases as grain size increases for the gypsum-bearing samples (Figure 1). This was also observed in a recent study of gypsum spectra [4].    Figure 1: VNIR spectra of Dune 3, Flag 7 size separates showing that gypsum is dominant for all grains <1000 µm and carbonate is dominant for grains >1000 µm.  Figure 2: VNIR spectra of gypsum/dolomite mixtures.  Gypsum features are clearly present for samples  with as little as 20 wt.% gypsum.  Unique Grains at Ripple Crests: Despite the field samples containing overwhelmingly gypsum, there are a few exceptions. The ripple crests at dune 3 contained coarse grains with many colors. In the case of the ripple 1 crest this consisted of grains with seven different colors, while the ripple 2 crest had less color variation and we only separated the grains into two color groups (Figure 3).  Figure 3: VNIR spectra of grains sorted by color  from the crests of ripples 1 and 2.  Ripple 1 Crest: The white and beige grains both show strong spectral dominance of gypsum (Figure 4) with significant dolomite that draws down the overall reflectance values and provides less distinct bands at the 0.995, 1.204, 1.945, and for the 2.217 to 2.267 µm doublet. These two groups of grains are likely to contain roughly 30-40% dolomite based on our mixture study (Figure 2). The brown grains are very similar but with stronger indications of dolomite so they probably range closer to 70-80% dolomite. The transluscent grains have some gypsum character but likely also contain quartz as the gypsum features are weaker and there are no carbonate bands. The pink grains are consistent with hematite, calcite and some gypsum, while the green grains appear to be mixtures of the clays beidellite and prehnite and may not contain any gypsum. The dark grains also likely contain calcite due to the band at 2.34 µm and identification of calcite in some ripple grains by XRD [3]. They may have a small amount of gypsum due to the water band at 1.94 µm; however, the low overall reflectance precludes much gypsum. The dark color of the grains coupled with a low reflectance spectrum and a broad, weak band near 1 µm is consistent with a mafic component.  Figure 4: VNIR spectra of ripple 1 colored grains  compared with spectra of likely minerals  Ripple 2 Crest: The typical grains of this sample were white in color and gypsum dominates the spectral character (Figure 4). The spectrum of the white grains also has a band at 2.32 µm indicating the presence of dolomite. Like Ripple 1, the dark grains contain very little gypsum, have a band at 2.34 µm attributed to calcite, and likely contain a mafic component.
