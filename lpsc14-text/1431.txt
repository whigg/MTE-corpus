Introduction:  Modern Mars is a wind world. Its surface hosts a variety of aeolian features, such as linear, barchan and star dunes, ripples, granule ripples, yardangs and ventifacts [1]. Even though active sand transport was observed at the surface [2], it is not clear whether all of the preserved aeolian bedforms are active. In particular, transverse aeolian ridges have been suggested to be remnant dunes that formed under past climatic conditions [3].  Sand transport is largely controlled by the size and the density of the grains [4]. Moreover, dunes and ripples form in unimodally distributed sand particles from different instabilities, and the wavelengths of these different bedforms do not have the same dependence on grain density. In contrast, granule ripples typically have bimodal grain size distributions [5]. A quantitative inversion of the mineralogy and granulometry of aeolian bedforms would thus provide great insights on their modern  dynamics, but also potentially on Martian paleoclimates and distances of transport from the sediment source areas.  Figure 1: (top) Barchan dunes in Endeavour crater (HiRISE image ESP_032006_1775). (bottom) Dark dunes in Gale crater (HiRISE image PSP_009294_1750).  Methods: We invert for mineral abundances and grain sizes of aeolian dunes in Endeavour and Gale craters (Figure 1) from Compact Reconnaisance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) visible nearinfrared spectra (VISIR). The goal of this study is to compare inversions made from orbit to ground truth provided by instruments aboard Opportunity at Endeavour Crater, Terra Meridiani and Curiosity in Gale crater. We use Hapke’s bidirectional reflectance spectroscopy theory [6] to invert for optical constants of minerals from laboratory spectra [e.g., 7, 8]. These are used to compute single scattering albedos of mineral endmember components of varying grain sizes. We use an atmospheric radiative transfer approach, DISORT [9], to correct the CRISM spectra for the effects of the Martian atmosphere. Examination of spectra corrected using the standard volcano scan method [10] showed undesired atmospheric absorptions and albedo variations due to uncorrected-for aerosols. Consequently, single scattering albedo spectra were retrieved by simultaneously modeling atmospheric gases, aerosols, and surface scattering and thermal emission, using the Hapke bidirectional scattering function [11]. Input spectra were typically averages of 10s of pixels and, prior to modeling, input spectra were smoothed to remove spurious single channel excursions from the continuum. We chose the mineral endmembers to include from a careful qualitative inspection of the spectra to identify obvious absorption features present. These combined with common minerals found in basalt were used to construct a parsimonous minimum set for each site (Table 1). We also included an amorphous phase (basaltic glass, relatively flat and dark spectrum) in some of the endmember suites. Mineralogy and granulometry of bedforms were determined by use a downhill simplex algorithm to invert for their abundances and grain sizes, optimizing for the lowest RMS error between measured and modeled single scattering albedo .

 Figure 2: CRISM and best fit spectra from barchans dunes in Endeavour crater (Merid1 and Merid2, Figure 1 top) and dark dunes in Gale crater (Gale1 and Gale2, Figure 1 bottom).  Results: Endeavour. We invert the CRISM spectrum (from CRISM frame FRT00019E9C) using six and seven endmembers (without and with an amorphous phase, Table 1). Not including hematite leads to large amounts of magnetite to compensate for the low albedo.  The best fit abundances as calculated without the amorphous phase, rescaled to Fe-bearing mineral abundances only, compare well with those measured in Berry soils by the Mossbauer spectrometer [12] on Opportunity in the surroundings (Table 2). Berry soils are surface lag deposits, and were observed at the crest of ripples on sols 367-373. The inverted grain sizes (D50 ≈ 1400 and 870 μm) compare very well to estimates made using the Microscopic Imager (D50 ≈ 1100 μm) [5].

We invert spectra (from CRISM frame FRT0000B6F1) for mineral abundances and grain sizes using five and six endmembers, with and without amorphous phases (Table 1). The fit is slightly better when an amorphous phase is included in the modeling, and the best fit abundance for the amorphous phase is 24 wt%. At Gale in a sand ripple, the presence of a large portion of X-ray amorphous material was detected by Curiosity (27±14 wt% according to [13] and up to 45 wt% according to [14]). The best fit abundances as calculated with the amorphous phase, rescaled to modeled crystalline phases only, are compared with those measured by APXS and CheMin [14] on Curiosity at Rocknest (Table 3). Figure 2 shows a comparison between the CRISM spectra and the best fit models at Meridiani and Gale.    Ol Low Ca Px High Ca Px Plag.

These numbers were renormalized to only take into account the modeled crystalline phases.  Implications: Mineral abundances can be inverted within reasonable errors if the effects of the atmosphere are properly accounted for. DISORT corrected spectra yield mineral abundances and grain sizes that are in very good agreement with those observed by Opportunity at Meridiani.  Nevertheless, olivine abundances seem to be consistently underestimated. Moreover, the suite of endmembers used in the modeling, and in particular the use of an amorphous phase, may significantly alter the modeled mineralogy. Discriminating between two endmember suites is not trivial as the solution to the inverse problem is highly non-unique.   References: [1] Ward A.W.
