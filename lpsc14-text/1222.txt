Introduction: The recent Martian meteorite fall, Tissint, is a fresh heavily shocked olivine-phyric shergottite [1]. During a nanomineralogy investigation of this meteorite by analytical scanning electron microscope, electron probe, micro-Raman, and synchrotron diffraction, we identified two new shock-induced minerals ahrensite, γ-Fe2SiO4, and tissintite, (Ca,Na,□)AlSi2O6; these phases provide new insights into shock conditions and impact processes on Mars. Both were approved by the Commission on New Minerals, Nomenclature and Classification of the International Mineralogical Association. In this work, we describe these new minerals and demonstrate how nanomineralogy can play a unique role in meteorite and Mars rock research. Ahrensite (IMA 2013-028): Ahrensite (γ-Fe2SiO4) is the polymorph of fayalite with a cubic spinel structure and the Fe-analog of ringwoodite (γ-Mg2SiO4). Synthetic γ-Fe2SiO4 is a well known high-pressure (P) form of fayalite [2]. Natural occurrences are also known [3,4,5] but our study provides the first full chemical and structural characterization that establishes ahrensite, γ-Fe2SiO4, as a new mineral. The name honors Thomas J. Ahrens (1936-2010), a geophysicist at the California Institute of Technology, for his many fundamental contributions to high-pressure mineral physics research. Both ahrensite and ringwoodite are found in Tissint as fine-grained polycrystalline aggregates in the rims of olivines adjacent to shock-melt pockets (Figs. 1-2) but they preserve the Mg-Fe gradient of the original olivine crystal. They are often separated from the melt pocket by a thin layer of amorphous (Mg,Fe)SiO3 and wüstite (Fe,Mg)O. Ahrensite occurs as translucent, bluish-green, 5-20 μm polycrystalline aggregates consisting of submicron-sized crystals of 50-400 nm in diameter with grain size generally increasing towards the melt pocket (Fig. 3). The mean chemical composition of the type region is (wt%) SiO2 34.95, FeO 43.76, MgO 21.15, MnO 0.75, sum 100.61 with an empirical formula of (Fe1.06Mg0.91Mn0.02)Si1.01O4. Synchrotron micro-diffraction reveals that ahrensite has a cubic spinel structure with space group .3mFd  A synchrotron diffraction refinement suggests that some of the Fe is on site 8a, leading to a formula of (Fe1.12Mg0.86Si0.02)(Si0.98Fe0.02)O4, although the excess Fe is within error of zero. The cell parameters are a =  Fig. 2. Enlarged BSE image of Fig. 1, revealing ahrensite domains with surrounding phases. Red box marks location of Fig. 3. Fig. 1.

8.163(1) Å, V = 543.96(7) Å3, Z = 8, which leads to a calculated density of 4.135 g/cm3.  Tissintite (IMA 2013-027): Tissintite, (Ca,Na,□)AlSi2O6, is the Ca-analog of jadeite with ¼ of the M2 Ca/Na sites vacant and a likely end-member of (Ca0.75□0.25)Al(Si1.5Al0.5)O6. The phase exhibits considerable solid solution towards the Ca-Eskola pyroxene (Px) component (CaEs: (Ca0.5□0.5)AlSi2O6). Based on Px nomenclature [6], tissintite may be considered the Al-analog of omphacite with Al dominant in the M1 site and the Si analog of kushiroite with Si dominant in the T site. Synthetic (Ca,Na,□)AlSi2O6 is not known. Reported here is its first natural occurrence. The mineral name is after the locality, Tissint, Morocco, where the Tissint meteorite fell.  Tissintite occurs as fine-grained aggregates of 0.53 μm single crystals in plagioclase (Plag) glass, surrounded by diopside and fayalite within shock-melt pockets (Figs. 4-6). The mean chemical composition of is (wt%) SiO2 52.52, Al2O3 29.61, CaO 13.14, Na2O 3.89, FeO 0.93, MgO 0.18, sum 100.27, with an empirical formula of (Ca0.48Na0.26□0.26)(Al0.98Fe0.03Mg0.01) (Si1.79Al0.21)O6. Synchrotron and electron back-scatter diffraction reveal that tissintite has the C2/c clinopyroxene structure. The cell parameters are a = 9.418 Å, b = 8.562 Å, c = 5.219 Å, β = 107.56°, V = 401.23 Å3, Z = 4, which leads to a calculated density of 3.395 g/cm3.  Origin and significance: Both ahrensite and tissintite are high-P minerals formed by shock metamorphism during the impact event(s) on Mars that led to the excavation and ejection of Tissint off the planet. Ahrensite and ringwoodite in Tissint are high-P phases apparently formed by solid-state transformation of olivine without significant diffusion, given preservation of Mg-Fe zoning from the original olivine. Crystal size increases towards the melt pocket (Fig. 3), reflecting higher temperatures (T) as the interface is approached. With increasing shock T, olivine transformed to ahrensite (or ringwoodite), then to wüstite (Fe,Mg)O [or periclase (Mg,Fe)O] and metasilicate (Mg,Fe)SiO3 glass at the contact with melt pockets. Synthetic tissintite is unknown and it has not been reported in any other meteorite or in a terrestrial rock. Constraints on origin must therefore be derived from composition and petrography. Plag or maskelynite (Msk) with a composition between Ab66.7An33.3 and An100 is consistent with a tissintite-type Px whose composition lies on the join between (Na0.50Ca0.25□0.25)AlSi2O6 and end-member tissintite, (Ca0.75□0.25)Al(Si1.5Al0.5)O6. Type tissintite is close to the midpoint of this join (Ca0.50Na0.25□0.25)Al(Si1.75Al0.25)O6; its nearly 50% CaEs is the highest known in either a synthetic or natural material. Given its composition and location in the midst of melt pockets, tissintite probably formed at high P-T, perhaps via Msk melt or solid-state transformation of Msk, with higher T or cooling rates slower than for Msk outside melt pockets key to its formation.
