Introduction: On February 15, 2013, an ET object of 17-20 m in diameter and of a mass of ~10 Ktons entered the Earth's atmosphere over the city of Chelyabinsk (Russia) at a velocity of 18.6 km/sec and an angle of 17-20°. The ensuing airburst occurred at an altitude >20 km and released a total energy of ~440 kT [1,2]. The parent body of this Chelyabinsk meteorite has been estimated to be part of the Apollo asteroids: it could be a fragment of the Near Earth Asteroid 2011 EO40 [4,5]. Based on the mineral compositions, oxygen isotopic composition and texture of the recovered fragments, the meteorite is classified as an LL5 equilibrated ordinary chondrite, shock stage S4, Weathering Grade 0, similar to other LL5 falls [1-3,6]. Material: The studied fragment of the Chelyabinsk meteorite is an impact melt breccia with the cement composed of the melt (black lithology, BL) entraining fragments of the chondrite material (light lithology; LL) (Fig. 1). The LL contains a few chondrules of different textures with the average size of 0.5 mm. The rim of chondrules contains tiny (<10 m) inclusions of sulfide and rare metals. Some chondrules are slightly deformed. The main minerals of the LL are olivine, ortho- and rare clynopyroxene. Some olivine grains show mosaic structure and planar fractures. Rare feldspar grains show undulatory extinction, planar deformation features, and are partly isotropic. Irregular sulfide and metal grains of various size (up to 0.5 mm) are present in the LL sometimes forming metal-sulfide assemblages (Fig. 2). Sulfide and metal grains in the BL are much smaller, scattered through mesostasis and have subrounded shapes. Polycrystalline kamacite (Kam), sulfide, and rare melt pockets with 1-2 m sulfide and metal droplets are observed. Methods and Results: An analytical study was conducted at the LPL of the University of Arizona. Metals and sulfides were analyzed for 12 major elements with the Cameca SX-50 electron microprobe (EMP), and for 28 elements in metals and 36 elements in sulfides with a CETAC Nd:YAG LXS-213 laser coupled with a ThermoFinnigan Element2 ICP-MS (LA-ICP-MS). Hoba IVB iron meteorite metal, and MASS-1 and Po724M sulfide standards were used as reference materials. Fe57, S34, and Ni61 were used as internal standards. EMP analyses revealed the presence of Kam and taenite (Taen). Taen and Kam grains from the LL often coexist, whereas metals from the BL are "independent". Kam contains 3.2-6.1% Ni, 1.6-3.9% Co, whereas Taen contains 31.9-39.0% Ni and 1.0-2.0% of Co. The presence of tetrataenite can be inferred on the basis of very high Ni (49.2-50.4%) and low Fe (47.7-51.9%) concentrations in some parts of Taen grains. All analyzed sulfides (Sulf) are troilite or pyrrhotite with 60.5-64.2% Fe and 32.6-37.2% S, and other elements present in minute amounts. No systematic distinctions between the minerals from the LL and BL are observed on the basis of the EMP analyses. LA-ICP-MS. Kam from the BL is characterized by concentrations of Ni of 3.9-4.5%, Cu of 25-42 ppm, Ga of 1.3-2.8 ppm, Ge of 119-186 ppm, Os of 9.6-11.9 ppm, Ir of 9.7-11.7 ppm, and Co of 1.722.51%. Taen from the BL is low (for Taen) in Ni (22.030.8%), contains 226-310 ppm of Ge, 0.92-1.39% of Co, 4.9-7.2 ppm of Ga, and is rich in Cu (3,220-4,450 ppm), Os (9.9-14.9 ppm) and Ir (8.9-14.0 ppm). Concentrations of other elements in metals are variable. Kam from the LL is characterized by Ni concentrations of 5.4-6.9% (higher than for the BL Kam), Cu of 75190 ppm (higher than for the BL Kam), Ga of 1.1-2.3 ppm and Ge of 166-322 ppm (similar to the BL Kam). Concentrations of Os (1.5-3.5 ppm) and Ir (1.4-3.3 ppm) are lower than for the BL Kam, and of Co (2.5 to 4.3%) are slightly higher than in the BL Kam. Taen from the LL displays much higher amounts of Ni than Taen in the BL (31.6-43.2%), concentrations of Cu (1,291-3,721 ppm), which are lower than in Taen from the BL, high concentrations of Ga (7.1-20.9 ppm) and Ge (323-690 ppm), and low concentrations of Co (0.61.8%). Concentrations of Os and Ir are low (3.2-6.1 ppm and 3.2-5.9 ppm, respectively) for Taen coexisting with Kam, whereas the elements display much higher concentrations (8.2-15.0 ppm Os, 8.1-14.6 ppm Ir) in individual Taen grains. Concentrations of other elements in metals from both lithologies are variable. Concentrations of most trace elements in Sulf are low (often < 1 ppm). In particular, the PGE are on the edge of the detection limits (up to first ppb) except for Ru (0.04-0.16 ppm), Rh (0.04-0.50 ppm), and Pd (0.02-0.67 ppm). Sulf coexisting with Kam contains higher amounts of Ni (1,255-1,825 ppm) and Co (4373 ppm) than "independent" Sulf (170-1,000 ppm and 7-40 ppm, respectively). Big Sulf grains are richer in As (0.30-0.70 ppm) than smaller grains (0.10-0.20 ppm). The distribution of Au and Ag is interesting: whereas in most Sulf grains concentrations of these elements are low (0.01-1.11 ppm Au; 0.06-0.47 ppm Ag), a few big grains (both lithologies) display very high concentrations of Au (13.8-24.0 ppm) and Ag (1.2-8.4 ppm). Some big grains from the LL are rich in Cu (654-1,288 ppm), whereas others are poor in the 1407.pdf

element (15-262 ppm). Smaller Sulf grains from both lithologies do not display any features distinguishing them from either each other or from the big grains. Discussion: Coexistence of low-Ni Taen (~26% Ni) and Kam (~4% Ni) in the BL suggests that Kam-Taen partitioning continued down to T >900K. This closure temperature for Kam-Taen partitioning points to the "fast" cooling of metals from peak temperatures, and favors a near-surface impact-melting origin. To the contrary, the absence of low-Ni Kam in the LL (~6% Ni) suggests that Kam-Taen partitioning continued until lower temperatures. Taen from the LL displays mean Ni content of ~40% that suggests that metals may have reached the point of eutectic, i.e., the T of KamTaen partitioning cease was ~650K and the LL material was close to the state of equilibrium. Based on Fe, Ni and Co concentrations in coexisting Kam and Sulf from the LL, and using NiS activity coefficient of 0.2 [7], we estimated T of Kam-Sulf equilibration to be 550-575K, i.e., not too far removed from the T when the Kam-Taen partitioning ceased. High Ni amounts (up to1,825 ppm) in Sulf coexisting with Kam (LL) may point that the Sulf may have formed from Kam that underwent gas-solid sulfidation [7,8]. On the other hand, very uneven distribution of Au and Ag in some LL Sulf may suggest the presence of Au-Ag-rich grains in Sulf matrix. That could be explained by subsolidus exsolution of Au from metastable As sulfide [9] (Au and As display direct correlation in Au-rich Sulf) that suggests the presence of S-rich liquid. High concentrations of Ru, Rh and Pd in troilite also suggest generation of Sulf from the S-rich liquid because partition coefficients for these three PGE favor the S-rich liquid [10]. Wide range of Ni (170-1,000 ppm) and Co (7-40 ppm) concentrations in the BL Sulf accompanied by high amounts of Ru, Rh and Pd, and very low amounts of other PGE suggests that some Sulf generated from S-Fe-rich liquid likely resulted from the shock melting, whereas others may generate via sulfidation of Kam by S-rich vapors resulted from vaporization of LL Sulf under the influence of high temperatures during shock. Very similar compositions of the minerals from both lithologies, and very similar bulk chemical compositions of those lithologies [1] suggest that the material of the BL was produced in situ in the parent body, and is not the product of magmatism and differentiation. Shock and thermal metamorphism accompanying the collisions is a fundamental process in the evolution of asteroidal material. The brecciated state of the Chelyabinsk meteorite suggests strong involvement of shock-related processes during the evolution of the parent body. The more equilibrated state of the LL material and unequlibrated state of the BL material suggests that the BL was formed during a short event that resulted in partial melting of the LL material, followed by fast cooling that prevented reequlibration. This is consistent with shock melting of the material located close to the asteroid's surface.  The presence of polycrystalline Kam and Sulf accompanied by only rare melt pockets existence confirms that the shock stage does not exceed S4 [4,5,11].
