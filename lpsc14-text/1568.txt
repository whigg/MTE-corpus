EXTRATERRESTRIAL VIRTUAL FIELD EXPERIENCE.  C. Million1, R. Sullivan2, M. St. Clair1, A. Hayes2,3,NASA RPIF Network Node Directors and Managers, 1Million Concepts (chase@mill  ionconcepts.com  ), 2Center forRadiophysics and Space Research, Cornell University.  3Dept. of Astronomy, Cornell University.Introduction: To promote public access and use ofplanetary  spacecraft  data,  the  Spacecraft  PlanetaryImaging  Facility  (SPIF)  at  Cornell  University,  amember  of  NASA’s  Regional  Planetary  ImagingFacility Network (RPIFN) [1], has begun to participatein the Virtual Field Experience (VFE) program of thePaleontological Research Institute (PRI) [2]. The VFEprogram uses remote sensing data (e.g., images) of realterrestrial locations of geologic interest to create virtualenvironments  that  can  be  explored  by  teacher-ledgroups of students in an inquiry-based manner. In kind,SPIF has developed a prototype game-like classroomactivity  called  the  Extraterrestrial  Virtual  FieldExperience  (EVFE)  that  places  students  in  the  firstperson  role  of  the  mission  operations  team  for  theOpportunity Rover after its landing at Eagle crater onMars [3]. Students are tasked to discover the source ofhematite  signatures  detected  from  orbit  bycommanding  the  rover  to  move  and  makemeasurements.  The  students’  ability  to  commandmovements  and  measurements  are  subject  tolimitations on consumable resources as an abstractedrepresentation of the operational constraints faced byactual mission teams. The EVFE has the potential toconvey key  concepts  in  core  scientific  sub-topics  aswell as generalized scientific and systems thinking. Weanticipate that the EVFE will be used as an enrichmentactivity  in  junior  high  to  high  school  level  scienceclassrooms  or  after  school  programs.  The  EVFEproject is part of a new series of programs sponsoredby the NASA RPIFN [1] to utilize digital resources todisseminate and describe the data returned by NASA’splanetary  exploration  missions  to  the  general  public[3].Overview: Student-players  are  presented  with  agraphical  interface  that  allows  them  to  browse  apanoramic  image of  a  site  as  well  as  front  and rearhazcam  images.  Footprints  (quadrilateral  regions),which denote areas of potential scientific interest  areoverlaid on these data. The footprints have hover-overtext  that describes  why  the  location  may  be  ofscientific  interest. Selecting a footprint can make oneor  more  scientific  instruments  available  in  theinstrument  toolbar,  indicating  which  kind  ofobservations  can  be  made.  Selecting  an  instrumentfrom the toolbar brings up a dialog that explains to thestudent-player  what  information  potentially  could  begained by using the specific instrument, and how muchtime  would  be  consumed  by  the  measurement.  Forexample,  a  Mössbauer  observation  could  revealinformation  about  iron-rich  minerals  at  the  givenlocation,  and  require  40%  of  a  planning  day’sresources.  The  user  has  the  option  to  enqueue  theobservation for “uplink” to the rover. When the rover“plan”  or  “queue”  is  full  or  the  student-players  areready, they can execute their final plan by choosing touplink it to the rover, along with providing a scientificjustification  for  the  selected  observations  (similar  toactual  rover  planning  strategies).  The  sol  counteradvances,  and  results  of  the  observations  areimmediately  returned  in  the  form  of  a  “MissionManager  Report”  that  contains  data  from  requestedobservations  (in  the  form  of  images  or  graphs),scientific  interpretations  of  those  data, andrecommendations  for  future  observations.  This  cyclerepeats until all possible observations have been madeor the mission ends at 90 sols. Users can download thecomplete set  of  Mission Manager Reports  as  both areference and log of activities.Figure  1.  An  example  of  target  selection  withavailable  footprints  in  the  main  window,  availableinstruments along the left, queue along the bottom, andnavigation to the right.Design:  The prototype EVFE user interface andbehavior  was  designed  to  mimic,  but  in  a  greatlysimplified way, the tools and procedures used by actualmission  scientists  requesting  observations  by  roboticspacecraft. In this case, the interface is an abstractedrepresentation of the “maestro” toolkit [4] used by theMars  Exploration  Rover  team  and,  whereas  realmission scientists  must  balance  a  number  of  limitedspacecraft  resources  including  power,  data  capacity,and bandwidth, all spacecraft consumables within theEVFE are abstracted as simply “time.” That is,  eachactivity takes a specific amount of time to perform andmust be optimized against the limited amount of time1568.pdf

per day for activities and the limited number of days inthe expected mission lifetime.While all images and graphics within the activityare derived exclusively from real mission data, not allmission data are available within the activity. Rather, aspecific module or scenario contains a curated subsetof the available data for that location. Descriptions andinterpretations  of  the  data  are  written  by  an  actualmission  scientist  and  closely  track  the  thoughtprocesses of the actual mission science teams. The dataand descriptions included within each module form acohesive whole with a  core  narrative thread meant toconvey specific key pieces of information and generalconcepts, not unlike a digital museum installation.Figure 2. An example of  the data review panel  and“mission  manager  report”  with  activity  justificationand scientific analysis.The  prototype  software  runs  in  a  browserenvironment from a development web server, but thegraphical interface and its modes of interaction weredeveloped with the intention of the software eventuallybeing  deployable  to  mobile  and  tablet  platforms  aswell as a desktop environment.In  addition  to  the  front-end  module,  we  havedesigned  an  underlying  content  format--an  XMLdatabase  with  a  carefully  defined  structure--to  beextensible  to  a  number  of  manned  and  unmannedplanetary surface mission data sets. In the expectationof  developing  future  modules  for  other  NASAmissions, we have also developed a prototype contentcreation tool called SiteManager which assists a user inthe creation of correctly formatted XML modules.Future Work:  The appropriate amount or level ofcontent  for  the  target  audience  and  environmentremains  an  open  challenge.  It  is  likely that  multiplemodules will need to be developed--even for the samescenario--which  can  fit  into  different  educationalenvironments.  Play-testing  in  junior  high  and  highschool classrooms, expected to take place starting inSpring  of  2014,  should  prove  extremely  helpful  inrefining these elements. Full deployment of the moduleto  classrooms,  including  detailed  teacher  guides  andmapping of modules and content to specific CommonCore [5] and Next Generation Science Standards [6],may begin as early as late summer of 2014. We expectto generate new EVFE modules at a rate of at least oneper year with data from a variety of missions.RPIF Network: The  NASA Regional  PlanetaryImaging Facilities (RPIFs) are a network of 9 domesticand  7  international  planetary  image  libraries.  Thesefacilities,  which  are  open  to  the  public,  maintainphotographic  and  digital  data  as  well  as  missiondocumentation  and  cartographic  data.  Each  facility'sholdings contain images and maps of planets and theirsatellites taken by solar system exploration spacecraft.By  placing  users  in  a  reconstructed  first  personnarrative of  discovery,  the  EVFE addresses  the  longterm vision of the RPIF Network to serve as a resourcethat provides the complete story of space explorationthrough  archived  data  products,  historicaldocumentation, and outreach materials [7].Acknowledgements: We would like to  thank theRegional  Planetary  Imaging  Facilties  Network  forsponsoring  this  project  and  NASA  for  providingsupport through grant NNX13AC79G.References: [1] Hagerty,  J.
