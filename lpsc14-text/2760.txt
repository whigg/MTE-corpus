SPATIALLY-RESOLVED SPECTROSCOPY OF IMPACT-GENERATED VAPOR PLUMES.  M. Bruck Syal1 and P. H. Schultz1, 1Brown University, Providence, RI 02912 (Megan_Syal@brown.edu)  Introduction: Hypervelocity impact events have been observed both in laboratory [1–9] and at planetary scales [9-12] to produce self-luminous vapor plumes that contain a wealth of spectral information. Spectroscopic measurements are unique in their ability to constrain the temperatures and vapor-phase concentrations of materials within impact-generated plumes, which are known to both evolve rapidly and exhibit spatially complex vaporization patterns, particularly in the case of non-vertical impacts. Probing the thermodynamic state within such plumes under laboratory conditions also yields critical insight into how impact energy is partitioned indirectly to the surrounding atmosphere (and thus may contribute to the formation or erosion of planetary atmospheres), how materials of interest, e.g., volatiles or organics, may be efficiently delivered by asteroids and comets to terrestrial bodies, and how various target and projectile-derived compounds may undergo chemical reactions to produce new materials during impact processing. Furthermore, the pioneering use of impactors as excavation tools for the Deep Impact [9,10] and LCROSS [11,12] missions, which included spectroscopic observations of the resulting vapor plumes during each event, has exposed the need for additional impact spectroscopy work at laboratory scales. Accurate interpretation of the data obtained from such missions depends upon fundamental research on the formation and evolution of vapor plumes. Here we report results from an upgraded highspeed spectroscopic system, designed to capture spatially and temporally-resolved spectra of vapor plumes generated during laboratory-scale impact experiments. Previous foundational work on impact spectroscopy has focused on the jetting phase [2-4], which is the earliest-time and hottest component of vaporization. Later studies assessed organic synthesis [5] and the evolving chemistries of the cooler components as a function of impact angle [6,7].  The present work extends this method to probe a wider array of plume components with this upgraded system in order to constrain how vapor temperatures and compositions evolve in both time and space.  Experimental Conditions: Impact experiments at the NASA Ames Vertical Gun Range (AVGR) utilized dolomite [CaMg(CO3)2] powder targets and glass projectiles to study target-derived vaporization, along with the reverse compositional conditions (dolomite projectiles and quartz sand targets) to study projectilederived vapor. Dolomite's volatility and abundance of calcium and magnesium emission lines make it a useful proxy for studing vaporized planetary materials at laboratory scales [e.g., 2-4]. Glass impactors (and quartz sand targets) were selected to minimize contributions to the plumes' spectral content. Impact velocities of v~5 km/s, 6.35 mm-diameter projectiles, nearvacuum conditions (P< 8×10-4 atm), and a range of impact angles (θ=30o-90o) characterized the study. Target views included both half-space and quarterspace geometries; the quarter space set-up provides a cross-sectional view of the impact process along the axis of symmetry [e.g., 7,8]. This perspective permits the vapor to be imaged without obscuration or blackbody contamination from ejecta at later times. High frame-rate Shimadzu cameras capture the evolving morphology of the vapor plume with 2-µs resolution, while high-spectral-resolution (~0.2 nm) optical emission spectra (440-640 nm) are obtained from up to seven distinct regions of interest within the plume. The spectroscopic system consists of two intensified CCD cameras (Andor iStar 340T ICCDs) coupled with McPherson Model 2035 Czerny-Turner monochromators. Seven individual telescopes focus emitted light from the impact event into the spectrographs and onto separate regions of the ICCD detectors. The spectra are exposed 10-20 µs, with varying time delays (0-60 µs) applied by an internal digital delay generator, in order to characterize different plume components. Triggering of the spectroscopic system is accomplished by a photodiode focused on the impact point, which achieves ~100 ns accuracy. Wavelength calibration is carried out using a combination of Oriel spectral lamps, which span the entire wavelength range (Argon, Xenon, Neon, Mercury), while spectroradiometric calibration is achieved through observations of a Labsphere integrating sphere source.  Results: Improvements in spectral resolution over past impact flash spectroscopy systems employed at the AVGR enabled a greater number of individual atomic lines and molecular bands to be resolved than previously achieved for impact vapor plumes. In particular, the sets of CaO orange and green bands [13] that are centered near 550 nm and 610 nm were wellresolved into a series of band heads (see Fig 1). Additionally, well-defined band heads from MgO emission were observed within several spectra (e.g., Fig 1).  While spectral inversion methods may be used to estimate vapor temperatures and column densities [10], a relatively simple way of attaining initial temperature estimates is to construct a Boltzmann plot, based upon relative intensities of atomic emission lines [2,3,15]. 2760.pdf

Boltzmann plots of calcium emission have been successfully used in the past to estimate jetting phase temperatures [2,3]; here we apply the method to other regions within the evolving plume. Initial results for tracking the temperature of the edge of the plume as it expands and cools (see Fig. 2) estimate that it cools from 2500 ± 250 K to 2200 ± 220 K between 30 µs and 80 µs.  Mg/MgO%MgO%MgO%Ca%Ca%CaO%Ca% Fig. 1 A portion of the spectrum (approximately one-third of the entire wavelength range) obtained downrange from a 30o impact (v~5 km/s) into a ¼-space powdered dolomite target. Exposure time is 10 µs, delayed by about 20 µs after the impact point (total of 30 µs after first contact). The impact plume is illustrated in Figure 2. Both atomic (Ca) and molecular (MgO, CaO) emissions are visible. A Boltzmann plot of relative Ca intensities reveals that the excitation temperature is approximately 3300 ± 330 K.   80 µs 30 µs  Fig. 2. Composite image of vapor plume produced by 30o impact into powdered dolomite (v=5 km/s), imaged at 30 and 80 µs. Arrow indicates impact point; red and violet circles denote two (of seven) plume regions targeted by spectrometers. Boltzmann plots of Ca line intensities indicate that the plume edge cools from 2500 K to 2200 K between these images.    Comparisons between vapor temperatures generated by different impact angles demonstrate how increasing obliquity results in lower-energy vapor plumes, consistent with previous work [3]. For illustration, nearimpact point temperatures were calculated to be 5900±590 K and 4300±430 K for 90o and 60o impacts, respectively (see Fig 3).  Ongoing analyses will improve the accuracy of such plots.  T=5900&K&T=4300&K&a. b.  Fig. 3 a. 90o impact into powdered dolomite, imaged at 25 µs.

Quarter-space geometry is evident in this view, as the transient crater growth is visible through window along central axis. b. Boltzmann temperature plots for 90o and 60o. Slope of line is inversely proportional to temperature.  Discussion: The upgraded high-speed spectroscopy system demonstrates significant improvement of both resolution and sensitivity that will allow quantitative assessment of the rapidly evolving conditions in impact-generated vapor plumes under free expansion. Such measurements establish important benchmarks for both analytical and numerical modeling of impact vaporization. These experimental comparisons are especially critical for oblique impacts, which statistically dominate impact events within planetary systems but remain the most difficult to model accurately.
