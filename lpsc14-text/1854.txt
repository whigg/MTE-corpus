COMPOUND VOLCANOES ON MERCURY - IMPLICATIONS FOR VENT MIGRATION AND LONGEVITY.  D. A. Rothery1, R. J. Thomas1 and L. Kerber2, 1Dept of Physical Sciences, The Open Universiry, Milton Keynes, MK7 6AA, UK (David.Rothery@open.ac.uk, Rebecca.Thomas@open.ac.uk), 2Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique du CNRS, Université Paris 6, Paris, France (Kerber@lmd.jussieu.fr)   Introduction:  Volcanic vents on Mercury were first recognized in images from MESSENGER's first flyby by virtue of their non-circular (scallop-edged) and 'rimless' nature [1,2]. Many are at the centre of spectrally red spots with diffuse outer edges, interpreted as pyroclastic deposits [3,4,5]. MESSENGER images from orbit offer higher resolution views than those obtained during flybys, and reveal previously unseen details within and around vents. Orbital stereo imaging and laser altimetry demonstrate the depth of the vents and, in contast, the generally subtle nature of the edifices hosting the vents [5,6], which are more subdued than the 'broad, low shield volcano' morphology interpreted from flyby images [1]. On Earth, a 'compound volcano' is defined as a 'volcanic massif formed from coalesced products of multiple, closely spaced vents' [7]. We have previously [6] presented evidence to argue that a 'kidney shaped' vent (Red Spot 3, RS-03, of [3]) in the SW of the Caloris basin represents a compound volcano, where the locus of activity (the active vent) has migrated to and fro by about 25 km. Here we review the RS03 vent complex and several similar examples. Pyroclastic deposits from these vents overlie volcanic plains (or the lava fill of craters). Thomas et al. [8] present crater counts suggesting ages of 3.2-3.8 Ga for several pyroclastic deposits. We suggest that local vent migration has been widespread on Mercury, and argue that some of these compound volcanoes could have been individually active at episodic intervals over prolonged (>1 Ga?) periods. SW Caloris vents:  The vents in the SW of the Caloris basin are the archetypal compound vents on Mercury. Fig. 1 is a map on which RS-03, and numbered features 1-5 are likely compound vents. Within RS-03, cross-cutting relationships and preservation of fine-scale texture in vents F-I (Fig. 2) suggest an age sequence begining with A, then B, then C/D/E then F, G, H and I (the youngest). The floor of D is 1.0 km below the northern brink of the complex but the edifice rises less than 0.3 km above the regional surface, with flank slopes of about 0.2°. Candidate vent complex 5 has been imaged at high resolution (Fig. 3), and in stereo. It is at least 1.2 km deep, but like RS-03 the edifice is subtle, with flank slopes of about 0.3°. Textural evidence of age differences is less clear than within RS-03, so the multiplicity of vents suggests, but does not prove, a long history.  Fig. 1.

Other compound vents:  Figs 4-7 illustrate other compound vents on Mercury. Figs 4 and 5 are within craters, whereas Figs 6 and 7 are on plains. Figs 4 and 7 are linearly elongated, Fig 5 is arcuate (related to the crater centre), and Fig 6 is equidimensional but scallop-edged.  Fig. 4. Candidate vent in Kipling crater, 71.37° E, 19.15° S. Image 40 km across.  Fig. 5. Candidate vent 143.6° E, 5.2° S, 51 m/pix. Image 32 km across. This lies in an arc near the centre of a unnamed 80 km degraded, smooth-floored crater. These examples cover a spectrum of compound vent types. These appear to be dominantly explosive vents, lacking evidence of either effusive activity or piston-like caldera-floor subsidence. Several vent loci can be inferred within each of them, making them compound volcanoes. It is debatable in each case whether their several vents were active simultaneously or sequentially. In the latter case, the time interval(s) between eruptive phases are uncertain but could have been considerable.  Fig. 6. Candidate vent to the north of Rachmaninoff, 57.5° E, 35.9° N.
