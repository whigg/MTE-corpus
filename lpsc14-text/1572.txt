Chemically stable and widely distributed, PAHs are strong candidates for presence at low concentrations in martian soils, where they are expected to be delivered by meteoritic and cometary infall. While many processes likely contribute to the destruction of PAHs in martian soils, a low equilibrium concentration of PAH compounds may be present near the surface of Mars in some locations [5,6]. Here, we investigate the detection limits for PAH compounds in the Johnson Space Center martian soil stimulant JSC-Mars-1, using reflectance, fluorescence, and Raman spectroscopic techniques. Detection of at least some PAHs appears to be possible down to at least ~tens of ppm levels.   Methods: Anthracene and naphtho[2,3-a]pyrene were chosen as model PAH compounds for this study. Mixtures of 1-5 wt.% PAHs were mixed mechanically, while the lower abundance mixtures had the PAHs dissolved in dichloromethane, and diluted to the target concentrations. The PAH-bearing solutions were then mixed with the soil stimulant in a fume hood and the dichloromethane evaporated by gentle heating with a hot plate. The dry PAH-JSC-1 mixtures were then homogenized and placed in aluminium sample cups for spectral measurements. Fluorescence spectra were collected using two excitation wavelengths: 405 nm (provided by a 75 mW 405 nm diode laser), and 365 nm broadband excitation (provided by a spot-lamp with a 365 nm bandpass). Sample fluorescence was measured at the University of Winnipeg HOSERLab in the 200-1150 nm range with an Ocean Optics Maya2000 PRO spectrometer equipped with an HC-1 grating and 30 μm slit width, giving an effective spectral resolution between 0.48 nm at 200 nm and 0.46 nm at 400 nm. The detector is a 2D back-thinned linear CCD-array Hamamatsu S10420. Spectra were collected through a bifurcated fibre optic bundle consisting of six illumination fibres surrounding a central pick-up fibre feeding into the detector array. This assembly consisted of 400-μm diameter solarization-resistant (XSR) fibres. Raman spectra were collected over the 175-4000 cm-1 range at a resolution of ~4 cm-1 with the B&WTek (Newark, DE) i-Raman-532-S instrument. Excitation was provided by a 532 nm ~50mW BWN solid state diode laser.  Reflectance spectra from 400-2500 nm were measured (relative to spectralon) with an Analytical Spectral Devices FieldSpec Pro HR spectrometer at i = 30º and e = 0º at a spectral resolution between 2 and 7 nm, internally re-sampled to 1 nm intervals. Illumination was provided by a 100W quartz-tungstenhalogen (QTH) bulb. Reflectance spectra from 200400 nm were collected using the Ocean Optics Maya2000 PRO spectrometer as above, with illumination provided by an Analytical Instrument Systems Inc. Mini-DTA light source with output from a 30 W deuterium lamp. Results and discussion: Fluorescence spectra with 405 nm excitation show clear evidence for the presence of anthracene down to 50 ppm in the form of a fluorescence feature between ~394-590 nm, with local maxima ~420, 445, 475, 494 and 530 nm (Fig. 1).. Fluorescence with 365 nm excitation shows evidence for anthracene down to 100 ppm, with an envelope of fluorescence features at the same wavelengths as with 405 nm excitation (Fig. 2). Reflectance spectra using broad-band QTH illumination  show features due to anthracene fluorescence down to 0.5%,. Ultraviolet reflectance spectra with deuterium lamp illumination also show anthracene fluorescence features down to at least 0.1% concentration with a particularly strong feature near ~419 nm (Fig. 3). Raman spectra with 532 nm excitation show strong fluorescence features due to naphtho[2,3-a]pyrene, but features due to anthracene are not resolvable except at the highest concentration (5 wt.%), where a weak peak at ~1450 cm-1 appears. Using a shorter excitation wavelength and/or electronic gating of the spectrometer may reduce or eliminate the fluorescence problems. Our results indicate that the qualitative spectroscopic detection of some PAH molecules using commonly-available laser and broadband illumination sources, is feasible at geologically relevant concentrations. Quantification of PAH concentration in solid geological media using these spectroscopic techniques is subject to numerous uncertainties, and the nature of the apparent non-linearity of PAH fluorescence intensity with concentration must be better understood in order to make these methods quantitative. Nevertheless, these results show that detection of PAH compounds using spectroscopy is possible in Mars-like rocks, down to relatively small concentrations of tens of ppm.   References: [1] M.

The fluorescence response with 405 nm excitation between 435-464 nm (grey box) appears to be linear with concentration at low concentrations (below ~1000 ppm), which is promising.

Fig. 2: Fluorescence spectra of anthracene-JSC-Mars-1 mixtures with 365 nm spot lamp excitation. An envelope of fluorescence features due to anthracene between 394-590 nm, with local maxima at ~420, 445, 475, 494 and 530 nm are detectable. The features at 420 and 445 nm in particular are detectable down to at least 100 ppm. The fluorescence intensity does not appear to vary linearly with concentration, for reasons that are at present unclear.   Fig. 3: Ultraviolet reflectance spectra anthracene-JSC-Mars1 mixtures with deuterium lam excitation, showing a strong fluorescence peak at 419 nm which is detectable down to at least 0.1 wt% (1000 ppm) and possibly lower concentrations.    Fig. 4: Raman spectra, with 532 nm excitation, showing strong fluorescence features for naphtho[2,3-a]pyrene (A). By contrast (B), anthracene mixtures show a weak feature at 1450 cm-1 in the 5% mixture, and enhanced overall intensity due to broadband fluorescence. Using different (likely shorter wavelength) excitation may circumvent the difficulties due to fluorescence.
