Introduction: Although Venus and Earth share a similar size, and a nearly equivalent mass and density, Venus' tectonics is very different from Earth [e.g., 1, 2]. The thermal history of Venus remains an enigma, and there are many unanswered questions on the structure and evolution of its lithosphere. A major question is how this planet loses its internal heat, and whether or not this process is episodic or uniform in time [3]. Calculation of paleo-heat flows from lithospheric strength (using as strength indicator the effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere, Te) can potentially be used in order to constrain the thermal evolution of a planetary body [e.g., 4], because the obtained values refer to the time of deformation (i.e., the time of loading). Here we characterize the lithospheric structure of equatorial highlands on Venus from the analysis of the coherence between topography and Bouguer gravity anomaly. Method & Data: To estimate the effective elastic thickness we calculate the coherence function relating the topography and Bouguer anomaly, commonly known as Bouguer coherence, using the wavelet method [5, 6]. This function gives information on the wavelength band over which topography and Bouguer anomaly are correlated. The wavelet method convolves a range of scaled wavelets with the whole data set to map and invert the coherence at each grid point, and achieves good wavenumber resolution over long length scales and good spatial resolution over short length scales. Here we employ a Morlet wavelet of high spatial resolution in the fan wavelet transform [6]. The Bouguer gravity anomaly and topography are mirrored about their edges prior to Fourier transformation. The wavelet transform is then applied to both data sets to calculate the auto and cross-spectra at different azimuths and scales. We use the spherical harmonic models VenusTopo719 (topography; [3]) and MGNP180U (gravity; [7]) in our analysis.  In the coherence deconvolution method of Forsyth [8], Te is estimated by comparing the observed coherence curve with coherence functions predicted for a range of Te values. For each given Te, we calculate via deconvolution the initial surface and subsurface loads and compensating deflections that generate a predicted topography and gravity that best fit the observed topography and gravity anomaly, and a predicted coherence that best fits the observed coherence [8]. We follow [5] and invert the square of the real part of the wavelet coherency (SRC), rather than the coherence, because it is less sensitive to correlations between the initial loads on the plate and to the presence of topographically unexpressed internal loading, both of which can cause incorrect recovery of Te [5, 9, 10, 11]. The deconvolution requires detailed information on the internal structure of the lithosphere. To define the lateral variation of the Moho interface, we use the Venusian crustal thickness model from Wieczorek [3], which is based upon the premise of an average crustal thickness of 35 km. The Te value that minimizes the differences between the predicted and observed quantities is the optimal one for the analysed area. We project all data sets to a Cartesian coordinate system using the Mercator projection to mitigate errors arising from the planar treatment of curvilinear coordinates. The data cover a much larger area than the study area to mitigate boundary effects.  We can also estimate the ratio between the initial internal and surface load amplitudes (the loading ratio, f; [8]). We can display the loading ratio results in terms of the F parameter, the internal load fraction [10], where purely surface loading gives F = 0, purely internal loading gives F = 1, while equal surface and internal loading gives F = 0.5.  Results: Preliminary results of lithospheric parameters are shown in Figure 1. The pattern of Te variations shows a high variability, suggesting that Venus remains an active planet with complex geologic processes [12]. Results show equatorial highlands lithosphere characterize by a uniform signature with moderate Te values (30-70 km), where subsurface loading exceeds surface loading, and with smooth transition to the surrounding plains. Meanwhile Artemis region is characterized by high Te values (> 80 km; see Figure 1a), dominated by surface loads (Figure 1b). The minimum values dominate in regions with large volcanic rift systems, such as defined by Atla Regio, associated with a surface loading domain (Figure 1b). However, in other regions there is not a clear correlation between the spatial variation of Te and surface geology, suggesting that there may be deep geodynamic processes with little surface manifestation [12]. 1202.pdf

Figure 1. Preliminary results of lithospheric structure in Aphrodite Terra and surrounding regions from the analysis of the Bouguer coherence: (a) effective elastic thickness, and (b) subsurface to surface load ratio. Black line is the zero topography contour, derived from the spherical harmonic model VenusTopo719 [3]. Future Work: The effective elastic thickness is a measure of the total strength of the lithosphere, integrating contributions from brittle and ductile layers and from elastic cores of the lithosphere [for a review see 13]. Te estimates can be converted to heat flows following the equivalent strength envelope procedure described by [14]. This methodology is based on the condition that the bending moment of the mechanical lithosphere must be equal to the bending moment of the equivalent elastic layer of thickness Te. We present a preliminary high-resolution map of spatial variations of Te in equatorial highlands, which can be used in order to constrain regional and global thermal evolution of Venus.
