Introduction:  The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) Wide Angle Camera (WAC) typically acquires observations in nadir pointing mode resulting in emission angles (instrument  boresight  intersection with the surface relative to the surface normal) of 30° at the edge of the 7-color field-of-view [1]. The WAC acquired a special series of forward pitch oblique (30°) observations that extend the range of available photometric angles near  the lunar north pole (>50°N, Fig. 1).  Additionally during  frequent  slew (roll)  observations in the cross-track direction, the maximum emission angle increases from 30° to >60°. Both types of observations extend the range of emission and phase angles allowing more confident solutions to the Hapke photometric function [2]. Due to the systematic increase in incidence angles toward  the  pole  and  the  WAC's  narrow  down-track field-of-view for each wavelength filter [1], the phase range decreases toward  the pole resulting  in  significant  uncertainties  in  photometric  normalization  and Hapke parameter  calculations  [3].  Lower  phase  images from the pole-facing pitch observations minimize such uncertainties. The increased emission angles are especially useful for determination of the parameter φ (filling factor) [4], because reflectance is more sensitive to porosity effects at high incidence and emission angles. In this study, we estimate fitting residuals at north ern high latitudes (>50°N) using the new WAC pitch observations to examine how the current Hapke photometric  parameter  maps  [3,2]  (by  the  "tile-by-tile" method based on nadir  observations) are accurate for uncovered low phase  ranges  at  high  latitudes.  From the slew observations we calculate the parameter  φ to see the variation and the regional trends. Methodology:  About 280 images from pitch observations  and  1370  images  from  slew  observation (with slew angle >20°) were radiometrically calibrated to radiance factor (I/F) and incidence (i), emission (e), phase (g),  latitude, and longitude of each pixel were computed  based on the WAC stereo DTM (GLD100) [5]  using  USGS ISIS software  [6].  A northern  high latitude mosaic was produced by choosing the observation data point (composed of I/F, i, e, g) at the lowest phase  angle  among  the  multiple  repeat  observations for each  pixel,  from pitch  and  no-pitch  observations independently for the comparison. The model fitting residuals (RS) were derived by where "model" is the Hapke model using the parameter maps [3]. RS was computed for each 1° by 1° tile. Lower  RS means smaller  residuals and higher  fitting accuracy. The shadow pixels were ignored in  RS calculation by removing I/F < 0.001 and i > 90°. Figure 1. Minimum phase angle from (a) nadir observations and (b) pitch observations from 48°N to 90°N (643 nm). RS=∣median( I / Fmodel )−1∣  For the calculation of φ, we set the parameter BS0 = BC0 = 0 to ignore opposition effects and used observations at  g > 30°.  The  θ was set  to a  constant  value (=23.4) [3]. Then the remaining four free parameters (w,  b,  c, and  φ) were determined by the same model fitting  algorithm  and  the  data  reduction  scheme applied in [3]. Results and Discussions:  The pitch observations cover  most  areas  for  latitudes  above 50°N  (Fig.1b). The minimum phase angles in  the covered areas decreased by an average of ~20° (Fig.2) relative to ~32 months of nadir observations (Fig.1a). For the model fitting residuals (RS), the pitch observation are relatively higher than the nadir observation except latitude 74° - 80°N. The parameter maps [3] that were used are based on only the nadir observations that do not cover the low phase angles acquired by pitch observations, resulting in lower fitting accuracies in pitch observation data.  The step-by-step parameter calculation [3] minimizes the influence of decreasing phase angle ranges toward the pole, but it is still hard to reproduce same residual levels in uncovered low phase range as the covered high phase data. New parameter maps based on the pitch observations will  improve the low phase fitting  residuals  and  the parameter accuracies at high latitudes. The roll slew observations are sparsely distributed across the whole Moon (Fig.3) with a median slew angle of 26.5°.  The dominant  emission angle  range  is higher  and wider in the slew observations relative to the nadir observations (Fig.4). The calculated parameter φ, based on the roll slew observations in addition to the nadir observations by the tile-by-tile method for a  test  area  (33°S-20°N,  182-202°E)  mostly  ranges from 0.1 to 0.3 (the physically possible range is from 0 to  0.524  [4]).  No obvious spatial  variation  was  observed. Also in many tiles the φ becomes zero, possibly due to  mathematical  coupling [7]. An optimized calculation  scheme  for  φ  needs  to  be  developed  to overcome this effect. Future Work:  Based on the pitch observations we will recalculate the parameter maps, and examine the surface properties at  northern  high  latitudes (>40°N) using the new maps. Also we estimate the influence of this new parameter map on the normalized I/F at high latitudes. Additional series of pitch observations near the south pole will improve the parameter map accuracies as well as the north  pole and allow accurate reflectance comparisons of the north  vs south poles or the poles vs the equator. The parameter  φ calculation needs methodological improvements.  Comparing  the  calculated  values  for WAC data and for the laboratory measured reflectance is also necessary for the ground truth.
