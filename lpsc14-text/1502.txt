Introduction: A prominent geochemical feature of the shergottites is the large range in initial Sr isotopic ratios (0.702 - 0.724) and initial  Nd values ( -10 to +50). Within this range, the shergottites do not form a radiogenic isotopic continuum, but instead fall into three discreet subgroups. These subgroups have distinct characteristics such as the bulk rock REE patterns, mineral chemistries (i.e. phosphate REE patterns, Ni, Co, V in olivine), oxygen fugacity of crystallization, and stable isotopes such as O. These characteristics have been linked to different reservoirs in the martian crust and mantle, and their interactions during the petrogenesis of shergottite magmatism [e.g. 1-4]. Two end-member petrogenetic models have been suggested to account for the location and interaction of these reservoirs and the variation in shergottite compositions. In one model, the shergottites are a product of melting of two distinctly different mantle sources: a reduced (IW1 to IW+1), depleted mantle, and an oxidized ( IW+3.5), enriched mantle. Alternatively, shergottites that are reduced and depleted reflect the martian mantle, whereas the more oxidized and enriched shergottites reflect the interactions between mantle-derived basalts and the martian crust. To distinguish between these two models for shergottite magmatism, the relationship between shergottite magmatism and other types of martian magmatism, and the nature of the crust and mantle of Mars, we examined the Cl isotopic compositions of a variety of martian rocks including shergottites, nahklites, chassignites, orthopyroxeneite (ALH84001), and a regolith breccia (NWA 7034). Companion abstracts by Sharp et al. [5] and Burger et al. [6] examine the Cl isotope systematics of Mars relative to other planetary bodies,  and on the martian surface, respectively.  Analytical approach: The  37 Cl  values of leachate and residue are measured from bulk samples using conventional magnetic sector mass spectrometry at the University of New Mexico [7]. Samples analyzed for bulk rock include martian meteorites Los Angeles, Zagami, NWA2975, NWA5790, Tissint, and NWA 7034. In situ ion microprobe analyses were made on the large radius UCLA Cameca 1270 ion microprobe using a Cs + primary beam. Ion beams for mass 35 and 37 are measured simultaneously on Faraday cups with equivalent count rates of 2 to 5×107cps for 35Cl-. A synthetic Cl-apatite from the University of Heidelberg, with a Cl concentration of 5.5 wt.% was used as a standard and had a reproducibility of 0.1‰ (n=38). Precision is lower for low Cl concentration apatites. Precision of individual spot analyses ranged from 0.1‰ to 1.2‰. All  37 Cl values are relative to SMOC.  In situ analyses of apatite were conducted on martian meteorites ALH84001, NWA7034, LAR06319, Chassigny, Dhofar019, Los Angeles, RBT04261, RBT04262, and Shergotty. Only one depleted olivinephyric shergottite was analyzed due to the typical near absence of apatite and the relatively high mass required for bulk analyses in these types of shergottites.  Results: Results from both bulk rock and apatite analyses are illustrated in Figure 1. Bulk rock analyses range from -1.0‰ to +2.0‰. Individual in situ apatite values range from -3.8‰ to +9.0‰. In the few samples in which bulk rock and apatite measurements were made, they are essentially equal. For example, rock analyses for Los Angeles and NWA7034 are -0.3‰ and 1.0‰ respectively, whereas individual apatite analyses range from -0.4‰ to -0.6‰ for Los Angeles and +0.1‰ to +9.0‰ (with an average of +1.2‰) for NWA7034. There are several systematic variations among the different martian lithologies: (1) olivine-phyric shergottites appear to be enriched in light Cl with  37 Cl between -1.0‰ and -3.8‰, (2) rocks with a higher crustal affinity (nahklites, chassignites, orthopyroxenites, and regolith breccias) generally appear to be more enriched in heavy Cl,  with  37 Cl between +0.1‰ to +9.0‰, (3) basaltic shergottites (Los Angeles, Shergotty, Zagami, NWA 2975) are variable ( 37 Cl = 0.1‰ to  -3.5‰) and generally lie between these "mantle" and "crustal" signatures. Discussion: The  37 Cl are clearly different among the different martian lithologies (Figure 1) and may reflect differences between the generally Cl-poor mantle (<20ppm) and the Cl-rich crust (>600ppm). Differences in Cl concentrations and the isotopic composition of the Cl make this a useful tracer in elucidating the nature of the martian mantle and its interactions with the crust. As an example, Figure 2 illustrates an assimilation fractional crystallization (AFC) model for interactions between mantle derived basalts and martian crust, following the AFC modeling approach of DePaolo [8] and the mixing models of Sharp et al. [9]. The results of these models suggest that changes in   37 Cl can be made to the parent magma with only small  amounts of crustal assimilation (2%) and with limited impact on the REE abundances (Figure 2, insert).       These data and models imply that the martian mantle has a different Cl isotopic signature than the Earth, Moon, and primitive asteroids. Sharp et al. [5] discusses the origin of this difference in a companion abstract. The data further indicate that the enriched and depleted signatures identified in the shergottites reflect different mantle sources and not AFC processes. Only minor AFC mixing of a crustal component is needed to modify the  37 Cl observed in the basaltic shergottites and this minor amount of AFC will not dramatically affect the REE pattern or radiogenic isotope systematics. Similarly, it seems unlikely that a small amount of assimilation of a crustal component would dramatically change the fO2 of martian magmas. Further, these observations indicate that differences in  37 Cl among the shergottites that experienced more extensive fractional crystallization (e.g. basaltic shergottites and more fractionated olivine-phyric shergottites such as Tissint, Dhofar) is a result of small and variable amounts of AFC of Cl-rich martian crust.

Suggested fields for the martian mantle, martian crust, and interactions between mantle produced basalts and crust are shown.     Figure 2. AFC modeling of Y98 basalt composition contaminated with martian crust. Elements modeled are Cl, Ce, and Yb. Olivine is considered to be the only phase that crystallized from the Y98 parental melt over a limited mass of magma remaining (F), from 1.0 to 0.90. The bulk solid/liquid partition coefficient (D) used in calculations is simply the olivine/liquid values for Cl, Ce, and Yb, all assumed to be less than 0.1. The relative concentrations in assimulant and initial magma (Ca/C 0m) are based on the analyses of Y98, NWA7034, and Gamma Ray Spectrometer results on board the Mars Odyssey Mission [10].
