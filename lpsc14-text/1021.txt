TagishLake has been described as perhaps the most primitivemeteorite  ever discovered [1].  Frozen samples foundeight days  after the fall have retained volatile organiccompounds (e.g. naphthalene); degraded samples wererecovered  several  months  later  in  the  spring  [1].  Alarge lithological variation in samples has led to TagishLake being described as a breccia composed of breccia[2], with clear evidence of a continuum of aqueous alteration [2,3]. The pristine fragments  of Tagish Lakeare chemically and physically unstable, and the majority of them are curated at the University of Alberta, intemperatures  at  or  below -10°C.  Given  the  limitedamount of this unique material—approximately  820 gremain following initial sampling and thawing of material, and organic studies [3]—it is critical to  use nondestructive methods to characterize these pristine samples as much as possible.Research objectives:  In  this  study,  bulk density,grain density, and porosity were determined for a suiteof frozen pristine Tagish Lake samples. Bulk and grainvolumes were measured within the curation facility via3D laser imaging and helium pycnometry, respectively.For most samples, a bulk volume and a grain volumewere determined, allowing porosity to be derived. Theliterature  values  of  approximately  1.6-1.7 g/cm³  forbulk density and 35-45% for porosity  (from six published sources reported in [4]) are very unusual for meteorites. The main objective of this study is to expandthe database of these measurements to include pristineTagish Lake  samples,  enabling  an  evaluation  of  anyfrozen volatiles.Methods: Bulk density is defined as the ratio of themass  to the total  volume including the  internal  porespaces. The  accurate determination of mass is trivial,but  measuring volume presents a challenge. A modified Archimedean method, where the fluid has been replaced  by  40 µm glass  beads,  has been  successfullyused  for  a  variety  of  meteorites  [5];  however,  thefrozen Tagish  Lake  samples  are too  fragile for  thismethod. Instead,  3D  non-contact  laser  imaging  wasused to  determine  the bulk  volume [6,7]. The KonicaMinolta  Vivid  9i  is  a  visible  light  laser  camera  thatgenerates a 3D point cloud representing the topologyof the imaged surface in great detail.  A library of  images capturing the entire surface of a sample was created. Relevant images were edited and assembled intoa watertight 3D model, whose bulk volume was calculated by software.The Ultrapyc 1200e helium pycnometer was usedto determine the grain volume. The pycnometer appliesthe ideal gas law to measure grain volume, which excludes the internal pore spaces.   The Ultrapyc 1200eperforms 15 runs  per sample.  The results  of  the lastfive runs are averaged to give the grain volume, whichis then used to calculate the grain density and porosity.Porosity is the ratio of the bulk and grain volumes.Data  acquisition  was done  at  a  temperature  of-10°C. This was not an issue for the helium pycnometer. The laser camera, because of its commercial gradeelectronics, could not cool below +10°C or the dewpoint.  To allow for  approximately  two-hour  imagingsessions in the cold room, a method of insulating thecamera was devised,  involving several layers of thermal blankets [4].Results:  The results for  mass,  bulk density, graindensity, and porosity are listed in Table 1. In total, 13samples were imaged with the laser camera. The samefragments were analyzed with the pycnometer exceptP-1 and P-10a, which were too big to fit into the instrument. The mass of each sample was measured to a precision  of  ± 0.002 g.  The  formal uncertainty  on  themass,  pycnometer,  and  camera  measurements  waspropagated by quadrature (partial differentiation) to thefinal results for bulk density, grain density, and porosity.  An estimate of the uncertainty for a single volumemeasurement  made  with  the  laser  camera  was attempted  for the first time [4], based on inter-operatorvariability [7,8] and the alignment error  among all ofthe points that constitute the model [8,9] from previousstudies.  The bulk volume results  from laser  imagingappear  to be more precise than  the results previouslyobtained  by  the  modified  Archimedean  method[1,2,4,7].  The uncertainty  on the grain volume  is  thestandard deviation of the results from the last five runs.Discussion: Most of the bulk density results clusternear 1.80 g/cm³. As seen in Figure 1, three samples (P3a, P-5a, P-9a) were closer to 1.90 g/cm³; of these, two(P-3a, P-5a) appear similar to the dark, dusty lithology[3], interpreted to be more brecciated and altered rela1021.pdf

tive  to  other  specimens.  The  porosity  results  of  thesuite clustered near 30%. The major outlier at 36%, P4, has an unusual fusion crust texture. Although its interior  is  not  visible,  the  porosity  and  unusual  crustsuggest a different lithological character. The results from this study differ significantly fromthe  literature  data  compiled  from  six  publishedsources [4]. The bulk density of pristine sample P-10awas reported as 1.66 ± 0.10 g/cm³ in [1], in contrast tothe result of 1.80 ± 0.03 g/cm³ here. The discrepancy isexplained by the use of 1 mm beads in [1], which mayoverestimate  bulk  volume,  leading  to  the underestimation of bulk density. Overall, per Figure 1, the literature bulk density is lower and the porosity is higher.The difference likely results from most of the literaturevalues  coming from measurements of either degradedor  thawed pristine  Tagish  Lake  samples.  For  thesesamples,  there has  been  a  loss  of  volatiles.  In  thefrozen pristine samples, some pore space may be occupied by a solid such as water ice, thus increasing bulkdensity and  decreasing porosity.  A numerical  checkcan be done by comparing the average "degraded" values  for bulk  density  (1.7 g/cm³) and porosity  (40%)from the literature [4] with the average "pristine" values  for bulk  density  (1.8 g/cm³) and  porosity  (30%)found in this study.  If 10% of the solids are removedfrom the pristine material  to increase the porosity to40%, then the bulk density changes from 1.8 g/cm³ to1.7 g/cm³  if the density of the solid was 1 g/cm³,  i.e.that of water ice.More investigations need to be done on the lithologies of Tagish Lake in order to explain variations in theexperimental data. A cautionary note: Tagish Lake isvery hygroscopic like many soils. If subjected to a humid environment, it will adsorb water, causing its massto increase. This effect further complicates data analysis, especially when comparing measurements made bydifferent studies in different environments. As the pristine  samples  have  not  been  subject  to  temperaturesabove -10°C, adsorbed water should not be a factor inthis study.Conclusion: Laser imaging and helium pycnometry  are  excellent methods by which to systematicallyand  non-destructively  characterize  fragile  material.This  study contributed  high-precision results  for  thebulk  density,  grain  density,  and  porosity  of  TagishLake.  Further  work—especially  on  the  differentlithologies—is  needed  to  get  further  insight  on  thephysical properties of this unique meteorite.References:  [1]  Hildebrand  A.R.  et  al.
