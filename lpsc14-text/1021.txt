Introduction: The Tagish Lake meteorite is an ungrouped carbonaceous  chondrite  that  fell  in  northern British Columbia, Canada, on 18 January 2000. Tagish Lake has been described as perhaps the most primitive meteorite  ever discovered [1].  Frozen samples found eight days  after the fall have retained volatile organic compounds (e.g. naphthalene); degraded samples were recovered  several  months  later  in  the  spring  [1].  A large lithological variation in samples has led to Tagish Lake being described as a breccia composed of breccia [2], with clear evidence of a continuum of aqueous alteration [2,3]. The pristine fragments  of Tagish Lake are chemically and physically unstable, and the majority of them are curated at the University of Alberta, in temperatures  at  or  below -10°C.  Given  the  limited amount of this unique material—approximately  820 g remain following initial sampling and thawing of material, and organic studies [3]—it is critical to  use nondestructive methods to characterize these pristine samples as much as possible. Research objectives:  In  this  study,  bulk density, grain density, and porosity were determined for a suite of frozen pristine Tagish Lake samples. Bulk and grain volumes were measured within the curation facility via 3D laser imaging and helium pycnometry, respectively. For most samples, a bulk volume and a grain volume were determined, allowing porosity to be derived. The literature  values  of  approximately  1.6-1.7 g/cm³  for bulk density and 35-45% for porosity  (from six published sources reported in [4]) are very unusual for meteorites. The main objective of this study is to expand the database of these measurements to include pristine Tagish Lake  samples,  enabling  an  evaluation  of  any frozen volatiles. Methods: Bulk density is defined as the ratio of the mass  to the total  volume including the  internal  pore spaces. The  accurate determination of mass is trivial, but  measuring volume presents a challenge. A modified Archimedean method, where the fluid has been replaced  by  40 µm glass  beads,  has been  successfully used  for  a  variety  of  meteorites  [5];  however,  the frozen Tagish  Lake  samples  are too  fragile for  this method. Instead,  3D  non-contact  laser  imaging  was used to  determine  the bulk  volume [6,7]. The Konica Minolta  Vivid  9i  is  a  visible  light  laser  camera  that generates a 3D point cloud representing the topology of the imaged surface in great detail.  A library of  images capturing the entire surface of a sample was created. Relevant images were edited and assembled into a watertight 3D model, whose bulk volume was calculated by software. The Ultrapyc 1200e helium pycnometer was used to determine the grain volume. The pycnometer applies the ideal gas law to measure grain volume, which excludes the internal pore spaces.   The Ultrapyc 1200e performs 15 runs  per sample.  The results  of  the last five runs are averaged to give the grain volume, which is then used to calculate the grain density and porosity. Porosity is the ratio of the bulk and grain volumes. Data  acquisition  was done  at  a  temperature  of -10°C. This was not an issue for the helium pycnometer. The laser camera, because of its commercial grade electronics, could not cool below +10°C or the dewpoint.  To allow for  approximately  two-hour  imaging sessions in the cold room, a method of insulating the camera was devised,  involving several layers of thermal blankets [4]. Results:  The results for  mass,  bulk density, grain density, and porosity are listed in Table 1. In total, 13 samples were imaged with the laser camera. The same fragments were analyzed with the pycnometer except P-1 and P-10a, which were too big to fit into the instrument. The mass of each sample was measured to a precision  of  ± 0.002 g.  The  formal uncertainty  on  the mass,  pycnometer,  and  camera  measurements  was propagated by quadrature (partial differentiation) to the final results for bulk density, grain density, and porosity.  An estimate of the uncertainty for a single volume measurement  made  with  the  laser  camera  was attempted  for the first time [4], based on inter-operator variability [7,8] and the alignment error  among all of the points that constitute the model [8,9] from previous studies.  The bulk volume results  from laser  imaging appear  to be more precise than  the results previously obtained  by  the  modified  Archimedean  method [1,2,4,7].  The uncertainty  on the grain volume  is  the standard deviation of the results from the last five runs. Discussion: Most of the bulk density results cluster near 1.80 g/cm³. As seen in Figure 1, three samples (P3a, P-5a, P-9a) were closer to 1.90 g/cm³; of these, two (P-3a, P-5a) appear similar to the dark, dusty lithology [3], interpreted to be more brecciated and altered rela tive  to  other  specimens.  The  porosity  results  of  the suite clustered near 30%. The major outlier at 36%, P4, has an unusual fusion crust texture. Although its interior  is  not  visible,  the  porosity  and  unusual  crust suggest a different lithological character. The results from this study differ significantly from the  literature  data  compiled  from  six  published sources [4]. The bulk density of pristine sample P-10a was reported as 1.66 ± 0.10 g/cm³ in [1], in contrast to the result of 1.80 ± 0.03 g/cm³ here. The discrepancy is explained by the use of 1 mm beads in [1], which may overestimate  bulk  volume,  leading  to  the underestimation of bulk density. Overall, per Figure 1, the literature bulk density is lower and the porosity is higher. The difference likely results from most of the literature values  coming from measurements of either degraded or  thawed pristine  Tagish  Lake  samples.  For  these samples,  there has  been  a  loss  of  volatiles.  In  the frozen pristine samples, some pore space may be occupied by a solid such as water ice, thus increasing bulk density and  decreasing porosity.  A numerical  check can be done by comparing the average "degraded" values  for bulk  density  (1.7 g/cm³) and porosity  (40%) from the literature [4] with the average "pristine" values  for bulk  density  (1.8 g/cm³) and  porosity  (30%) found in this study.  If 10% of the solids are removed from the pristine material  to increase the porosity to 40%, then the bulk density changes from 1.8 g/cm³ to 1.7 g/cm³  if the density of the solid was 1 g/cm³,  i.e. that of water ice. More investigations need to be done on the lithologies of Tagish Lake in order to explain variations in the experimental data. A cautionary note: Tagish Lake is very hygroscopic like many soils. If subjected to a humid environment, it will adsorb water, causing its mass to increase. This effect further complicates data analysis, especially when comparing measurements made by different studies in different environments. As the pristine  samples  have  not  been  subject  to  temperatures above -10°C, adsorbed water should not be a factor in this study. Conclusion: Laser imaging and helium pycnometry  are  excellent methods by which to systematically and  non-destructively  characterize  fragile  material. This  study contributed  high-precision results  for  the bulk  density,  grain  density,  and  porosity  of  Tagish Lake.  Further  work—especially  on  the  different lithologies—is  needed  to  get  further  insight  on  the physical properties of this unique meteorite. References:  [1]  Hildebrand  A.R.  et  al.
