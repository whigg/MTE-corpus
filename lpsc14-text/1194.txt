Introduction:  Metal is a major component of primitive meteorites; yet its genesis is still controversial, with scenarios varying between direct condensation in the disk [1], recondensation following local evaporation [2], reduction of FeO-bearing silicates [2,3], and desulfurization of iron sulfides [4]. Metal is abundant and best preserved from secondary parent body processing in CR chondrites [5], where metal-rich margins are prevalent in type I (low-FeO) chondrules (e.g. Fig. 1). CR chondrites are thus a prime target to understand metal formation and potential links with chondrule formation. It has long been known [5] that metal composition depends on petrographical setting: metal grains in chondrule interiors (henceforth interior grains) are systematically richer in Ni than grains on the chondrule margins (hereafter margin grains) or grains isolated in the interchondrule matrix (hereafter isolated grains). [2] proposed that interior grains and part of margin grains formed by reduction from silicates while the other margin grains formed by recondensation, based on SIMS measurements suggesting refractory element depletion in the latter relative to the former. [6] suggested that margin metal has a larger contribution of late, lower-temperature (lower-Ni) condensates and originally formed a continuous film accumulated due to surface tension effects that beaded upon cooling.    Figure 1: Back-scattered electron image of a highly melted chondrule R21 in Renazzo, with round interior metal grains and amoeboid margin metal grains. In order to shed light on these issues, we [7] set to analyze siderophile element distribution in metal from 10 different CRs using Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICPMS), one of the first applications of this technique to CR chondrite metal along with a study of isolated grain zoning [8] and further analyses reported by [9-10]. Results and discussion:  Individual Ni-normalized patterns are variable, with in particular lack of coherence between refractory siderophile elements (PGE except Pd) and the “main component” Ni, Co, Pd, Fe. This suggests high-temperature fractionation of an early formed refractory metallic condensate, presumably in the disk. We note however that by the time chondrules formed, the ambient disk was likely cold (a few hundred degrees) so that differences between interior and margin metal is unlikely to result from nebular cooling as envisioned by [6].    Figure 2: Average Ni-normalized concentrations of siderophile elements arranged in order of increasing volatility for the three different petrographical settings of metal grains (error bars are standard errors of the mean).  Importantly, the average of nonvolatile siderophile elements concentrations normalized to Ni for the three petrographical settings of metal grains are indistinguishable (Fig. 2) and essentially in chondritic propor1194.pdf

tions to each other (see also [11]), at variance with [2] although probably only a matter of limited statistics of the latter. This is inconsistent with a significant proportion of recondensed metal among margin grains, although some recondensation on preexisting margin grains is evidenced by enrichment in volatile elements (e.g. Cu, Au) in the latter relative to interior grains.   Figure 3: Palladium vs. osmium content in metal grains.   Figure 4: Ni concentation vs. convolution index(“CVI”) of the metal grain (ratio between perimeter and that of the equal area disk: the rounder the grain, the closer to 1 the CVI).    Interior metal is enriched in noble metals like platinum-group element, independently of volatility (e.g. including Pd as noted by [9]; e.g. Fig. 3). The most Nienriched interior grains correspond to the rounder morphologies in the highly melted chondrules (Fig. 4), indicating that this difference arose during the chondrule-forming process. Fe in the metal grains was presumably oxidized (as even type I formation conditions are more oxidizing than solar, e.g. [12]), but no “Prior rule”-style correlation between Ni content of metal and fayalite content in olivine is apparent [6]. This suggests evaporative loss of FeO, as suggested by the low fayalite contents of the best melted chondrules (this work; [13]). Equilibration between metal and silicates was also found by [3]. How comes margin grains are less processed than interior grains? We note that this is to be understood not only chemically, but also texturally: margin grains are amoeboidal in shape, in a state of incomplete coalescence of precursor grains, similar to metal in slightly melted chondrules [13]. As chondrules would be essentially isothermal on > 1 s timescales, the only way around this paradox is to assume that margin metal precursors were added after the peak heating recorded by chondrule interiors. We note that this margin metal is mixed with enstatite which may also result from open-system behavior [14]. While it is conceivable that the heating events recorded by the core and margins of chondrules were independent [14], it is probably simplest, and in better agreement with compositional correlations between rim and interior [15], to assume that chondrule melting and growth by accretion occurred concurrently. Chondrule margins would then represent a veneer accreted during an accelerated cooling (see also [16]), perhaps as the chondrule left its native hightemperature region, and the frequent igneous rims surrounding chondrules the very latest veneer incompletely digested by the hot albeit cooling chondrule. The thickness accreted would however require solid densities >2 order of magnitudes above Minimum Mass Solar Nebula models [17]. This is in line with mounting evidence of supracanonical concentrations of condensable species in chondrule-forming regions [18-19]. References: [1] Campbell A. J. & Humayun M.
