Introduction: Trace elements, including the rare earth elements (REE), are commonly used to track source reservoirs and processes in terrestrial rocks when they are present in measurable quantities. Components of chondritic meteorites can be enriched 10x1000x above chondritic (CI) values permitting evaluation of processes and chemical conditions in the solar nebula [1,2]. Many components, and bulk chondrites, display flat REE patterns without enrichment or depletion in light or heavy REE (LREE or HREE). Six types of REE patterns are recognized in Ca- and Al-rich inclusions (CAI), amoeboid olivine aggregates (AOA), and chondrules [3]. Here we consider the complementary Group II (HREE depleted) and ultra-refractory (HREE enriched, Fig. 1) patterns [1-5].  Figure 1: Generalized, fractionated REE abundance patterns: Group II (purple) and ultra-refractory (green). LREE are to the left, HREE to the right. Modified from [4]. The ratios La/Lu and Pr/Eu may be used to distinguish between the LREE and HREE contributions of inclusions, due to the large variation of these elements between Group II and ultra-refractory patterns (red, dashed lines Fig. 1). Many studies of REE in chondrites and their components have focused on single minerals and the overall patterns of large objects and limited subtypes [e.g., 6-8]. Here we examine Ornans-type (CO) carbonaceous chondrites due to the high abundance and variety of objects they contain in any 2D cross-section [9-11]. Compelling arguments in support of the chemical complementarity of chondrules and matrix in carbonaceous chondrites have been put forward [e.g., 12-15]. However, the refractory components (CAIs, AOAs) are rarely considered important or capable of quantitatively addressing the hypothesis of component complementarity due to their low absolute abundance. By measurement of their REE fractionation patterns en masse, the role of these refractory inclusions in early solar system history can be better evaluated. Method: Objects in 4 thick sections of Colony (CO3.0) were analyzed with the joint Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory-AMNH VG PZ ExCell quadropole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer with a UP193FX laser ablation sample introduction system using a 25, 40, or 10µm diameter raster of varying length. Bulk analyses were obtained for a variety of objects including: chondrules, Al-rich portions of chondrule mesostasis, CAIs, AOAs and matrix. Backgrounds were measured for 60s and samples were measured for 60s or with a raster rate of 3µm/s for a suite of elements including the lanthanide REE. Applicable segments of output were selected for each point using LazyBoy3.1. Ca was used as the calibration element referenced to basaltic glasses (BIR, BHVO, and BCR). Results: Average ratios for over 60 analyses (23 chondrules, 7 matrix, 3 AOAs, 28 CAIs) for bulk REE are plotted in Fig. 2. The axes are LREE/HREE, with the most HREE-rich components plotting closer to the origin.  Figure 2: Comparison of average LREE/HREE for two sets of REE: La/Lu and Pr/Er for major components in chondrites. More HREE-rich components plot closer to the origin as they contain higher HREE. Bulk CO ratios from [16]. Averages of each component type surround the bulk CO ratios [values from 16]. Average chondrules exhibit the most refractory signature while average matrix closely reflects the flat bulk CO chondrite REE signature.   1379.pdf

Discussion: Many studies of CAIs report abundant Group II REE patterns, and some emphasize the need to systematically search for the ultra-refractory enriched CAI components [e.g., 1,7,17]. Here, CAIs exhibit a large range of REE signatures (Fig. 3) but none exhibit a true ultra-refractory pattern in bulk. Consequently, the average bulk CAI lies to the upper right of bulk CO in Fig. 2 because the CAIs analyzed contain a more HREE-depleted, Group II-like signature. Chondrule mesostases and olivines also exhibit a range of REE ratios (Fig. 3) but the mesostases have a larger HREE, or more refractory, contribution greatly influencing the chondrule average.  Figure 3: LREE versus HREE for two sets of REE; La/Lu and Pr/Er for major components in chondrites.  HREE enriched signatures plot closer to the origin. Ranges of each component surround the bulk CO ratios [16]. Complementarity in major element abundances has been observed between chondrules and matrix [12-15]. When simple mass balances are calculated using the REE ratios from this study and the abundances of chondrite components from [18, 9], it is evident that refractory inclusions are critical to understanding the complementary distribution of REE among chondrules, CAIs, and matrix within CO chondrites (Table 1). Due to CAI’s highly refractory mineral assemblages, many studies associate CAIs with the potential to contain an HREE-rich component, which is generally not observed [e.g., 8,19]. The results of this study (Figs. 2 and 3) imply that other objects, especially chondrules, have incorporated this ultra-refractory signature, supporting [1,13,20,21]. Chondrules must inherit this ultra-refractory signature from a precursor. Whether this precursor was CAI-like and whether it  affected the resulting chondrule type is a subject for future study.    Table 1: Area percentage of components in Colony [18] and their average La/Lu and Pr/Er [this study]. Results of mass balance calculation and bulk CO [16].  % component La/Lu Pr/Er CAI 2.2 38 2.7 Chondrule 55 5.8 0.48 Matrix 37 12 0.65 AOA 4.4 11 0.91 Mass balance  9.0 0.61 Bulk CO  9.7 0.60     Conclusions: REE are complementary between all components in Colony (CO3.0) with CAIs playing a key role. Chondrules preserve an ultra-refractory signature that remains in a very few CAIs, indicating incorporation of an ultra-refractory precursor into chondrules. Flat bulk CO REE patterns require complementary mixing of chondrules and CAIs formed locally and accreted rapidly from a precursor mixture of solar composition, setting the stage for the emergence of worlds.
