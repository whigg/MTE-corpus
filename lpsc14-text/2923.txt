Introduction:  IDPs collected by NASA airplanes in the upper atmosphere [1] and Antarctic Micrometeorites (AMMs) [2-4] extracted from ice  and snow by melting and filtering, likely sample a similar mixture of reservoirs, including asteroids and comets [5]. The sample types differ mainly in collection method and size of the particles; IDPs are typically <50 µm after impacting the collector (cluster IDPs are as large as 500 µm before impact), AMMs are typically 20-500 µm. Micrometeorites are often recovered partially melted or as fully melted spherules, therefore often having no detectable, or a contaminated noble gas content, however ~35% of those recovered from Dome-C in Antarctica have no evidence of heating [5] and are therefor promising for noble gas analyses.  AMMs have been analysed for their noble gas content e.g. by [6-10], revealing that samples either have a component resembling primordial Q-Xe, fractionated air from atmospheric entry, or addition of solar components [6]. The small size of IDPs and AMMs is still a problem for measuring the heavy noble gases, with large analytical errors reported. RELAX (Refrigerator Enhanced Laser Analyser for Xenon) at the University of Manchester [11] has the potential to detect Xe down to 500 atoms. Previous experiments failed to detect significant Xe in typical chondritic porous IDPs [12, 13], however large concentrations of trapped Xe were reported in four combined metal-rich non-chonditic IDPs, although the Xe isotopic composition could not be distinguished [14]. Here we present initial results from analyses of small (20-145 µm) AMMs, with the hope of learning more of the origin and distribution of their noble gases and parent bodies, as well as finetuning the experiments for even smaller (5-25 µm) IDP samples; the results of which are due to be presented at the conference.  Sample Set:  20 AMMs (Table 1) were initially characterised for texture and composition in Orsay. They include 10 from the Cap-Prudhomme collection [15] and 10 from Dome-C of the Concordia collection  [16]. There are a mixture of textures; Crystal (Xtal), Fine-grained Scoriaceous (FgSc) and Fine-grained Compact (FgC), as defined by [17] (Table 1). Some samples are fragments of AMMs also distributed to [9], and therefore a more complete noble gas catalogue can be eventually compiled for these samples. 26 IDPs from several collectors have been analysed for H, C and N isotopes and C-Raman characteristics [18].  Experimental: Samples were prepared in a clean room and placed in individual holes in a molybdenum mount, then loaded into the sample holder of the RELAX mass spectrometer [11] (IDPs will remain pressed into the gold foils used for NanoSIMS analysis). AMM samples were heated in 1 minute intervals with a Nd:YAG until all gas had been extracted.  Data were calibrated against air measured before and after each sample, and a  regular blank measurement was substracted. Typical blanks amount to ~1700? atoms 132Xe and contribute 1-10 % of the 132Xe in the most gas-rich steps for each AMM but much more in gaspoor extractions. To roughly estimate the mass, each AMM was approximated to a spheroid with a diameter averaged from the longest axis through each AMM and the centered axis perpendicular to it. The density was assumed to be 2.5 g/cm3. Typical mass errors are 30-50 %.

All AMMs in this study and their characterisations. Results and Discussion: So far, the data for 10 AMMs (Table 1, highlighted)  have been fully reduced, blank and IMF corrected. All 10 had Xe detectable above the blank. As the data is still preliminary however, and the sample masses roughly estimated, errors are large for some samples. 132Xe abundances mostly lie within the range reported by [7-9, 18]. The most gas-rich samples in previous studies are unmelted  samples, which is also what we find. This is consistent with the presence of a primordial trapped component. This is supported by elevated 129Xe/132Xe ratios (above air) in two AMMs (Table 1). AMM PL07-2B-9 from this study is the most Xe-rich reported so far, with an abundance of 1.33 ± 0.7 10-7 cc/g, which reaches concentrations found in organic meteoritic residues. However, the sample is rather small. Three other samples are amongst the highest literature values [7-9, 18] (Fig. 1). The rest have a typical abundance seen in AMMs and similar to chondrites. There are large varations in Xe concentrations between samples in different  collections, also agreeing with previous studies. Isotopic ratios of PL07-2C-3 show a mix of primordial Xe and terrestrial air, see, e.g. 129Xe/132Xe in Fig. 2. Fractionated air observed in [8] is also consistent with our data, albeit larger errors here. There are consistent very minor enrichments in 134Xe and 136Xe for several AMMs, which was also observed by [10], who suggested a combination of SW implantation and partial degassing as the source of the fractionation. Here we cannot rule out a small contribution of fission Xe. A 129Xe/132Xe  excess of 1.41 ± 0.13 (Fig. 2) is observed in AMM PL09-20-3. Only two AMMs from [6] (1.67 ± 0.39) and [7] (1.220 ±0.007) have similar ratios. The large range of observed 132Xe abundances is indicative of multiple populations. However, there are also differences observed between the same samples analysed in this study and [9] (Fig. 1 arrows). There is not as much abundance variation across the CP-AMMs in this study, similar to little variation amongst Transantarctic Mountain AMMs in [8]. However, DC IDPs show much variation, probably due to their variation in degrees of heating and composition, including FgC, thereby reflecting the fine-grained heterogenous nature and small sample size of the AMMs.   Fig. 1.
