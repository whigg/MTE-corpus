Introduction: The Chicxulub crater, located in the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico, is one of the largest impact structures on Earth [1]. Because the Chicxulub impact is considered to have caused a mass extinction at the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary [2], knowledge on the cratering process of the Chicxulub impact will be important for understanding not only a large-scale impact process but also the environmental perturbations at the K-Pg boundary.     Despite such an importance, detailed cratering process of the Chicxulub has been poorly constrained by geological data because it is  overlain by 2-3 km thick sedimentary rocks [3]. Even the Yaxcopoil-1 (YAX-1) core, located 60 km south to the crater center, which provides the only continuous data inside the crater, has not been fully understood, such as its relative position to the transient crater and its depositional process.      Here we report vertical profile of the shocked quartz grains to constraint the depositional processes of impactite of the YAX-1 core. We analyzed both the grain size distribution and planar deformation features (PDFs) on shocked quartz contained in the impactite of the YAX-1 core. Because the crystallographic orientation of PDFs preserves information of shock pressure achieved by impacts, we examined characteristics and vertical profiles of PDFs along with the YAX-1 core to discuss the excavation, transport, and depositional processes of each impactite unit of the YAX-1 core.     Previous Interpretations: The YAX-1 core is subdivided into 6 units based on lithological observations [4]. Previous studies have suggested their depositional process [e.g., 5-8], however, the results are inconsistent with each other. First of all, the existence of ejecta curtain deposits is not clear because depositional process of units 5 and 6 are differently interpreted. One interpretation is that, based on geochemical, petrographical analyses, units 5 and 6 are considered as melt-sheet and ejecta curtain deposit, respectively [5,6]. However, Kring et al. suggests that, based on geochemical analysis and the similarity of primary minerals, unit 6 is a part of unit 5 which is interpreted as outflowed melt-sheet [7].      Also, it is still controversial whether water invasion into the crater occurred associated with the impact. Based on the observation of rock strata and geochemical analyses, the upper parts of the impactites of the YAX-1 core are interpreted as impact-induced resurge deposits [5,8], whereas others interpret the same units as ejecta deposits that fell in the atmosphere [6,7].     Samples and Methods: We analyzed shocked quartz grains from 24 vertical levels throughout the impactite sequences in the YAX-1 core (from Units 6 to 1 in ascending stratigraphic order).      Quartz grains were extracted from the YAX-1 drillcore samples by treating with hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hydrofluosilicic (H2SiF6) [9]. After the acid treatment, resident quartz grains were mounted on glass plates with petropoxy basin. Orientation of PDFs were measured and indexed using a four-axis universal stage (U-stage) microscope (Fig.1) [10]. The obtained data was indexed following the method summarized in Langenhorst and Nakano et al. [9,11]. For the reproducibility and accuracy of Ustage measurement as mentioned in Ferriere et al. [11], we measured PDF orientations over 50 sets per sample. Only for the uppermost sample (46 sets), the criteria were not achieved because of the scarcity of shocked quartz grains. Grain size of quartz were measured with the use of photomicrographs.      Results and Discussions:  We found 617 shocked quartz  grains from all samples and measured 1329 sets of PDFs .      We found that, in the middle part of impact melt layer (Unit 5), the orientation of PDFs in shocked quartz grains were dominated by {1013; ω} and {1012; π } while others only account for under 3% 50μm�{1013}�Figure 1.

(Fig.2). Quartz grains with the predominance of ω and�π orientation suggest experience of high shock pressures (> 25 GPa) by laboratory experiments [12], whereas shocked quartz grains found in other impactite sequences are mixtures of shocked quartz with various PDFs orientations) which suggest experience of various shock pressures [12]. These results suggest that unit 5 is likely to have been formed by an outward flow of impact melt-sheet from the transient crater cavity during the collapse of the central uplift and transient crater [5,6]. Shocked quartz in unit 5 would have been originally located at the bottom of the transient crater and, then, transported by the outward flow of melt-sheet. Because impact ejecta are expected to contain mixtures of quartz with various shock pressures,they cannot explain the obtained PDFs orientation pattern.     Given this interpretation of melt-sheet origin of unit 5 together with the order of deposition of impact ejecta and melts suggested by numerical simulations [13], unit 6 is considered as ejecta curtain deposits. The fact that PDF orientations in shocked quartz grains from unit 6 show various orientations which suggests that they were the mixture of shocked quartz grains  undergone various shock pressure, is consistent with this idea. The presence of ejecta curtain deposits in the YAX-1 core means that the core was located outside the transient crater, which support the results of hydrodynamic simulations [13]. Additional detailed comparison of the thickness and profile of YAX-1 core with hydrodynamic simulation might provide further constraint on the transient crater size.      In unit 1, i.e., the uppermost impactite unit, PDF orientations in shocked quartz show features to undergone various shock pressures, which is consistent with both the ideas of fallback ejecta and redeposited material. However, both the grain size and shocked quartz abundance profiles show cyclic variations in unit 1 (note that the upper part provides higher resolution data than those from lower part, Fig.3). Grain size of fallback ejecta should be sorted during their deposition through the atmosphere. Hence it is difficult for such cyclic variations to be explained by fallback ejecta. These results support the idea that unit 1 is repeated impact-induced resurge deposits [5,8], which suggest water invasions into the crater.      References: [1] Gulick et al.
