Introduction:  Photometric models have enabled the description of the physical properties of planetary surfaces, including their roughness and surface porosity. Spacecraft observations represent the best possible data set for photometric investigations, because they span a wide range of wavelengths and solar phase angles that aren't observable from Earth. These rich data sets - which include both disk resolved and disk integrated observations - avoid the worst problem of photometric modeling: that there aren't sufficient observations to uniquely determine physical parameters.  The Cassini spacecraft has been in orbit around Saturn for nearly a decade, gathering unique data on the rings, moons, and magnetosphere, as well as on the planet. The orbital tour has enabled the acquisition of a full excursion in solar phase angles, providing an inflight laboratory for photometric modeling. Furthermore, the Visual Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) obtained measurements between 0.4 and 5 µm, or three octaves. Studying the behavior of reflected light as a function of wavelength offers clues to the physical nature of the surface, and new wavelengths not observed from Earth allow simplifications of photometric modeling to be made.  In this abstract we focus on the derivation of roughness and surface porosity for Enceladus, the active moon of Saturn. The southern hemisphere of this moon is lined with features ("Tiger Stripes") that are the source on active jets (Figure 1). We seek to correlate photometric parameters with the nature of activity on the moon. One goal is to establish "markers" that indicate vent locations, so that such markers can be used to locate geological active regions on other active bodies, including Europa and possibly the PlutoCharon system, which will be visited by the New Horizons spacecraft in 2015.   Photometric modeling, surface porosity: The opposition surge is the anomalous increase in brightness that occurs when a planetary surface becomes fully illuminated to an observer. The canonical explanation is the disappearance of mutual shadows cast by regolith particles [1], with an additional contribution at the smallest solar phase angles from coherent backscatter [2]. This latter effect is due to multiple scattering and is thus more significant for high-albedo objects such as Enceladus.  A significant advance in deriving the surface porosity of the optically active portion of the moons of  Saturn was realized by the acquisition of observations at wavelengths in which multiple scattering is not significant. These data can be used to derive surface porosity in a fairly straightforward fashion using shadowing hiding models in which the partial illumination of primary shadows is ignored [1]. For Enceladus and other icy moons of Saturn, data at 3 µm and beyond has been returned by VIMS and reduced to a diskintegrated solar phase curve. A typical curve (based on a preliminary reduction) for an icy saturnian moon is shown in Figure 2. Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) observations in the near UV, where multiple scattering is also not as important, are shown for comparison. It is unknown why the UV points at larger phase angles exhibit a forward scattering component.

A prelimlinary solar phase curve for a typical icy moon of Saturn, showing observations obtained by VIMS (black) at wavelenghts greater than 3 µm and by ISS (red) in the near-UV for comparison.  The blue line is a shadowing model [1] with a porosity of over 90%. VIMS and ISS        With a decreased importance of multiple scattering and thus of coherent backscatter, observations in both the IR and UV can be used to directly model the porosity of the upper regolith of Enceladus. Preliminary results show porosity in the 90-95% range, similar to that from freshly fallen snow or deposits of particles from plumes falling back onto the surface of Enceladus.        Photometric modeling, roughness: Another important physical parameter is macroscopic roughness, which is represented by features ranging from clumps of particles to mountains and craters. Active plumes or volcanism tend to create surfaces with a lower roughness, due to infilling by particles that reaccrete onto the surface. The most valuable data for deriving roughness is afforded by disk-resolved observations; disk integrated observations cannot be used to uniquely derive roughness because other parameters such as the single scattering phase function are also at play. However, disk resolved observations of the specific intensity yield a characteristic shape that is a function of the roughness of the surface.  For this study we used a crater roughness model [3], which idealizes rough facets by paraboloidal craters defined by a depth-to-radius ratio. Figure 3 shows a scan of I/F extracted from ISS images of the northern plains of Enceladus, an area dominated by craters and geologically old terrain. For comparison, a scan from the tiger stripe region is shown in Figure 4.   Figure 3. A scan of I/F extracted from ISS images of the northen plains of Enceladus. The model fit corresponds to a depth-to-radius ratio of 0.08.        Discussion: The unexpected result, that the geologically older northern plains of Enceladus and the geologically active regions of Enceladus have similar roughness, can be explained by a global infilling of the surface of the moon by reaccreted plume deposits.   Figure 4. A scan of I/F extracted from ISS images of the active southern hemipshere of Enceladus (baghdad Sulcus). The model fit corresponds to a depth-to-radius ratio of 0.10.   The depth-to-radius values of 0.08-0.10 correspond to Hapke mean slope angles of only a few degrees, which is extraordinarily smooth for an icy moon.       The solar phase curves of Saturn's icy moons obtained at 3 µm are the first such measurement of any airless body. The data are devoid of the confounding effects of multiple scattering, and thus the surface compaction state can be modeled directly from it. Future work includes using such measurements as a probe for identifying regions on moons that are active and possibly harbor reservoirs of liquid water and habitable environments below.
