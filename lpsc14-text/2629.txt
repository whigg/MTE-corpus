THE INITIAL 87Sr/86Sr OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND THE AGE OF THE MOON. R. Parai1, S. Huang1 and S. B. Jacobsen1, 1Dept. of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Harvard University, 20 Oxford St., Cambridge, MA 02138, USA; parai@fas.harvard.edu.   Introduction:  The long-lived 87Rb-87Sr system provides a powerful chronometer for early Solar System events. Due to differences in the volatility of Rb and Sr, 87Sr/86Sr ratios record information about condensation and volatile depletion in the early Solar System. For Rb-poor Solar System materials such as Moore Co. plagioclase, Angra dos Reis, Juvinas and the lunar anorthosite 60025, corrections for radiogenic ingrowth of 87Sr are small, and variations in resulting initial 87Sr/86Sr may be interpreted to reflect differences in the timing of separation from an evolving solar nebula [e.g., 1-3]. Thus, a chronology may be constructed based on relative variations in initial 87Sr/86Sr in planetary materials, rather than absolute ages derived by the internal 87Rb-87Sr isochron method.  Based on a re-normalized compilation of literature Rb-Sr data measured in various laboratories over the course of decades, Halliday and Porcelli [4] argued for a young lunar formation age of 90±20 Myr after the formation of CAIs. In order to improve on the normalization, we have measured Sr isotopic data for two Sr standards used in the literature: NBS 987 and Pacific seawater. Here we undertake a comprehensive set of Sr isotopic measurements in eucrites, angrites, lunar samples and CAIs in order to shed light on the early history of the Solar System. Methods:  Purified Sr was loaded onto Ta single filaments with phosphoric acid and run on the GV Isoprobe-T TIMS at Harvard using a multidynamic collection method and new Xact amplifier boards, generously provided by Isotopx. A 5V 88Sr signal was typically maintained for 20-100 blocks of 10 cycles each (20 seconds integration time per cycle). Corrections for instrumental fractionation were made to a common  86Sr/88Sr  value (0.1194) using the exponential law. Results:  Measured 87Sr/86Sr and 2σ errors for 9 NBS 987 runs (Fig. 1), 8 Pacific seawater runs (Fig. 2) and 4 Juvinas runs (Fig. 3) are shown with sample grand means and 2 standard error intervals. 87Rb/86Sr for the Juvinas sample was measured by isotope dilution to be 0.00256±5, yielding an initial 87Sr/86Sr of 0.699057 ± 8. We measure an offset of 0.001074 ± 5 between NBS 987 and Pacific seawater. Precise determination of the 87Sr/86Sr in these standard materials allows us to correct for interlab biases in literature data and to thereby construct an internally consistent compilation that includes our own new high-precision Sr data for early Solar System materials.

Discussion:  Using a new normalization based on our measurements of NBS 987 and Pacific seawater (Fig. 4), we find that some samples with discrepant reported initial 87Sr/86Sr values agree within error when properly normalized: Allende CAI D7 from [5,6]; Moore Co. plagioclase from [7,8]; LEW86010 from [8,9]; and Juvinas from [1,10 and this study] all agree within error. We note that after proper normalization, our Juvinas measurements result in a value for the basaltic eucrites' initial 87Sr/86Sr that is within 10 ppm of the original value (BABI) determined by [1]. Thus, a careful normalization resolves some standing issues in the literature. However, normalized initial 87Sr/86Sr data for Angra dos Reis [2,8,9] and lunar anorthosite 60025 [7,11] do not all agree within error. In particular, significant differences in the initial 87Sr/86Sr for lunar anorthosite 60025 persist after correcting for inter-laboratory bias. Therefore, there is a clear need to make new high-precision measurements of Sr in 60025 and Angra dos Reis in order to further our understanding of early Solar System chronology.  A precise determination of the lunar initial 87Sr/86Sr is particularly important to our understanding of the processes that shaped the early Earth-Moon system and the early Solar System. The timing of the Moon-forming giant impact has important implications for the timescale of Earth's accretion and the segregation of the iron core: Yu and Jacobsen [12] showed that a late Moon-forming giant impact (at ~100 Myr) requires extremely short timescales of accretion  (mean age of accretion < 1 Myr) based on Hf-W systematics. A strict constraint on the timing of the Moon-forming giant impact is thus critical to our understanding of Earth's growth and metal-silicate differentiation as well as our broader understanding of Solar System history.  The very low initial 87Sr/86Sr of 60025 strongly supports formation of the Moon within the first 30 Myr of Solar System history rather than 100 Myr later.  References: [1] Papanastassiou D.
