University Blvd. Tucson, AZ 85721, USA (cmelder@lpl.arizona.edu).   Introduction: Convection alone is not sufficient to remove the heat generated in Io's interior by tidal dissipation [1].  This and the abundant volcanism observed on Io's surface suggests that a significant amount of heat may be lost through the heat pipe mechanism [2, 3].  An induced magnetic field detected by the magnetometer on the Galileo spacecraft suggests that Io's interior contains a global conducting layer at least 50 km thick and at least 20% molten [4], which further implies that magma, is an important factor when attempting to understand Io's interior.  Not only does magma allow energy to be efficiently transferred by the advection of latent heat, but widespread partial melting in Io's interior will also affect convection by lowering the viscosity of the material and increasing the density contrast driving convection.  This mode of planetary heat loss may also been relevant for Earth and other terrestrial planets in our solar system earlier in solar system history [5] and may be relevant on extrasolar planets today. In order to understand the effects of partial melting on planetary heat loss, we develop a 1-D model of melt migration through Io's mantle coupled with convective scaling laws re-derived to include the effects of partial melt.  We adapt [6]'s model for melt migration beneath sea floor spreading zones on Earth to Io.  This model treats the subsolidus mantle upwelling velocity and temperature as free parameters, so we use convective scaling laws to constrain these parameters.  We use boundary layer stability analysis to re-derive convective scaling laws while including the effects of partial melt.  This will allow us to estimate the vertical melt profile in Io's mantle and the amount of heat brought to the base of Io's lithosphere by melt migration.  In the future we plan to couple this 1-D model to an orbital dynamics model to investigate Io's thermalorbital evolution. Model:  We envision convection comprised of narrow plumes descending through a partially molten mantle whose net mass flux is upward (figure 1).  As the mantle rock rises between the downwelling plumes, it begins to melt.  The less dense magma buoyantly ascends through the solid grains carrying latent heat with it.  To model this process we need to consider both the migration of the magma through the solid grains and the convective forces driving the upwelling of the mantle material.  Mantle Solidus geotherm Figure 1. Cold narrow plumes sink through Io's partially molten mantle.  The rest of the mantle rises and begins to melt when it reaches the solidus temperature.  Melt migration: [6] developed a 1-D model for partial melting and melt migration through an ascending column of mantle rock beneath a mid ocean ridge.  This process is analogous to most of Io's mantle but we must additionally include tidal heating as an internal heat source for Io.  Melt migration conserves mass:  !! !t +"# (!u) = m "l               (1) ! "! "t +#$ ((1!!)V ) = ! m "s              (2) where ! is the melt fraction, u and V are the melt and solid velocities respectively, "l and "s are the melt and solid densities respectively and m is the rate of melting.  Melt migrates according to Darcy's law: !(u!V ) = k "l (!"pl + #lg)               (3) where k is the permeability, #l is the melt viscosity, and pl is the liquid pressure.  Momentum is conserved: !" ((1#!)" s )+!" (!" l )+ (!#l + (1#!)#s )g = 0    (4) where $s and $l are the solid and liquid stress tensors, and g is the acceleration due to gravity.  Energy is also conserved  mL + !lc" !!t +u "# $% &' ()T + !sc(1*") !!t +V "# $% &' ()T *#T" ! !t +u "# $% &' () pl *#T (1*") !!t +V "# $% &' () ps = #" (!sc$#T )+++E (5) where L is the latent heat, c is the specific heat capacity, T is the temperature, % is the thermal expansivity, ps is the solid pressure, & is the viscous dissipation (see [6]), and E is the tidal heating rate per volume.  Equations 1-5 are non-dimensionalized and combined into two equations that depend on the melt fraction and  the difference in the solid and liquid pressure.  We solve the equations numerically, allowing them to reach steady state.  This model includes three free parameters: the upwelling velocity and temperature of the mantle rock below the depth at which melting begins, and the tidal heating rate.  An example of the results obtained from this model for an assumed mantle temperature of 1750 K, a mantle upwelling velocity of 3 cm/yr, and a tidal heating rate of 5x1013 W are shown in figure 2.   Mantle convection:  The mantle temperature and mantle upwelling velocity can be reasonably estimated on Earth [6], but a lack of similar data for Io makes estimating these values for Io difficult.  We turn to convective scaling laws to constrain these values.  However, typical convective scaling laws [e.g. 7, 8] do not include the effects of partial melting.  Partial melting will affect the viscosity of the mantle material, the density contrast driving convection, and will remove some fraction of the heat in the mantle through the eruption of magma to the surface rather than conduction of heat through the lithosphere.  We re-derive the convective scaling laws for the internal mantle temperature and the root mean squared velocity of mantle material based on the internal heating rate while including these effects using boundary layer stability analysis as in [7] and [8].  The increase in the density contrast between the cold solid lithosphere and the warm partially molten mantle means that the Rayleigh number depends on both the temperature contrast and the melt fraction contrast.  The viscosity's melt fraction dependence goes as exp(-B!) [1].  Typically conservation of energy in mantle convection dictates that the amount of heat conducted through the lithosphere out of the mantle is balanced by the rate of internal heating, but in the case of partial melting, heat is also lost by melt advecting latent heat.  The velocity in the convecting region is found by equating the volume integrals of the viscous dissipation and of mechanical work done by convection per unit time [8].  The mechanical work done by convection is affected by partial melt.  All other relationships are the same as described in [7] and [8].  These adapted mantle convective scaling laws can be used to estimate the temperature and root mean squared velocity of the mantle, which we will use in the melt migration calculations. Conclusions and Future Work:  Convective scaling laws without the effects of melt predict unrealistic temperatures for Io's mantle.  Incorporating the effects of melt migration significantly lowers the predicted internal temperature.  We are currently working to couple the melt migration model with the adapted convective scaling laws to self-consistently calculate the radial melt profile, and amount of heat being carried towards Io's lithosphere by melt migration.  The average melt fraction predicted by our model will be compared to [4] and the melt advected towards the surface will be compared to Io's resurfacing rate [8].   References: [1] Moore W. B.
