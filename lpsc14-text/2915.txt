 IS SUDDEN PERMEABILITY CHANGE FROM DIKE EMPLACEMENT THE CAUSE OF FLOOD OUTBURSTS AT ATHABASCA VALLES, MARS?  K. L. Craft1, R. P. Lowell2, and L. Germanovich3 1Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (11100 Johns Hopkins Rd., Laurel, MD 20723, Kate.Craft@jhuapl.edu), 2Virginia Tech (4044 Derring Hall, Blacksburg, VA, rlowell@vt.edu), 3Georgia Tech (Atlanta, GA, lgermanovich@gatech.edu).   Introduction: The morphology of large flood valleys on Mars suggest high-rate water expulsions emanated from nearby fractures.  These valleys may have formed by dike-driven hydrothermal systems as described in [1]. Hydrothermal systems exist abundantly on Earth [e.g. 2] and likely exist or existed on many planetary bodies in our solar system including Mars where evidence of volcanic activity and hydrothermal deposits have been observed [eg. 3,4,5].  At terrestrial midocean ridge hydrothermal systems, large, sudden increases in heat output, called event plumes, have been observed [6].  The plumes are suggested to occur as a result of magmatic dike intrusion beneath the seafloor that forms a damage zone in the adjacent crust, greatly increasing permeability and fluid flow [7,8].   Athabasca Valles, a very young outflow channel system on Mars, is suggested to have formed by water flood events originating at a fissure in the Cerabus Fossae region [9].  These fissures may have formed from magmatic dikes stalling in the near subsurface [10].  Similar to event plumes at mid-ocean ridges, the dike intrusions may have damaged the surrounding crust and provided increased permeability and fluid flow in a region near the dike.  Outside the damage zone, however, dike intrusions would likely cause compressive stresses that would act to decrease permeability.  A previous study by [11] modeled the stresses resulting from an ~ instantaneous dike emplacement and the ensuing pore pressure distribution to determine if sufficient water volumes could be rapidly forced to the surface to form the flood features Mangala and Athabasca Valles. Their analyses assumed instantaneous dike emplacement and predicted an approximately infinite initial stress near the dike margin resulting in high discharge rates immediately following the diking event. Our analyses take a closer look by recognizing that dike propagation occurs over time, resulting in a more gradual permeability change with depth that provides a  closer approximation to actual initial fluid flow rates. Moreover, Hanna and Phillips investigate only the fluid flow resulting from pressurization of the groundwater aquifer as a result of diking. They do not consider changes in crustal permeability in the damage zone (except to make the assumption that water flow will not meet any resistance there), nor the changes in permeability resulting from dike induced compressive stresses away from the dike margin. Objective: We analyze how the increase in permeability of the damage zone adjacent to the dike and compressive pore closure further from the dike changes hydrothermal flow.  We compare the outflow volumes and rates in our model with those estimated for formation of Athabasca Valles and to flow results of [11]. Methods: We first make the assumption that the initial crustal permeability throughout is about 10-12 m2 before dike intrusion occurs, in order to compare with results in [11].  During intrusion, a damage zone around the dike forms, where according to field observations by [8], permeabilies increase 3 to 5 orders of magnitude within one dike's width distance from the dike wall. Therefore, the damage zone is assumed to be one dike's width wide and has a permeability between 10-9 and 10-7 m2.  Outside of the damage zone, the crust will experience stress induced by the dike intrusion volume change and heat output.    Here we model the volume change effects using a finite element program, FRANC2d [12].  First we propagate a magmatic dike and assess the resulting stresses. Figure 2a shows the dike propagated up to the Martian surface from a magma body located 20 km deep.  The magma body is pressurized 1% over the lithostatic load, σL, and hydrostatic pressure is maintained in the propagating dike:  Pd = P1 − ρmgh                               (1) where Pd is the dike pressure, P1 is the pressure at the base of the dike = 1.01 * σL, ρm is the density of magma, and h is the distance above the lens. Figure 2b shows the resulting σx stress field.  These stresses are then related to change in crustal permeability via the expression:  K* = K0 1+ Cβ ΔP E" #$ %& '3                           (2) where K0 and K* are the initial and new permeabilities respectively, C is a constant defined as C ≈ 2 (1-ν2) with ν = Poisson's ratio, β is the crack aspect ratio (width:length), ΔP is the change in stress perpendicular to the dike (difference in σx before and after dike emplacement), and E is Young's modulus [Germanovich personal commun., 2013].    We then apply the permeability change to a hydrothermal flow model to determine volume and flow rate outputs possible at the Martian surface following the  boundary layer analysis described in [1].

Model of hydrothermal flow adjacent to a magmatic dike, showing formation of boundary layer Results: Results find that for all permeabilities, boundary layer flow occurs within the damage zone.  Flow rates calculated for a 200 km long dike propagated from 20 km depth to the surface are given in Table 1.  The dike length was chosen to simulate the fissure length observed at the source fissure for Athabasca Valles.  Rates for permeabilities of K = 10-8 and 10-7 m2 fall above 300 km3/yr and could therefore provide flow to form the valley system.  Total volumes are estimated over the conductive lifetime of the dikedriven system (τ ~ w2/κ) where w is the dike width and κ is the thermal diffusivity. Total volume amounts for each permeability and dike lifetime/width are shown in Table 2.  All systems tested meet the minimum volume estimated requirement of 400 km3 for formation of Athabasca Valles and systems with the wider dike and K ≥ 10-9 m2 as well as the narrower dike with K ≥ 10-8 m2 meet or exceed the upper 1600 km3 requirement.   In the boundary layer model applied, calculations assume that water is drawn into the system through a similar or higher permeability when, in actuality, results show that the permeability outside of the damage zone will be less than or equal to the initial permeability of K0=10-12 m2 and may equal zero (Table 3). The lower permeability would restrict flow into the damage zone where hydrothermal boundary layer flow occurs. To determine if flow from the damage zone could be adequate on its own, the volume of water available is estimated for a Martian dike ~ 15 km deep (where porosity is significant), ~ 200 km long, and with a damage zone ~ 10 - 100 m wide, that results in 30 to 300 km3, respectively.  Therefore, in order to form Athabasca Valles, flow from outside the damage zone region is required. Observations indicate that Athabasca Valles likely formed from multiple flood events, and we suggest the damage zone could have had time to recharge between flood events if repeated dike intrusions occursed to drive water upwards to enable the formation of the valley system.
