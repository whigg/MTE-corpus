CTX data gaps that only make out a fewpercent of the mapping area were filled with dataacquired by the High Resolution Stereo Camera [2, 3](HRSC) at resolutions between 12.5 to 25 mpx-1. Whilethe focus of this map lies on the study of recent surfaceprocesses and the complex volcano-tectonic historythat has sustainably shaped Tempe Terra, adjacentunits associated with the formation of major geologicregions (Arcadia Planitia, Kasei Valles, Tharsis) werealso included to get a comprehensive insight in theregional geology. To improve stratigraphic positionsof geomorphologic units, we performed extensivemeasurements of crater size-frequency distributions onHRSC and especially CTX data to derive relative andabsolute model formation ages. In contrast to previousinvestigations that were based on Viking data of lowerresolutions (50-100 mpx-1 [4]) (130-300 mpx-1 [5]), ourmap represents a more advanced study of the TempeTerra region owing to the higher resolution and betterimage quality of CTX data. In the following sectionswe summarize some of the key findings of our detailedmapping approach.Labeatis Mons: The best-preserved of the 3 largervolcanoes in Tempe Terra is Labeatis Mons, a steepsided dome, situated inmidst the southwestern rift segment at 37.4◦N/76.0◦W. It might be the result of anascending mantle plume which also commonly occurwithin terrestrial rift systems such as the East AfricanRift System [6, 7, 8] or the Baikal Rift System [9].Numerous overlapping lava flows extend radially fromits center with farthest extensions up to 100 km to thenorth and 122 km to the south and southwest. Withinformer studies [5, 10, 11, 12] boundaries of LabeatisMons were roughly drawn along the disappearance offaults that carve into late Noachian smooth plains (Ntfl).While this approach is not very precise because faultsonly slowly fade whereas demarcation becomes a bit arbitrary, scarps of lobate flows (Fig. 1) and flow frontsthat form the boundary to the sorrounding unit Ntfl arewell discernable in CTX data and were mapped in detail. The great importance of Labeatis Mons for determining the times of rift activity of Tempe Fossae has already been made clear by [10, 12] who measured cratersize-frequency distributions (CSFD’s) of key areas revealing a model formation age of the main volcanic edifice of 3.51 Ga which is highly consistent with own agedeterminations of 3.53 Ga. However, our detailed investigation of the volcano using CTX data reveals newinsights into relative and absolute stratigraphic relationsbetween volcanic emplacement and rifting. Narrow lavaflows (Fig. 1a) which represent later eruptions andshould therefore be younger than 3.53 Ga (or 3.51 Ga)are cut by major curvlinear border faults of Tempe Fossae and linear, narrow faults of Mareotis Fossae. Thus,rifting or at least faulting seems to have been active afterthe latest eruptions.Ancient lakes and river beds: In the eastern partof Tempe Terra, Nochian cratered units are often carvedby irregular, often labyrinth-like, flat-floored and rimless topograpic depressions. In times when precise topography data of Mars were not yet available, thesedepressions and channels were falsely interpreted aslava flows, issued from a circular central depression at43.98◦N/61.50◦W e.g. by [13, 14, 5]. This is in factnot surprising considering the low resolution of smallscale Viking data which they used for their investigations. However, the utilization of high-res CTX datacombined with topography data acquired by the MarsOrbiter Laser Altimeter [15] (MOLA) leave no doubtFigure 1: a) Sinusoidal projection (clon = 76.74◦W) of CTX image P20 008972 2175. One of many north trending lava flow lobes(in red) that extend from Labeatis Mons. Curvlinear faults of TempeFossae have subsequently cut younger lava flows. b) Sinusoidal projection (clon = 75.46◦W) of CTX image P20 008972 2175. In contrast to the north trending flows, south trending volcanic eruptionsrather appear branched as an assemblege of many overlapping narrowflows. They are cut by long but narrow linear graben of Mareotis Fossae. Black arrows in both images point towards the center of LabeatisMons.2313.pdf

This small meandering stream resp. the remaining dry river bed (marked in bright blue) which looks like a miniature Kasei Valles has subsequently cut through unit Nfptm andeven through the Amazonian-Hesperian plains interpreted as ancient lakes and/or rivers beds.

Center of CTX image P13 006229 2157 lies at N35.08◦/E-56.35◦.Flow direction is from the west to the east, indicated by streamline-shaped islands and MOLA topography data.that these features are depressions instead of volcanoeswith radial extending narrow lava flows.Another type of depressions that have carved intoNoachian cratered plateau units are long, winding andshort but wide valleys with tributary channels and landforms that stronly resemble ancient river beds (Fig. 2).These winding valleys and possible ancient lake bedsgenerally follow the decreasing elevation towards thenorthern lowlands.Volcano-tectonic evolution: According to numerical models, faster extension rates which produce highlocal extensional deformations that can lead to continental rifting only occur within the thermally younger,and therefore warmer lithosphere. In contrast to this,spreading and widening of the area, that is incorporated in the extensional deformation is expected to occurwithin a cooler and thickened lithosphere at slow deformation rates [16]. Thus widening and crustal thickening are thougth to generally mark the end of rifting.For Tempe Terra, this would mean, that the larger riftvalley to the northeast should have formed earlier inMars history when geothermal gradients were higherand the lithosphere thinner. By progressive cooling ofthe planet with simultaneous thickening and strengthening of the lithosphere, extension rates slow down whichresult in spreading of the rift, as observed for the southeastern part of Tempe Fossae. This is in accordancewith the stratigraphic distribution of volcanic edificeswithin Tempe Terra and a decrease in size and therefore in volume of erupted materials. First volcanic activity is indicated by the formation of the ancient, largeand heavily eroded pre- to synrifting volcano [10, 12]at 44.6◦N/70.0◦W that is dissected by many faults ofTempe and Mareotis Fossae [14]. Early and Late Hesperian rift related volcanic edifices are situated within central Tempe Terra at 38.4◦N/70.2◦W and 37.4◦N/76.0◦Wand have sustainably shaped the rift geometry. Early toLate Amazonian volcanic activity can only be observedin the western Tempe volcanic province as clusters ofnumerous small low shields [17].Summary: Many boundaries of geomorphologicunits previously mapped e.g. by [4, 5] could have beenrefined during our mapping. Besides boundaries thatwere mapped as uncertain or were not recognized owing to lower resolutions of used image data in previous investigations have been verified or established forthe first time. By the use of our new map, combinedwith precise age determination of many units, we wereable to considerably improve the overall stratigraphyof Tempe Terra. Additionally, we were able to narrowformation intervals of many fault arrays of Tempe andMareotis Fossae.References: [1] M. Malin, et al. (2007) JGR 112(E05S04). [2] G. Neukum, et al.
