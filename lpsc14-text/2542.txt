A Ten Million SPH Particle Simulation of the Origin of Obliquity of Uranus Luı´s F.A. Teodoro1, Donald G. Korycansky2, Michael S.

The current paradigmfor the cause of this property is that the planetexperienced a giant off-axis impact by a largebody (of order one Earth mass) some time after its formation. Since the pioneering work ofSlattery et al (1992) [1] twenty years ago therehas been no major reinvestigation of this problem. We are currently carrying out a new setof simulations using the same method (SmoothParticle Hydrodynamics) as Slattery et al [1]but with one thousand times better mass resolution (107 particles).SPH codes are well-suited to computinggravitational interactions, tracking provenance,3D geometry, extreme computational parallelization, and they are guaranteed to conserve matter. Furthermore, the time integrationscheme is designed to approximately conserveenergy and angular momentum. These qualitieshave made SPH codes the usual choice to studygiant planetary impacts. The relevant physicsfor each particle’s kinematic (position and velocity) and state (internal energy, density) is i)gravity, ii) compressional heating and expansional cooling, and iii) shock dissipation. Thechosen form for the Equation of State (EOS)relates a particle’s specific internal energy andlocal density to pressure at each time step.We are employing the parallel tree-codedeveloped by Warren and Salmon (1992) [2]with SPH capabilities enhanced by Warren andFryer for astrophysical applications and extensively used in cosmological simulations and hydrodynamics (e.g. Warren et al., 2006, 2013;Fryer et al., 2006 [3, 4, 5]). The initial conditions are generated using the algorithm introduced by Diehl et al [6]. Finally, we are using the same EOS as Slattery et al [1]. Thetime step is Courant limited and for the runtimes considered here (approximately 1 dayof simulated time), the typical energy error is∆E/E ∼ 105, with angular momentum conserved to 1 part in 104 over the entire computational volume.Our suite of simulations explores a range ofparameter space and tests the conclusions of thework by Slattery et al. Furthermore, it takesadvantage of the vastly higher mass (and spacial) resolution to place additional constraintson the process, by means of investigating possible post-impact satellite formation. Additionally, we are currently testing various combinations of proto-Uranus structures and compositions with the aim of constraining the impactgiven our present-day knowledge about the interior of the planet.References[1] W.
