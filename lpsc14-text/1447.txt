Introduction:  At LPSC2013 [1] we reported on MAHLI images and APXS spectra obtained on Sol 34 from the APXS calibration target, which is a polished slab of Broken Tank basalt (BT2) from near Socorro, New Mexico. Taken together the data suggested that during Curiosity's landing, the resultant dust and stone cloud had caused deposition of a thin film of fine particulate on the target surface. By comparing element peak area ratios before and after landing with results of modeling a two-layer target with our APX-Yield code, we estimated the thickness (~100 nm) and gave approximate concentrations of the dominant components, Fe2O3, MgO, Cl and SO3.  We have now refined these calculations [2] and confirmed that any similar deposit on the APXs sensor head would not alter the calibration significantly. Here we describe calibration of the actual BT2 target and then follow its real and apparent element concentrations before landing and up to Sol 411.     Laboratory APXS measurements of BT2 basalt:       During calibration of the flight-equivalent APXS unit (FEU) with ~ 60 geochemical reference materials [3], we processed APXS spectra from various powdered and pelletized BT2 samples using our GUAPX program. Empirical corrections, derived and explained in ref. [3] using ten basalt reference materials, were applied for Na, Mg and Al. The results were self-consistent. The first two columns of Table 1 compare the concentrations for an aliquot of a particular BT2 powder sample with values determined for a different aliquot by Activation Laboratories, Ancaster, Ontario using a variety of techniques.  The results justify our Mg and Al empirical corrections, but the Na correction appears less appropriate for this high-alkali basalt, and was therefore adjusted to achieve agreement. All further BT2 analyses employed used these corrections.        Using the methods detailed previously [1,3] we transferred the FEU calibration to the proto-flight unit (PFM) and analyzed the BT2 calibration slab. Several differences from the powder are apparent in Table 1. The Mg and Fe concentrations are lower and those of Si and Ca are higher.        Various hypotheses to explain the powder-slab differences were considered and some discarded. SEM X-ray mapping reveals a slight heterogeneity in the olivine distribution across the slab area, but this is insufficient to explain the observed Mg and Fe   differences. Our preferred hypothesis, currently under further testing, is that the shape of the mineral grains plays a role in the apparent difference in chemistry because it controls the relative importance of area (measured on the calibration target) versus volume (measured with the powder).      Measurements on Mars: The FEU calibration was again transferred to the PFM, this time to take account of the fresh 244Cm sources destined for Mars [1]. The first Martian BT2 spectrum (Sol 34) displayed clear S and Cl signals which were absent from the lab spectrum. The Si:Fe peak area ratio fell by over 20% as opposed to the 12% that was expected from the different 244Cm source configurations [1]. Peak areas for the other PIXEinduced elements Na and Al fell by essentially the same amount, but in contrast to this collective light element behavior, the Mg signal was increased. Finally, the Fe signal increased relative to the scattered Pu X-ray lines. All these observations suggested deposition of a thin film dominated by Mg, S, Cl and Fe. This film would attenuate the X-rays of the lightest elements from the basalt, with the consequent loss of Mg signal being more than compensated by the Mg from the film.        It follows that element concentrations extracted from this spectrum will not fully represent the original BT2 material and must therefore be regarded as "apparent concentrations". Nevertheless, these values are useful in monitoring the calibration target response with time. The apparent concentrations on Sols 34, 179 and 411, based on the Martian PFM calibration, are given in the flight model (FM) columns of Table 1, along with typical spectrum fitting errors (Sol 411). The apparent increases of Mg, S, Cl and Fe concentrations on Sol 34 relative to the 2008 lab measurement reflect the dominance of these elements in the surface dust film.      The S and Cl results decrease by one third on Sol 179 and then remain constant over time, and there is an indication of loss of some Fe. These observations suggest that the film has become thinner, which should result in decreased attenuation of X-rays of the lightest elements. This is consistent with the observed slight increase in apparent Na concentration. In contrast however, Mg remains constant, suggesting that any loss of Mg from the film is to some degree compensated by increased transmission of Mg X-rays from the BT2 substrate.

This has resulted in a re-balancing of the constituents: ~ 10 wt% MgO, 62.5 wt% Fe2O3, 3.9 wt% Na2O, 3.6 wt% Cl and 20 wt% SO3. In [4], Fe2O3 as nanophase iron oxide, coupled with SO3 and Cl in a rather constant ratio of ~ 7, was found to be a part of the smallest and brightest components of the Martian soil. The SO3/Cl ratio found in the BT2 film aligns with this value and remains constant with time. The film's overall composition is dominated by only a subset of the components of Martian soil [5], which appears postSol 179 to adhere stably to the calibration target.    Conclusions: A cursory glance at the concentrations measured in the BT2 target since 2008 could suggest conflicting trends for various elements. These can only be reconciled by following the intricacies of the calibration sequence, noting the marked drops in Mg and Fe content in the BT2 target relative to powdered material, and modeling the peak areas from the dustcovered  BT2 such that the rise (and fall) of Mg and Fe with time are understood. The estimated thickness and composition of the surface film on the BT2 are such that a similar film on the APXS sensor head would have negligible effect on the calibration.    Continued study of the contamination on the vertically mounted calibration target and comparison with airborne dust deposited on the horizontal observation tray may shed light on how Martian dust interacts with surfaces, whether rock or rover. One might address the mechanisms (electrostatic force, chemical reaction, UV radiation, dissolution in thin frost films) which enable a subset of the dust to adhere over a long period to the calibration target. Preferential reactivity of the S, Cl bearing phases with the underlying surface might explain APXS trends seen on MER and MSL from "as- is" to brushed rocks, where there is usually no full coverage by fine grains with a soil-like composition. It often looks like S or Cl decrease without apparent cations. A corresponding example on MSL is the the drastic drop of only sulfur when loose, reddish dust was brushed by the DRT off the Yellowknife Bay target Wernicke, exposing a gray substrate.
