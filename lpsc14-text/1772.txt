Among the most important are morphological and mineralogical indicators suggesting that liquid water has existed on Mars at various locations over the entire history of the planet, albeit in decreasing abundance with time. The High Resolution Stereo Camera of ESA’s Mars Express Mission (HRSC) is designed to simultaneously map the morphology, topography, structure and geologic context of the surface as well as atmospheric phenomena [1]. After 10 years of orbiting the planet, HRSC has covered about 90% of the surface in stereo and color with resolutions up to 10 m/pixel. High precision digital elevation models of up to 30-50 m grid spacing [1], generated from all suitable datasets of stereo coverage, currently cover about 40% of the surface [1,2]. The geomorphological analysis of surface features observed by the HRSC indicate major surface modification by endogenic and exogenic processes at all scales. Besides constraining the ages of surface features, HRSC also provides basic data for quantitative analyses to constrain the emplacement of volcanic material, fluvial erosional processes, glacial and periglacial surface modification, and eolian surface/atmosphere interactions.  Geomorphological changes with time: Endogenic landforms (e.g., tectonic rifts, small basaltic shield volcanoes) were found to be very similar to their equivalents on Earth [1,3-7], suggesting that processes unique to Mars may not be required to explain their formation. Volcanism may have been active up to the very recent past or even to the present, putting important constraints on thermal evolution models [4,6,7]. Mars’ climate history is still subject to debate. Various erosional processes characterize Noachian landscapes. Landforms such as widespread valley networks, fluvial deposits and associated assemblages of hydrated clay minerals has led researchers to propose the hypothesis that the martian climate was at least considerably wetter during the early history of Mars [e.g., 8,9].

At the boundary between the Late Noachian and Early Hesperian, environmental and climate conditions changed significantly and resulted in a transition towards a colder and drier climate. The intensity of aqueous activity decreased throughout the Hesperian, including a transition from long-term and repeated precipitation-induced fluvial activity towards reduced, short-term, spatially isolated and groundwaterdominated fluvial erosion [e.g., 10-13]. Figure 1 presents an exemplary valley network in Libya Montes, which has experienced different types of water release mechanisms and various periods of activity and quiescence [10]. By the end of the Hesperian, fluvial erosion had mostly ceased and volcanic, eolian and glacial processes are interpreted to be dominant on Mars. The Early Amazonian was already most likely characterized by a cold and dry climate that was similar to the conditions on recent Mars. However, Mars’ climate and aqueous history, in particular the timing of the termination of dendritic valley network formation due to widespread surface runoff and the transition from precipitation-induced toward groundwater-dominated erosion such as sapping and outflow channel formation, is still subject to debate. The analyses of diverse landforms produced by aqueous processes revealed that surface water activity was likely episodic, but ranged in age from very ancient to very recent [1,14-22]. Particularly important are prominent glacial and periglacial processes at several latitudes, including mountain glaciers and a frozen sea [23-31]. The identification of aqueous alteration minerals and their geological context has enabled a better understanding of paleoenvironmental conditions and pedogenetic processes [32-33]. Dark dunes contain volcanic material and are evidence for a very dynamic surface, characterized by widespread erosion, transport, and redeposition [34]. Recently formed gullies and alluvial fans might have experienced even shorter periods of liquid water (minutes to hours), as shown by the identification of debris flow deposits that were formed by short-lived high-energy mass-wasting events [19]. However, most gullies show morphological characteristics, which indicate that they were formed by repeated flow events involving fluvial-dominated processes, such as snow deposits melting during high-obliquity phases [31, 35].  Comparable environmental conditions: The surface of Mars shows many landforms that resemble cold-climate features on Earth. Permafrost on Earth is known to host rich habitats containing cold- adapted microbial communities. Permafrost environments on Mars might represent habitable zones if liquid water is present, e.g., as a consequence of freeze-thaw cycles. Since basically all geologic interpretations of extraterrestrial features require profound knowledge of the Earth as key reference, thus, studying terrestrial analogues is mandatory in planetary geology. Field work in Antarctica, Svalbard and Iceland [27,30,36,37] using similar instrumentation as on Mars provided a basis for the analyses of periglacial and volcanic processes, respectively.
