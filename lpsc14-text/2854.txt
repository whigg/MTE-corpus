Introduction: Recent data from the MESSENGER mission have shown that Mercury’s surface has a low iron content compared to other terrestrial planets like the Earth or Mars (<4 wt% Fe [1], with a maximum amount as FeO <2-3 wt% [2]). This low Fe content and the large surface S contents (up to 4 wt% [3]) have led to the inference that Mercury’s differentiation occurred at particularly reducing conditions, so that most iron was in metal form and was incorporated into the core. The S content of the core could be large [4-6]. Moreover, up to ~4 wt% C could be partitioned into the core from chondritic precursor materials under suitably reducing conditions during the planet formation. Previous experiments have demonstrated that S strongly influences the melting conditions of iron, potentially creating an iron snow process in Mercury’s core [4,7], wherein iron precipitates at shallow levels and then sinks through the core. This is due to the decrease of eutectic melting temperatures (TE) and S contents with increasing pressure. In order to constrain the role of C, the melting of Fe-S-C systems at 2-20 GPa has been investigated using piston-cylinder and multi-anvil experiments, by analyzing the recovered quenched samples [8,9]. [8] found that eutectic melting occurs below 1050°C at 2 GPa. In addition, they showed that immiscibility between a S-rich melt and a C-rich melt occurs at low pressure, up to 4 GPa in the Fe-5wt% S-5wt% C system and up to 5 GPa in the Fe-5wt% S-15wt% C system. [9] found that TE ~1100°C at 10 GPa, i.e., a much higher temperature than in the simpler Fe-S system (~855°C [10]). [10] also found that increasing pressure decreases TE in the Fe-S system up to 14 GPa. Above this pressure, TE increases again, reaching 1150°C at 25 GPa [11]. According to [9], the Fe-S-C system melts around 1225°C at 20 GPa. By extrapolating their curve, TE>1250°C at 25 GPa.  One of the main difficulties for the determination of solidus temperatures in metallic systems is the interpretation of the textures of quenched samples at low melt fraction. In situ spectroscopic methods allow to determine the phase changes – in particular, the appearance of melt – during the experiments. In order to constrain TE in the Fe-S-C system, we therefore made in situ multi-anvil experiments on a synchrotron. Experimental method: The experiments were performed using the 1000-ton mutli-anvil apparatus at Advanced Photon Source, Argonne (13-IDD). A 10/5 (octahedron edge length/WC cubes TEL) assembly was used for the experiments between 4.5 and 15.5 GPa, and an 8/3 assembly between 18 and 24.5 GPa. The sample was placed in a MgO capsule plugged at each end by MgO powder. Temperature was measured using a W5-Re26 thermocouple crossed at one end of the sample. Pressure calibrations were made during each experiment using a MgO pressure marker. A rolled rhenium foil was used as furnace. It was separated from the MgO octahedron using a LaCrO3 insulating sleeve. In addition, graphite windows were put into the Re furnace and LaCrO3 sleeve on the X-ray beam path. During the experiments, the pressure was first increased to the desired value. Then, the temperature was increased by increments in order to regularly take X-ray images and diffraction spectra of the sample. In most cases, temperature was quenched soon after the melting was observed, so that eutectic melting textures would be preserved. Starting material: In order to distinguish metallic melts and solids, we physically separated the Fe phase from the FeS+Fe3C mixture by inserting a Fe rod inside the capsule, and put the mixture below it. At the interface between the rod and mixture, the three phases Fe, FeS and F3C were in contact. In order to avoid any kinetic issues with C diffusion, we pre-saturated the Fe rod with C using high temperature furnace experiments.

Analyses: Energy dispersive X-Ray diffraction spectra were collected for 300s at various stages during the experiments. 2-θ was calibrated during each experiment. Spectra of MgO were fitted using [12]. Xray images were also taken at various stages – in particular, around the eutectic melting temperature – in order to observe the decrease of contrast between the two parts of the sample (Fig.1). After the experiments, the recovered samples were mounted in epoxy resin, ground to the longitudinal mid-section and polished using Al2O3 powder, then colloidal silica. Backscattered electron images of the samples were taken using a FEI Helios Nanolab 650 SEM. In order to determine the phase compositions, chemical maps and quantitative analyses were made using an energy dispersive spectrometer and a silicon drift detector. The standards used for Fe, C, S and O were iron Fe, iron sulfide FeS, iron carbide Fe3C and alumina Al2O3, respectively. Results: X-ray images and diffraction spectra recorded during the experiments show that melting occurs below 900°C from 4.5 to 24.5 GPa (Fig.2). Melt appears either interstitially or as large pools (4.5 and 13.5 GPa). In most cases, it has a eutectic texture with rounded darker features that probably formed during temperature quench (Fig.3). Melt compositions are FeS-rich with small C (and accessorily O) contents. Because of the low temperature, no immiscible FeCrich melt was observed but iron carbides. However, “drops” of FeO-rich material (with small contents of C and S) are present in most experiments, suggesting that immiscible FeO-rich melt  might be present. The low FeO melting temperature could be induced by the presence of S and/or C [13]. Alternatively, the FeO “drops” may have formed during temperature quench.

Discussion: TE from our experiments is concordant with the presence of melt in [8] experiments on the Fe-S-C system, but is much lower than TE obtained by [9] (Fig.2). One explanation would be the presence of an immiscibility domain creating a hill on the liquidus curve of the Fe-S-C phase diagram, as found by [8]. However, the phase assemblage in our samples is similar to that in [9], implying that the concerned eutectic points are similar. Another possibility might be an overestimation of TE by [9] because of the quench textures. The decrease of TE observed at 14 GPa in the FeFeS system does not appear in our Fe-S-C experiments. Nevertheless, the solidi coincide between 10 and 14 GPa. The presence of carbon induces a eutectic plateau, i.e., pressure has little or no influence on TE. Implications for Mercury’s core: If Mercury’s core contains C in addition to S, its melting temperature might be lower, influencing its formation and evolution processes. The iron “snow” process, evoked to explain the origin of the Mercury’s magnetic field, might be modified. However, the small negative to possibly zero slope of the eutectic melting temperatures with increasing pressure suggest that, even in the presence of C in addition to S, iron may precipitate at shallow levels in planetary cores such as Mercury.
