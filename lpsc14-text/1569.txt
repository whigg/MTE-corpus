Introduction:  Ground temperature measurements and thermal models have been used extensively to infer physical properties of the Martian surface such as effective mean particle size [1], rock abundance [2], the presence of lateral or vertical het- erogeneity [e.g., 3], degree of induration or cementation [4], etc.  Knowledge of these physical properties is valuable for interpreting Mars' geologic history at a variety of spatial scales from local to global, as well as providing important insight into the safety and trafficability of candidate landing sites [5, 6].  The Ground Temperature Sensor (GTS) of the Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS) on- board the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity provides the first in situ observations of ground temperature throughout the diurnal cycle [7]. These measurements enable us to: 1) compare orbital and in situ temperature observations, 2) compare thermal inertias derived from single time-of-day measurements to those derived from a full diurnal temperature cycle, and 3) validate interpretations of thermophysical data with visual observations of local terrain. In this presentation, we show comparisons of GTSmeasured temperatures and derived thermal inertias through sol 360 with simultaneously-acquired data obtained from the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) onboard the Mars Odyssey orbiter [8].   Data and Methods: We use measured ground temperature data from the MSL rover and Mars Odyssey orbiter to derive thermal inertia from a thermophysical model. We compare trends in the derived inertias with visible physical properties of the surface.  Below, we describe the instruments/data and thermal model used in this study. Coordinated observations through sol 414 are listed in Table 1. REMS GTS. The GTS is a rover mast-mounted thermopile that measures the integrated ~8-14 µm brightness temperature (Tsurf) over a ~100 m2 area - the majority of the signal comes from the 0.5 - 2.0 m of the ground nearest the Curiosity rover. Nominal measurements are acquired at a rate of 1 Hz for ~5 minutes each hour although extended (~1 hr) sessions were acquired in most instances shown here to coordinate with THEMIS overflights of MSL's location in Gale. Mars Odyssey THEMIS. THEMIS is an orbiting thermal IR camera with 100 m/pixel sampling. Tsurf is derived from the 12.57 µm channel, which is ~1-µm wide. The local time of Odyssey's orbit varies, ranging from ~04:00/16:00 LMST to ~04:40/16:40 LMST in the data shown here. Mastcam. A pair of rover mast-mounted cameras acquire "clast survey" images within a subsection of the GTS footprint, which enables direct correlation of thermal data with visible information about particle size distribution, induration, etc. Thermal model. We use the KRC thermal model [9] to recover thermal inertia from GTS-measured Tsurf. Season, hour, elevation, latitude, opacity, and local mscale slope and azimuth are set to known values for each location at the time of temperature observations.  Albedo and thermal inertia are allowed to vary, consistent with prior studies [10, 11]. Results: Figure 1 shows surface temperatures measured by GTS and THEMIS at MSL's location for sols 30 - 352. The correlation is quite good, and deviations from a perfect fit are expected at some level based on the instruments' spatial resolution differences. Local imaging (e.g., clast survey images, see below) show that, not surprisingly, the relatively small GTS field of view can be heavily biased by smallscale, local thermophysical features. Additional measurements over time and along the rover's traverse will allow us to refine this trend.  Figure 1. Comparison of simultaneously-measured surface temperatures (Tsurf) through sol 360. Error bars are on the order of the symbol size.  Thermal inertias derived from GTS data are shown in comparison to THEMIS-derived orbital values in Figure 2. THEMIS thermal inertias appear to be somewhat higher than their GTS counterparts overall.  1569.pdf

However, much of this difference can be attributed to the difference in the spatial resolution of the instruments. Data representing the informally-named Rocknest sand shadow and Glenelg/Yellowknife Bay locations are shown with different symbols because the GTS viewed surfaces that are highly unlikely to be representative of those included in the much larger THEMIS pixel. Excluding those locations, the correspondence is improved substantially. Clast survey imaging (Figure 3), particularly when paired with local Navcam mosaics (Figure 4), demonstrates what can be dramatic differences in what is included in the two instruments' areas of observation.

Ongoing work:  The data shown here are examples of the comparisons that can be made between orbital and in situ observations of the same location at the same time. More data are needed to draw solid conclusions about the similarities and differences between the data sets and other phenomena that may affect such comparisons.  References: [1] Fenton, L. K. et al.
