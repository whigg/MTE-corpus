Introduction: Changes in ultraviolet (UV) reflectance of lunar materials due to exposure to space weathering are thought to be relatively rapid [e.g., 1]. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) provides the first global dataset to assess differences in UV (321 nm and 360 nm) reflectance across the Moon’s surface. Here we present an investigation of space weathering effects at UV wavelengths, focusing on variability in the lunar highlands that is consistent with differences in the degree of shock experienced by local materials during cratering events. Data:  We investigate a color mosaic (±60° latitude; 400 m/pixel) from the LROC Wide Angle Camera (WAC). The WAC is a seven-band (321, 360, 415, 566, 604, 643 and 689 nm) push-frame imager, and acquires near-global coverage each month [2]. The seven-band mosaic is the product of ~20 months of WAC observations; each pixel is a median of all observations at that location (average n per pixel is 84) after the application of an empirical photometric correction derived from the same dataset [3]. LROC WAC results are considered in the context of laboratory samples [4–10], and compared with near-infrared data from the Moon Mineralogy Mapper [11]. Results: Silicate minerals typically have a steep spectral slope at wavelengths below ~450 nm due to strong absorptions shortward of 300 nm [4]. Spectra of laboratory samples suggest that space weathering decreases this slope [1]; LROC WAC observations of fresh craters generally confirm these results, with an important exception. Changes in UV slope are explored with a ratio of 321/415 nm, where a low value is consistent with a steeper slope. Low ratio values are observed in association with the ejecta and rays of Copernican craters throughout the mare. This is also true for swirls in iron-rich regions, which show spectral signatures consistent with the exposure of fresh basalt and UV ratios lower than most neighboring fresh craters, suggesting they have experienced lower levels of space weathering.  However, in the highlands, the picture is more complicated. Instead of a simple relationship between maturity and 321/415 nm ratio as seen in the mare, fresh ejecta at highland craters has ratio values both lower (within ~one crater radius) and higher (distal ejecta and rays) than for mature soils (Fig. 1). Laboratory spectra of powdered lunar rocks (no space weathering) and soils of varying degrees of space weathering (as measured by IS/FeO [12]) show that for materials with less than ~5 wt% FeO, little change is observed in the 321/415 nm ratio except for an increase at the lowest levels of maturity (IS/FeO <~ 20).  Fig. 1. Color composite of a portion of the lunar highlands. Reflectance at 415 nm is shown in red, 321/415 nm ratio is in green, and the 321/360 nm ratio is in blue. Fresh crystalline highlands material is yellow (high 321/415 nm, low 321/360 nm, high albedo relative to mature highlands); and shocked or melted materials is red or pink (low 321/415 nm ratio, high albedo). Giordano Bruno (GB), Necho (N), and Jackson (J) craters are labeled. 2000.pdf

What is the cause of the low 321/415 nm ratios near highland crater rims? The answer may lie in differing amounts of shock experienced by the materials. Plagioclase-rich compositions are particularly affected by shock because relatively modest shock pressures (~25 GPa) result in the solid-state transformation of plagioclase to a diaplectic glass, maskelynite [13]. A comparison of spectra of crystalline plagioclase, maskelynite, and low-iron synthetic glass (Fig. 2A) indicates there are large differences in UV reflectance for shocked or melted materials. A spectrum of an impact melt-rich region on the rim of Giordano Bruno crater [14] shares the break in slope at 415 nm (Fig. 2B) observed for the glass and maskelynite spectra, whereas a portion of a ray extending to the northwest has a break in slope at 360 nm (Fig. 2B), similar to the crystalline samples. These relationships are observed at all of the fresh highland craters that we examined, and within distal rays typically the only regions indicative of higher proportions of glass or melt (higher levels of shock) are associated with secondary craters. A color composite (Fig. 1) helps capture these differences and pinpoint the locations of fresh crystalline (yellow) and shocked materials (red to pink) in the highlands.  We compared our results to those from nearinfrared data, in regions where crystalline plagioclase has been identified from the presence of an absorption feature near 1250 nm [11]. Portions of two massifs in the Inner Rook Mountains of Orientale with this absorption feature were initially selected. Each region also exhibited the characteristic downturn at 360 nm of crystalline plagioclase (Fig. 2A), whereas nearby massifs that lacked the 1250-nm absorption showed strong downturns at 415 nm. Discussion and Conclusions: UV observations for the maria are consistent with a steep spectral slope (<450 nm) that rapidly shallows with exposure to space weathering. Comparisons with swirls (magnetically shielded from the solar wind [e.g., 15]), suggest the solar wind is the dominant agent of space weathering. In the highlands, the effects of shock on UV reflectance are important for fresh craters. Maskelynite and glass-rich compositions are identifiable by their low 321/415 nm ratio. The combined characteristics of a high 321/415 nm ratio and low 321/360 nm ratio may allow for the ready identification of fresh exposures of crystalline plagioclase-rich material in the highlands (Fig. 1). The stronger UV downturn at a slightly longer wavelength for maskelynite and glass (Fig. 2A) is likely the result of broadening of the plagioclase UV absorption due to vitrification, so that more of its wing is observable at WAC wavelengths. Our initial comparisons with near-infrared data suggest that combining information from UV absorption, 1250-nm absorption, and albedo may prove fruitful for further distinguishing among materials with different levels of shock or melting, especially if informed by comparisons with laboratory studies [e.g., 16]. The distribution of shocked and crystalline materials elucidates the crater formation and ejecta emplacement processes. The exposure of more crystalline material only within distal ejecta and rays suggests that late-stage emplacement of ejecta with lower degrees of shock occurs only at greater distances or that in these regions a large component of local fresh soil is exposed by ejecta gardening. This second scenario is consistent with ballistic sedimentation models [e.g., 17,18] and observations of crater rays [19,20] that suggest a substantial contribution of local material to rays.
