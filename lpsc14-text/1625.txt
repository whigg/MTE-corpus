Introduction: On 14 December 2013, China's Chang'e 3 made the first soft landing on the Moon since the Russian Luna 24 lander in 1976. On 24 December 2013, images obtained by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) captured the landing site, which is located at 44.12°N, 340.49°E in Mare Imbrium [1,2]. The highest resolution images were taken on 25 December when LRO was approximately 150 km above the surface [2]. These images show the lander and the Yutu rover, as well as an area of increased reflectance around the lander (Fig. 1). In this abstract we present reflectance profiles derived from the NAC images to characterize the increase in reflectance of the area around the lander as well as the size of the affected area. LRO also imaged the area prior to the landing [2], and we compare the reflectance of the exact area of the landing before and after. Our motivation is to investigate the change in physical properties at the landing site, presumably related to the impingement of rocket exhaust from the lander, which can then be compared to the effects observed with NAC images at the landing sites of Apollo, Luna, and Surveyor spacecraft. Methods: The reflectance changes within the area of the landing site were quantified using NAC images obtained over a range of illumination conditions [2]. Images were processed using the USGS's Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers (ISIS) [3]. Calibrated NAC images provide reflectance (I/F) measurements from which we quantify the reflectance changes.  Because the illumination conditions were different for the before and after images, we use a Hapke photometric function to fit the reflectance data. We first normalized to the Lommel-Seeliger function (IoF/LS) to reduce the effects of different illumination geometries [4,5]. We then normalized the reflectance to a 45° phase angle for comparison of the before and after images, and to compare with reflectance changes at the Apollo, Luna, and Surveyor landing sites. We use ISIS tools to measure the spatial extent of the area of increased reflectance on a map-projected image. Results: Photometry: Comparing before and after images of the Chang'e 3 landing site with similar illumination conditions (Fig. 1) provides information about reflectance changes. To compare, we construct profiles across the area of the landing site before and after landing (Fig. 2), and we determine the percent change in reflectance.  Figure 2 shows the reflectance profiles taken across the landing site. The shape of the profiles indicates that reflectance is highest in the area of increased reflectance and decreases and levels off in the surrounding undisturbed areas. The shape of the profiles are consistent with trends observed at the Apollo, Luna, and Surveyor landing sites [6]. At the Apollo sites, an area Fig. 1: Images of the Change'3 landing site, before (left; NAC image M181302794L) and after (right; NAC image M1142582775R) landing.

of lower reflectance exists that extends from beneath the lander up to a few meters out from the lander. This region is too small to be resolved at the Luna and Surveyor sites because of the small lander size, and we have also not been able to detect it at the Chang'e 3 landing site. Three profiles were taken across the area of increased reflectance at the landing site - one across the northernmost tip (a-a'), one across the center (b-b'), and one ~N-S that also crosses the lander (c-c'). We also extracted the c-c' profile across the site before landing for comparison. The effects of local, smallscale topography and crater walls appear in the profiles (see b-b') as noise and in two cases, in b-b' and c-c', as a prominent dip and rise, as indicated on the plots. Profiles are used to extract average reflectance values within the area of increased reflectance, as well as in the local background areas.  The reflectance (IoF/LS) within the area of increased reflectance after Chang'e 3 landed, taken from profile a-a', is ~0.050, but prior to landing the reflectance in the same area was ~0.040. This corresponds to a 25% increase in reflectance after landing. However, the images used for the profiles in  Fig. 2 have phase angles of 82° (before) and 92° (after), so extrapolating the Chang'e 3 reflectance data to 45° phase angle to compare with other landing sites gives a 14% increase in reflectance. Spatial extent of the area of increased reflectance: We used ISIS Qview to measure the diameter of the area of increased reflectance, which is approximately elliptical in shape. These measurements give a ~52 x 47 m estimate for the area of increased reflectance, consistent with the profiles in Fig. 2, which corresponds to an elliptical area of ~1900 m2. This preliminary estimate will be updated as LRO obtains additional images of the landing site at lower, more favorable incidence angles.  Discussion:  Even though the initial NAC images of the Chang'e 3 landing site were taken at high incidence, they clearly show an area of increased reflectance around the lander. We interpret the area of increased reflectance as the region disturbed by the interaction of rocket exhaust from the lander with regolith at the landing site [6,7]. The increase of reflectance that we have measured is 25% at phase angles of 82° and 92° and, using our photometric model, is 14% at a phase angle of 45°. This increase actually compares favorably with the average increase in reflectance for other landing sites, which were found to be ~16% for Apollo, ~12% for Luna, and ~15% for Surveyor when normalized to 45° phase angle [6]. This preliminary result would indicate that the reflectance changes are approximately the same across all landing sites, including the Chang'e 3 site. The similarities in the magnitude of increased reflectance between the Chang'e 3 landing site and the Surveyor, Apollo, and Luna landing sites suggests that lunar soil reflectance changes caused by interaction with rocket exhaust are not significantly altered over a period on the order of decades.
