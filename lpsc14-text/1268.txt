Transient Atmospheres on Charon and Water-Ice Covered KBOs Resulting from Comet Impacts.  S.

However, impacts from both Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud comets must from time to time import N2, CH4, and other cometary super-volatiles that can create temporary atmospheres around Charon. In this report we will estimate the frequency of such cometary impacts on Charon and the imported mass of super-volatiles from each such impact. We will then examine the characteristics of such transient atmospheric events, including their column densities, mean molecular weights, scale heights, and loss timescales. We will also report on the detectability of such a transient atmosphere by New Horizons, and discuss the generalized case of cometary impact-created transient atmospheres on other satellites of Pluto and water-ice covered KBOs across the Kuiper Belt.       Findings:  We will show that Charon suffered thousands of impacts by km-class diameter comets, and that these impacts import significant volatile inventories of CO, N2, CH4, and perhaps Ar—all of which can create tenuous atmospheres at Charon. We also find that such atmospheres are then rapidly lost due to thermal and photoionization effects. However, we also find that such atmospheres—if recently created—are detectable by the solar occultation experiment planned to be conducted by the Alice ultraviolet spectrograph aboard New Horizons on 14 July 2015. Indeed, such impact-generated atmospheres can in many cases even be detected many e-folding loss timescales after an impact, yielding an improbable but not impossible that such a detection will be made. We will discuss a molecular hop-till-you-escape loss mechanism and compare its predicted time scale to that of Jeans escape.      Regardless of whether New Horizons detects an atmosphere around Charon in 2015, we conclude that it seems inevitable that Charon has possessed tenuous, transient atmospheres on thousands of occasions from km-class comet impact (and, including still smaller impactors, perhaps even millions of occasions) over the age of the solar system.      Similar impact statistics and atmospheric persistence timescales for other Charon size-class KBOs negate the static view of Schaller & Brown [4] of such bodies either having or not having surface volatiles and atmospheres in the current epoch. More realistically, adopt a paradigm of a preferred non-atmospheric state in Charon and similarly-sized KBOs but with numerous transitions to a short-lived atmospheric states. Such a paradigm can be visualized as hopping back and forth from left [a devolatilized state] to right [a volatilized state] in Figure 1 of [4], like jumping beans on a plate.
