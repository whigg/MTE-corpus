EVIDENCE FOR MAGMA OCEAN SOLIDIFICATION AT 4.36 Ga FROM 142Nd-143Nd VARIATION IN MARE BASALTS.  A. M. Gaffney1 and L. E. Borg1, 1Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA 94550; gaffney1@llnl.gov.  Introduction:  The age of the Moon and the timing of lunar magma ocean solidification remain elusive, despite four decades of study. Ages determined for individual samples thought to be the oldest crustal rocks yield a wide range that is not entirely consistent with the magma ocean model of lunar differentiation. Specifically, ages of the ferroan anorthosites (FANs), argued to be primary crystallization products of the magma ocean, range from 4.29 to 4.53 Ga [e.g., 1, 2] and overlap ages of the Mg-suite samples. However, the Mg-suite is thought to represent the first pulse of magmatism after magma ocean solidification, and therefore should post-date FAN formation. These seemingly inconsistent ages may in part result from impact metamorphism, which can disturb the isotope systematics of individual rocks.  An alternative approach to determining the age of magma ocean solidification is to establish model ages for geochemical reservoirs that formed during magma ocean crystallization. One such reservoir comprises mafic cumulates that crystallized from the magma ocean and which, upon subsequent melting, generated the mare basalts. The combined 142Nd-143Nd isotopic variation in mare basalts can be used to establish a model formation age of the mare basalt source. Several studies have taken this approach [3-6], but few analyses utilized the more accurate multi-dynamic mass spectrometry method. Additionally, corrections to 142Nd/144Nd ratios due to neutron fluence effects are commonly larger than the analytical uncertainty. Here we present new 142Nd/144Nd results for 16 mare basalts that show minimal neutron fluence effects and represent the compositional range of mare basalt sources.  Methods: We have completed 142Nd-143Nd147Sm/144Nd measurements on 16 mare basalts. These samples were analyzed previously for Hf and Sm isotopic compositions [7]. After complete digestion, sample solutions were split. One half was spiked with a mixed 149Sm-150Nd tracer for Sm and Nd concentration analysis and Hf isotopic composition analysis. The other was spiked with a mixed 176Lu-180Hf tracer for Lu and Hf concentration analysis and Sm and Nd isotopic composition analysis. Analytical procedures are described in [8, 9]. Neodymium isotopic compositions were measured on the ThermoElectron Triton TIMS at LLNL using a multi-dynamic analysis routine. It has been recognized that neutron irradiation of the lunar surface modifies the isotopic composition of some elements (e.g., Sm, Gd, Nd, Hf) in some lunar samples. We previously developed a model that uses the measured stable Hf and Sm isotopic compositions to determine the thermal and epithermal neutron fluence that affected a particular sample [7]. These modeled fluences are then used to calculate a correction to the measured 142Nd/144Nd and 143Nd/144Nd values of the samples. The samples analyzed in this study were selected because, with a few exceptions, they were determined to have low neutron fluence histories based on previously measured ε149Sm values [7]. Therefore, for most of the samples, the correction to 142Nd/144Nd is less than 4 ppm. The Nd isotopic composition of four samples required substantial corrections. Nevertheless, the corrected data appear to be consistent with the uncorrected or minimally corrected Nd isotopic data (Fig. 1). The calculated corrections to 142Nd/144Nd show a strong inverse correlation with measured ε149Sm, and this correlation is used to apply a correction to measured 142Nd/144Nd results published by other groups (Fig. 2).  Figure 1. Comparison of 142Nd/144Nd results as measured (gray symbols), to results corrected for the effects of neutron capture on 142Nd/144Nd and 143Nd/144Nd. 142Nd/144Nd reported as ppm deviation from measured standard value of 1.141839. Source 147Sm/144Nd calculation discussed in text. Results and Discussion: The combined 142Nd143Nd systematics can be used to determine a model formation age for the mare basalt sources. From the initial 143Nd/144Nd determined for each sample, the 147Sm/144Nd of the source is calculated assuming a two-stage evolutionary history. This model assumes 142Nd and 143Nd ingrowth in a reservoir of chondritic composition, from the time of solar system formation until the time of lunar differentiation and formation of the mare basalt sources. The age of the source is calculated iteratively from the slope a linear regression of the data. In the final iteration, the age of source formation used to calculate the 147Sm/144Nd of the source converges with the age determined from the slope of 1449.pdf

the isochron. Assuming a more complicated history prior to formation of the mare basalt source [e.g., 5], has little effect on the calculated source age, increasing it by less than 10 My. Because the age is calculated directly from the slope of a line regressed through the data, the 142Nd/144Nd of the bulk Moon is not defined in the calculation. Instead, the age is based in the assumption that 142Nd and 143Nd reflect a common history prior to the formation of the basalt sources. From the combined 142Nd-143Nd systematics of the mare basalts, we calculate a model age for formation of the mare basalt sources of 4355 +31/-39 Ma.   Figure 2. Whole rock 146Sm-142Nd isochron of mare basalts (16 analyses from this study and 6 published multi-dynamic analyses [5, 6]) yield a model age for mare basalt source formation of 4355 +31/-39 Ma. Calculation uses 146Sm t1/2 = 103 Ma and initial 146Sm/144Nd of 0.00828 [16]. Using the parameters of [17] gives an age of 4414 +20/-26 Ma. One FAN [9] and 3 KREEP-rich samples [5, 6] are shown for reference, but are not included in the age calculation. The co-linearity of KREEP-rich samples with mare basalts (Fig. 2) presents the possibility that 142Nd/144Nd of the mare basalts may simply represent mixing of urKREEP with a common mare basalt source component. In this case, urKREEP would control the incompatible element isotopic characteristics of these samples and the age would not necessarily record lunar cumulate formation. However, the Hf isotopic data are not consistent with this interpretation. The εHf vs. εNd143 values of the mare basalts define two distinct trends, requiring incompatible trace element heterogeneity in the mare basalt sources that is preserved [8, 10]. Although some amount of mixing with urKREEP or another incompatible element enriched component is required [e.g., 11], these data clearly show that two distinct LREE-depleted sources are present. Although these sources are petrologically and geochemically distinct, the basalts derived from them define a common model formation age. The age calculated here is in excellent agreement with 142Nd model ages determined in earlier studies [36]. The reproducibility of this age with different sets of samples and independent studies confirms that this is a reliable estimate of the formation age for mare basalt sources. Furthermore, this age is derived from samples from four Apollo landing sites and one meteorite launch site, and so dates an event with wide geographic representation. This age is concordant with urKREEP model ages determined using the Lu-Hf and 147Sm-143Nd systems (4353 ± 37 and 4389 ± 45, respectively; Fig. 3) that are thought to represent the age of final magma ocean solidification. Some of the most precisely-dated FANs also have ages that are concordant with these model ages [9, 12]. Although a few lunar samples yield ages that are not consistent with a young age for magma ocean crystallization [13-15], the complementary geochemical characteristics of the mare basalt sources, urKREEP and the FANs, together with their concordant formation ages, strongly indicates that a widespread magmatic event occurred on the Moon at ca. 4.36 Ga, most plausibly attributed to solidification of a magma ocean.
