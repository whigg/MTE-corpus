ORIGIN OF MARTIAN KIESERIT.  K. Connor and Alian Wang, Dept of Earth and Planetary Sciences and McDonnell Center for the Space Sciences, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, 63130, USA (alianw@levee.wustl.edu).  Kieserite on Mars:  Kieserite is one of the two (another is polyhydrated sulfate) most commonly seen and widely spread hydrous sulfates observed at the surface of Mars, identified by orbital remote sensing, using vis-NIR spectroscopic technique (OMEGA and CRISM instruments on ESA’ Mars Express and NASA’s MRO missions). Due to its distinct reflectance double band in 1.95 & 2.07 µm, kieserite was definitively identified, especially on its hydration degree, as monohydrate MgSO4.H2O [1]. However, there are two very different schools of thoughts on the origin of these martian kieserite, expecially when interpretating the interbedded layers of kieserite and polyhydrated sulfate,  observed ar several locations on Mars [2, 3].  a. Kieserite from dehydration: laboratory experimental investigation on the thermodynamic properties of hydrous Mg-sulfates have the following foundings: 1) Kieserite can only directly precipitate at T ≥69°C from Mg-SO4-H2O solution [4, 5]; 2) Kieserite cannot be formed from direct dehydration of pure Mg-sulfates, epsomite and hexahydrite,  at T ≤ 50˚C [6, 7, 8] 3) However, kieserite can be formed by dehydrations at T≤ 50°C through two pathways: (a) from epsomite (MgSO4.7H2O) mixed with hydrous Ca-, Fesulfates, and Fe-oxides and Fe–hydroxides, (b) from amorphous Mg-sulfates, e.g., MgSO4.23H2O [8]; The current understanding of  Mars’ historical surface temperature is generally <50°C except within very localized hydrothermal zones. Therefore above experimental findings suggest that the most observed martian kieserite should be the dehydration products from epsomite (or hexahydrite depending on the T of precipitation) which was precipitated together with (Ca, Fe)sulfates and Fe-oxides/hydroxides.  b. Kieserite directly precipited from brines at T < 50°C: Another school of thought [9] based on geochemical modeling suggests when Mg-sulfates precipitate from a brine with high ionic strength,  other salts, especially chlorides and chloride-sulfate (kainite KClMgSO4. 3H2O, carnallite KMgCl3.6H2O, bischofite MgCl2. 6H2O) would also precipitate. The low H2O activity environment provided by those salts would facilitate the precipitation of kieserite, at temperature below 69°C. This concept of low-T kieserite precipitation has been used to interpret the observed interbeded kieserite-polyhydrated sulfates on Mars [3]. Experimental evaluation: we conducted two sets of precipitation experiments at temperature T=21°C and 5°C to evaluate the second model-deriven concept.  Brine samples: We made five mixtures of epspmite MgSO4.7H2O and bischofite MgCl2.6H2O, with molar ratios of 1:9, 3:7, 5:5, 7:3, and 9:1. These mixtures are dissolved in small amounts of Millipore H2O to build brines in Mg-SO4-Cl-H2O system, with extremely high ionic strength. Thus they are very good simulations for over-saturated brines right before the happening of salt precipitation on Mars.  Evaporation and precipitation: Two open Petri Dishes were used for each brine, containing small quantities of brines that barely cover the bottom.  One set of five brines was maintained at the counter-top of a laboratory (21±1˚C, varyable RH). Another set was maintained in a refrigerator (5±1˚C, varyable RH). In addition,  we placed the two Petri Dishes that contain the brine of bischofite:epsomite=9:1 (Cl:SO3=18:1), the highest Clconcentration, into an abnormally low RH environment in a sealed dessiccator buffered by saturated LiCl-H2O solution  (RH=11.3% at 21˚C and at 5˚C) (Fig.1).These experiments lasted for nearly three months. In situ Measurements: Contineous Laser Raman Spectroscopic (LRS) measurements were made directly on the precipitated crystalline materials from the second day after the experiments started, until the full solidifications of all brine samples were reached. Figure 2 shows the standard LRS spectra of bischofite and Mg-sulfates with hydration degree from zero to 11 H2O per MgSO4 molecule. These Mg-sulfates and bischofite all have finger-print LRS spectra,which facilitate the definitive identification of them (chemistry & hydration degrees) in mixtures. The LRS measurement was made by directly targeting a focused 532 nm laser beam (~ 9 mW) onto a salt grain. Each spectrum was recorded in 10 second. Previous experimental study [6] have demonstrated that no change in the hydration degree of Mg-sulfates would happen in such short measurement time. For the early products of evaporations, 10 spots per sample were checked by LRS each time. For final products, 2750.pdf

automatic and manual LRS scan via 100 spots per sample were made.  No kieserite observed in low-T precipitations: Table 1 shows the hydration degrees of final Mgsulfates from all ten samples.  Our experiments simulate the precipitation of Mg-sulfates from oversaturated Mg-SO4-Cl-H2O brine at Mars relevant low temperatures (21˚C and 5˚C).  The extremely low water activities in these experiments were controlled by (a) a salt-brine system with saturated Mg-SO4-Cl-H2O solution and co-precipitated bischofite MgCl2.6H2O salt, as suggested by geochemical modeling [9]; (b) an atmospheric enviroment buffered by LiCl-H2O saturated solution (11% RH at 21˚C, xx% RH at 5˚C, [10]). Yet, kieserite was not observed in any of these experiments.  Furthermore, we have observed in all these experiments, bischofite precipitated in much late stage (solubility of MgSO4 at 25C is 36 g/100gH2O, MgCl2 is 56 g/100gH2O, [11]). It means during Mg-sulfates precipitation, the local RH was controlled by MgCl2-H2O saturated solution, which has be experimentally determined to be 33% RH at 21°C and 33.6%RH at 5°C [10].  Origin of martian kieserite: we have not found experimental evidence for the direct precipitation of kieserite at T<50˚C from the brines with very high Clconcentration as geochemical model suggested.  Although we cannot exclude kieserite formation from brines with even higher Cl-concentration (e.g., Cl:SO3 ~ 100:1, 1000:1, 10000:1), giving the huge amount of kieserite found at Mars surface by orbital remote sensing and the almost constent Cl:SO3 ratio ( ~1:10) found in Mars’ rocks and soils by landed missions, it seems that direct precipitation at low-T is highly unlike to be the origin of martian kieserite.  Our previous and current experimental investigations support the low-T dehydration of epsomite or hexahydrite (and of starkeiyite when co-existing with Ca, Fe-sulfates) to be the origin of martian kieserite.  We believe the formation of interbedded layers of kieserite and polyhydrated sulfate should be induced by the episodic changes of brine chemistry, which would generate two type of precipitates: (1) almost pure epsomite (or hexahydrite depending on T), and (2) epsomite mixed with other sulfates and chlorides. When dehydration started in later time at T < 50˚C, the one from almost pure epsomite would stop after forming starkeyite MgSO4.4H2O [6, 7], that would be seen by orbital remote sensing as polyhydrated sulfates; while the dehydration of epsomite mixtures (with other sulfates and chloride)  proceeded further to generate kieserite, as identified by orbital remote sensing.   Giving the difference in dehydration rates of starkeyite and rozenite FeSO4.4H2O, experimentally determined by another set of experiments [12], we anticipate the polyhydrated sulfates to be mainly starkeyite.
