Introduction:  The Athabasca Valles Lava was emplaced as a turbulent flood within the last 50 million years, making it the youngest known major volcanic event on Mars.  The lava was fed by the Cerberus Fossae, coursed through Athabasca Valles, overfilled Cerberus Palus, and finally halted 1400 km from source.  The peak discharge was of order 107 m3/s and the eruption duration was only several weeks [1].   One of the most interesting remaining questions related to this remarkable eruption is “Could this catastrophic flood of lava erode the substrate?”  A theoretical investigation of thermal erosion by this flow suggests that, because of the short eruption duration, only a few meters of material might have been removed by melting of the substrate [2].   Theoretical Considerations:  However, mechanical erosion could plausibly be more effective [1,2].  As noted in [1], mechanical erosion by aqueous flows is often considered to be proportional to “stream power” or the basal shear stress created by the flow.  The stream power for aqueous and lava floods filling Athabasca Valles would be nearly identical.  Mechanical erosion by lava is also aided by the relatively small density contrast between rock and lava, making transport in suspension easier.  However, a turbulent lava flow is not expected to have the intense eddies of a large aqueous flood, so current theory is insufficient to confidently conclude that there was significant mechanical erosion by lava in Athabasca Valles [1].   A simple thermal balance places rough but useful constraints on the amount of cold rock that could be entrained into a lava flow.  Rock is of order 1000 K colder than the lava and the lava will freeze if cooled ~100 K, so the entrained rock should be no more than 10% of the erupted volume.  Given the huge distance the lava continued past Athabasca Valles, an order of magnitude less entrainment is considered more realistic.  Since the volume of the flow is 5000-7500 km3 [1], this corresponds to on order of ~100-1000 km3 of erosion.  Athabasca Valles is roughly 300 km x 30 km in area (~10,000 km2), so a maximum of <100 m, and more realistically ~10 m, average downcutting is allowed.  Non-uniform erosion is likely, so some tens of meters of local downcutting is thermally plausible.   Data: This scale of erosion would produce features resolvable in images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter CTX and HiRISE cameras.  The primary data we utilize are (a) the 1 m/post HiRISE DEM produced by the USGS from images PSP_002661_1895 and PSP_003294_1895 with corresponding 25 cm/pixel orthorectified images and (b) the 100 m/post CTX DEM (Fig. 1) produced by the USGS from images P01_001540_1889, P01_001606_1897, P03_002226_ 1895, P03_002371_1888, P19_008344_1894, and P20_008845_1894 with corresponding 6 m/pixel orthorectified images.

Vertical Channel Incision:  Forming the entire Athabasca Valles channel system requires removing more material than can be comfortably carried by the Athabasca Valles Lava.  However, the DEMs clearly show a smaller, 5-10 km wide and 10-25 m deep, inner channel (purple in Fig. 1).  The corresponding ~10-100 km3 could easily have been carried away by the lava and is located where stream power was highest [3].   The landforms on the floor of Athabasca Valles are also consistent with (but not diagnostic of) mechanical erosion by lava.  For example, the area is strewn with sub-rounded, lava-coated boulders several meters in diameter, often arranged in chains parallel to the flow direction.  These appear similar to “lava balls” that can be stranded on the levees of lava flows after a surge produces overbank deposits [5].  Indeed, some of these chains of boulders are found arrayed atop ledges that marked the margins of the lava as its level dropped in stages.  However, others are found on the channel floor 1683.pdf

away from likely flow margins (Fig. 2).  This suggests that large boulders were being transported both on top of, and within, the lava flow.  This is what would be expected in a mechanically eroding lava flow.  However, the blocks may be pieces of lava crust rather than of the substrate.   Figure 2.  HiRISE image PSP_002661_1985 of boulders on the floor of Athabasca Valles.   Mechanical erosion by lava also provides a new hypothesis for the formation of dune-like features previously described by [6].  The HiRISE data shows that the “dunes” transition into coherent lava plateaus and are disrupted by phreatovolcanic constructs (Fig. 3).  We suggest that these are volcanic landforms and speculate that they consist of a thin lava crust draped over hummocks of solid material that was being transported within the lava flow.  This “sediment” might be boulders carried as bedload or, alternatively, more coherent slabs dragged along the base of the flow.   Scarp Formation by Lateral Erosion?  Based on MOLA gridded topography, [7] suggested that erosional scarps were found above the level of the lava flow, which argues against erosion by lava.  The CTX DEM shows that the elevation of the lobate lava flow margins marking the high lava stand on the sides of Athabasca Valles are actually consistently close to the elevation of the highest erosional scarps found on the streamlined “islands” within the channel.   However, erosion by lava is not expected to be effective where only a thin flow overtopped high topography in the channel.  Furthermore, the convoluted trace of some of the erosional scarps (Fig. 3) is also unusual for mechanical erosion (whatever the fluid).  We suggest that undermining of scarps may be assisted by the explosive venting of steam at the margins of the lava flow.  In fact, some of the scarps in Athabasca Valles are lined with phreatovolcanic constructs that have been torn in half because they formed along the shear zone between the stationary and moving lava crust [8].  Numerical studies have shown that such steam mobility is likely an essential ingredient in the formation of concentrations of phreatovolcanic constructs in and around Athabasca Valles atop buried craters and other topographic highs in the substrate [9].   Groundwater will also move toward scarps and facilitate enhanced explosive activity there [8].  However, unlike steam, groundwater will also move toward fissures in the substrate.  The lack of phreatovolcanism associated with the buried fracture in the left half of Fig. 3 suggests that movement of groundwater is not controlling the phreatovolcanism in Athabasca Valles.   Figure 3.  Section of HiRISE image PSP_002661_1985 colorized with topography.   Conclusion:  We find multiple lines of evidence consistent with at least modest mechanical erosion by lava in Athabasca Valles.  However, since there are no established criteria for distinguishing channels carved by lava versus other fluids, we cannot provide definitive proof of such erosion.  Comparison to other localities with probable erosion by lava is the most promising next step toward answering this question.   References: [1] Jaeger, W. L. et al. (2010) Icarus, 205, 230-243.
