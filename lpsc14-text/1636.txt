ON THE LOWER RADIUS LIMIT OF EXOPLANETS. A. Lorenzo1, S. J. Desch1 andS.-H. Shim1, 1School of Earth and Space Exploration, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287.(steve.desch@asu.edu).Background:The pace of exoplanet discovery is accelerating, andthere are now many known transiting exoplanetsthat have been followed up with ground-based measurements, providing estimates of not only theirmasses but their radii. Among the densest of theseare: CoRoT-7b, with mass 8 ± 1.2M⊕ [1], radiusR = 1.58 ± 0.09R⊕ [2], and mean density ρ¯ =11±3.5 g cm−3 [1]; and Kepler-10b, with mass M =4.56+1.17−1.29M⊕, radius 1.416+0.033−0.036R⊕, and density8.8+2.1−2.9 g cm−3 [3]; These exoplanets are sometimescalled "chthonian" planets because their mean densities are approximately those of Earth's core without the overlying mantle, near the maximum densities thought possible for super-Earths.The bulk density can in fact be used to infer thecomposition of these planets, by comparing withpredicted mass-radius (M-R) relationships such asthose of [4,5]. Models that predict M-R relationstake into account the fact that planet-forming materials are compressible, and achieve densities inplanet interiors that are higher than those of theirpolymorphs at zero pressure. Considering possibleplanetary materials such as Fe (proxy for FeNi),MgSiO3 (proxy for the silicate mantle of a terrestrial planet, or H2O ice (to account for predictedwater worlds), Fe is found to yield the densest planets and smallest planetary radii. The expected radiiand mean densities of pure-Fe planets of mass Mpare: R = 0.63R⊕ and ρ¯ = 10.8 g cm−3 for Mp =0.5M⊕; R = 0.78R⊕ and ρ¯ = 11.8 g cm−3 for Mp =1.0M⊕; and R = 0.95R⊕ and ρ¯ = 13.1 g cm−3 forMp = 2.0M⊕ (based on calculations below, whichare consistent with [5]). As measurements improve,it will be possible to determine whether a denseexoplanet is pure Fe, or whether it contains lowerdensity components like rock.As an example, [6] considered how a pure Feplanet might be produced following a giant impact.If a planet differentiates into a core and silicatemantle, the mantle might be stripped by a giantimpact, exposing the bare core of the planet. Buttheir numerical simulations show that a single impact cannot generally strip the entire mantle: evenfor generous input parameters, a 1M⊕ planet canbe at most 85% Fe, and a 2M⊕ planet can be atmost 81% Fe. This puts a lower bound on exoplanetradii R as a function of their mass M , a curve thatlies above the curve for pure Fe in the R(M) diagram.If dense (chthonian) exoplanets cores originatein this way, they should resemble the Earth's core—which is distinctly not pure Fe. It is well knownthat Earth's inner and outer cores are less dense,by about 10%, than expected for pure Fe, and thatit must contain one or more of the following lightalloying elements: Si, O, S, C and H [7]. We adoptthe following values, from [7]: 6 wt% Si, 3 wt%O, 1 wt% S, and only trace amounts of C and H.This is equivalent to about 18 wt% FeSi, 13 wt%Fe0.95O, 3 wt% FeS, and 66 wt % Fe (assumingFeNi is equivalent to Fe). Inclusion of these elements can (but need not) reduce the zero-pressuredensity of the core, but they generally also alterthe compressibility of the core material. In thisabstract we ask how the mean densities andradii of chthonian planets would change byincluding these light alloying elements.Calculation:To calculate the radius of an exoplanet with various compositions, we model it as having a core andmantle of various materials. We integrate the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium to find the pressureat depth, invert the equation of state to derive thedensity as a function of pressure, then adjust thethickness of layers to conform to the new density.Updating the gravitational acceleration at depth,we iterate to convergence. We assume a third-orderBirch-Murnaghan equation of state for all materials, and calculate pressure as a function of densityusing the density ρ0, isothermal bulk modulusKT,0,and pressure-derivative of bulk modulus dKT/dP 0at zero pressure. Pressure is continuous across thecore-mantle boundary. We draw from the literaturefor data for pure � (hcp) Fe [8], B2 phase of FeSi [9],the orthrhombic B8 phase of Fe0.95O, FeS VII [9];for the rocky mantle we use the equation of statefor MgSiO3 of [4]. These are the preferred phasesat pressures of the Earth's core (≈ 360 GPa), andare expected throughout the bulk of our exoplanets, even at the center of our 2M⊕ model (centralpressure ≈ 600 GPa).We find that pure Fe planets with masses 0.5, 1.0and 2.0M⊕ have radii of 0.634, 0.776 and 0.945R⊕,yielding mean densities ρ¯ = 10.80, 11.79 and 13.061636.pdf

g cm−3, respectively. If we include the impuritiespresent in the Earth's core, we would find thatFe planets with these three masses have new radii0.656, 0.803 and 0.978R⊕, yielding mean densities ρ¯ = 9.76, 10.64 and 11.80 g cm−3, respectively.These densities are lower, by about 9%, comparedto the pure Fe case. But it is interesting to seethe effect of each impurity individually. Pure Fecores with the only impurity being 20 wt% Si haveradii 0.678, 0.830 and 1.010R⊕, and mean densities ρ¯ = 8.86, 9.64 and 10.70 g cm−3, respectively.Pure Fe cores with the only impurity being 20 wt%S have radii 0.677, 0.828 and 1.007R⊕, and meandensities ρ¯ = 8.87, 9.70 and 10.80 g cm−3, respectively. Pure Fe cores with the only impurity being20 wt% O have radii 0.674, 0.824 and 1.009R⊕, andmean densities ρ¯ = 9.01, 9.86 and 11.00 g cm−3, respectively. If one considers 1M⊕ Fe cores with upto just 10 wt% impurities, mean densities are likelyto be reduced by about 11%, from 11.79 g cm−3(pure Fe), to between 10.52 g cm−3 (Fe w/O) and10.42 g cm−3 (Fe w/Si).If a lower limit to exoplanet radii were found, thesensitivity of mean density to impurities in the Fecore would complicate the interpretation as a lowerlimit due to a maximum stripping limit as suggested by [6]. We assume iron fractions followinga single large impact are 0.89 (assumed) and 0.85and 0.81 [6] for final exoplanets with masses 0.5,1.0 and 2.0M⊕, with the remainder being MgSiO3,We find radii 0.665, 0.833 and 1.045R⊕ and meandensities 9.34, 9.55 and 9.68 g cm−3. While lowerthan the densities of pure Fe planets, these densitiesare equivalent to adding to the core not-implausibleproportions of Si: roughly 15, 21 and 32 wt%.Conclusions:Exoplanets quite plausibly can be the Fe cores ofterrestrial planets that have seen their silicate mantles removed by impacts. A pure Fe compositionhas been considered to yield the minimum radiusfor exoplanets of different masses, the minimumR(M) curve. But, given the simple fact that theEarth's core contains roughly 10 wt% light alloyingelements, mostly Si, O and S, this R(M) curve mustbe considered uncertain, by about 10% dependingon what exactly the core is contaminated with. Abetter understanding of the effects of impurities,and the origin of impurities in the Earth's core, isneeded to better define the lower radius limit forterrestrial exoplanets.It is sometimes assumed that cores must have lowermean densities than pure Fe cores, because impactscannot remove all of the silicate mantle and mustleave behind some MgSiO3 with roughly 15% themass of the planet. These mantles lower the meandensities of the exoplanets, but by amounts equivalent to adding roughly 15 to 32 wt% Si into thecores. The effects of impurities must also be considered so that completely stripped cores are notmisdiagnosed as cores with remaining mantles.References: [1] S. Ferraz-Mello et al. 2011, A&A531, 161.
