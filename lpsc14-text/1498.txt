"STANDOFF BIOFINDER" FOR FAST, DAYTIME, LARGE AREA DETECTION OF BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS WITHOUT SAMPLE COLLECTION. A. K. Misra1, S. K. Sharma1, T. E. Acosta-Maeda1, P. J. Gasda1, P. G. Lucey1, G. J.

The task of finding a small amount of biological material or bio-minerals from a large collection of rocks on a planetary surface can be a very time consuming process for rovers/landers. The standoff biofinder instrument is capable of finding biological materials, biominerals, and other bio-markers from a standoff distance of 1 to >10 m quickly (0.1 s). The instrument provides time-resolved (TR) laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) images showing locations of biological materials on a large area in the vicinity of the rover/lander during daytime operation. After an area of interest is identified, the instrument, when combined with remote Raman and LIBS techniques, can assess the molecular and chemical composition of the target material from a standoff distance. Methodology: Time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy is a technique where the optical emission of molecules, electronically excited by an incident monochromatic pulsed laser source, is measured in the time and wavelength domains. Most biogenic and organic materials give strong fluorescence signals when excited with UV and visible lasers [1-5]. When minerals containing transition metal and rare-earth ions are excited with UV and visible lasers, they produce fluorescence bands that sometimes overlap with the fluorescence bands of biogenic and organic compounds in the wavelength domain. However, the fluorescence of inorganic materials and bio-organic materials do not overlap in the time domain. The decay time or lifetime of biogenic and organic compounds is much shorter (<1 to 100 ns) than the fluorescence decay time of metal ions (1 μs to ms) in minerals. The average fluorescence lifetime of several bacteria has been shown to be <10 ns [6]. The fluorescence lifetime of a fluoroprobe in a protein or nucleic acid is highly dependent upon its local environment and can vary from a few ps to 10s of ns [711]. The standoff biofinder exploits the short lifetime of bio-fluorescence to locate a biological materials among inorganic materials when excited with a 532 nm pulse laser. Figure 1 demonstrates the usefulness of timeresolved LIF spectroscopy to distinguish a biogenic material from a non-biogenic material. Standoff fluorescence spectra of chicken eggshell and an inorganic calcite sample were recorded from a distance of 22 m with 1 s detection time using 15 mJ/pulse energy of 532 nm laser operating at 20 Hz. Figure 1(a) shows the combined Raman and fluorescence spectra of nonbiogenic calcite mineral over sequential 1 ms time interval. It is shown that calcite has long-lived fluorescence signals extending over the 20 ms time frame. The wide fluorescence band near 616 nm is due to the presence of Mn2+ luminescence centers within the calcite structure. In the spectrum of calcite, the sharp lines are spontaneous Raman lines, which are observed at 282, 711, 1085, 1434 and 1748 cm-1 on the Stokes side, and are characteristic of calcium carbonate in the calcite structure. The anti-Stokes Raman peaks of calcite are also visible in the calcite spectrum.  Figure 1(b) shows the time-resolved fluorescence spectra of chicken eggshell with the same instrument measured over a sequential 20 ns time intervals with a 1 s integration time. Strong fluorescence signals with very short life time (<60 ns) is observed in the eggshell. The fingerprint Raman lines at 282, 711, and 1085 cm-1 are also seen in the egg shell spectrum, confirming presence of calcium carbonate in the eggshell. There are several differences in the time-resolved fluorescence spectra of calcite and eggshell in terms of lifetime, spectral intensity, and spectral wavelength. It is the presence of strong, but short lifetime, bio1498.pdf

Instrumentation: The details of the prototype bioimaging system have been described earlier [10]. The standoff biofinder consists of a regular camera lens, a 532 nm notch filter, a gated ICCD camera, and a small diode-pumped 532 nm Nd:YAG pulse laser with 35 µJ/pulse energy operating at 10 kHz. A 28 cm diameter laser spot size at 2 m distance is achieved using a diffuser and a lens. All biofinder images were recorded with 0.1 s integration time with all the room lights turned on and a gate width of 500 ns. The biofinder system can record live images (10 frames/s) showing locations of biological materials in the 615 cm2 target area. Results: Figure 2 shows the detection capability of standoff biofinder using fluorescence imaging. The top image (a) shows the samples under white light illumination. A fossil Hebertella sinuata from the Ordovician period, ruby (a highly fluorescent mineral), and an augite-containing basaltic rock are imaged in Figure 2. In the biofinder false-color image (b, warm colors indicate high signal intensity), the fossil is clearly seen; the ruby and the augite have nearly no signal in this time range. The fluorescence from the minerals is detected by delaying the detector by 1 µs to omit any fast biofluorescence signal and using a  100 µs exposure time (Fig 2c). The white light image  of a hematite coated rock from Little Red Hill, Mojave Desert is shown in Fig 3a. The slightly darker patch on the rock is due to a hypolith colony on the right side of the rock. In the biofinder TR LIF image (Fig 3b), one can easily see the presence of biological bacterial colonies. The image clearly demonstrates capability of standoff biofinder system to detect minute amounts of biological material even in well-lit conditions. Summary: A "standoff biofinder" instrument prototype locates various biological materials in a 615 cm2 area from a standoff distance of 2 m by exploiting the short fluorescence lifetime of bio-organic materials. Using an electronically gated camera, live images at 10 frames/s can be obtained. Biomaterials stand out as bright objects among inorganic materials due to strong short-lived fluorescence. The standoff biofinder instrument would allow a rover or lander to quickly locate biomarkers in its immediate vicinity during the day for further characterization with other onboard instruments.
