Although it did not strikethe Earth's surface, the blow-up of the object was impressive.There were numerous witnesses (cf. youtube videos providedin many cases by dashboard-mounted cameras in vehicles),and the fireball was seen over several Russian cities. A gooddeal of damage was done by the shock wave from the exploding bolide: broken window glass in buildings and numerousinjuries therefrom, although fortunately no fatalities seem tohave occurred. The impact was likely the largest known eventsince the Tunguska impact over a century ago.Subsequent analysis of the event, including orbit analysisand recovery of meteorite fragments, suggest that the impactorwas ∼ 17−20 m in diameter, striking the atmosphere at 18.6km s−1 at an angle of 75 degrees from the vertical [1]. Theobject composition was chondritic of the LL5 type [2] with abulk density of∼ 3.3 gm cm−3. Further discussion and analysisof the impact observations can be found in the discussion by[3].The event underscores the potential hazard posed by theimpact of asteroids on the Earth. Even non-fatal impacts ofsmall objects can cause significant amounts of damage. Assuch, these events need to be understood and the hazards theypose need to be characterized for mitigation purposes.Beyond the hazard aspect, terrestrial meteor impacts area fascinating example of complex physical processes in thenatural world. They present strong challenges for modeling of0 2×106 4×106 6×106 8×106 107010102×10103×1010dKE/dz (erg/cm)z (cm)Figure 2: Energy deposition curve (erg cm−1) for a simulationlike that shown in Fig. 1.the type described in this abstract. At the same time, the wealthof data generated by these events, and this one in particular,afford a unique set of tests: literal "ground truth" applicationsof modeling techniques. Given the parameters of the event(object size, velocity, impact angle, composition, and materialproperties), it should be possible to match the observations, inparticular the energy deposition along the bolide's track.Hydrodynamic modelingWe have carried out some low- to medium-resolution threedimensional calculations with the ZEUSMP2 hydrodynamicscode [4] that we have successfully used for a number of studiesof atmospheric impacts for objects in the size range from tensof meters to kilometer scales, primarily for impacts into theatmospheres of Venus and Jupiter [5-8].Simulation of the Chelyabinsk impact is challenging. Modeling an object of this size demands high resolution (grid cells∆x of order a meter or smaller); combined with the velocity viof the impact, the Courant condition for the simulation requirestimesteps ∆t ≤ ∆x/vi ∼ 10−5 s. The challenge is increasedby the high inclination of the bolide's path, which increasesthe timescale of the event by a factor ∼ 4 from a vertical impact starting at z = 100 km height, to ∼ 10 s, thus requiringapproximately 106 timesteps for a single calculation.The ZEUSMP2 code has several features that aid in thiscalculation, for instance the ability to include a moving gridthat follows the bolide so that it does not have to be advectedthrough an inordinately long grid. The code's chief weaknessas presently configured is the lack of a strength model for solidmaterials. While this lack may not affect simulations of kmscale bodies previously modeled [5-8], it may be expected thatmaterial strength would be more important for smaller bolideslike the Chelyabinsk object.Figs. 1 and 2 show images and energy deposition fortwo separate Chelyabinsk simulations; Fig. 1 shows density1269.pdf

Fig 2. shows theenergy deposition dE/dz where E(z) is the kinetic energy ofbolide material. The peak deposition is between 50 and 60 kmaltitude, compared to the observed peak at ∼ 30 km [3]. Thediscrepancy is probably due to the lack of a strength modelin the ZEUSMP2 code, as mentioned, that causes the modelimpactor to disintegrate at too high an altitude.Simplified model with fragmentationAs noted above the ZEUSMP2 calculations appear to deliverincorrect results in this case, as judged by energy depositioncurves like those shown in Fig. 2. Another model we discusshere is one in which the impactor is considered in terms ofdiscrete object(s) subject to ablation, drag, and fragmentation.This model is essentially the "separated fragment" model discussed by other authors [9,10], as well as being used by us formodeling the production of crater populations and Venus andTitan [11].For each object (original bolide or fragment) j, we integratethe mass equationm˙ j =−CAρ(z j)A jv j, (1)where CA is the ablation coefficient, A j = pid2j /4 is the crosssection for an object of diameter d j , ρ(z) is the atmospheredensity at height z, and the speed v j = (v2x + v2y + v2z )1/2j . Thevelocity of the bolide vvv j = (vx,vy,vz) j is determined bym jv˙vv j =−CDρ(z j)A jv jvvv j −gm j zˆ j, (2)where CD is the drag coefficient and g is the Earth's gravity.We model the impactor (and fragments) as quasi-cylinders ofconstant density ρi and initial length h = 4m j/piρid2j . Massloss by ablation is assumed to reduce d j while keeping h and ρiconstant. Finally the object's position xxx j is given by x˙xx j = vvv j. Inour previous work [11] we included "pancaking" or flatteningof the impactor by aerodynamic forces but we neglect that hereassuming that objects have non-negligible strength. We hadalso previously assumed that strengthless bodies fragmenteddue to Rayleigh-Taylor instability driven by deceleration, butbolides in this size range (tens of meters) are more likely tofragment due to dynamic pressure across a body with materialstrength σ . Here we assume that material strength is massdependent according to σ = σ0(m/m0)−γ , so that a body m jwill fragment into 2 < n < 7 sub-masses m j+n smaller objects,with masses and small transverse velocities chosen from random values chosen as with previous modeling [11].A calculation starts with a single object at the initial heightz = 100 km, and proceeds by integrating equations 1 and 2until the dynamic pressure ρ(z j)v2j = σ , at which point theaformentioned fragmentation prescription is applied. Individual fragments are then integrated downards, with an indefinitenumber of sub-fragmentations permitted until all objects haveablated or been halted (i.e. have velocities less that 10−3 thevelocity of the initial object). Fig. 3 shows results from arun with nominal values CA =CD =CV = 1.0, σ0 = 107 dynecm−2, m0 = 1010 gm, and γ = 0.5. Peak energy deposition isreached at an altitude of 25-30 km, similar to the inferred valueof ∼ 30 km [3]. Further work on this problem will explore theeffects of different parameter values and will compare resultswith the observations to constrain the physical properties of thebolide.AcknowledgmentsThe work was supported by NASA Planetary AtmospheresProgram award NNX11AD87G and NSF Planetary Astronomyaward AST-1109729.References[1] Yeomans and Chodas 2013. http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/news/fireball 130301.html [2] Kohout et al. 2014Icarus 228, 78.
