GEOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS ON OUTER SYSTEM PLANETESIMAL DISK MASS FROM RIDGESURVIVAL ON IAPETUS. E. G. Rivera-Valentin1, E. J. Lopez Garcia1, A. C. Barr1, 1 324 Brook St, Box 1846,Dept. of Geological Sciences, Brown University, Providence, RI.Introduction: The equatorial ridge of Iapetus maybe one of its oldest features because of its degraded state[1]. The ridge, which reaches heights of ∼20 km andwidths of ∼100 km, may be formed by either endogenic processes arising during early despinning [2, 3]or debris infall from a primordial ring [4, 5]. Recentmorphological investigations found that 33% of Iapetus'ridge retained an unmodified triangular shape with someslopes reaching 40◦ [6], indicating little to no impactmodification. If the ridge is indeed primordial, then ithad to survive impacts from planetesimals scattered intoSaturn crossing orbits during the dynamical sculpting ofthe outer planets [7, 8]. This brought ∼1.2× 1019 kg ofprimarily cometary material to Iapetus during the firstbillion years of its history [7, 9, 10]. Here we use ourMonte Carlo model of impact cratering [11] to constrainthe planetesimal disk mass based on limits of impactinduced erosion on the ridge.Impactor Population: We use Monte Carlo methods to select a population of impactors with a total massand Size-Frequency Distribution (SFD) as the KuiperBelt, which may be left over from the scattering event(see e.g. [10]). Our SFD contains one slope break atD = 60 km and follows a differential power law in mass(m) of the form dN/dm ∝ m−1.63 for D ≤ 60 km anddN/dm ∝ m−2.6 for D ≥ 60 km, assuming impactordensity ρi = 1.1 g cm−3 [12, 13]. Given these slopesand the location of the slope break, we find that most ofthe mass is delivered by objects with ri ∼ 30 km.Analytic Model: The likelihood the ridge survivescan be approximated by finding the average number oftimes an area on Iapetus is excavated. A conservativeassumption is that the ridge morphology is affected if atransient crater impinges upon it. An impactor forms acrater of [14]Dtc = 1.16(ρiρm) 13D0.78 (vi sin Ω)0.43g−0.22, (1)where ρm = 1.1 g cm−3 is Iapetus' surface density,vi is velocity, g = 0.22 m s−2 is Iapetus' gravity, andΩ is impact angle. The characteristic impact velocityat Iapetus is 6.1 km s−1 [9]. For ri ∼ 30 km andΩ = 45◦, Dtc∼337 km. An estimate of the numberof times a given region is excavated, Ncrat ≈ n ×(14piD2tc)/(4piR2p), where n = (Rp/ri)3(MNice/Mp)is the number of impactors, MNice is the total massof material delivered to Iapetus during the first billionyears of its history, and Mp and Rp are Iapetus' massand radius respectively. The total mass of objects hittingIapetus,MNice ∼ 1.2×1019 kg, which includes objectsscattered into Saturn crossing orbits in the 800 Myr before the 2:1 MMR crossing, plus the material that hitsduring the LHB [7, 9, 10]. We find that Ncrat ∼ 1.3 fora full Nice model bombardment, which would disruptthe ridge to an extent greater than observed.Monte CarloModel: Iapetus is modeled as a Cartesian sphere of radius 735 km. We consider the ridge tobe centered at 0◦ latitude and to extend to ±2◦ latitude.Impact locations are chosen randomly in longitude andlatitude following dϕ = sin (2ϕ) [10]. To account forthe lack of topographic data within the light terrain, weanalyze the fate of the ridge in only one hemisphere,which is randomly selected for each Monte Carlo run.Not only does 33% of the ridge survive major impactmodification, but triangular peaks compose 31%±11%of a 12◦ longitude bin [6]. This implies that there aresignificant continuous segments of the ridge that avoidmajor impact-modification. Thus, the studied hemisphere is divided into 12◦ longitude bins; latitudinalslices are then taken at the model resolution (5 km). Ifa crater is incident on a slice, the ridge is assumed tono longer have a triangular shape. For every bin, thepercent of non-impact damaged slices is found. If thisvalue falls within the observed (31% ± 11%), that binis successful. We find the percent of successful bins foreach Monte Carlo run to determine the total bombardment mass Iapetus can experience and preserve ridgesegments that are 31% pristine.Results: Figure 1 shows an example postbombardment map of the number of times an elementis impacted following a Nice Model bombardment. Inthis single bombardment history, the maximum numberof times an area is excavated is 11 times with a globalaverage of 2 times. For this bombardment history, noneof the 12◦ bins contained an undisturbed region due tothe high cratering rate.We performed a suite of Monte Carlo simulations fora range of bombardment masses, Mx. In Figure 2A,we plot the percent of the post-bombardment ridge thatremains unmodified by impacts. In Figure 2B, we plotthe percent of 12◦ bins considered successful (i.e., binswhere 31%±11% of slices were unaffected by impacts)averaged over 200 Monte Carlo realizations for eachMx. Error bars are the standard error of the meansto a 95% confidence. Supporting our preliminary results from our analytic approach, a Nice model bombardment does not allow the ridge to survive becausethere are on average 2% successful bins. Indeed, on average, only 1.7%±0.4% of the ridge remains unmodified by impacts. For mass ratios >0.34, too much of2615.pdf

Figure 1: Post-bombardment results for a single impact history onto an model Iapetus following a Nice Model bombardment.Colors indicate the number of times an area is excavated by an impactor.the ridge is affected by impacts and so it does not retain its primordial triangular shape while for <0.17 toomuch of the ridge survives with its primordial shape.The best successful cases occur for Mx ≈ 3 × 1018 kg(i.e., Mx/MNice = 0.23).Conclusions: We find that a Nice Model outer system bombardment would significantly modify Iapetus'ridge to a greater extent than observed. These resultsmay imply: 1) the ridge is young, which may be excluded by the crater density on the ridge itself [1], 2)the surface of the young Iapetus was warm and it did notbegin recording craters until sometime during the LHB,much like its interior siblings [15], or 3) Iapetus itself isyoung, 4) the outer system disk mass is smaller [16] thansuggested by prior work [8, 7, 17] or 5) none of Saturn'sregular satellites are primordial and the present-day system is not the same that was present during the first billion years of solar system history.Acknowledgements: This work was supported byNASA through PG&G NNX12AI76G.References: [1] C.
