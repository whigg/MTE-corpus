Introduction: One  of  the  main  findings  of  the Apollo 17 UV Spectrometer experiment is that the albedo of the Moon at far-UV wavelength region is 'inverted' compared to expectations from the more common visible light imagery [1]. This spectral inversion is prevalent in lab measurements of returned lunar soils but is absent in crushed rock powders [2], which implies a relation to space weathering other surface alteration  processes  [3].  Asteroids  and  likely  other  solid bodies in the solar system lacking atmospheres exhibit similar  spectral  trends  at  far-UV  wavelengths  (e.g., 100-200  nm)  [4].   We  investigate  the  wavelength where the far-UV albedo reversal of the Moon's mare and highlands region occurs.  By using data obtained from the Lyman Alpha Mapping Project (LAMP) instrument on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft  [5]  we  identify  a  distinct  inverse  relation between the far-UV albedo and the visible albedo of the Moon (Figure 1). The Moon is  divided  into  two distinct  units,  the brighter  highlands and the  darker  mare  regions.  The mare  regions  which  are  now  filled  with  iron  were defined  by  past  volcanic  eruptions  and  are  much younger then the brighter  highlands.  It  is the abundance of anorthosite that gives the hilly portions of the Moon its bright color in stark contrast to the Mare regions. By comparing mare and highland regions measured  at  several  wavelengths  within  the  57-196  nm spectral range of the LAMP instrument we plan to obtain  a  deeper  understanding  of  the  space  weathering and surface altering processes that lead to the spectral inversion signature.  LAMP Methodology:The LAMP instrument is an imaging spectrograph that measures ultraviolet surface reflectance  using  illumination  by:  1)  the  Sun  when LRO is on the dayside, and 2) the interplanetary medium  and  UV-starlight  when  on  the  nightside  and/or when over permanently shaded regions (PSRs) [6,7]. The LAMP albedo maps provide sub-km resolution on the lunar surface and now cover both polar and equatorial regions [8]. Future Work:  We are currently developing maps that divide the global LAMP maps into finer spectral bins to pinpoint the wavelength where the spectral inversion occurs. Maps of spectral slopes are determined from these products and our recent progress in identifying regions with relatively blue and red spectral slopes will be reported. 0 2x10^6Figure  1: LROC-WAC western  equatorial  hemisphere  map  (top)  and  LAMP  Lyman-  nightsideÎ±  brightness (bottom).References:[1] Lucke R.
