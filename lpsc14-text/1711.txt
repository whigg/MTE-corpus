Introduction:  Cooling rates of meteoritic chondrules are mainly estimated from the study of oxidized chondrules (type II), based on the observation of the texture and Fe-Mg zoning in olivine. Indeed, the study of zonations allows diffusion calculations and/or crystallization modeling, providing access to kinetics of chondrule thermal history [1–4]. However, type II chondrules mainly occur in ordinary chondrites, leaving the thermal history of reduced (type I) chondrules, dominant in carbonaceous chondrites, poorly constrained. To decipher the thermal history of type I chondrules, other thermal markers need to be established since forsterite is essentially un-zoned. Recently, Cu-Ga diffusion profiles in metal grains were proposed to be useful to determine cooling rates [5, 6]. Another method is based on the observation of the diopside/pigeonite exsolution microstructure in Capyroxenes [7]. Indeed, Ca-bearing pyroxenes' structure and composition depend on thermal history and the study of subsolidus phase transformations may allow the determination of cooling rates within the range of temperature 1200-1400 °C [7–9]. The exsolution process in pyroxene has its origin in the variation with temperature of the miscibility gap between the Ca-rich and Ca-poor pyroxenes.  Here we studied grains of Ca-pyroxene by TEM (transmission electron microscopy) from two chondrules in the Paris meteorite classified as a CM2 chondrite [10]. This meteorite combines both moderately and very little altered zones and is hence less altered than other CM chondrites. Chondules represent about 45% of the chondrites with mostly type I chondrules (Fig. 1).  Methods: Type IAB chondrules were first selected after a survey of a Paris section by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). SEM-BSE imaging and EDS compositional maps were obtained using a Tescan VEGA II LSU in order to localize Type IAB chondrules containing Ca-rich pyroxene grains (Fig. 1). TEM foils (100 nm thick) were extracted from the petrographic section by the focused ion beam technique using an FEI Strata DB 235 at IEMN (Univ. Lille). Analytical TEM was performed using an FEI Tecnai G2-20 (LaB6 filament) operated at 200 kV and a Philips CM30 operated at 300kV.  Fig. 1: RGB compositional map (R=Ca, G=Mg, B=Si) of a type I chondrule in Paris. Enstatite grains are in light-blue and Ca-rich pyroxene in pink. (Fe,Ni) metal grains are in black and forsterite in light-green.   Fig. 2: Compositions of pyroxenes in the chondrules 1 (black squares) and 2 (red squares), measured by EDS-TEM and visualized in the Mg-rich portion of the pyroxene quadrilateral. Open squares are for unexsolved and solid squares for exsolved microstructure. The two-phase domain is in light grey. Results:  Chondrule 1. The Ca-rich pyroxene grains studied have  heterogeneous compositions and microstructures. For compositions outside the miscibility gap (Ca/(Ca+Mg) ≥ 0.4 and enstatite (Mg/(Ca+Mg) ≥ 0.9), pyroxene is found un-exsolved  (Fig. 2). Grains with intermediate compositions plot in the two-phase domain and exhibit exsolution lamellae. Lamella thick1711.pdf

ness is very fine (≈10 nm) making it impossible to determine the exact composition of a single lamella. However, the electron diffraction pattern reveals the characterisitic spots of the low pigeonite P21/c microstructure exsolved in the augite host C2/c (Fig. 3). Lamella orientation is close to (001) and its wavelength is varying between 20 ≤ λ ≤ 30 nm from one area to another independently of pyroxene compositions.   Fig. 3: Bright field TEM image of exsolution lamellae in chondrule 1. Augite/low-pigeonite P21/c lamellae are along the (001) plane. Chondrule 2. As for the first chondrule, exsolved areas occur only for compositions within 0.1 ≤ Ca/(Ca+Mg) ≤ 0.4. Exsolved grains exhibit a tweed microstructure (Fig. 4). Orientation of lamellae is close to (001) and (100) planes. The diffraction pattern also indicates that augite C2/c co-exists with low-pigeonite P21/c. Lamella wavelength is between 10 ≤ λ ≤ 14 nm along (001) and between 7 ≤ λ ≤ 9 nm along (100).  Fig. 4: Bright field TEM image of a tweed microstructure in chondrule 2. Lamella orientations are close to the (001) plane and (100) plane. Discussion: Exsolution wavelength is closely related to cooling rates, making it a reliable thermal marker. The link between wavelength, time and temperature has been explored by [7] who proposed a calibration curve to estimate the cooling rate (Fig. 5). The cooling rate of the two chondrules studied is deduced from this curve, assuming a diffusion closure temperature for of 1200°C.  Chondrule 1 lamella wavelength (20 ≤ λ ≤ 30 nm) corresponds to a cooling rate between 10-100°C/h. Chondrule 2 exhibits a tweed microstructures revealing that spinodal decomposition occurred within a highly supersaturated system. This is typical of rapid cooling rates and indeed lamella wavelength is below 15 nm corresponding to a cooling rate faster than 1000°C/h (Fig. 5).  Fig. 5: Time-Temperature-Transformation diagram (TTT) for diopside/pigeonite exsolution (adapted from [7]) showing cooling rates and the corresponding lamella wavelength. This study shows that type I chondrules, like type II chondrules, experienced different cooling rates. Besides, the range of cooling rates is similar to that of type II chondrules. Despite the different environments experienced by type I and type II chondrules based on their oxygen fugacities, their comparable cooling rates suggest that their formation was triggered by a common mechanism.
