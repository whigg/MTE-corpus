Introduction:  The existence of ancient valley networks and associated lakes and sediments on Mars suggests that fluvial activity once played a significant role in shaping the surface of the planet. This likely required a wetter and warmer climate than exists today [1-13].  Several studies [7, 14, 15] have demonstrated that the morphometric characteristics of drainage basins on Mars differ somewhat from those on Earth. For example, valleys commonly lack the well-graded, concaveup topographic profiles seen on Earth. In addition, the mean Hack’s exponent appears to be higher for valley networks on Mars than on Earth. Hack’s exponent h relates stream length L to drainage area A: L  kAh     (eq. 1) Typically, valley networks on Earth have h ~0.50.6. On Mars, characteristic values for h are ~0.640.74 [14, 15]. In other words, valleys on Mars seem to possess smaller drainage areas for a given length than their terrestrial counterparts, implying that basins integrate (and widen) less quickly. This discrepancy has not yet been fully explained. Possible reasons may relate to the relative immaturity of the valleys and therefore a closer correlation between valley morphology and regional terrain [10, 12], the disruptive effects of impact cratering [16, 17], or a lack of tectonic uplift [14]. The MARSSIM landform evolution model was introduced by A. D. Howard in 1994 [18]. Its primary purpose is to simulate a variety of geomorphic processes on a digital elevation model (DEM) input file. These files may be created artificially or taken from real topographic data sets. The model can also simulate mass wasting, eolian processes, impact cratering, lava flows, accretion and ablation, and lake evaporation.  The effect of different geomorphic processes on input topography can be modeled in MARSSIM, and the interplay between processes can be examined in a controlled manner. In this way, a set of model runs can be compared with observations from real topography in order to determine which parameter or combination of parameters will create erosional features – specifically valley networks – most similar in morphometry to real drainage basins on Mars whose scaling properties are known. This allows us to quantitatively test hypotheses that might explain the observed discrepancies in valley properties on Mars and Earth. In principle, this can also provide insight into the specific geologic and climatic conditions that prevailed at the time the valleys formed. Methods:  The MARSSIM landform evolution model is accessed through a command-line interface. A parameter file stores all possible inputs, although in most cases a limited number of simulation modes will be applied at any given time; for all experiments described here, the only processes enabled were fluvial erosion and mass wasting. A full explanation of the model parameters is given in [19]. We have used both idealized topographic datasets as well as real topography extracted from preexisting DEMs (MOLA and HRSC) using ArcMap, GDAL [20], and GMT [21] to crop regional terrain models. A command line tool has been created using TauDEM [22] to allow rapid derivation of Hack’s exponents from MARSSIM output files. This allows for the determination of valley profiles and drainage areas without the need for manual post-processing. Initial Numerical Experiments:  The goal of our initial numerical experiments has been to understand the behavior of Hack’s exponent in MARSSIM with different input parameters on idealized topography.  We have run experiments on a domain that is periodic in X with a constant slope in Y, and a double-periodic domain, with a ridgeline separating two slopes in the center of the region (Fig. 1).    Gravity: The effect of the difference in gravitational acceleration between the two planets can easily be assessed in MARSSIM. We experimented by changing gravity, both with and without taking into account other expected differences in bed roughness [23] or channel width [24]. This cannot explain the observed difference in Hack’s exponent between the two planets.  Repeated simulations changing g on the synthetic ridges with 1 degree slopes (with simulated random noise of 10 cm magnitude) resulted in haverage ~0.55 on both Earth and Mars.   Discharge exponent: The parameter related to discharge in MARSSIM is the discharge exponent , which relates to discharge Q and cross-sectional area A as: Q  kA      (eq. 2) Therefore a higher discharge exponent will lead to greater runoff efficiency and more erosion, all else being equal [25]. This has a clear effect on the degree 2478.pdf

to which valleys incise the landscape (Fig. 1). The effect of changing  on Hack’s exponent is less straightforward, however. Our initial results suggest that: (1) domains with higher  (more efficient runoff) appear to have less variability in h in different drainage basins across the model domain, and (2) the haverage appears to converge to typical terrestrial values (~0.55).  Future Numerical Experiments:  Future numerical experiments will focus on using input files derived from the real Martian landscape. Source topographies will be based on those used in previous studies that have simulated Martian valley network formation with other landform evolution models [17, 25-28]. Regions of particular interest include Loire, Ma’adim, Naktong, Parana, and Warrego Valles, Sinus Sabaeus, and Terra Cimmeria. Existing valley features and young craters will be artificially removed using the median filter and blur tools in Photoshop as explained in [25, 27]. Another important question is whether Hack’s exponent evolves with time, or if incision efficiency varies with valley maturity. Ultimately, the goal of this work is to develop a quantitative framework for understanding the differences in morphometry between Mars and Earth. Many factors may be relevant to this problem, including the discharge exponent, timescale and periodicity of formation, grain size and bed roughness, and the role of cratering.

The average Hack’s exponent of the three longest drainages in the lower precipitation case ( = 0.75) is 0.74, and in the higher precipitation case ( = 0.9) is 0.68 ; the difference is likely due to the capture of some of the smaller drainages by the longest valleys as incision progressed in the “wetter” case. 2478.pdf
