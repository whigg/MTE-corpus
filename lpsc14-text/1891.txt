Introduction: Impacts played a major part in the early development of the Solar system [1]. They may also have had an equally important role in subsequent planetary evolution, including the formation and evolution of atmospheres and hydrospheres around the terrestrial planets and their satellites [1, 2]. Previous studies [3-5] have demonstrated that hypervelocity impacts can result in the release of volatiles from hydrated, carbonate and sulphate mineral targets. It is important to understand the conditions and mechanisms of impact induced devolatilisation in specific important mineral species, especially those abundant on the surfaces of planetary bodies. With this understanding, we may be able to use remote-sensing, or rover-based instruments to recognise, and quantify, any devolatilisation that may have occurred. For example, [6] has shown that Raman spectroscopy is capable of quantifying the loss of volatiles from impacts, and this instrument is beginning to be seen as a useful tool for in situ planetary surface analysis [7], evident by the inclusion of a Raman spectrometer onboard ESA's ExoMars rover [8]. Here we present results of laboratory impact experiments using two minerals believed to be relevant in the evolution of Mars: goethite and gypsum (in the form of plaster of paris (PoP)).   Experiments: Two experimental programs have so far been carried out using a two stage light gas gun [9] to simulate planetary impacts, with analysis carried out using a LabRam-HR Raman spectrometer, both instruments are based at the University of Kent.  Table 1. Shot program for devolatilisation experiments. The first set of experiments used a cuboid projectile (1.5 × 1.5 × 2 mm) of goethite fired onto aluminium alloy plates at velocities between 1 and 5 km s-1. The second set of experiments used both fully hydrated (gypsum) and semi-hydrated (bassanite) phases of PoP, either as the target or projectile material. The experimental results are summarised in Table 1. (N.B. in the 'Target' column 'mm' denotes the thickness of the Al target plate).   Results: Goethite. Analysis of the residue within craters resulting from impacts showed the loss of OH from goethite producing hematite through the reaction: 2 FeO (OH) → Fe2O3 +H2O The experiments to date (Fig. 1) show at impact velocities ≥3 km s-1 almost complete dehydration of goethite occurs, as indicated by the doublet peak at 607 and 658 cm-1 and the formation of a broad peak at 1315 cm-1. Whereas a lower impact velocity of 1.3 km s-1 shows almost no sign of devolatilisation as a result of impact.  Fig. 1 a: Raman spectrum of goethite after heating to 400 °C and then cooled to 28 °C. b-e: spectra obtained from the residue within craters formed at impact velocities 5.13, 4.11, 3.72, 1.36 km s-1 respectively. f: Spectrum of raw goethite that has not undergone any shock or heating. Arbitrary vertical shifts have been applied for clarity. Hydrated plaster of paris. Raman spectra taken from inside craters shows some slight indication of dehydration of the PoP target, via the following reaction: CaSO4 ·2H2O → CaSO4·0.5H2O + 1.5H2O The appearance of a small feature at 3553 cm-1 (Fig. 2), next to the H2O features at 3405 and 3493 cm-1, Shot I.D.

suggests the formation of semi-hydrated material in the crater; although this still requires confirmation.   Fig. 2 (from G111013#1) a: located at the edge of the target and b: within the crater. c: semi-hydrated phase of plaster of paris.   Semi-hydrated plaster of paris. Analysis of crater residue from a buckshot of semi-hydrated PoP powder (Fig. 3), shows there has been a loss of the remaining volatiles (H2O, O and S) within the PoP, as signified by a change in the spectra from the semi-hydrated phase to a phase that closely resembles that of CaCO3. This may reflect creation of fine-grained CaO, rapid hydration of this strongly hygroscopic phase by atmospheric moisture, and uptake of CO2. However, a peak present in the impact residue at 507.1 cm-1 is not present in pure CaCO3. There is a difference of a few wavenumbers between the positions of comparable peaks between the residue material and CaCO3, which may be the result of shock resulting from the impact. Further analysis is being conducted to determine the exact composition of the residue material, and whether this might include high pressure mineral polymorphs.   Fig. 3 (from shot G141113#2). a: Raman spectrum taken from the residue found within craters found on the aluminium plates. The broad peaks at 1350 and 1600 cm-1 are the 'D' and 'G' carbon peaks, probably from LGG debris. b: Pure calcite sample with peaks that match those from the target residue. C: Raman spectrum of semi-hydrous PoP.   Fig. 4 shows the Raman spectra of residue from a projectile made from semi-hydrated PoP. Here, the complete dehydration of plaster of paris has occurred, seen by the loss of the peak at 3558 cm-1 and the shift of the SO4 (V2) peaks from 427 and 487 cm-1 to 417 and 498 cm-1, which are indicative of anhydrous PoP (anhydrite) [10].    Fig. 4 Raman spectra of the anhydrous plaster of paris analysed in craters on the target plate (pink, top), and semi-hydrous plaster of paris (blue, below).   Conclusions: Initial experiments show hypervelocity impacts induce devolatilistion of goethite and both semi-hydrous and hydrous PoP. The impacts lead to a distinctive change in the Raman signatures of these minerals. These early results indicate the degree of devolatilisation is dependent on both the velocity and the size of the projectile. Contiuned investigation (including modelling to determine the peak pressures/temperatures associated with the impacts) is underway in order to confidently quantify the degree of impact induced devolatilisation of minerals using Raman spectrometry.
