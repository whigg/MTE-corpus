Introduction:  It is widely accepted that the Moon was formed by a large impact on the proto-Earth [1,2].  As a result of this event, as well as the decay of heatproducing radioactive elements, the initial thermal state of the Moon was likely either completely molten, or was molten to depths of up to 500 km – forming a so-called magma ocean [2,4,5,6].  According to the initially totally molten (ITM) model, the lunar surface should have young (<1 Ga) thrust faults created from modern compressional stresses of up to 350 MPa [7].  Alternatively, if the Moon had a lunar magma ocean (LMO) with depths between 300-500 km and a cool interior at 1700-1800 K, the global stresses in the crust should currently be less than 100 MPa, insufficient to allow thrust faults to initiate [4,5,8].  As a result, the LMO model predicts that the lunar surface should be free of young, compressional tectonic features, with thrust faulting limited to the Moon’s early geologic history (>3 Ga) [4].  With high-resoultion images from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC), the global spatial distribution of lobate scarps can be mapped, and the topography of the lunar surface can be studied in unprecedented detail [9,10].  Furthermore, LROC images allow new opportunities to conduct quantitative structural measurements, geomorphological and morphometric analyses, and crater size-frequency distribution (CSFD) measurements in areas of previously documented lobate scarps, as well as new locations, on the Moon [11,12]. Thus, we investigated such small-scale compressional fault scarps to better constrain the amount of crustal shortening, timing of faulting events, and improve our understanding of the stress state of the Moon and its thermal evolution.  Scarp Morphology:  Lobate scarps are interpreted to be the manifestiation of reverse slip on faults resulting from compression in the lunar crust [7,13].  The lunar thrust fault scarps have a linear or curvilinear asymmetric shape with arcuate fault surfaces [10,11].  Typically, the scarps consist of a series of smaller, connected subscarps called complexes [7].  Previously investigated scarp complexes span lengths of up to ~10 km, occurring in a series of up to 10 subscarps, and generally having maximum relief of <~100m [10,14].  Based on their generally crisp appearance and the absence of superimposed, large-diameter impact craters, and the fact that they cross-cut small craters, such scarps were interpreted as the youngest (≤~500 Myr) landforms on the Moon [10,14,15].  Methodology: Several methods were used for this investigation and are described in detail below. Mapping and Geomorphology:  Lobate scarps were identified using LROC Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) and Wide Angle Camera (WAC) images.  Geologic maps were created by photointerpretive methods using ENVI and ArcMap software.  Using Fledermaus software, 3D visualizations were created by draping NAC images over the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) digital elevation model (DEM) (Fig. 1 shows an example).  Crater Size-Frequency Distribution Measurements: Determing the regency of these lobate scarps may be accomplished with crater size-frequency distribution (CSFD) measurements [15].  Given a measured CSFD and using the production function and chronology of [16], absolute model ages can be obtained for any lunar surface unit [17,18].  LROC NAC images were imported into ArcGIS where counting areas and craters were measured using CraterTools [19].  CSFDs are Figure 1: Oblique view of NAC image (M145624586LC) draped over the LOLA DEM showing the northwest-southeast trending Plummer scarp (23.51N, 153.09W).  Illumination from the east.

then plotted and fit using CraterStats [18], using techniques described in [17].   Fault Mechanics: Using ArcMap, we also took structural measurements of the scarp radius and half angle (Figure 3), and used these parameters in thermoelastic equations [13,14].  Mohr-Coulomb failure laws [20] and Andersonian fault dynamics theory [21] can assist in understanding the compressional stress state of the Moon.  Thermoelastic stress calculations can yield estimates for the amount of stress required to repture thrust faults like the ones observed in remotelysensed imagery.  These computations can also be used to quanify the amount of crustal shortening.  A MATLAB code was created to process these equations in an efficient manner [13]. Results and Summary: To date, 5 previously undetected scarps were measured using the methods discussed above.  [13].  The results from our work [13] and others’ [22] demonstrate the ability to make structural measurements of thrust faults at various scales using LROC imagery.  Our calculations show that current compressional stresses in the lunar crust are in excess of 400 MPa, and that the formation of the faults that produced the lobate scarps was likely dominated by the material strength of the upper lunar crust [13].  Further calculations indicate that the amount of crustal shortening (i.e. contraction) associated with this compression results in a change in the lunar radius of ~200 m [13].  This result is comparable to that of [10] calculating a ~100 m change of radius. Structural analyses of scarps show that the thrust faults producing them have average depth of 1.2 km, with a maximum depth of 4.1 km.  Most scarps exhibited low dip angles (<36˚), which are comparable to thrust faults measured by [22].  Also, the average relief for the scarp faces was 43 m.   The absolute model ages from our CSFD measurements indicate that ages of the faults that produced these lobate scarp range from 10 to 123 Ma, implying geologically recent faulting, consistent with the work of [10,13,15].   In summary, these results show that crisp morphologies, relatively small scarp heights, young crater count ages, and current crustal compressional stresses in excess of 400 MPa seem to indicate that the ITM model is more plausible, because it predicts the occurance of young scarps and that their formation is dominated by the material strength of the rock.  To supplement these results, further research is to be completed on the conflicting lunar thermal models and improving age constraints on thrust fault scarps.
