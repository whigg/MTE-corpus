Introduction: Iron is an abundant component of the Martian igneous and sedimentary rocks, soil, and dust and it has been proposed that iron-rich cements are present in some rocks[1]. Here we propose a method of determining the composition of this component. ChemCam (CCAM), the laser-induced breakdown spectrometer on the Mars Science Laboratory now in Gale Crater, provides new analytical capability on the martian surface. CCAM's laser vaporizes 300 to 500 µm diameter spots on rocks and soil targets and collects spectra in the ultraviolet, visible, and infrared, which are converted to elemental abundances. Laser shots vaporize a fraction of a µm of rock, so repeated shots at the same location provide a chemical depth profile. CCAM provides chemical details of finegrained mineral and amorphous phases that cannot be resolved with other instruments on Mars.  The CCAM beam is small enough that it may occasionally hit single feldspar phenocrysts in igneous rocks or detrital feldspar minerals in sedimentary rocks. However, to date there have been no single analyses by CCAM that show perfect feldspar stoichiometry. Instead, targets in Gale Crater that would be considered feldspars (their main components are SiO2, Al2O3, CaO, Na2O, and K2O) often contain the elements Fe and Mg that are not incorporated into feldspars.  Some of these feldspar-like analyses have 20 wt.% or more FeO. Terrestrial feldspars rarely have more than 2 wt.% FeO, so feldspars with 20 wt.% FeO are ruled out. The observations could be explained by thin films of Fe-rich material coating minerals or infiltrating fractures in minerals and pore spaces in rocks, resulting in the elevated Fe contents of feldspar-like analyses. The presence of an interstitial, Fe-rich material would give clues to the aqueous environment on Mars and help answer some outstanding questions about the distribution of Fe on the Martian surface. Approach: We assumed that some CCAM laser locations on rocks and soils only hit feldspar plus an Fe-rich component. These two-phase analyses can be identified by their elevated Fe, low Mg, and SiO2, Al2O3, CaO, Na2O, and K2O and that have molar abundances consistent with solid solutions of albite (NaAlSi3O8), anorthite (CaAl2Si2O8), and K-feldspar (KAlSiO4).   We inspected all CCAM analyses from the first 360 sols of the MSL mission. These data were processed with PLS1 software and all shots from each location were averaged. There are 155 CCAM locations from 49 rock and soil targets with feldspar-like components and very little MgO and TiO2, and with FeO exceeding 19 wt.%. The average of all 155 potential two-phase analyses is 51 wt.% SiO2, 7 wt.% Al2O3, 5 wt.% CaO, 2 wt.% Na2O, and 1 wt.% K2O. The FeO, TiO2, and MgO in the 155 analyses averaged 21 wt.%, 1.0 wt.%, and 0.8 wt.%, respectively. Aluminum cations correlate with sodium and potassium and project to 0 cation % Na and 0 cation % K at 0 cation % Al, indicating that Na and K are primarily contained in an Al-bearing phase (Figure 1) Ca cations correlate weakly with Al cations and the correlation suggests that about half of the Ca is associated with phases that do not contain Al. Plagioclase components were calculated assuming that Na and K were in the albite (NaAlSi3O8) and the orthoclase (KAlSi3O8) components of feldspar and all remaining Al was in the anothite (CaAl2Si2O8) component. SiO2 was calculated based on stoichiometry. Anorthite, albite, and orthoclase proportions in the purported feldspars were calculated.  Results: Feldspar components make up 40 ± 6 wt. % of the individual analyses, where ± indicates one standard deviation. The feldspar components were subtracted from the average oxide abundances at each analysis location and the residual was normalized to 100 wt.%. When the residuals of all 155 locations are averaged, the result is a silica-rich and Fe-rich composition with 56 ± 3.6 wt.% SiO2 and 36 ± 2 wt. % FeO. The other components of the residual are 2 ± 0.5 wt.% TiO2, 1 ± 1 wt. % MgO, and 5 ± 2 wt. % CaO. The SiFe-rich material present with the feldspar-like components in the 49 Gale Crater rocks and soils are shown in Figure 2.  Discussion: The elevated Fe in the residua is due to the subtraction of the iron-free feldspar and thus enriching the residua in Fe. Silica in the residua is slightly higher on average than the original analyses.  CaO and TiO2 are present in the residua suggesting that they are present in phases other than the Fe-rich component and feldspar. Ca could be associated with sulfates or apatite and Ti with ilmenite or magnetite. The calculated 1 wt.% MgO in the residuals is not statistically different from 0.0 wt. %, however, small amounts of Mg could be incorporated in feldspar.  Dust on the surface of the rocks does not contribute to the high Fe content of the analyses. The dust has less than 19 wt. % FeO and the averages used in this study do not include the first five laser shots (dust).  Silica and iron-rich residua in Gale rocks could be due to the infiltration of pore spaces and fractures in sediments or sedimentary and igneous rocks with Si and Fe saturated water.  Alternatively, they could be due to removal aluminum, calcium, and alkalis by aqueous alteration leaving the rocks enriched in Si and Fe. The presence of water in Gale Crater suggests that alteration of iron-rich rocks was possible, however, the evidence for extensive aqueous alteration is missing [2].  Conclusions: The stoichiometry of feldspar and the low abundance MgO, and TiO2 but high FeO in feldspar-like CCAM analyses allow us to identify a Fe-rich component in locations where CCAM only hit feldspar and the Fe-rich component. Using this approach, the Fe-rich component in 49 Gale Crater rocks and soils averages 56 ± 4 wt. % and 36 ± 2 wt. % FeO. This could represent a silica and iron that precipitated from as saturated solution that infiltrated the rocks. References: [1] Blaney et al. 2014 (submitted). [2] McLennan et al.

Correlation of Na and K cations with Al and the zero intercept of the trend line suggest Na and K are associated with Al.  Feldspar is a common mineral with this association.        Figure 2.
