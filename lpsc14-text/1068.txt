Introduction:  The howardites are brecciated HED meteorites that probably represent of metamorphosed regolith breccias of the HED parent body (PB). They are comprised of mineral and lithic clasts excavated from the HED PB interior by the impacts. Pyroxenitic clasts are typical components of the howardites and represent the rocks which were derived from deep layers of the HED PB, probably from the lower crust or the upper mantle. One of the pyroxenite clasts from Yurtuk howardite exhibits a symplectic assemblage of spinel and silicate, the nature of which is discussed. Results and discussion: One of the pyroxenitic clasts in meteorite Yurtuk [1] has been studied with optical microscopy, EMPA and FEG-SEM techniques. The fragment is mainly composed by the medium - grained orthopyroxe grains. The dominant pyroxene shows zonality with increasing Fe/Mg ratio towards the grain boundaries (average Mg0.74Fe0.25Ca0.01SiO3) and contains poikilitic inclusions of olivine (Mg1.29Fe0.71SiO4) (Fig. 1). Interstitial spaces of the rock are filled by fine-grained pyroxene-plagioclase aggregate, called "mesostasis" (Mes, Fig. 1, 2). The mesostasis is an aggregate of clinopyroxene (Mg0.39Fe0.14Ca0.42SiO3) and feldspar with minor orthopyroxene (Mg0.59Fe0.34Ca0.02SiO3), troilite, chromite and Fe-metal. The olivine grains have conspicuous rims of an orthopyroxene-chromite symplectites (fig. 3, 4). These symplectic rims do not occur in orthopyroxene grains, neither within the matrix nor within the mesostasis. Different types of chromite occur in the pyroxenitic clast. Chromite Chrs and orthopyroxene form symplectic rims replacing olivine (Fig. 3, 4). Chromite Chrc is filling the numerous cracks in the orthopyroxene (Fig. 2, 5). These cracks emanate from the orthopyroxene/mesostasis boundaries and propagate deep into the orthopyroxene interior (Fig. 2). No reaction rims around the cracks are observed in the dominant orthopyroxene. Chromite Chrm forms ~5 μm grains within the mesostasis together with troilite, ilmenite and Fe-metal (Fig. 2). Chromite Chrt occurs inside the tiny trapped melt inclusions observed as trails in olivine grains (Fig. 6). The chemical composition of chromite occured in symplectites (Chrs), in cracks (Chrc), and mesostasis (Chrm) is different: (MgAl2O4)0.27-0.30(FeCr2O4)0.73-0.70; (MgAl2O4)0.20(FeCr2O4)0.80; and [(Mg,Fe)Al2O4]0.310.26(FeCr2O4)0.65-0.68(Fe3O4)0.04-0.06 respectively. Here, the contents of trace element such as Mn, Ti, Ni and probably V were not taken into account. Chemical compositions of Chrs and Chrc were calculated from the EMPA and FEG-SEM mixed chemical analyses data, and the Chrm composition represents the EMPA data for pure chromite. Chrt has not been analyzed because of small size of inclusions. Both Chrc in cracks and Chrs in symplectites are connected to mesostasis (Fig. 2, 4). From our observations, the crystallization sequence, thermal history and redox conditions during solidification of parent melt can be reconstructed for the pyroxenitic fragment in the following way. (1) A solidification of the rock has been interrupted during dominant orthopyroxene crystallization, probably due to impact event attended with reheating process and deformation of crystalline material as it is indicated by the occurrence of cracks in orthopyroxene and olivine. (2) The following history of the rock proceeds via solidification of residual melt in mesostasis, and crystallization of chromite Chrs and Chrc took place at this stage. Our observations show that mesostasis is connected to the  symplectic rims as well as chromite veins, and thus it has served as a source for Cr and Al during the Chrs and Chrc crystallization. (3) Different composition of  Chrs, Chrc and Chrm  reflects an increasing of fO2 and a change in chemical composition of  residual melt during its solidification, as well as a change in temperature during cooling of residual melt. Chrm appeared in methostasis at the late stage of orthopyroxene crystallization. The similar Cr/Al ratio for Chrs (2.3 - 2.7) and Chrm (2.1 - 2.6) might indicate more or less constant Cr/Al ratio in the melt during their crystallization and therefore give evidence for their simultaneous crystallization. On  the other hand, the much higher Cr/Al ratio for Chrc (4.0) might indicate a late precipitation of Chrc during cooling, when the Al content in the melt decreased after crystallization of plagioclase. A presence of Fe3+ in Chrm might indicate that during chromite crystallization the fO2 has been higher than it has been during crystallization of Chrs and Chrc. (4) Ortho/clinopyroxene - magnetite/chromite symplectites are well known for olivine from terrestrial [2], martian [3] and lunar [4, 5] rocks and were observed in the achondritic meteorites [6-9]. Dehydrogenation and oxidation of OH-bearing olivine was suggested as a reaction of chromite-diopside symplectites in lunar olivine [5], and this model might be applied to symplectites in Yurtuk. There are some in dications for the presence of "water" in HED meteorites: the water as (OH-) was found in nominally anhydrous minerals in the Ibitira eucrite [10], and some liquid water was suggested to exist in eucrite Serra de Mage [11]. (5) We assume that the parent melt of the pyroxenitic clast in Yurtuk has been initially saturated by H2 and H2O, and OH-bearing olivine has been crystallized first. During impact, decompression initiated H2 degassing by the residual melt, thus increasing Cr2O3/2CrO ratio in the melt and giving rise to chromite Chrm precipitation. In turn, decreasing of H2/H2O ratio in the melt led to dehydrogenation of OH-bearing olivine with the generation of symplectite rims by the following reactions:  [2Mg2+ + 2H+]olivine + <2Cr 2+>melt → < 2Mg 2+>melt + H2 +[ 2Cr 3+]olivine  [2Mg2+ + 2H+ ]olivine + <Al2O3>melt → < 2MgO + H2O>melt +[ 2Al 3+]olivine  The trivalent chromium then lead to the coprecipitation of chromite and orthopyroxene forming the symplectite replacing the olivine.
