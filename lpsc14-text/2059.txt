DETECTION OF SPINELS EXPPOSURES FROM SOME NEAR SIDE LOCATIONS OF THE MOON. Prabhjot Kaur and Prakash Chauhan, Space Applications Centre, (ISRO), Ahmedabad-380015, India. (prabhjotk@sac.isro.gov.in).   Introduction: Moon crust has been formed by the fractional crystallization of lunar magma ocean (LMO) with mafic rich mantle and plagioclase being lighter formed the upper lunar crust. Mafic minerals being denser sank down and constituted the lunar mantle. Detection of spinels on lunar surface from Chandrayaan-1 Moon Mineralogical Mapper (M3) data has added a new mineral to the earlier existed mineralogy of the lunar surface [17]. Spinels being mafic and denser mineral like olivine form deep seated lithology and thus any exposures of these minerals on the lunar surface must have been transported through some geological processes i.e. volcanism or excavation by impact craters. Study of the surface exposures of such deep seated minerals may help in understanding the geological formation transportation process of these minerals on the surface. Global survey of the spinel rich locations has been restricted to craters only. However, spinels detected from the rim of basins like Moscoviense, Imbrium, and Ingenii provide framework to study more locations globally to understand the vertical and horizontal distribution of spinel rich layer. To know the global distribution of spinel exposures we have examined a large area of the near side of the Moon. Earlier studies were restricted to limited locations or basins or only to central peak of the craters.   For global mapping of spinels we examined a large extent of the near side of the Moon. In  this study, we  report new results about the presence of spinel rich exposures from locations of the near side of the Moon which include Sinus Iridium, Dorsum Bucher, Gassendi A crater and Olbers A crater.    Data Set and Method: M3 is an imaging spectrometer onboard Chandrayaan-1 covering the spectral range from 0.45-3.00 µm with 85 spectral bands and ~140 m per pixel (in Global mode) spatial resolution [8, 9]. M3 acquired data in several modes including full spectral and spatial resolution but acquired near global data in a reduced resolution mode of 85 spectral bands and 140 m/pixel. M3 reflectance data (level-2), corrected for thermal and photometric effects have been used for the present study [10]. M3 images covering near side of the Moon were downloaded from NASA PDS website, geocorrected and mosaiced. The extent of the mosaic generated is shown as red box in figure 1. For noise reduction, pixels with negative reflectance values were masked and moving average was applied for spectral smoothening of the reflectance spectra. The examined area in this study constitutes around half of the near side of the Moon.   Spinel spectrum shows characteristic absorption near 2000nm without any absorption around 1000nm [12]. The characteristic absorption has been used to identify the exposures, if present, over a large area of the near side of the Moon.       1Olbers ASinus IridiumDorsum BucherGassendi AFigure 1 shows the Clementine data generated mosaic where red box is the extent of areas studied using M3 data.

Fig. 2(a) shows Sinus Iridium, where the spinel rich locations have been detected from the hills  surrounding it. Fig. 2(b) shows crater Olbers A, a 43km diameter crater situated near the western rim of Oceanus Procellarum. Fig 2(c) shows 33km Gassendi A crater situated on the rim of large Gassendi crater. Dorsum Bucher is shown in fig 2(d) which is situated on the western portion of mare Imbrium basin. The reflectance spectra corresponding to the above said locations are shown in fig 3 where the spectra show display characteristic spinel absorption around 2000nm without any absorption at 1000nm.

Blue color circles represent spinel exposure whose spectra are not shown. (b) M3 image of Crater Olbers A, spinel rich location is shown as red star. (c) Crater Gassendi A, magenta circle represent spinel rich area. (d). Dorsum Bucher, orange circle represents the area from where the spinel rich spectra has been extracted.                Fig 3. Reflectance spectra extracted from the spinel rich areas mentioned in the text. The corresponding locations of the spectra are marked with the same colors on the fig 2.            Conclusions: The new spinel rich locations identified in this study adds to the existing knowledge about the spinel rich locations of the lunar surface. The spinel rich locations identifed till date are only not restricted to the central peaks of the craters but encompass large basins and silicic domes also. To have a better understanding about the spinel formation on the luanr surface, more regions are being analyzed with M3 and other available data.    References: [1] Hangar, D. et al.
