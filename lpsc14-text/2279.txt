Introduction: Determining new information about lunar volcanic processes is an ongoing objective of Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter mission. Here, our primary goal is to determine what role volcanism has played in the formation of the lunar "red spots," which are defined by relatively high albedos, topographic slopes steeper than basaltic domes, and strong ultraviolet absorptions [1-3]. Some, but not all, of these landforms are associated with localized enhancements of incompatible elements such as Th [4], suggesting a granite or granitoid composition.  Using data from LRO, the Gruithuisen Domes, Compton-Belkovich complex, Mairan domes, Lassell Massif, and Hansteen Alpha were determined to be exposures of highly-silicic, high-Th materials produced by intrusive or extrusive volcanic activity [5-12]. Other red spots were interpreted as kipukas of highland or basinforming materials [3,4,13]. Due to their potential importance for understanding the full diversity of lunar volcanic processes and the compositional range of the lunar crust, many of the lunar red spots (including the Bullialdus and Gruithuisen regions) were Regions of Interest defined by the Constellation project as high-priority targets for human and robotic lunar exploration [14]. While the geology of some red spots is well-constrained, others are more ambiguous, and questions remain about their origin and compositions. We present results from a new study of lunar red spots, beginning with the features located in the Procellarum/Cognitum boundary region.  Rationale: The Herigonius feature (16°S, 329°E) is one of three red spots located in southeast Oceanus Procellarum where Procellarum, Mare Cognitum, and Mare Humorum intersect. Historically, this feature was informally referred as either the "Helmet" or the Herigonius Feature and is an irregularly-shaped landform with a higher albedo than the surrounding mare and two distinct topographic highs, referred to as Herigonius Pi and Herigonius Eta (Fig. 1) [3,15].   The origin of the Herigonius feature is not known. Earth-based spectral mapping defined two terrain types (a smooth plains unit and a hummocky, hilly terrain) as well as discrete spectral units suggesting that the Herigonius region was compositionally heterogeneous [15]. Forward Th abundance models showed that the Herigonius region is not Th-enhanced and therefore more likely to be remnant highland materials, not an example of extrusive volcanism [4]. A similar conclusion was reached using a preliminary version of the Diviner dataset, which indicated that none of the Cognitum red spots are distinct in terms of silica content from the surrounding highlands materials [11]. Detailed geologic mapping and model age dates were determined by Wagner et al. [16], who concluded that the Herigonius region was emplaced in the late Imbrian, subsequently embayed by mare units, and possibly formed by either highlands volcanism or emplacement in a basin-forming impact. Wagner et al. [16] also noted that further investigation of the Herigonius region using datasets unavailable at the time could help to determine the stratigraphy and mode of emplacement for the Herigonius feature.  Methods: The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Wide Angle Camera (WAC) provides global imaging of the Moon with pixel scales of 100 m in five visible bands and 400 m in two ultraviolet bands [17]. The WAC is a push-frame camera that collects seven color bands (321, 360, 415, 566, 604, 643, and 689 nm) with a 57-km swath width in color mode from a 50-km altitude [17,18]. The WAC monochrome low-Sun global mosaic was used as a base map for the investigation (Figure 1). A preliminary version of the multispectral WAC data set that was photometrically corrected using spatially-resolved Hapke parameters [19] was employed here to perform a multispectral assessment of the red spots. Topographic measurements were collected for red spots globally using the Figure 1. WAC morphology basemap of the Herigonius feature. 2279.pdf

GLD100 dataset, which has a spatial resolution sampling of 100 m and a vertical accuracy of 10 m [20].  Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) frames were map-projected and mosaicked to facilitate geologic interpretation of individual landforms at meter-scales.  NAC stereo pairs were targeted for the Herigonius region and used to create a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) with 2 m sampling (e.g., [21,22]) that covers part of the Herigonius Eta massif. This DTM was used to measure the heights, slopes, and diameters of individual landforms.  Results: Morphology and Topography. The highalbedo region that traditionally defines the boundaries of the Herigonius region is readily apparent (Fig. 1). However, unlike landforms such as Hansteen Alpha, the boundaries of the high-reflectance feature are not strongly correlated with the local topography. The Herigonius region consists of an irregularly-shaped landform, with an overall relief of 320 m, that includes the Herigonius Eta (relief: 1130 m) and Herigonius Pi (relief: 489 m) massifs (Fig. 2). Analysis of the NAC DTM indicates that the average flank slope of Herigonius Eta is 12°, which is somewhat less than the slopes observed at other "red spots" such as Gruithuisen Gamma (27°) and Mairan South (20°).   Multispectral results: The entire Herigonius feature is spectrally distinct from the adjacent highlands units, as well as the adjacent mare units, and other lunar "red spots" and some basaltic low shield volcanoes (Fig. 3). The average spectral properties in this parameter space for the whole Herigonius feature are distinct from that of both mare shields (e.g., Hortensius) and silicic domes (e.g, Gruithuisen). The Herigonius Eta massif is spectrally comparable to the spectral properties of Mons La Hire, considered to be part of the Imbrium basin inner ring [13], consistent with highlands material rather than volcanic materials (silicic or mare).  Conclusions and Future Work: We conclude that Herigonius Eta comprises remnant highland material embayed and perhaps modified by later mare flows. Future work will consist of model age determinations and combined morphologic/spectral investigations at other red spots, such as the nearby Darney feature, in order to place further constraints on their composition and origins.
