Mars And Beyond: Human Spaceflight at the Museum of Science BostonJoseph Paul Cohen at the University of Massachuestts Boston, and Julia Sable at the Museum of Science Boston, andWei Ding at the University of Massachuestts Boston, and Ron Li at the Ohio State University, Tom Stepinski at theUniversity of CincinnatiIntroductionIn the third year of this ongoing outreach project [1][2] we had a greater emphasis on manned spaceflightthan in previous years. This years Mars and Beyondevent occurred on August 31st and September 1st atthe Museum of Science in Boston Massachusetts whichhosts more than 1.5 million visitors yearly.This years event grew to include many speakersfrom the community and focused on the challenges tohuman spaceflight. In order to highlight the challengesof sending astronauts to Mars we focused on the Apolloand Orion missions, space suits, Mars settlement, and3D printing (a technique for making needed tools duringa space mission).ApproachIn 2012 [2] we emphasized the landing of Curiosity onMars because that was hot news at the time. Roboticspace explorers weren’t in the news as much in thesummer of 2013, so we wanted to try a different “hook”to capture people’s imaginations. We chose mannedspaceflight because there is real intent to send humans toMars within the next generation. We also chose this topicbecause it appeals to both adults and children. Adults canrecall the excitement of the Apollo missions and comparethe newest technology with those historic achievements.Kids can picture themselves as astronauts.A consistent theme in our events over the past threeyears has been a panel of NASA funded scientistsdiscussing their work and answering questions frommuseum visitors. This year we organized the panelists sotheir research would progress through the different waysof studying Mars, from indirect to direct. We thoughtthis would help provide perspective on how the differentresearch is relevant and necessary for successful mannedmissions to Mars.Figure 1: Mars and Beyond Panel: (left to right) WeiDing, Joseph Paul Cohen, Sam Kounaves, Ron Li.Indirect: Using artificial intelligence to mapplanetary surfaces. Wei Ding from the Universityof Massachusetts Boston presented the theory behindapplying machine learning to analyzing remote sensedimagery. This was a visitor friendly version of [3] and[4].Indirect: Studying remote sensed Martian imageryusing computers. Joseph Paul Cohen from the Universityof Massachusetts Boston discussed how scientists gofrom remote sensed images to features that can be usedin artificial intelligence algorithms [5] [6].More direct: Sending robots to Mars. Sam Kounavesfrom Tufts University discusses his involvement as aCo-PI in the Phoenix Lander mission and how the resultspresented [7] [8] where a robot acted as a proxy for ahuman, taking samples and carrying out experiments.Direct: Sending humans to Mars. Ron Li from TheOhio State University discussed his involvement in thedevelopment of astronaut localization methods for futurehuman missions [9].For this years event we had many talks throughoutboth days from members of the community. A few apresented next:Jim Hand who is retired from Northrop Grummanworked on the Apollo Moon missions. He designed astar alignment system to get the coordinates of the shuttleafter it left earth. He presented visitors with amazingstories of working closely with NASA and JPL to installand launch these systems.Jack Mustard is the chairman of the Mars 2020Science Definition Team and a professor at theGeological Sciences at Brown University. He discussedhow geologic exploration of Mars can elude to signs oflife.1643.pdf

2Bruce Mackenzie from the Mars Foundationdiscussed a plan for Mars settlement describing all thetechnology we do and don’t have.Jonathan McDowell from Harvard-SmithsonianCenter for Astrophysics gave a presentation about theinvisible universe.John Johnson from Harvard University discussedfindings from the Kepler missions that indicate there aremany warm planets around cool stars and his work tovalidate these findings.The Crater Seeker 3D simulation video gamedesigned by Joseph Paul Cohen allows visitors toimagine themselves as JPL driving the MER-B rover.Visitors are confronted with challenges that lead them touse tools such as false color DEM slope maps and ingresspath planning. The best way to understand why toolsare needed is to face the same challenges that requirethem. In the picture visitors have unlocked a secret rovermodeled after a star wars land speeder.Our outreach efforts had a high impact, connectingwith many people in a short time. Our audience countsfor the stage presentations totaled 635 for Saturday and630 for Sunday. We counted the number of “engagedvisitors” who did activities or interacted with presentersat tables during the event. We counted a total of 1887engaged visitors over the course of the two days.AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank Phoebe Li for the use ofher photographs.
