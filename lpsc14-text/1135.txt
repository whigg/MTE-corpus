FORMATION OF PLUTO AND CHARON FROM TWO PARTIALLY DIFFERENTIATEDIMPACTORS. S. J. Desch1. 1School of Earth and Space Exploration, Arizona State University, Tempe,AZ 85287. (steve.desch@asu.edu).The Pluto system is unique in many ways. Plutohas 5 satellites: Charon, Nix, Hydra, Styx and Kerberos. Aside from the gas giants, no solar systembodies are known to possess as many. (Who’s aplanet now?!) Charon has 12% the mass of Pluto,exceeding even the Moon-Earth mass ratio. Likethe Earth and Moon, the Pluto-Charon system hasbeen modeled as arising from the impact of twobodies, in this case large Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs)[1]. But currently two scenarios are considered. Inthe first (“intact moon”) scenario, an impactor withrelatively low mass (30% of the Pluto-Charon total mass) collides with the larger body; after losing substantial mass, the impactor separates fromthe larger body and enters into orbit around it.The second (“disk”) scenario more closely resembles the model for the Moon’s formation. In it, theimpactor and the target have essentially identicalmass (50% of the Pluto-Charon total mass). Thecollision sends material into orbit around the pairas their cores merge to form Pluto. Charon formsfrom some of the material in the disk, the rest ofwhich is reaccreted by Pluto, except for some whichescapes. The intact moon scenario was consideredby [1] to be somewhat more probable with regardto the resultant angular momentum, but both scenarios were considered viable. Here I discuss howpredictions of the thermal evolution and internalstructures of the impactors can be used to distinguish between these scenarios and to constrain theorigin of Pluto and Charon.According to [1], the collision of the two objects had to happen with low relative velocity (≤0.9 km s−1). For this to occur with high probability, [1] considered it likely that the collision tookplace after the two bodies were caught in the 3:2resonance with Neptune. This requires the collision to take place after Neptune started its outwardmigration, which [2] have associated with the LateHeavy Bombardment 3.9 Gyr ago. Accordingly, weconsider it likely the collision took place ≈ 1 Gyr after solar system formation. This is sufficiently longthat heating by long-lived radionuclides should havecaused the separation of a rocky core from an icemantle, even for an impactor as small as 30% of thePluto-Charon mass [3]. An object with this massand a mean density 2 g cm−3 would have radius 800km, a mass almost triple that of Charon, and wouldhave been large enough to differentiate.The fact that the impactors should have bothdifferentiated immediately calls into question theintact moon scenario. This scenario requires theimpactor to lose ≈ 70% of its mass before emergingas Charon. Because its outer icy layers would havebeen preferentially lost, Charon would have a density greater than that of the impactor. This is difficult to reconcile with the low density of Charon, ≈1.63 g cm−3, lower than that of Pluto, ≈ 2.03 g cm−3,which is itself comparable to other KBOs. We consider the formation of Charon from a disk to bemore likely.In the disk scenario, Charon forms from somefraction of the disk material that is ejected fromthe outer layers of the two impactors. Allowingboth objects to have masses of 53% of the PlutoCharon total mass, and mean densities 2.00 g cm−3,they would each have radii 972 km, again, largeenough to differentiate and form rocky cores [3].Now the question is why Charon has as high a density as it does, since it should form preferentiallyfrom the outer layers of the bodies, presumablypure ice, with density≈ 1 g cm−3. This conundrum,pointed out by [1], is resolved by the recognitionthat for the surface temperatures characteristic ofthe Kuiper Belt, the viscosity of the ice is too highto allow for complete differentiation; an undifferentiated crust is predicted to remain [3-5]. This isdespite the gravitationally unstable nature of theresultant structure, with a rock/ice layer atop anice mantle, although formally unstable to RayleighTaylor instabilities, it is nonetheless stable on geologic timescales [4,5]. Because of this undifferentiated crust, the resultant disk will contain somerocky material as well as ice.To estimate the fraction of rock in the disk,we must determine the structure of the two impactors. We have run the thermal evolution codeof [3] for a KBO with radius 972 km and meandensity 2.00 g cm−3. We calculate the evolution ofthe KBO to proceed as follows. First, long-livedradionuclides decay, heating the interior above themelting point of ice; rock and ice separate withinthe interior, forming a rocky core and icy mantle, surrounded by a thick, undifferentiated crustof rock and ice. Then, because the density of thisrock/ice crust exceeds the density of the ice man1135.pdf

tle, Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instabilities will initiate,seeking to overturn these two layers. The rock/icecrust sinks (eventually adding rock to the core)while the ice mantle grows, at the expense of thecrust. Eventually the RT instabilities reach a layerclose enough to the surface (with temperature Tsurf =50 K) that the temperature is so low, and the iceviscosity so high, that the timescale of the RT instability exceeds the age of the solar system. Forall practical purposes, differentiation ceases when alayer with this low temperature, which we call Tdiff ,is reached. We calculate Tdiff by using the growthrate calculated by [6] for RT instabilities when theviscosity varies exponentially with temperature andtherefore with height, over a lengthscale L. Thecritical viscosity for the RT instability to grow froman initial perturbation Z0 to an amplitude L, in atimescale τ , isηcrit =[(n− 1)1/nCL∆ρ2n] (Z0L)(n−1)/n∆ρ g L τ,where ∆ρ = 1.065 g cm−3 is the density contrastbetween the ice mantle and rock/ice crust and g =0.54 m s−2 is the gravitational acceleration for theseimpactors, and CL∆ρ = 0.76 [5,6]. We used the icerheology of [7] to determine that basal slip dominates the viscosity, so n = 1.8 (and L ≈ 3.6 km).Asssuming Z0 = 1 km, we find that RT instabilities propagate the differentiation to the surface until temperatures below Tdiff = 145 K are reached. Inour thermal evolution modeling, we find that differentiation proceeds outward to a radius of 927 km,leaving a crust 45 km thick that does not differentiate. The structure of the body then includes: arocky core of radius 716 km and mass 5.00× 1024 gat the center (assuming olivine rock with density3.25 g cm−3); a liquid layer from 716 km to 729km, with mass ∼ 1023 g; an ice mantle extendingfrom 729 km to 927 km, with mass 1.60 × 1024 g(with density 0.935 g cm−3); and an undifferentiated ice/rock layer 45 km thick, with mass 1.02 ×1024 g, of which 0.77×1024 g is rock and 0.25×1024 gis ice. This is the structure of each of the two bodieswhen they collide.Following the collision, we assume that Plutoforms from the merger of the two rocky cores, pluswhatever ice is needed to accrete to yield Pluto’smass and density. Exactly one half of Pluto’s massis found within a radius of 910 km within each impactor. Forming Pluto from this material in eachimpactor ensures it has the required mass and arock fraction ≈ 0.77, yielding a mean density onlyslightly higher than the mean densities of the impactors. As for Charon, it must form from whatever material does not escape and does not formPluto. If we assume that a fraction 6.0% of thetotal mass escapes the system, all from the outermost layers beyond 953 km in both impactors, thenthe shells between 909 km and 953 km have combined mass exactly equal to that of Charon. Charonwould accrete from ice shells between 909 km and927 km, having combined mass 0.36 × 1024 g, androck/ice crust shells between 927 km and 953 km,having mass 1.16×1024 g. Charon’s mass would bethen be 1.52× 1024 g. Given a rock fraction in thecrust of 0.749, Charon would accrete 0.87 × 1024 gof rock, yielding a final rock fraction within Charonof 0.57. We calculate Charon’s density would be1.60 g cm−3, very close to its observed density. Thefinal density is sensitive to the assumed escape fraction, among other parameters, but an escape fraction of 6.0% is very much within the range of escapefractions found by [1] in her numerical simulationsof equal sized impactors.Based on our thermal models, both the impactorand target objects that formed Pluto and Charonmust have been large enough to differentiate beforethe impact. Because the mean density of Charonwould be greater than the starting bodies in the intact moon scenario, yet Charon is less dense thanPluto and most KBOs, we consider this scenario unlikely. The alternative scenario, formation of Charonfrom a disk, was considered by [1] to be less likelybecause Charon was predicted to form mostly fromice, but this conclusion was based on the impactorand target being fully differentiated. Our thermalevolution models [3,4] indicate that KBOs will retain undifferentiated crusts of thickness ≈ 45 km.In the disk scenario, Charon would form from a mixof ice and this undifferentiated crust material, explaining very neatly why its density is somewhatlower than Pluto’s but still much higher than thatof ice alone.References: [1] Canup, R. 2005, Science 307, 546.[2] Gomes, R., Levison, H.
