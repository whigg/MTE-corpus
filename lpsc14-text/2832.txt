(melissa.a.morris@asu.edu).Introduction:The Center for Meteorite Studies (CMS) at Arizona State University (ASU) houses a unique andsignificant collection of meteorites comprising over30,000 individual specimens from more than 2,000distinct meteorite falls and finds. As a world-classresearch and educational institute, the Center iscommitted to the curation, distribution, and exhibition of this material for scientific research, education, and public outreach. As part of our education and public outreach (EPO) efforts, the Centerparticipates in various on-campus events, such asASU's Night of the Open Door, Earth and SpaceExploration Day, Homecoming Block Party, andthe monthly Earth and Space Open House. Theseevents bring in approximately 20,000 visitors. Scientists with the Center also frequently travel to local astronomy and rock/mineral clubs to presenttalks, providing touchable specimens. In order toreach and inform an even wider audience, CMS recently partnered with the City of Tempe/TempeCenter for the Arts to design and participate in exhibitions that combine art and science. These exhibitions will be hosted at the Tempe Center for theArts, the Tempe Public Library, and the U.S. PostOffice on Mill Ave. in Tempe, Arizona.Tempe Center for the Arts:From January 17 through June 8, 2014, TheTempe Center for the Arts (TCA) will present anexhibition entitled "American Pop: Comic Booksto Science Fiction". This exhibition for all ageshighlights the ongoing popularity of satire, fantasyand escapism in the worlds of comics, graphic novels, gaming, toys, television, movies and more, andhow American Pop has informed and been informedby science. Artisitic displays include materials fromlocal and national collectors as well as original artand limited edition pieces from some of America'sfavorite pop culture icons. Scientific displays include exhibits specific to the Moon, Mars, and meteorites. CMS will provide samples of lunar, martian, and other meteorites to be displayed in each ofthese exhibits.

Images courtesy of L.A.J. Garvie.ager, Laurence Garvie, will be displayed as threelarge banners, measuring 44" x 204" each, on a 12'wide by 29' high wall space (Figure 1). A raï¬„ewill be conducted at the end of the exhibition for a12-person meteorite vault tour (6 tickets for two),to be hosted after June 8. As a part of this innovative exhibition, TCA also partnered with ASU'sCenter for Science and the Imagination to interviewASU scientists regarding the inspiration they havereceived from American popular culture. The interview of CMS Assistant Director, Melissa Morris,will be displayed at TCA and can also be foundonline here http://csi.asu.edu/tca-pop/. A collection of Dr. Morris's science fiction-related personalitems will also be on display. Each Friday eveningfrom January 17 through June 8, TCA will host SciFi Friday, including a talk on subjects from roboticsto game design to planetary imaging. On April4, 2014, Dr. Melissa Morris will present the SciFi Friday talk entitled, "ROCKS FROM SPACE!".2832.pdf
