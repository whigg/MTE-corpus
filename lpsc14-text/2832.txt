(melissa.a.morris@asu.edu). Introduction: The Center for Meteorite Studies (CMS) at Arizona State University (ASU) houses a unique and significant collection of meteorites comprising over 30,000 individual specimens from more than 2,000 distinct meteorite falls and finds. As a world-class research and educational institute, the Center is committed to the curation, distribution, and exhibition of this material for scientific research, education, and public outreach. As part of our education and public outreach (EPO) efforts, the Center participates in various on-campus events, such as ASU's Night of the Open Door, Earth and Space Exploration Day, Homecoming Block Party, and the monthly Earth and Space Open House. These events bring in approximately 20,000 visitors. Scientists with the Center also frequently travel to local astronomy and rock/mineral clubs to present talks, providing touchable specimens. In order to reach and inform an even wider audience, CMS recently partnered with the City of Tempe/Tempe Center for the Arts to design and participate in exhibitions that combine art and science. These exhibitions will be hosted at the Tempe Center for the Arts, the Tempe Public Library, and the U.S. Post Office on Mill Ave. in Tempe, Arizona. Tempe Center for the Arts: From January 17 through June 8, 2014, The Tempe Center for the Arts (TCA) will present an exhibition entitled "American Pop: Comic Books to Science Fiction". This exhibition for all ages highlights the ongoing popularity of satire, fantasy and escapism in the worlds of comics, graphic novels, gaming, toys, television, movies and more, and how American Pop has informed and been informed by science. Artisitic displays include materials from local and national collectors as well as original art and limited edition pieces from some of America's favorite pop culture icons. Scientific displays include exhibits specific to the Moon, Mars, and meteorites. CMS will provide samples of lunar, martian, and other meteorites to be displayed in each of these exhibits. The Center's "Meteorite Fun Time" quiz will be available via iPad for the duration of the exhibition. As a part of the meteorite display, artistic and informative digital images of meteorite sections produced by CMS Collection ManFigure 1: Optical and reflected-light images of sections of the (Eucrite-mmict) meteorite Ibitira, the (H5) meteorite Franconia, and the (Eucrite-mmict) meteorite Rancho Blanco (L-R). Images courtesy of L.A.J. Garvie. ager, Laurence Garvie, will be displayed as three large banners, measuring 44" x 204" each, on a 12' wide by 29' high wall space (Figure 1). A raffle will be conducted at the end of the exhibition for a 12-person meteorite vault tour (6 tickets for two), to be hosted after June 8. As a part of this innovative exhibition, TCA also partnered with ASU's Center for Science and the Imagination to interview ASU scientists regarding the inspiration they have received from American popular culture. The interview of CMS Assistant Director, Melissa Morris, will be displayed at TCA and can also be found online here http://csi.asu.edu/tca-pop/. A collection of Dr. Morris's science fiction-related personal items will also be on display. Each Friday evening from January 17 through June 8, TCA will host SciFi Friday, including a talk on subjects from robotics to game design to planetary imaging. On April 4, 2014, Dr. Melissa Morris will present the SciFi Friday talk entitled, "ROCKS FROM SPACE!".  Figure 2: Pencil drawing Wilhemena the Wooly Mammoth by Melissa A. Morris The "American Pop: Comic Books to Science Fiction" exhibition at the Tempe Center for the Arts is estimated to receive approximately 10,000 visitors. Further details can be found at the following website: http://www.tempe.gov/index.aspx?page=661. Tempe Public Library: An exhibition at the Tempe Public Library is planned to open in March 2014 and will run for approximately one year. The exhibition encompasses a large area of wall and floor space outside of the Children's Library. The display will focus on Arizona's Meteor Crater and the Canyon Diablo meteorite. Two pedestals will be provided by the library to display specimens of Canyon Diablo provided by CMS. CMS will also provide graphics and a painting (sketch depicted in Figure 2) by CMS Assitant Director, Melissa Morris, designed to tell the story of Meteor Crater through art and science. For a longer-term display, CMS will provide a large (330 lb.), touchable iron meteorite (Nantan, courtesy of donor Frederic Stephan) and associated graphics, for installation in the Children's Library. Children's books related to meteoritics will be displayed adjacent to the exhibit. These exhibitions at the Tempe Public Library are estimated to receive nearly one million visitors every year. U.S. Post Office: Tempe Cultural Services (TCS) maintains exhibit space at the US Post Office on Mill Ave. in Tempe, Arizona. TCA and CMS are in the initial planning stages for an exhibition that will begin sometime in the fall of 2014 and will run 4 months. The exhibition will consist of images and graphics only, visible from both inside and outside the post office. CMS Collections Manager, Laurence Garvie, is already planning artistic and informative images for this display. The exhibition space at the U.S. Post Office on Mill Ave. receives approximately 5 million visitors per year. Conclusion: The Center for Meteorite Studies at Arizona State University has partnered with Tempe Center for the Arts to develop exhibitions that help the Center in its mission to inform and educate the public about the science of meteoritics and space science, through the combination of art and science. In so doing, CMS is able to reach a larger public audience than would otherwise be possible. These types of collaborations are essential to foster scientific understanding in members of the general public, as well as a life-long wonder in the beauty of the universe.
