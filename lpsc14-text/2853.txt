Introduction:  Using THEMIS, NASA has intensely studied the thermal behavior of Martian surface materials and, by using the THEMIS data, diurnal thermal behavior of these materials has been modeled. NASA believes that diurnal temperature curves are dependent on only two factors: albedo and thermal inertia. Thermal inertia, in turn, is believed to be dependent on thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, and density (Jeff Moersch, personal communication, July, 2013). This raises the question: are there other factors that affect thermal inertia? If there are, finding these factors and accounting for them would result in more accurate conjectures concerning the thermal behavior of sediments on Mars and of the overall physical properties of the Martian surface. The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether porosity (space between particles) is another factor that affects thermal inertia. Analytical Approach: To determine the effect of porosity on thermal inertia, the heating and cooling curves of uncompressed sand and the heating and cooling curves of compressed sand (sand with less porosity) were determined.  Quantities of sand consisting of grains of 1 to 4 millimeters in diameter were poured into buckets (separate buckets for multiple trials). To keep the porosity of the sample constant, the buckets were not moved after the sediment was added. Each setup included an infrared thermometer and a heat lamp placed above the bucket. All the heat lamps were tested to ensure that they all produced the same amount of heat on a sample from the same distance (similar to the amount of heat the sun produces on the surface of Mars) and each infrared thermometer was calibrated along with the others. Each setup corresponded to the measurements in the image below:   Three initial temperatures (to minimize error) of each sample were recorded by using infrared thermometers. Next the heat lamps were turned on, and temperature readings of the center of the sample's surface were recorded at 30 second intervals for 60 minutes. This provided the heating curve of each sample. After 60 minutes, the heat lamps were turned off and temperature readings continued to be recorded at 30 second intervals for 60 minutes. This provided the sample's cooling curve.  To compress the sand, a bucket was placed on each sample and hammered down for two minutes. Then the same process of obtaining the heating and cooling curve was repeated for the compressed sand.   The average temperature of all the trials for uncompressed sand at each point of time was found and graphed. The same was done for compressed sand. Mathematical models of the average heating and cooling curves of compressed and uncompressed sand were found. Results:   Fig. 1: The average heating curves of compressed (red) and uncompressed (blue) sand. The black lines are the logarithmic lines of best fit for each curve.  Fig 2: The average cooling curves of compressed (red) and uncompressed (blue) sand. The black line is the logarithmic line of best fit of uncompressed sand, while the orange line is the logarithmic line of best fit of compressed sand.  Because the compressed sand started at a lower temperature than the uncompressed sand in both cases, to make the difference in initial temperature negligible, functions for the rate of change (the derivatives) of each's mathematical model were determined.    Fig. 3 a graph of the rates of heating for both compressed (red) and uncompressed (blue) sand.     Fig 4: A graph of the rates of cooling for both compressed (red) and uncompressed (blue) sand.    Though hard to notice in the graphs above, the red line was consistently—though marginally— higher than the blue line at all times in both graphs; this suggests that the compressed sand had a slightly higher/faster rate of heating and cooling than the uncompressed sand at all times.  Discussion: The compressed sand had a marginally faster rate of heating and cooling than the uncompressed sand, implying that less porosity results in a faster rate of cooling/heating (a lower thermal inertia). Normally, we would expect that the compressed sand would heat and cool slower than the uncompressed sand, since it acts more like a solid than the uncompressed sand. Therefore, there are two possible explanations for the contrary results of the experiment: either the experiment needs to be set up differently, or the uncompressed sand heats and cools faster because the sand to air to sand transfer is quicker than a sand to air transfer, since the uncompressed sand has more air pockets.  However, the difference between the thermal inertia of compressed and uncompressed sand—though measurable—wasn't large. The small, seemingly insignificant size of the difference in this experiment suggests that, while it may be a factor of thermal inertia, it does not appear to be significant. It is noteworthy, however, that the compressed sand consistently started at a consistently lower temperature than the uncompressed and remained at a slightly lower temperature throughout the experiment. Sources of error: The experiment was conducted in an air conditioned environment. There may have been changes in the temperature of the room, caused by the door opening/closing or the inconsistency of the air conditioning, that affected the temperature of the samples. The compressed sand also may not have been as compressed as we thought, as we didn't have a set measurement for its porosity, or we might have only compressed the surface of the sample. Additionally, the compressed sand started at a consistently lower temperature than the uncompressed sand, which may have impacted its rate of heating/cooling. Future Work: If this experiment were to be carried out again, the sand samples should be in a completely temperature controlled environment where only the heat lamp would affect the temperature of the sample. A quantifiable measure of the porosity of a sample would also be helpful, so that we could determine that the porosity had decreased. In addition, compressing the sand in layers would be a better option rather than trying to compress the whole sample at once. The initial temperatures of both the compressed and uncompressed sand should also be the same to ensure that the faster rate of heating/cooling was not just a byproduct of a lower initial temperature. Further experimentation would also be required to determine that porosity is not a significant enough factor of thermal inertia to require it to be accounted for in analysis of THEMIS data, and that disregard for it as a factor does not affect the validity of current models that identify the nature of sediments on Mars.
