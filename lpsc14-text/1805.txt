Introduction:  C-type asteroids are thought to be parent bodies of carbonaceous chondrites (Cchondrites).  The D/H and 15N/14N ratios of Cchondrites have almost the same values with the earth and the moon [1], which suggests that C-type asteroids are one of the candidate origins of terrestrial water by delivering volatiles from icy planetesimals to the inner planets [2].  Therefore, it is important to know the status of hydroxide and hydrated minerals on C-type asteroids. The Near-Infrared Spectrometer (NIRS3) is a scientific instrument on Hayabusa-2 that will be launched toward C-type asteroid 1999JU3 in late 2014.  It will observe near-infrared spectroscopy to detect especially molecular absorption by hydroxide minerals at 2.7 µm and hydrated minerals at 2.9 to 3.0 µm.  We started manufacturing the flight model after the critical design review in early 2012.  We then implemented ground performance tests for the NIRS3 flight model before and after environmental tests in July and November 2013.  We examined whether the performance satisfies requirements and collected data for calibration in the tests.  We also demonstrated to observe reflected spectra of samples of serpentine, olivine, and C-chondrites (Murchison, Murray, and Jbilet Winselwan).   Scientific objectives:  C-chondrites are classified into sub-groups by their composition, petrologic characteristics, and isotope ratio of oxygen [3, 4].  The spectra of C-type asteroids have also been classified into sub-types by their spectral slope and the existence of absorption bands from ground observations [5, 6].  However, the relationship between the sub-groups of C-chondrites and the sub-types of C-type asteroids has not been clarified because of the effects of solar radiation and space weathering.  Therefore, we will directly observe the surface of the C-type asteroid without the terrestrial atmospheric absorption at 3µm-band using NIRS3.  Detection of younger terrain by global mapping of the asteroid and of the ejector of newly created crater by the Small Carry-on Impactor (SCI) [7] will also provide surface spectra relatively less affected by space weathering.  To estimate the quantities of hydrated minerals with accuracies of 1-2 wt%, we determined the minimum requirement for the NIRS3 system to have a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) exceeding 50 at 2.6 µm for global mapping.  Thus, NIRS3 will shed light on the initial composition, aqueous alternation, thermal metamorphism, and space weathering of the surface of the C-type asteroid.  Instrument design:  NIRS3 has sensitivity at wave length of 1.8 to 3.2 µm, which covers the primary absorption band of silicates (1.9 to 2.3 µm), phyllosilicates (1.9, 2.3, 2.7, and 2.9 to 3.2 µm) and carbonates (2.3, 2.5, and 2.8 µm).  We adopted a new linearimage sensor using an indium arsenide (InAs) photodiode to extend the longest wave length from the 2µmband of the NIRS [8] of Hayabusa mission to the 3µm band.  We also incorporated passive radiator for refrigerating the optical and sensor assemblies to 193 K (-80°C) to reduce thermal noise.   NIRS3 consists of the Spectrometric Unit (NIRS3S) and Analog Electric Unit (NIRS3-AE), which are connected with a harness cable (NIRS3-HNS) [9].  Table 1 summarizes the characteristics and performances of NIRS3.  Optics in NIRS3-S includes a baffle, an objective, seven silicon-germanium (SiGe) lenses for collimating and focusing, a slit, and a flat transmission grating.  An electromechanically driven shutter is placed in front of the entrance slit to obtain a dark reference.  It chops signals to switch light on and off, and thus, eliminate dark-current noise.  The chopping frequency is adjusted to 100 Hz ±10% at 193 K and the readout frequency is designed to be about 100 Hz.  A flat transmission grating disperses the light toward the focal plane where the sensor is installed.   The InAs linear image sensor is installed at the focal plane assembly.  It has pixels of 128 channels and the spectral sampling of 18 nm / pixel, whereas the Hayabusa NIRS InGaAs sensor has pixels of 64 channels and spectral sampling of 23.6 nm / pixel.  The 20 times greater condenser capacity enables establishing high-gain and low-gain modes.  FPGA sets the integration time to 10, 20, 40, 100, 200, 250, 400, and 600 µs, 1, 1.2, 1.6, 1.8, 2, 2.5, 4, and 10 ms, and a stacking number from 1 to 1024 (20 to 210). The 0.1° field of view corresponds to the spatial sampling of 40 m per spectrum at 20 km in altitude in the home position observation phase.  It also corresponds to that of 2 m at 1 km above the surface when  Hayabusa-2 observes the SCI crater from the lower altitude.         Table 1.  NIRS3 Characteristics and performances.

Ground tests:  Figure 1 conceptually diagrams the ground tests for observing samples settled in the dish that is indicated by the red dashed eclipse.  Infrared rays from the black body source are reflected by the sample and two gold mirrors in a vacuum desiccator, and then injected into NIRS3-S which is refrigerated at -60 to -90°C in a vacuum cryostat.  The black body source emission is directly injected into NIRS3-S during amplitude-calibration tests.  Lights from a halogen lamp are injected into NIRS3-S through a monochromator during frequency-calibration tests.  NIRS3AE controls the inner calibration lamps, the chopper, and data acquisition by the sensor in NIRS3-S.  NIRS3-AE is connected to a PC through Space Cube®  which is a SpaceWire-based computer simulating the data handling unit and the mission data processor of Hayabusa-2. Results of flight-model tests implied that the dark current at the InAs sensor is much lower than that of the engineering model [9], which improves SNR.  The projected on-board SNR was confirmed to be sufficient during the one-year observation period of 1999JU3 assuming the asteroid surface temperature estimated from the heliocentric range and solar phase angle.  The SNR exceeds 300 after 2.5 ms integration and 1024-stacking at the home position observations.  It exceeds 60 after 1 ms integration and 64-stacking for the SCI crater observations.  The data obtained after the vibration tests and thermal-vacuum tests indicate that NIRS3 is sufficiently durable for the launching and on-orbit environments.  The observed spectra for samples of serpentine, olivine, and C-chondrites (Murchison, Murray, and Jbilet Winselwan) demonstrated that the derived reflectances are almost the same as those obtained by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy.  These design results show that NIRS3 has sufficient performance for scientific objectives.  References: [1] Saal A. E. et al. (2013) Science, 340, 1317-1320.  [2] Owen T. & Bar-Nun A.
