Introduction:  The topographic signature of a landform can give important clues as to its formation process. Since their discovery [1] the formation process of gullies on Mars has been under debate; ranging from completely dry processes [2], through hyperconcentrated flow and debris flow [3] to pure water runoff. Each of these processes involves a different amount and configuration of water and hence confirmation of one or another of these theories affects how we understand Mars' recent hydrosphere. Here, we have used topographic long profiles to study the process of gully formation on Mars. First, though, we studied topographic long profiles of gullies on Earth to both confirm previously published generalisations of how long profile shape varies with process [4-6] and also to use them as a direct comparison to the martian data.

Datasets and sites:  Long profiles of gullies on Earth were obtained from laser altimeter (LiDAR) data or differential GPS measurements. Two sites were used for the debris flow end-member: the Westfjords of Iceland (NERC ARSF 1 m/pix LiDAR) and the Front Range, Colorado (NCALM 1 m/pix LiDAR). Three sites were used for the fluvial end-member: San Jacinto, California, Death Valley, California (both NCALM 1 m/pix LiDAR) and La Gomera, Canary Islands (dGPS field data).  Long profiles on Mars were obtained from HiRISE stereo-pairs using the point-matching technique derived by Kreslavsky [7]. In brief it calculates the y-parallax at user-defined points using the geometrically corrected JPEG2000 images released by the HiRISE team as a starting point.  Matching points, such as boulders, were identified and digitised in both images. We have verified this technique against published full digital elevation models and rejected all those data which had errors greater than 20 units. Profile analysis:  Point samples were taken along the length of each profile, which extended from the top of the hillslope to the end of the gully-apron. Points along the line of the gully profile were digitised at 50100 m spacing, but this spacing varied according to the availability of features to match. Each point was classified as "alcove", "channel" or "debris apron" (Fig. 1). We used nine different characteristics of the profiles for analysis: start-to-end gradient, the overall range of slope, alcove slope, channel slope, debris apron slope, concavity (3 methods [8-10]) and the relative position of the maximal concavity.  We then performed canonical discriminant analyses, which allowed us to pick out the variables most important for differentiating between different groups. Canonical Discriminat Analysis (CDA) attempts to find a linear combination of variables that best separates groups. It uses a similar approach to Principle Components Analysis (PCA), but instead of maximizing the spread of the data it tries to maximize the difference between groups of data. Results:  We have compared 24 fluvial and 22 debris flow long profiles of gullies to 68 long profiles of gullies on Mars across 32 sites spanning 32-71°S and two sites at 41°N and 59°N. The three most important properties for separating debris flows from fluvial gullies on Earth were: the debris apron slope, channel slope and the curvature (Fig.2). This is consistent with the generally accepted relationships from terrestrial 2438.pdf

geomorphology: namely debris flow dominated alluvial fans are steeper [11] and fluvial profiles are more concave [12]. Hence, we have shown that these relationships also apply for gully long-profiles at the scale of kilometres. We find that, for this CDA, martian gullies overlap with both categories (Fig. 2), but lie closer to fluvial gullies. When a CDA is performed to separate fluvial, debris flow and martian gullies (Fig. 3), we find the three most important parameters are: overall gradient, alcove slope and curvature. For a given concavity value, martian gullies tend to be less steep than their terrestrial counterparts. This difference is expected if we assume that martian gullies obey the stream power law, for martian gravity a given fluvial gully should be less steep [13]. However, the differences are not so great as to enable the point-clouds to be fully separated; suggesting terrestrial and martian gullies share many attributes. Conclusions:  We have found that debris flow and fluvial gully long-profiles on Earth are morphometrically distinct - following similar relationships to those established for larger-scale features. Further, gully long profiles on Mars morphometrically resemble long profiles of gullies formed by both fluvial and debris flow processes on Earth. Also, we found that long profiles of gullies on Mars can only be separated weakly from those on Earth by slope, which can be accounted for by adjusting for martian gravity. We conclude that martian gullies probably formed by water-driven processes. Acknowledgements: We gratefully acknoweldge funding from the UK Leverhulme Trust and a PhD studentship from UK NERC.
