Introduction: The Renazzo-like carbonaceous (CR) chondrites cover a wide range of aqueous alteration, from minimal (QUE 99177) to extensive (GRO 95577) [e.g., 1−4]. Due to its higher surface area to volume ratio, fine-grained anhydrous matrix aqueously alters to secondary minerals (e.g., phyllosilicates, oxides, sulfates, and carbonates) more readily than larger components such as chondrule phenocrysts [e.g., 1,5,6]. Since matrix is generally the second most abundant component in the CR chondrites, after type I chondrules [e.g., 1,4], its composition significantly influences the whole-rock O-isotope composition of a sample. While the CR chondrites record a wide range of aqueous alteration [e.g., 1−4], the matrix O-isotope composition of only four CR chondrites has been determined [7]. We aim to determine the O-isotope composition of CR chondrite matrix across the whole range of aqueous alteration to determine: (1) the anhydrous composition of the matrix that accreted with the CR chondrite parent asteroid, and (2) the influence of aqueous alteration on matrix O-isotope compositions. Samples and analytical procedures: The Oisotope compositions of 14 CR chondrite matrix separates (Dhofar 1432, EET 87770, Gao-Guenie (b), GRA 06100, GRO 03116, LAP 02342, LAP 04720, MET 00426, MIL 07525, MIL 090292, MIL 090657, NWA 6957, QUE 99177, and Y-793495) and four CR chondrite whole-rock samples (MIL 07525, MIL 090292, MIL 090657, and NWA 6957) were determined at the Open University using an infrared laser fluorination system [8]. Whole-rock sample chips (50−175 mg)  were crushed/homogenized and ~2 mg aliquots were used for analysis. Due to the difficulty of obtaining clean matrix separates the amount of material available was limited (generally >10 mg per meteorite). Some of the matrix samples were not homogenized and instead two replicates of ~2 mg per sample were run using untreated material; the mean is reported here (Figs. 1,2). System precision for samples containing low temperature mineral assemblages such as aqueously altered carbonaceous chondrites are typically ±0.2‰ for δ17O; ±0.4‰ for δ18O; ±0.1‰ for Δ17O (2σ).      Results: The O-isotope compositions of CR chondrite matrix plot near the CR-mixing line (Fig. 1)  [1,4,7]. A linear least squares fit for the CR matrix data of this study (14 samples) on a three-isotope plot yields δ17O = (0.80±0.08) x δ18O - 2.74±0.22 with R2 = 0.977 (errors given are 2σ, R = correlation coefficient). In comparison, a linear least squares fit for the CR whole rock data (20 samples; [4], this study) gives δ17O = (0.69±0.04) x δ18O - 2.32±0.09 with R2 = 0.982. The O-isotope composition of CR chondrite matrix measured here ranges from -5.2‰ to 6.1‰ in δ18O, and      -7.3‰ to 1.6‰ in δ17O (Fig. 1). The matrix separates, relative to their corresponding whole-rock values [4, this study], are 16O-enriched for Dhofar 1432, GaoGuenie (b), MET 00426, MIL 090292, MIL 090657, and QUE 99177, and 16O-depleted for EET 87770, GRA 06100, GRO 03116, LAP 02342, LAP 04720, MIL 07525, NWA 6957, and Y-793495 (Fig. 2).   Figure 1. O-isotope composition of CR whole-rock and matrix separates [4, this study]; phenocrysts [10−13].  Discussion: The O-isotope compositions of CR chondrite matrix range in δ18O by ~11‰ and δ17O by ~9‰ in this study. The O-isotope composition of CR matrix is not always 16O-depleted relative to the wholerock value, in contrast to previous work [7]. This is likely due to multiple factors: (1) whole-rock Oisotope compositions are likely dominated by highly abundant type I chondrules (Fig. 1) [1,4], and may not adequately reflect aqueous alteration; (2) as many CR chondrites are minimally aqueously altered [3,4] the matrix is mostly anhydrous and records its initial Oisotope composition (i.e., 16O-enriched); and (3) as the CR chondrites are brecciated [e.g., 9] matrix likely contains minor amounts of 16O-depleted rock fragments such as type II chondrules [10,11] and dark inclusions [e.g., 1], and 16O-enriched rock fragments such as type I chondrules [e.g., 11−13] and refractory inclusions [14]. Although, if matrix samples were dominated by refractory inclusions or chondrule fragments, they would plot along the CCAM or a slope 1 [11,13] line, respectively; which they do not (Figs. 1562.pdf

1,2). Therefore these fragments are likely a minor component, and as they also occur normally in chondritic matrix (i.e., due to collisions during chondrule formation, accretion, and on the parent asteroid) their contribution is not considered a contaminant. Therefore, the O-isotope composition of the matrix is considered an average value of isotopically diverse components.   Figure 2. O-isotope compositions of CR whole-rock and matrix separate pairs [4, this study].  The whole-rock and matrix O-isotope compositions of QUE 99177 are the most 16O-enriched among CR chondrites (Fig. 2) [1,4,7]. QUE 99177 matrix is more 16O-enriched than type I chondrule phenocrysts (Fig. 1), indicating a distinct component. Therefore, despite showing some evidence for aqueous alteration [e.g., 3,6], the matrix O-isotope composition of QUE 99177 (δ18O = -5.2‰, δ17O = -7.3‰) is the best approximation of the primary anhydrous composition of matrix that accreted with the CR chondrite parent asteroid.  A key requirement of the hydration model of [7] is that the matrix O-isotope composition of an aqueously altered carbonaceous chondrite is more 16O-depleted than that of its whole-rock value due to hydration by 16O-depleted water [4,7,11]. This is the case for samples studied by [7] and some samples studied here. However, the matrix compositions of six CR chondrites studied here are 16O-enriched relative to their measured whole-rock compositions (Fig. 2). The hydration model of [7] predicts that these samples are not aqueously altered. However, that is not the case as even QUE 99177 shows evidence for aqueous alteration [e.g., 3,6]. Therefore, more work is needed to determine the implications of this data on the hydration model of [7].  Regardless, assuming that the O-isotope composition of QUE 99177 matrix is a reasonable approximation of the anhydrous component of all CR chondrite matrix, we propose that the degree of matrix aqueous alteration can be approximated by the degree of 16Odepletion relative to the 'anhydrous' matrix. Conclusions: The O-isotope composition of anhydrous CR matrix is now constrained, with QUE 99177 providing the most accurate estimate. As a result of its fine-grained nature, matrix is particularly susceptible to aqueous alteration and is therefore a more sensitive indicator of aqueous alteration than whole-rock Oisotope analyses. The wide range of aqueous alteration experienced by the CR chondrites [1−7] provides intriguing insight into the range of fluid conditions present on a single asteroid.
