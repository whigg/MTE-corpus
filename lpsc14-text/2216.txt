Dynamical evolution of the Earth-Moon Progenitors.   B.  Quarles1 and J.  J.  Lissauer1,1NASA Ames Research Center, Space Science and Astrobiology Division, MS 245-3, Moffett Field, CA 94035-1000(billy.l.quarles@nasa.gov)The origin of Earth's Moon has been a perplexingmystery for many decades.  Lunar samples have beenobtained indicating an age of the Moon to be roughly60-120 Myr [1,2] younger than the Calcium AluminumInclusions in the chondritic meteorites.  Updated measurements  indicate  an  age  difference  of  70-110  Myr[3,4].  Additional information has been obtained for thecomposition of  the  Moon relative  to  the Earth,  withsurprising similarities and differences.   However,  thecomplete story of the formation of the Moon has yet tobe told.Simulations of a Moon-forming giant impact usingsmooth particle hydrodynamics have been successful inproviding  insight  into  what  initial  conditions  are  required  with  respect  to  the  collision  parameters  andcompositions  [5].   But  the  mass  of  the  impactor  islargely unconstrained and can vary depending on thechosen model [6,7].   Using a dynamical  5 terrestrialplanet model we present results  that constrain some ofthis uncertainty and indicate a likely spatial origin ofthe proto-Moon if a mass ratio of 4:1 or 1:1 is assumedbetween the progenitors.MethodWe have developed  a  custom dynamical  model  (an  improved version of [8]) in which the orbital parameters  are  determined  seconds  before  a  collision.We investigate a parameter space of initial semimajoraxes and eccentricities of the proto-Moon.  The initialconditions of the proto-Earth are determined throughconservation  of  angular  momentum with  the  currentEarth-Moon system.  All other orbital parameters forthe other terrestrial and giant planets are taken from arecent common ephemeris.  Mass ratios of 8:1, 4:1, and1:1 are  considered  within a range of semimajor  axis(0.76 – 1.55 AU) and eccentricity (0.0 – 0.1).This model assumes a Solar System architecture ofgiant planets, however this may not have been the casefor  the era  in question.  Thus we investigate a Nicemodel [9] configuration for the 4:1 mass ratio to determine the possible consequences of the Nice model onearly giant impacts.Our simulations begin at a time where most material  has  been  cleared  from  the  early  Solar  System  (~30 Myr  after  CAIs)  and we evolve the system for200 Myr  or until a planet-planet collision occurs foreach chosen initial condition.  Completely inelastic collisions are  assumed.   We characterize  each  outcomebased  upon  the  collision  time  and  resultant  mergedmass.  A category of success describes a collision thatoccurs after  8 Myr and the colliding bodies  are the  proto-Moon and proto-Earth.  A pseudo-success occursafter 8 Myr with a collision that produces an Earth-likemass but the colliding bodies are not the proto-Earthand proto-Moon.  A collision after 8 Myr that doesn'tproduce  an  Earth-like  mass  is  denoted  as  a  non-SSmass.  If the collision occurs before 8 Myr, the simulation is characterized by the  early category and is notdiscriminant  to  the  resultant  merged  mass.   Caseswhere no collisions occur (stable) or a terrestrial bodyis  ejected  from the  system are  denoted  as  NC and  ejection, respectively.ResultsWe present  the results  of  a  high resolution set  of  simulations considering the 4:1  mass ratio  within a  Solar System like giant planet architecture (Figure 1).A total  of  8110 initial  conditions are  considered  to  fully  explore  the  parameter  space  which  illustratesmany interesting features.

Local  regions  of  success are  evident  in  semimajoraxis ranges of 0.80  – 1.00 AU and 1.08 – 1.30  AUwhere these regions have potentially different  causesfor success.  The interior region is dominated by interactions  between  the  proto-Moon  and  its  terrestrialneighbors.   The proto-Moon in the exterior region isinfluenced by interactions with its terrestrial neighborsand Jupiter.  This is shown with a comparison of thismap with the Nice model (Figure 2).From  comparison  of  these  figures  the  interior  (< 1 AU) region is almost identical while a more significant difference is seen at 1.165 AU.  In this regionthere is a strip of  success  outcomes in the case of theSolar System that are induced by resonant interactionsbetween the proto-Moon, proto-Earth, and Jupiter.  Atthis location we have identified a possible mean motionresonance  along  with  a  secular  perturbation  fromJupiter that could affect the long term stability of theproto-Moon.Much weaker features occur between 1.0 and 1.165AU due to mean motion resonances in both the SolarSystem and Nice model architectures.  Even though the1.165  AU feature  is  not  present  in  the Nice  model  simulations,  both  models  demonstrate  that  the  outcomes in the success and the pseudo-success categoriesare not uncommon.  Overall there were slightly  fewercollisions in the Nice model simulations where this isattributed  different  secular  perturbations  due  to  the  assumption  of  nearly  circular  orbits  of  Jupiter  and  Saturn.  In the model of the present Solar System, theseeccentricities are approximately 0.05 leading to largerperturbations affecting the proto-Moon in the exterior (> 1 AU) region.DiscussionConsideration  of  different  initial  conditions  of  a  5  terrestrial planet model have produced a wide varietyof possible outcomes.  However, not all these outcomesare equally probable.  Due to the dominant gravitational interactions,  some outcomes have a higher densitylocalized within the parameter space.  This is importantin  interpreting  the  likelihood  of  possible  outcomes.Additionally,  we have uncovered an interesting set ofdynamics that would have occurred among the terrestrial  planets through mean motion resonances.   Mostimportantly, we provide estimates of the likely formation region of the proto-Moon.AcknowledgementsThis work has been supported by the NASA Postdoctoral Program.References[1]  Hartmann, W.
