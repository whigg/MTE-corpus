Introduction:  We present a comprehensive spatial, temporal, morphological, and dynamical analysis of avalanche-cloud events [1] observed along steep northpolar peripheral scarps by HiRISE from all four northern spring imaging seasons to date. Continued observation of this phenomenon since their discovery has provided further information as to their nature, their source location and materials, related features, CO2 processes of the scarp environment, and cloud velocities. Background: These steep peripheral scarps reveal heavily fractured exposures of the north polar layered deposits (NPLD) and underlying exposures of alternating dark sand and fractured icy layers (basal unit, BU) [2, 3], and are easily 30°-70° steep and 100s of m tall (as contrasted with the gently sloping NPLD-interior spiral troughs). Some fractured slabs proturude nearvertically from the steep trend of the scarp, creating intervening space and casting shadows behind them (Fig. 1). The cloud events are here referred to as avalanches, interpreted to be most analogous to terrestrial powder avalanches of snow on rocky cliffs [1], but encompass any cloud-like form indicating or related to this process of mass wasting of scarp material (Fig. 1). MRO began its primary mission at Mars in late 2007, in northern martian summer, and is currently approaching its 5th northern summer. We here refer to the four years of spring "avalanche season" observed as Years 2, 3, 4, 5 (corresponding to Mars Years 29-32). Temporal Analysis: The location and frequency of image targeting has been motivated by the distribution of steep scarps around the pole and the detection of avalanches or other signs of mass wasting in earlier images. The HiRISE image survey included all north polar images of scarps with slopes >= 30° taken between Ls 340-70° (geographic summary: Fig. 2; timeline summary: Fig. 3). It is evident that only a few locations host all the avalanches. There is a clear seasonality to observed images: ~Ls 10°-45°, the first half of spring (Fig. 3). Both the last and first avalanches of the year are fairly consistently timed in all years. The perimage avalanche detection rate is fairly constant over the years (Table 1). Data suggests repetition and continuity of conditions promoting avalanche formation.

A similar plot of avalanche detections over local time of day strongly reflects the control of orbitcrossing opportunities (summarized in Table 2). However, with the use of large spacecraft rolls and descending node orbits, some daily sampling has been achieved. Both the 3:30-5:30 and 12:00-14:00 time periods have a similar number of avalanche detections per image, while the rate between 14:00-15:00 is 4 times higher. This suggests that while avalanches may be occurring all day (at least when the sun is up), there is a strong preference for mid-afternoon. Both the seasonal and daily findings are critical in considering models of avalanche-event initiation, including those involving winds, substrate thermal stresses, and frost sublimation activity. While these data apparently illustrate trends in avalanche activity over location, time of day, season, and multiple years, more rigorous constraints and tests of these trends is warranted, e.g.: detection normalization by kilometer of imaged scarp and (for yearly and hourly variability) limitation to the few  active scarps and to the active Ls season.

Scarp Analysis: As both a precursor to imageddistance normalization and to assess avalanche preference for aspect and slope of host scarps (as well as observation bias in this), we have mapped all polar scarp segments with sections >30° that have been imaged with HiRISE, and classified them based on aspect (down-dip direction) and slope (magnitude; Fig. 2). Scarp segments are defined by contiguous sections of scarp with constant aspect (roughly within ~30°-45°) mapped at 1:250,000 scale. The imaged-distance normalization is complicated because the relationship of images to scarps is often many to many. Slope characterization of segments is done by extracting the steepest pixel in the MOLA 512-ppd gridded dataset along the segment. Avalanches clearly prefer scarps with 100mscale slopes >50°. At the few scarps with high activity, finer-scale analysis of scarp aspect and scarp average or maximum slope corresponding to individual avalanche events can be determined by hand.  Morphological Analysis: Classification of on-scarp and on-BU portions of avalanches by gross appearance allows assessment of avalanche stage progression. On-scarp portion #Avs  On-BU portion #Avs  1: diffuse haze 6    1: just impacted 15  2: column or    2: nice run-out 24     dense cloud 59  3: isolated cloud 18 3: discrete stream 16  4: diffuse cloud 25 Table 3. Summary of cloud-event forms. The geographic distribution of "Uncertain" avalanche events (classified as such due to their thin, diffuse, low-contrast nature from which it is not entirely possible to rule out BU albedo patches) is coincident with nominal events, suggesting they may be reasonably included as faint examples of nominal forms. Most "Transitional" forms (classified as such because they have minor cloud-like feature(s) but also resemble large versions of small, bright, otherwise-featureless streaks ubiquitously appearing to "stain" many steep scarps) occur elsewhere to typical avalanche locations. The scarps between 180°-210°E especially are covered with the short, narrow white streaks and have the highest occurence of Transitional events. Furthermore, several avalanches that also display a BU cloud and/or scarp cloud also display individual or multiple discrete streams of material near their scarp-source end (Type 3, Table 3), such that a continuous spectrum of forms between streaks and avalanches appears to exist. This could mean that down-slope transport of fine frost material, in the form of streaks that are indistinguishable from surface markings, is wide-spread (explaining the apparent large accumulations of BU-blanketing frost aprons at the base of NPLD scarps where no avalnches are observed) and may be nearly continuously ongoing; the avalanches would be the most prominent endmembers of the process by which all steep scarps persistently shed frost. Source Analysis: Early spring images reveal that while the flat, smooth surfaces of scaly slabs on the NPLD scarp never appear coated in bright, relatively white material typical of CO2 frost, the ledges and crevasses between and behind the slabs do host exceptionally bright, whitish material that disappears from lower to mid scarp sections by mid spring. Also, the source and uppermost reaches of 26% of avalanches with onscarp portions are well-resolved and clear enough to pinpoint their origin at the edges of slabs, in cracks, or on ledges. Finally, the majority of avalanches have their highest extent on the lower or mid scarp, with only 3 on the upper 10% of the scarp and none at the top scarp lip. While the source frost material may be concentrated in these locations from direct atmospheric precipication or from movement of material from the shallower frostcovered slopes at the top of the scarps (where surface markings tracing down-slope movement are plentiful) or from the plateau above, the immediate avalanche sources are likely the irregularities of the scarp face. Velocity Analysis: The velocity of the moving avalanche clouds is determined similar to [1] with a correction for scarp and viewing geometry. The example in Fig. 1 is the quickest measured so far, moving downscarp at ~14 m/s and over the BU at  ~8 m/s. References: [1] Russell P.S. etal. (2008) GRL, 35, L23204 [2] Herkenhoff K. E. etal.
