Colorado, Boulder.We study the surface slopes of regolith on spinning, gravitating bodies to identify how they evolve across the surfaceof these bodies, the direction of failure for slopes that exceedthe angle of repose, and an analysis of how the shape of thebody may be modified based on these results. We find specificcharacteristics for body surfaces when spun to or near disruption and compare them with the observed characteristics of theclass of small, oblate and rapidly spinning asteroids such as1999 KW4 Alpha, Bennu and 2008 EV5.Introduction The angle of repose and conditions for globallandslides on the surfaces of small, rapidly spinning, spheroidalasteroids are studied. Applying techniques of soil mechanics,we develop a theory for, and examples of, how regolith willfail and flow in this microgravity environment. Our motivation is to develop an understanding of the "top-shaped" classof asteroids based on analytical soil mechanics. Our analysistransforms the entire asteroid surface into a local frame wherewe can model it as a conventional granular pile with a surfaceslope, acceleration and height variations as a function of thebody's spin rate, shape and density. A general finding is thatthe lowest point on a rapidly spinning spheroid is at the equatorwith the effective height of surface material monotonically increasing towards the polar regions, where the effective heightcan be larger than the physical radius of the body.We study the failure conditions of both cohesionless andcohesive regolith, and develop specific predictions of the surface profile as a function of the regolith angle of friction andthe maximum spin rate experienced by the body. The theoryalso provides simple guidelines on what shape a body may take,although we do not analyze gravitationally self-consistent evolution of the body shape. The theory is tested with soft-spherediscrete element method granular mechanics simulations tobetter understand the dynamical aspects of global asteroidlandslides. We find significant differences between failureconditions for cohesive and cohesionless regolith. In the caseof cohesive regolith, we show that extremely small values ofstrength (much less than that found in lunar regolith) can stabilize a surface even at very rapid spin rates. Cohesionlesssurfaces, as expected, fail whenever their surface slopes exceed the angle of friction. Based on our analysis we proposethat global landslides on spheroidal bodies will generally resultin the flow of material towards the equator.Surface Slope and Accelerations Assume the surface of asphere of radiusR is covered with regolith of a depthH wherewe implicitly assume thatH � R. The total mass of the bodyis M and is assumed to have a constant density. The regolithhas mechanical properties of a soil, with a friction angle φ anda cohesion c. We study the stability of the surface of this sphereas its spin rate is increased under some slow, exogenous effectsuch as YORP. With this model the surface accelerations arecharacterized by the total gravitational parameter of the body,GM , and the spin rate of the sphere, ω. At any point on thesurface of the body the total acceleration acting on the regolithis comprised of a radial and transverse acceleration:an = g0[−1 + ω˜2 cos2 δ]rˆat = −g0ω˜2 cos δ sin δtˆa = g0√1− (2− ω˜2) cos2 δω˜2where δ is the latitude, g0 = GM/R2 is the surface gravity, rˆ isthe radial unit vector, tˆ points towards the pole of the spinningbody and away from the equator, and ω˜ = ω√R/g0. Ifω˜ < 1 then the entire surface is spinning less than the surfacedisruption limit.Using the accelerations, we can define the local slope onthe surface of our spinning sphere. The tangent of the slopeequals the ratio of the tangential and normal accelerations.tan θ =ω˜2 cos δ sin δ1− ω˜2 cos2 δSee Fig. 1 for a representation of slope as a function of latitudeand spin rate. Thus we note that the slope is always zeroat the equator and the pole (for ω˜ < 1). Further, the slopeis always positive leading away from the equator, meaningthat the equator of a spinning sphere is the minimum point inthe surface geopotential. The maximum value of slope as afunction of ω˜ is found to be:tan θ∗ =ω˜22√1− ω˜2which occurs at a latitude defined by tan δ∗ =√1− ω˜2. Thusthe latitude of maximum slope occurs at 45◦ latitude for nearlyzero spins and moves down towards the equator for more rapidspins. At the same time, the maximum value of the slopeincreases with increasing spin rate, until it reaches a value of90◦ at the equator for ω˜ = 1. At extreme spin rates it is alsoinstructive to note that the slope takes on a specific structure.Let ω˜ → 1 to find tan θ = cot δ, or θ = pi/2− δ. Thus, eventhought the slope goes to 90◦ at the equator, it is limited to thecolatitude across the surface of the body. Specifically, in theregion of the pole the slope will always be low and close tozero, independent of the spin rate of the body.Ignoring varying gravity as a function of radius we candefine an effective height in terms of slope alone by integratingthe relation dh = R tan θdδ to find:h(δ, ω˜) = R ln√1− ω˜2 cos2 δ1− ω˜2See Fig. 2 for the effective height as a function of latitude andspin rate. The highest point is always at the pole and the lowestpoint at the equator. Thus we note that particle migration will1930.pdf

always flow towards the equatorial regions. The total acceleration, however, is minimum at the equator and maximum at thepoles. Thus we find the dichotomous situation where materialflows from the region of highest effective gravity to the regionof lowest effective gravity.Cohesionless Surface Failure and Shapes It is of interestto study the failure of the surface of a rapidly spinning sphereonce the angle of repose is violated. We develop an analyticaltheory that is applicable to the surface of a spherical body andapply it to predict the characteristics of the shape of a failedbody. Once the angle of repose of the regolith is exceeded(equal to the angle of friction), we note that portions of thesurface regolith will flow towards the equatorial region. In oursimple, analytical model we assume that this migrated materialwill ultimately settle into a zero slope condition at the equator(note, this is a strong assumption and will be relaxed in futureresearch). This is to be contrasted Minton [1] where surfaceswere formed at a constant value of angle of repose.Applying these simple failure rules we can predict theshapes of the surface of the spheroid as it undergoes failureat progressively higher spin rates. For a friction angle of 40◦we find a striking similarity between the profile of 1999 KW4Alpha and the ideal shapes predicted from the failure law (seeFig. 3). We note, however, that this particular asteroid shapemay also have been strongly influenced by the formation of itsbinary companion. In particular, there are different theoriesfor how such bulges form in the context of a binary system (seeWalsh et al. [2], Jacobson and Scheeres [3] and Hirabayashiand Scheeres [4]). To properly identify how such characteristicridges form requires the different competing theories to be fullyexplored and compared.To further test these theories we are developing a simulation model of surface regolith failure.
