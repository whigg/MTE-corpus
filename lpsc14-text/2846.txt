THE RESPONSE OF METEORITIC AND COMETARY MATERIALS TO NEUTRON BOMBARDMENT. C. S. Plesko, plesko@lanl.gov, Applied Physics, Theoretical Design Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory.   Introduction: The asteroid and comet impact hazard is in the forefront of public and scientific consciousness after the recent Chelyabinsk impact, the near miss of asteroid DA14, and the disintegration of comet ISON. A possible hazard mitigation method under consideration is deflection or disruption by nuclear burst. Before we can say with certainty that an explosive yield Y at height or depth of burst h will produce a momentum change in or dispersion of a potentially hazardous object (PHO), we need to quantify how and where energy is deposited into the rubble pile or conglomerate that may make up the PHO. One part of that energy comes from neutrons. Here I present particle transport models of energy deposition from a neutron source into various materials that are known PHO constituents. These models can be used to predict the Mean Free Path (MFP) of neutrons in the materials, where they deposit their energy, and any isotopic changes (in this case very small) that may be caused by neutron bombardment of these materials.  Background: Nuclear mitigation of potentially hazardous asteroids and cometary nuclei (PHO's) depends on the absorption of x-rays and neutrons by the target object, and how the object then responds to energy deposition. The absorption of x-rays has been studied experimentally by Remo et al. [1]. Neutron absorption by geologic materials in general has been reported in [2] .   The nuclear mitigation problem in porous rubble piles depends on volatilization of some part of the target. Neutron energy must be relatively high (>1 eV) in order to contribute to volatilization. Lower energy neutrons can interact with the crystal structure of a material (e.g. Bragg scattering), while the higher-energy neutrons in this problem interact with the atomic structure of the constituent elements. This simplifies the problem by allowing us to model nuclear cross-sections as weighted sums of the cross-sections of different elements and neglect further mineralogical details.  The cross-section of an atom depends on its nuclear structure, and can contain resonances, or narrow energy bands at which the probability of interaction is higher.  These cross-sections, including averaged values for chondritic populations of isotopes of various elements are determined by experiment, reviewed, and tabulated by several governing bodies.  Methods:  I use meteoritic compositions from [3], [4] and [5], [6] for the refractory component of cometary nuclei as representative small body compositions for these models. I then used these compositions and experimental nuclear cross-section data from [7] to make neutron scattering and absorbtion cross-sections for various meteorite types, devolatilized cometary refractories, and various mixtures of cometary volatile and refractory elements.  With these cross-sections, and the published estimates of the neutron energy spectrum from [8], I then use the MCNP particle transport code  [9] to calculate neutron scattering, energy deposition, and the possibility of isotope production in nuclear mitigation of a PHO.   Fig. 1: Estimated neutron energy spectrum of the nuclear explosion at Nagasaki, Japan. The higherresolution 2001 curve was used in this work. The ordinate is the spectrum in moles of neutrons per kt, per MeV, the abscissa is energy in MeV. Results:  Results for CI chondrite meteorites of a composition reported by [3] are presented here. Results for other compositions will be presented at the meeting.  CI Chondrite Cross-Section.  A neutron crosssection is the probability of a neutron interacting with a given material, as a function of neutron energy.  As described above, it is a mass-weighted sum of the cross-sections of the atoms that make up the material. The CI chondrite used here contains more than 60 different elements. The diverse composition of the object results in a relatively resonance-free cross-section because the resonances in the cross-sections of the constituent elemets average out over a heterogeneous composition. Objects that have more homogeneous compositions will have stronger resonance peaks.  Energy deposition as a function of depth.  Particle transport codes like MCNP use a source energy spectrum (Fig. 1) and target nuclear cross-section (Fig. 2) to model the interactions of  the large numbers of neutrons released from a nuclear device with the large number of atoms in the target material. For this energy spectrum and cross-section, the mean free path (MFP) 2846.pdf

of neutrons in the target is 2-3 cm of solid material. If the regolith were porous, the MFP would increase as ρ0/ρ, so for a regolith density of 1.5 g/cm3, the in-situ MFP would be 3-4 cm, and the energy deposition falls off approximately exponentially in the MFP [10].  1e-12 1e-9 1e-6 1e-3 1e+0 1e+3  Energy (MeV)1e+01e+11e+21e+3C ro ss  s ec ti on  ( ba rn s)                               Cross Section Plot                          Neutron Total Cross Sectionmcnp 6probid: 12/06/10 16:28:03      m100 nuclides  1001.24c  3006.42c  4009.60c  5010.60c  6000.60c  7014.60c  8016.60c  9019.60c 11023.60c 12000.60c 13027.50c 14000.60c 15031.60c 16000.60c 17000.60c 19000.60c 20000.60c 21045.60c 22000.60c 23000.60c 24000.42c 25055.61c 26000.42c 27059.60c 28000.42c 29000.50c 30000.42c 31000.42c 33075.42c 35079.55c 37085.66c 39089.60c 40000.60c 41093.60c 42000.60c 44101.50c 45103.66c 46106.66c 47000.55c 48000.42c 49000.60c 50000.42c 51000.42c 53127.60c 55133.66c 56138.66c 59141.50c 60143.50c 62152.49c 63000.42c 64000.35d 67165.66c 69169.55c 71175.66c 72000.60c 73181.66c 74000.21c 75187.42c 77000.55c 78000.42c 79197.66c 80000.42c 82000.42c 83209.66c 90232.66c 92000.  c  mt        xs -1       m100 Fig. 2: Nuclear cross-section of a CI chondrite, calculated using MCNP and [3]. The ordinate is is the cross-section in barns, the abscissa is  energy in MeV.   Isotope Production.  Neutrons can interact with an atom in a variety of ways. Sometimes the end product of these interactions are one or more daughter isotopes different from the original atom. There has been concern in the popular press that unstable iosotopes generated by a nuclear deflection attempt may prove hazardous itself. While the relatively large distances and relatively small masses involved make this unlikely, detailed estimates of isotope production may be derived from transport calculations like those reported here. The main components by mass of a CI chondrite are Fe, Si, Ni, H, C, and S. Of these, only 58Ni, about 70% of natural Ni, can produce an unstable isotope, through the reaction 58Ni(n,d)57Co, but the reaction has a relatively low probability, and is not predicted to occur by this simulation.  At lower abundances, phosporus, which is present at concentrations of 920 ppm, undergoes an n-γ reaction and produces 32P, 4.16 × 10−6 ± 0.003% g/kt absorbed by the target, which has a half-life of 14.28 days.  Conclusions: I am using the MCNP particle transport code, nuclear data from the ENDF nuclear data libraries, and compositions from published studies of meteorites and sample returns from Hayabusa and Stardust to explore the response of meteoritic and refractory cometary materials to neutron bombardment at energies relevant to the impact hazard mitigation problem. Mean free paths of neutrons in the target materials are of order 1-10's of cm for solid targets, and increase as the target density decreases. Daughter isotope production from neutron bombardment can be estimated, but for CI chondrites and other targets whose constituents produce predominantly stable daughter products under these conditions, the production of unstable  products is predicted to be vanishingly small.
