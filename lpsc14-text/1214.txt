MIOSOTYS: exploring the outer solar system small bodies with stellar occultations.   A. Doressoundiram1, F. Roques1, C.-Y. Liu1,2, L. Maquet1 and the MIOSOTYS team 1LESIA, Observatoire de Paris, CNRS, UPMC, Universit√© Paris-Diderot, 5 place Jules Janssen, 92195 Meudon, France, 2Department of Physics, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan.   MIOSOTYS (Multi-object Instrument for Occultations in the SOlar system and TransitorY Systems) is a multi-fiber positioner coupled with a fast photometry camera. This is a visitor instrument mounted on the 193 cm telescope at the Observatoire de HauteProvence, France. Our immediate goal is to characterize the spatial distribution and extension of the Kuiper Belt, and the physical size distribution of TransNeptunian objects (TNOs). We  present the observation campaigns during 2010-2012, objectives and observing strategy. We report the detection of potential candidates for occultation events of TNOs. We will discuss more specifically the method used to process the data and the modelling of diffraction patterns. 1214.pdf
