Introduction:  The carbonaceous chondrite (CC) meteorite found at Tagish Lake (TL) is the most carbon-rich chondrite [1] and by far the darkest meteorite ever found, with a reflectance of ~0.02 at 0.55 Âµm. This low reflectance is matched by <4.5% of the asteroids in the main belt and <0.02% of the Jupiter Trojans. This means that possible parents of TL are far fewer than those of CM-type meteorites (such as Murchison and Mighei), and they seem to be located preferentially in the outer asteroid belt (2.85-3.3 AU) [2]. Since a single spectral match had been suggested between TL and an asteroid (368 Haidea), we investigated the effect of solar wind ions, which could affect the reflectance of an asteroid but be absent on an unweathered TL sample. Although we found that irradiation produced a flattening and brightening of the reflectance in the visible and near infrared spectra, we saw variability between samples that points to heterogeneity in the composition of the meteorite.  Here we report on measurements of surface composition by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) supplemented by Raman analysis.  The experiments were done using a sample of TL crushed and sieved to a final grain size of 45-125 microns and pressed into pellets [2]. The XPS studies were done with the setup described by Dukes et al [3] and Loeffler et al [4], where both irradiation and analysis are performed under ultrahigh vacuum without removing the sample to atmosphere. The analysis area is 6 mm in diameter, thus the XPS results are averages over a large number of grains. Raman spectra of individual grains were acquired for the unirradiated sample in air with a Renishaw inVia Raman microscope at 488 nm in conditions of negligible sample heating.  Results:  Fig. 1 shows survey XPS spectra of a TL sample before and after irradiation with 1019 He+/cm2 at 4 keV. Fig. 2 shows high resolution XPS spectra of prominent photoelectron lines that indicate a loss of oxygen and carbon, as well as chemical changes in the C and Fe components. The reduction of the valence of Fe correlates with oxygen loss.  In Fig. 3 we report atomic concentrations as a function of ion irradiation fluence; the most prominent evolution is the loss of carbon. Fig. 4 shows Raman spectra from two grains of the sample, without subtraction of the fluorescence baseline. The broad bands are due to aromatic carbon in the graphite structure (G) and disordered (D) carbon [5]. The sharp lines in the top spectrum are assigned to highly forsteritc olivine [6].   1200 1000 800 600 400 200 0 01 23 4 O KLL Fe LMM Fe 2p Ti 2p O1s Mg KLL C1s Mg 2p Mg 2s Si 2s  C ou nts / 1 05 Binding Energy (eV) Si 2p 10 19 He +/cm 2unirradiated Al-K x-rays Figure 1. XPS survey spectra of Tagish Lake sample before and after ion irradiation showing the main elements on the surface.  Our carbon peaks are in general agreement with those in the Raman spectrum of TL published by Matrajt et al [7] but our spectra do not contain structure due to water as theirs and it differs in the Si-O region (they report a broad band at 1017 cm-1 rather than the multiple peaks at 823-965 cm-1.) This divergence, and the very different Raman spectra of different micron spots, as shown in Fig. 4, point to the need to take into account the heterogeneous nature of the meteorite in any comparison with asteroidal data.  We find that ion irradiation depletes carbon from the surface, which can explain the brightening reported by Vernazza et al. [2]. However, ion irradiation is known to darken mafic silicates [4] as a result of oxygen loss and formation of metallic Fe, as seen in XPS (Fig. 2). Thus, the net effect of the solar wind on asteroid reflectance will depend on the relative fraction of carbon (whose removal brightens the surface) and silicates (which darken upon irradiation).  From these results, we suggest that further comparisons between meteorites and potential parent asteroids need to combine measurements of visible albedo (dominated by carbon) and mid-IR spectra of silicate bands.    294 292 290 288 286 284 282 280 10k 15k 20k C-1s  In te ns it y ( Co un ts )Binding Energy (eV)  542 540 538 536 534 532 530 528 10k 20k 30k 40k  In te ns it y ( Co un ts )Binding Energy (eV) O-1s 740 735 730 725 720 715 710 705 40k 50k 2p 3/2 Fe 0Fe 3+ Fe 3+ Fe-2p  In te ns it y ( Co un ts )Binding Energy (eV) Fe 02p 1/2  Figure 2.
