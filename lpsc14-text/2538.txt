Introduction: Analysis of crater populations on asteroids Eros and Itokawa have demonstrated a significant depletion of small craters, those less than about 100m diameter, relative to the expected equilibrium population [1, 2].  Chapman et al. [1] considered various explanations for this depletion on Eros including infilling of small craters by subsequent larger craters, erasure of small craters by seismic jolts that occur during large impacts, a depetion of the impacting population by the Yarkovsky effect, and "armoring" of the surface due to numerous boulders that are part of the blocky regolith.  They note that the target aurface area occupied by the boulders is a small part of the total surface area, arguing aginst the armoring idea. They further presented qualitative arguments against the infilling and seismic shaking mechanisms.  Subsequent modeling [3-5] suggests that the Yarkovsky effect cannot produce the needed depletion of small impactors and that seismic shaking is consistent with the observed crater populations. Holsapple [6] suggested that the blocks may be outcomes of the domination of spall cratering mechanisms on small bodies less than a few tens of km diameter with strength. In any case, the question of the influence of large rocks and blocks on a surface, to the point of dominating the surface, is an important question. Güttler et al. [6] presented a recent study.  They impacted targets consisting of mono-size glass spheres ("grains") and varied the size of the spheres relative to that of the impactor.  They found that craters became irregularshaped and relatively flatter when the impactor size was comparable to the size of the spheres making up the target.  Additionally they found in repeated experiments that when the target grains were ~3x larger than the projectile the scatter in the measured crater size was about a factor of 2.  Impacts into targets where the particle size was a factor of 10x larger than the projectile did not produce recognizable craters.   However, those experiments were conducted at impact speeds of only a few hundred m/s.  In that case, an impact may little more than the energy to shatter a single large grain. They noted the possibility that cratering at the ~5 km/s impact speeds relevant to asteroid collisions might produce different results.   We agree with that assessment.  One should compare the impactor energy with that to shatter a largest grain, and not just the ratio of dimensions of the projectile to the largest grain. Here we summarize the results of experiments that reveal how crater size is affected by the size of the impactor relative to the size of the particles that constitute a granular target, at hypervelocity speeds for which the energy is much greater. The results are surprising. Experiments:  The impact experiments were a part of a study of momentum transfer in hypervelocity collisions performed using the vertical gas gun at the AVGR facility at NASA Ames. A description of the experimenal setup can be found in [8]. The targets consisted of either a fine quartz sand or gravel.  Three sizes of gravel were used (Fig 1) with largest (and relatively uniform) particle sizes of approximately 5mm, 15mm and 55mm. The projectile in each experiment was a 6.35 mm diameter aluminum sphere at normal incidence at 5.35±0.20 km/s.  That provided a ratio of projectile diameter to particle diameter of about 30:1 for the fine sand, down to 1:8 for the coarsest gravel.  An experiment was also performed in a roughly 50/50 mix of the fine (5 mm) gravel and the coarse (55 mm) gravel.   Fig 1.  The three gravels used in the present experiments.    The pre- and post-impact targets with the 55mm gravel is shown in Fig. 2.   Fig. 2.  The pre-impact targe of coarse gravel and the post-impact target.  The resulting crater rim is outlined in red.  projec'le) Crater&rim&  Crater profiles were measured with a 3D laser scanner with a spatial resolution of 300µm.  The crater volume and linear dimensions were determined from those scans and the pre-shot target surface elevation.  Results: The crater volumes and the radii can be compared to lots of data for other material using the groups πv	   	   or	   	  πR	   and	   gravity-­-size	   parameter	  π2	   di-­mensionless	   parameters	   commonly	   used	   by	   the	  authors	  and	  others	  [9].	  	  Here	  we	  compare	  it	  to	  rep-­resentative	  data	  for	  common	  sand	  materials.	  	  Fig.	  3	  presents	   the	   scaled	   radius	   data,	   and	   Fig.	   4	   the	  scaled	  volume	  values.	  	   Fig. 3.  Scaled radius versus gravity-size parameter π2.	     Fig. 4.  Scaled volume versus gravity-size parameter π2.	   Surprisingly,	   the	   data	   for	   the	   crater	   radii	   falls	  right	  on	  the	  curve	  for	  the	  dry	  sand	  data.	  	  That	  is,	  the	  craters	  in	  the	  coarsest	  gravel	  were	  the	  same	  size	  as	  in	  dry	  sand:	  they	  all	  fall	  on	  the	  curve	  for	  the	  point-­source	   results	   with	   the	   scaling	   exponent	  µ=0.41.  Considering	  that	  for	  the	  coarsest	  target	  the	  projectile	  was	  tiny	  compared	  to	  the	  grain	  size,	  that	  was	  not	  expected.	   	  We	  conclude	  that,	  when	  the	  im-­pactor	  energy	  is	  much	  larger	  than	  that	  to	  shatter	  a	  single	  particle,	  then	  the	  grain	  size	  has	  no	  effect.	   	   In	  the	  present	  experiments,	  the	  energy	  is	  on	  the	  order	  of	   50-­-100	   times	   that	   required	   to	   break	   the	   largest	  particle.	   	   That	   implies	   that,	   at	   5	   km/s,	   the	   largest	  particle	  size	  compared	  to	  the	  impactor	  size	  could	  be	  on	  the	  order	  of	  4	  times	  larger	  than	  in	  these	  experi-­ments,	  or	  with	  a	  size	  ratio	  of	  30:1,	  before	  suppress-­ing	   cratering.	   	   A	   1m	   impactor	   hitting	   a	   rocky	   rub-­ble-­-pile	   asteroid	   shielded	   with	   continuous	   30	   m	  rocks	  may	  have	  the	  same	  cratering	  as	  a	  fine	  granu-­lar	  surface.	  	  And	  that	  size	  ratio	  would	  be	  greater	  at	  higher	  impact	  speeds.	  For	  the	  volume,	  that	  simple	  result	  is	  not	  quite	  so	  true,	   there	   is	   some	   small	   scatter	  depending	  on	   the	  grain	  size,	  but	  the	  data	  centers	  on	  the	  dry	  sand	  data.	  Further	  experiments	  are	  appropriate	  to	  sort	  out	  the	  details.	  	  However,	  it	  appears	  that	  the	  effect	  of	  grain	  size	   on	   crater	   dimensions,	   at	   least	   for	   the	   cases	  studied	  here,	  is	  surprisingly	  small	  or	  absent.
