GEOLOGIC MAPPING OF THE TYRRHENUS MONS LAVA FLOW FIELD. David A. Crown and Scott C. Mest, Planetary Science Institute, 1700 E. Ft. Lowell Rd., Suite 106, Tucson, AZ 85719, crown@psi.edu.  Introduction: Tyrrhenus Mons is an ancient, eroded volcano located in the ridged plains of Hesperia Planum, northeast of Hellas basin. Tyrrhenus Mons (formerly referred to as Tyrrhena Patera) is one of the areally extensive, low relief highland paterae found in the circum-Hellas highlands [1-4]. The main edifice of Tyrrhenus Mons is 215 x 350 km; its summit rises only 1.5 km above the surrounding plains resulting in flank slopes of ~1° [5]. The volcano displays a central caldera complex (41 x 55 km), and relatively flatlying, layered deposits heavily dissected by radial valleys characterize its flanks [5-8]. Recent highresolution images confirm earlier suggestions that the flanks of Tyrrhenus Mons are composed of friable deposits dissected by fluvial processes. Formation of Tyrrhenus Mons has been attributed to large explosive eruptions in the Late Noachian Epoch that emplaced thick sequences of pyroclastic flow deposits around the volcano's summit for hundreds of kilometers [6, 9-10]. Subsequent effusive activity occurred in the summit region and also formed a large field of lava flows that extends to the southwest toward Hellas basin [6, 11]. As part of a new geologic mapping study across the upper reaches of the Dao and Niger Valles canyon systems, we are examining the volcanic landforms and geologic evolution of the Tyrrhenus Mons flow field. Tyrrhenus Mons Lava Flow Field-Previous Studies: Lava flow lobes were recognized in the plains to the southwest of Tyrrhena Patera in Viking Orbiter images, although this region was initially considered to be part of the ridged plains of Hesperia Planum, with no direct connection to eruptive vents associated with Tyrrhenus Mons [12]. Systematic mapping studies of the region using Viking Orbiter images defined the boundaries of the flow field and analyzed its surface morphology [6, 11, 13]. Viking Orbiter-based mapping indicated that the flow field extended for 1000+ km southwest from the volcano's summit, was connected to the central caldera complex via a prominent sinuous rille, and exhibited a series of lava flow lobes (with typical lengths > 50 km) and volcanic channels. Age estimates for various parts of the flow field from superposed craters observed in Viking Orbiter images ranged from middle Hesperian to Early Amazonian [13-14]; the most recent analysis using craters ≥ 5 km in diameter suggests a Hesperian age for the entire flow field [15]. Geologic Mapping: New digital geologic mapping studies using ArcGIS are incorporating THEMIS IR (100 m/pixel) and CTX (5 m/pixel) images as well as constraints from MOLA topography to characterize the volcanic geology and degradation of the Tyrrhenus Mons flow field. This mapping effort will result in an updated map of the flow field showing its spatial extent and the distribution of volcanic and erosional features, as well as provide new age constraints on associated volcanic and erosional activity. Initial research has utilized CTX images to examine volcanic flow lobes and volcanic and erosional channels. Volcanic Flow Lobes. THEMIS IR and CTX images allow improved discrimination of the numerous flow lobes that are observed in the flow field, including refinement of the margins of previously known flows [11] and identification of additional and smaller lobes (Figure 1). Most flow lobes have sinuous planform shapes and are oriented in a NE-SW direction, appearing to have flowed to the southwest along the shallow regional slope toward Hellas. Flow lobes have elongate, broad, and digitate forms; these morphologies are all consistent with lava flows, although lahars or debris flows may be identified within the flow field with further study. Lobes may have central channels and display lateral levees. Lobe widths are relatively uniform in medial and distal zones but flow widening is also observed [16]. Lobe margins range from subtle to well-defined and variations are observed both within an individual flow and between different flows. Some steep-sided margins are evident, similar to those attributed to flow inflation in other regions [e.g., 17]. Several lobes appear to be segmented, suggesting stagnation of the front followed by renewed advance.  Volcanic Channels. The prominent sinuous rille extending from Tyrrhenus Mons' summit caldera defines the northern margin of the flow field. The rille changes in character form a curvilinear depression to a leveed channel at the base of Tyrrhenus Mons and discontinuous segments of this leveed channel can be observed at distances of 650 km from the summit, suggesting it served as a major distributary feature for the flow field [11] (Figure 1). Flows are observed to both emanate from and bury channel segments, suggesting a complex history of flow emplacement. Other "channels" with likely volcanic origins occur in segments along the crests of local topographic highs and may delineate lava tube systems. Small sinuous channels are common within the flow field; some are associated with flow lobes and are likely volcanic and others occur in areas lacking flow margins and may have volcanic and/or fluvial origins. Erosional Channels. In addition to the sinuous channels described above, some of which may be 2471.pdf

fluvial in origin, braided channel morphologies and wide troughs are present that are best explained by fluvial processes with contributions from local masswasting. These are most common along the eastern and southern margins of the flow field near large impact craters, whose formation may have caused mobilization of subsurface volatiles. In addition, in several areas combinations of discontinuous channel segments and pits define curvilinear pathways that may delineate sapping channels. These are distinct from features interpreted to be lava tubes because they there is no apparent association with flow lobes and because they appear to cross-cut flow lobes and wrinkle ridges within the flow field.  Future Work: CTX images provide critical insights into the distribution, nature, and diversity of volcanic and erosional features that characterize the Tyrrhenus Mons flow field. Further geologic mapping studies and related morphologic analyses will determine important constraints on the volcanic and geologic evolution of Tyrrhenus Mons. References: [1] Peterson, J.E.
