Although the probability of such an event is remote, the consequences are so severe that we are well justified investing in a modest effort to minimize the probability. The impact of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 into Jupiter triggered intensive NEO search programs. Of particular interest are the potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) which approach Earth’s orbit. However, detailed knowledge on the physical properties of NEOs lags far behind the discovery rate. Understanding the nature of the near-Earth asteroids is critical to assessing potential impact hazards.     Analysis of NEO data from WISE has provided direct size determinations for a few percent of the NEO population [e.g. 1,2]. Taxonomic classifications are also available for a few percent of the population [e.g. 3-5]. Actual compositional determinations and/or identified meteorite analogs are available for less than 1% of the population. Although most NEOs are believed to originate from collision events on asteroids in the mainbelt, the pathways of these fragments into Earthcrossing orbits are known only in a statistical way. The PHA-NEO 2007 LE was discovered on June 2, 2007 by the LINEAR NEO survey. At the time, nothing but (H) was known, which provided a rough estimate of diameter. Methodology:  Near-infrared (NIR) spectral observations of 2007 LE and standard stars were obtained at the NASA IRTF on June 3, 2012 using the SpeX instrument [6]. Data reduction was done using previously outlined procedures [7,8]. The position of the absorption features and the relative areas of the features are diagnostic of the compositions and abundances of mafic silicates [e.g. 9-17). The NIR spectrum of PHA 2007 LE exhibits a single the absorption feature in the 1 µm region (Fig. 1). The band center was measured to be 0.96 ± 0.02 µm.   Several calibrations have been developed to derive mafic mineral compositions and abundances from spectral parameters [e.g., 13-18]. These formulas produce comparable results within their uncertainties. There is no discernable Band II in the 2007 LE spectrum. The increase in apparent reflectance beyond ~2.2 µm is the short wavelength edge of the thermal emission curve from the relatively warm asteroid. This thermal emission was used to derive the surface albedo (~8%) of 2007 LE using a technique pioneered by [19, 20] and reinvented by [21]. The albedo and H allows for the diameter (~0.54 km) to be calculated using equations developed by [22, 23]. The derived albedo & diameter are consistent with those reported by [24]. Analysis and Interpretation:  Based on the measured Band I center, one can constrain a composition for the pyroxene surface component.  Using the equations of [17], the pyroxene and olivine compositions would be Fs20 and Fa23. Asteroid 2007 LE’s spectrum most resembles that of the black chondrites.  The black chondrites are OCs that have experienced strong shock events that dramatically lowered their albedo.  The mineralogy comprising black chondrites is essentially that of the OCs as far as the metal content and olivine/pyroxene compositions [25-27]. Fig. 1 plots 2007 LE and the black chondrite Rose City [28].  The Band I absorption feature is consistent in position and depth with Rose City (7-9% deep).  Rose City is a complex H-chondrite, which experienced shock, brecciation, and recrystallization [29]. The H-type parent material was shocked to between 45 and 90 GPa [30] at either ~380 or ~2300 Myr ago [31].  Rose City has mineral chemistries ranging from Fa20-22 and Fs15-17 [29], while 2007 LE‘s mineral chemistries are Fs20±3 and Fa23±3.  The comparable compositions of H-chondrites are Fs14.5-18. The chemistry calculated from the Band I center of 2007 LE using equations of [17] may be high because the equations were produced from spectra of unshocked OCs and 2007 LE is shock blackened.  PHA 2007 LE’s albedo of 0.08 and Rose City’s albedo of 0.07 [28] are consistent within their uncertainties and further support the proposed link. 2007 LE is from a region of highly shocked material on the Hchondrite parent body. Compared to other shock blackened chondrites, the relatively slow cooling rate of Rose City [32] is consistent with a greater depth and a larger volume of shocked material on the parent body. Conversely, the size of 2007 LE is small enough that it need not sample a spectroscopically abundant lithology on its parent body [33]. The measured cosmic ray exposure age of Rose City (~39 Myr [34]) would represent the time since the meter-scale Rose City meteoroid was ejected from its immediate parent body. Discussion: 2007 LE was identified as a binary asteroid system [24]. Isotopic and mineralogical studies of the H-chondrites suggest they all derive from a single parent body, or more precisely from a single chemical reservoir in the solar nebula.

ment of the H-OC parent body which has been identified as the mainbelt asteroid (6) Hebe [36].  Dynamical models indicate the majority of asteroidal material delivered to the inner solar system originates from the 3:1 mean motion and the ν6 secular resonances [37-43]. [39] predicted that (6) Hebe would deliver 2.3% of its fragments into the 3:1 resonance and 83.9% of its fragment into the ν6 resonance. Hebe fragments are frequently delivered into Earth-crossing orbits, consistent with the fact that H-chondrites constitute approximately a third of all meteorite falls.   Asteroid (6) Hebe most likely suffered a major collisional event ~380 or ~2300 Myr ago that shocked a significant volume and/or ejected the ~0.5 km shock blackened PHA 2007 LE. Perturbations by the giant planets transferred 2007 LE into an Earth-crossing orbit.  The CRE age of Rose City [~39 Myr, 34] would suggest that 2007 LE was delivered into an Earthcrossing orbit through the slower ν6 resonance.  Once in near-Earth space, the Rose City meteoroid (and possibly 2007 LE’s secondary) could have been liberated from 2007 LE ~39 Myr ago by either 1) a small impact, 2) a gravitational encounter with the Earth during which tidal forces pulled loose fragments off [e.g. 44,45], or 3) spinning the asteroid by YORP effect until it underwent rotational fission [e.g., 46].  This is the first case where a specific meteorite has been linked to a near-Earth Object for which a mainbelt parent body has been identified. In this case the pathway leads from asteroid (6) Hebe through NEO-PHA 2007 LE to the meteorite Rose City.
