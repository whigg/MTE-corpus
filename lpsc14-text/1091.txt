 DEPTH-DEPENDENT MANTLE SOURCES FOR HIGH- AND LOW Ti-MARE BASALTS- AN INVESTIGATION THROUGH TRACE ELEMENT GEOCHEMSITRY. D. Ray1 and S. Misra2, 1PLANEX, Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad, India (dwijesh@prl.res.in), 2 Department of Geology, SAEES, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban- 4000, South Africa (misras@ukzn.ac.za).    Introduction:  The mare basalts, which constitute ~ 1wt% of lunar crust and ~17 vol% of lunar surface [1], are primarily classified into three main types on their TiO2 contents viz., high-Ti (H-Ti, TiO2 > 6 wt%), low-Ti (L-Ti, TiO2 > 1-6 wt%) and very low-Ti (VLTi, TiO2 < 1wt%) basalts [2], however, geochemical data on the third type of basalt is inadequate at present. The most precise radiometric ages suggest that the lunar Ferroan Anorthosites, representing the primary lunar crust, were formed at ~4.36 Ga [3], followed by the formation of H-Ti basalts between ~3.9-3.6 Ga, and L-Ti and VL-Ti basalts between ~3.4-3.2 Ga [2]. Another important type of mare basalt, known as KREEP basalts (i.e., K, REE and P-rich basalts), which are found either as basaltic impact-melts or as pristine basalts particularly in every site from where lunar samples were returned [2], were dated as ~3.85 Ga [4].  The interrelationship between the H-Ti and L-Ti mare basalts is not clearly known. While observation on collected samples suggests their bimodal association [2], the Clementine orbital data indicate the contacts between these two basalt types are gradational [5]. The Lunar Magma Ocean (LMO) model is the best known hypothesis explaining the origin of these basalts [6, 7]; however, the idea perhaps needs a second thought because the lunar mantle is recently found to have evolved in hydrous condition [8, 9]. In the present abstract, we review particularly the trace element geochemistry of the lunar basalts and show that the parent liquids of these basalts were generated at different depths of the lunar mantle with distinct geochemical signatures.    Geochemistry of mare basalts: The geochemical data on lunar basalts and glasses for the present work were collected from literature [8, 10-13]. The majority of lunar basalts typically have low total alkalies in comparison to those in the examples of terrestrial MORBs and CFBs, except the lunar KREEP basalts, which are similar to the terrestrial Archaean MORBs and show transitional chemistry between the majority of lunar basalts and terrestrial examples of basalts in TAS diagram (Fig. 1).  In the incompatible trace element spidergram, the average lunar basalts are almost flat except typical depletions in Rb, Pb, Sr and Eu (Fig. 2). The average KREEP basalt has the highest incompatible trace element content, which is higher even than those in the terrestrial OIB, followed by the H-Ti and L-Ti mare basalts, whereas the VL-Ti mare basalt shows the lowest content of incompatible trace elements, even lower than those in terrestrial N-MORB except few elements. The L-Ti mare basalts show incompatible trace element chemistry similar to that in the terrestrial EMORB, whereas the H-Ti mare basalt has chemistry between E-MORB and OIB, although it is moderately enriched in Nb and Ta, and significantly in HREEs. 01234535 40 45 50 55 60VL-Ti glassL-Ti-glassH-Ti-glass H-Ti--mare (WR)L-Ti--mare (WR)VL-Ti-mare (WR)Na  O+K  O (wt%)22Alkaline SeriesSubalkalineor Tholeiitic seriesBasaltBasalticAndesite AndesitePicrobasaltMAREPRArchean-MORBCIR-MORBDeccan-FBKREEPSiO2  (wt%) Fig. 1.

The available data suggest that all the HTi and VL-Ti basaltic glasses show definite trends of olivine fractionation but are concentrated on the olivine-orthopyroxene cotectic boundaries at 1.5 GPa and 1 GPa, respectively.

Plots of lunar basaltic glasses in experimental phase diagram on Olivine (Ol)-Diopside (Di)- Quartz (Qz) projected from plagioclase apex [15]. In the Pb/Nb versus Nb/U plot [16], all of the mare basalts are plotted on a hyperbolic mixing trend where the H-Ti basalts show Nb/U values that are significantly higher than those of any terrestrial examples, the LTi and KREEP mare basalts are plotted within the range of terrestrial basaltic rocks (Fig. 4).   05010015020025030035000.020.040.060.080.10.120.140.16Nb/UPb/NbTerrestrialBasaltN-MORBKREEPOIBE-MORBEM-1EM-2H-Ti-WRL-Ti-WR Fig. 4. Incompatible trace element ratio [16] plots for lunar and terrestrial basalts, EM-end member. Discussion: Distinctly different non-overlapping linear trends in SiO2 versus FeOt/MgO plot [17] suggest that the H-Ti, L-Ti and VL-Ti mare basalts must had distinctly different source rocks and history of magmatic evolution. The source of the H-Ti mare basalt is relatively SiO2 poor whereas the value is relatively high for  the source of L-Ti and V-L-Ti mare basalts, while source for the KREEP has the highest SiO2 (Fig. 1). Comparison with experimental phase diagram (Fig. 3) also confirm that the H-Ti and VL-Ti lunar basaltic glasses, which could be the least fractionated lunar magmas [18], evolved at different pressure corresponds to lunar mantle depth of ~300 and 200 km respectively (assuming a pressure gradient of 20 km/ kbar at outer portion of the moon[19]). The depth of magma generation of L-Ti mare basalts was between ~300-200 km. The Nb/U and Pb/Nb ratios are useful in tracing source compositions of terrestrial basalts as these ratios are least affected by either fractional crystallization or partial melting [16]. Our observation on figure 4 shows that all the lunar basalts are plotted on a hyperbolic mixing trend between end member (EM) 1 (which is unknown) and EM-2 (which is close to terrestrial N-MORB) [20]. The L-Ti mare basalts were derived from a shallow depth (300-200 km) lunar mantle, which could be broadly similar to the source of terrestrial E-MORB (or OIB). By contrast, the H-Ti basalts, which was generated at deeper lunar mantle (~300 km), could have a source close in composition to unknown end member EM-1. However, the trend of plots in figure 4 suggests limited mixing of these two different sources was possible during generation of different parent lunar basaltic magmas. Therefore, our study suggests a possible two fold stratification of lunar mantle, a deeper source (< 300 km), depleted in Pb and U, and a shallower (> 300 km) mantle souces, enriched in these two elements.
