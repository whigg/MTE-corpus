Reflectance spectrophotometry acquired by the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft is governed by the spectral resolution of, and spectral range across, data sets obtained with the Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS) and Mercury Atmospheric and Surface Composition Spectrometer (MASCS) instruments. Global and regional studies of Mercury's reflectance properties show variations in spectral characteristics and tie them to surface geological processes [1, 2] and elemental compositions derived from the MESSENGER Gamma-Ray and Neutron Spectrometer (GRNS) and X-Ray Spectrometer (XRS) [3, 4].  We have undertaken a search for spectral evidence of surface mineralogy related to specific geologic features.  Mercury's "hollows" are shallow, irregular, rimless, flat-floored depressions with high-reflectance interiors and halos [5,6,7], are fresh in appearance, and have reflectance that increases less steeply with increasing wavelength than the general spectral reflectance of Mercury.  Hollows are generally associated with crater walls, floors, and peaks and represent one of the distinctive classes of features discovered on Mercury's surface [5].   Early during the spacecraft's first Earth year in orbit, MESSENGER imaged the crater Dominici (1.4°N, 323.5°E) using both the narrow-angle camera (NAC) and wide-angle camera (WAC) on MDIS.  Figure 1 shows a high-resolution image of Dominici crater obtained with the NAC.  Two areas of hollows are apparent, in the center and on the south wall of the crater.  The hollows located on the south crater wall have brighter halos and welldefined depressions compared with the hollows in the center of Dominici.  This difference suggests that these two sets of hollows have undergone different histories of environmental processing [8,9].  We report here on the results of the examination of the south crater wall/rim photometry. A color mosaic of the areas we sampled near Titian and Dominici craters in the Homer basin region is shown in Fig. 2. The MDIS WAC images provide photometry across the visible/near-infrared spectral range, although they lack the spatial resolution provided by the NAC.  Seeking to isolate the hollows spatially in the WAC 8-filter color-image sets, we identified a range of latitude and longitude coordinates that outline and define this hollows region. We applied these constraints to WAC 8-filter color-image sets    Figure 1. NAC high-resolution image (CN0253965560M_RA_4) of Dominici crater (1.4°N, 323.5°E; ~20 km diameter ).  The hollows on the south wall of the crater have the highest reflectance.    Figure 2. Color mosaic of regions sampled near Titian and Dominici craters. The red, green, and blue channels are the reflectance at 996 nm, 749 nm, and 433 nm, respectively, derived from MDIS WAC filters. The regions sampled include intercrater plains (yellow outline), interior crater smooth plains (Titian, green), bright crater ejecta (blue), interior hollows (Dominici, red), and brighter crater wall hollows (Dominici, purple).  containing Dominici crater with spatial coverage at least 6 pixels in areal extent, and we hand-picked the pixels from each set to sample the hollows on the floor and southern wall/rim of Dominici in addition to sampling regions within the local ejecta field. The reflectance data (expressed as I/F, where I is light reflected from Mercury's surface and F is incident sunlight) have been corrected for global geometric effects.   We identify an absorption feature in two color sets of the bright wall hollows of Dominici crater ranging in wavelength from near 480 to 630 nm, centered near 559 nm (Fig. 3).  Figure 4 compares the I/F for the Dominici bright wall hollows with three nearby areas external to the crater, within one of the color-image sets examined. We confirm that the lower-spatialresolution global color mosaic also shows an absorption feature for the bright wall/rim hollows.  We are unable to confirm the feature with existing MASCS spectra as the MASCS observational footprints encompass enough surrounding darker terrain to diminish any potential absorption feature.  Targeted MASCS spectral transects focused on the Dominici wall/rim hollows, and for which inclusion of surrounding terrain within the instrument footprint is minimized, have been scheduled.  On first look, this absorption feature is consistent with laboratory spectra of heated sulfide powders, such as oldhamite (CaS), as analogs for Mercury's surface material [10,11]. The spectral range is consistent with the feature present in spectra for CaS, which has been identified as a potential sulfur-bearing phase for Mercury on the basis of the correlation between the elemental abundances of sulfur and calcium as observed by the XRS  [3,4] . The laboratory absorption feature for heated CaS is shallower, however, than the absorption observed in the MDIS color data.  One possible explanation for this difference in band depth is a difference in particle size between the material on Mercury and the laboratory sample. Generation of sulfides as a result of impact melt formation on Mercury has been extensively modeled [12,13]. As a result of this modeling, CaS is predicted to be the major lithophile sulfide on Mercury [13].  Collectively, these lines of investigation support the identification of CaS as part of the bright wall/rim hollows material.          Figure 3.

The spectral coverage of the potential feature estimated to be near 559 nm is marked by the green horizontal bar beginning at a lower wavelength of 470 nm.   Figure 4.
