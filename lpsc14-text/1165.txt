Introduction:  During planetary processes such as the differentiation and cooling of bodies, the composition of metallic liquids can dramatically affect the partitioning behavior of elements. In particular, the “light element” content of a metallic liquid – those elements that are present in the liquid at wt% levels with atomic numbers much lower than Fe – can have a significant influence. Understanding how light elements such as S, P, and C affect partitioning behavior is critical for explaining planetesimal differentiation, large-scale planetary core formation, and core crystallization. The influence of the light elements S [e.g. 1], P [e.g. 2], and C [e.g. 3] has been the focus of a number of previous studies. However, a limitation of these studies was that the parameterizations of the partitioning behaviors were not constrained to be consistent in the light-element-free Fe-Ni system. The purpose of this work is to determine experimentally the partitioning behavior of trace elements in the Fe-Ni system and to produce consistent parameterization expressions.  Method:  Experiments to produce coexisting solid metal and liquid metal phases were conducted in a 1 atm vertical tube furnace. Powdered starting compositions (mixtures of Fe, Ni, FeS, and P powders doped with >20 trace elements at hundreds of ppm each) were placed in high purity silica tubes, evacuated, and sealed in a similar fashion to previous experimental partitioning studies in metallic systems [e.g. 1-3]. Three experiments were conducted in the Fe-Ni system at 1500°C for ~7-12 hours and produced consistent partitioning results; a typical run product is shown in Fig. 1. Six additional experiments were conducted in the Fe-Ni-S and Fe-Ni-P systems with low concentrations of either S or P. These experiments were run at temperatures of 1400-1475°C for ~24 hours to better constrain partitioning behaviors at low light element concentrations. No new experiments were conducted in the Fe-Ni-C system. Experiments were first analyzed for the major elements of Fe, Ni, S, and P using a JEOL 8900L electron microprobe at the Carnegie Institution of Washington. Trace element concentrations were measured by laser ablation ICP-MS microanalysis at the University of Maryland. Results: In total, partitioning results were obtained for 24 elements. As one example, Fig. 2 shows the results for Au. The partition coefficient, D(E), is the ratio of the weight concentration of an element E in the solid metal to that in the liquid metal. The partition coefficient for the light-element-free Fe-Ni system is defined as D0, and the new value determined by our experiments is shown in Fig. 2, with an error of twice the weighted standard deviation of our three runs. The other experimental data points shown on Fig. 2 include our six new experiments at low S and P concentrations as well as the data from numerous previous experimental studies (compiled in [1-5]). Previous parameterizations [e.g. 4, 5] treated D0 as a free variable in the fits, which allowed different values for D0 depending on the parameterization approach and light element data used. Our new experimental determinations of D0 enable this value to be fixed and produce a consistent set of parameterization expressions for all light-element-bearing Fe-Ni systems. Our new parameterization expressions use the approach detailed in [5]. For a trace element E in a system with light element i, D(E) can be calculated by the equation:   ln(D(E)) = ln(D0 ) + βiln(Fe Domains) (1)  where Fe Domains is defined as the fraction of free Fe atoms available in the liquid metal and βi is a constant specific to the element being fit and the light element i. Fe Domains is parameterized using a speciation of FeS for the Fe-Ni-S system, Fe3P in the Fe-Ni-P system, and Fe3C in the Fe-Ni-C system as follows: Fe Domains =1− 2XS1− XSfor FeS  1− 4XP1−3XPfor Fe3P1− 4XC1−3XCfor Fe3C"#$$$$%$$$$(2)  Figure 1: Back-scattered electron image of a typical Fe-Ni run product.

where Xi corresponds to the molar fraction of light element i in the liquid. For example, in the Fe-Ni-S system, as the liquid metal composition approaches ≈36wt% S, the Fe Domains fraction goes to zero because there is one S atom for every Fe atom (to produce FeS). The value of D0 was fixed for each element based on our new experimental results, and βi was determined by linear regressions of all data. The resulting parameterization fits for Au are shown in Fig. 2, and Table 1 provides the fit coefficients for all elements. Overall, the parameterization model is able to reproduce the large changes in D due to the presence of S, P, or C in the metallic liquid. However, finer details of the partitioning behaviors of specific elements can deviate from this simple model, such as for D(Au) in the low S system, as shown in Fig. 2. Additionally, to model systems with multiple light elements, at present, we recommend using a weighted average of the systems involved, as proposed by [4], as the identity of the light element results in different βi values, in contrast to the theory presented by [5].  Figure 2: Experimental and parameterization results for Au. The black square shows the D0 value determined by this study in the Fe-Ni system. The new expressions for the S, P, and C-bearing systems were constrained to use this D0 value. The parameterized lines end at the eutectic points of their respective systems.
