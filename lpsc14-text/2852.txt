Introduction: New small craters on Mars are sometimes surrounded by a roughly circular dark area that is generally larger than its ejecta and any associated rays (Figure 1). This circular area is interpreted as an "airblast" [1, 2, 3], wherein the shockwave propagating through the atmosphere blows away or otherwise disturbs a layer of dust surrounding the new crater (or craters, in the event of an atmospheric breakup of the projectile [4].) Previous work has indicated that the airblast diameter is not correlated with crater diameter [1, 5]. Approximately 250 new martian impact craters have been discovered to have formed on Mars [6]. For each of these craters there are images of Mars taken both before and after the impact, thus we know that these impacts are less than about 10 years old. Many of these impact sites exhibit the airblast feature. Because the airblast is large and dark, it makes the new, small impact much easier to identify from orbital imagery. In this work we perform systematic diameter measurements of a number of these airblast features and their central craters to ascertain what controls the diameter of the airblast. Method and Results: At each impact site with an airblast feature, we used JMars [7] to measure both the crater diameter(s) and the airblast diameter. In the cases where the projectile broke up within the atmosphere and produced multiple impacts within a single airblast, we calculated an effective crater diameter by taking the cube root of the sum of the cubes of each individual crater diameter [1, 6]. Our initial study of 20 airblast features showed no consistent relationship between airblast diameter and crater diameter, consistent with previous studies [1, 5]. There are multiple reasons that may explain why the data are so scattered. For example, factors that could affect airblast diameter include the amount of dust cover on the surface, the elevation of the impact site, and impact velocity. But another reason could be the age of the airblast; if the airblast fades with time the airblast radius will shrink. We know all the airblasts studied here are very young - less than ten years. However, current work is showing that the airblast features sometimes shrink and disappear on very short time scales, as short as just a year or two [8]. Thus, age is likely a very large source of Figure 1: A: An airblast observed in HiRISE image ESP_013893_1755. Airblast diameter is approximately 1 km.

Therefore, to better understand the relationship between airblast diameter and crater diameter, we look for a way to control all these variables. We found such a situation in HiRISE image ESP_014010_1800 (Figure 2). In this case, the projectile broke up very high in the atmosphere, resulting in each fragment having its own atmospheric shock wave and creating its own airblast feature. Because of this process, each of these airblasts was created at the same time, on the same terrain, with the same type of projectile, traveling at the same speed. Thus,  Figure 2: Airblasts (green) and impact craters (pink) from one impact event, observed in HiRISE image ESP_014010_1800. the only variable left to consider is projectile diameter. We measured the airblast diameters and crater diameters in this image. The result is plotted in Figure 3. This data is found to be tightly constrained by a power law: y = 3.12x1.96. Thus we find that airblast diameter is proportional to crater diameter squared. We have continued examining additional new impact sites. To date we have examined about 70 of these impact sites. 20 of the sites did not have the airblast features. The remaining 50 did. We find that with the increased numbers, although the scatter is still significant, a definite trend appears. We plot (Figure 4) diameter vs. effective crater diameter (cube root of sum of cubes of all craters within the airblast.) There is a lot of scatter in the data, but the general trend matches that found for the airblasts observed in HiRISE image ESP_014010_1800; a line of y = 3.12x1.96 is plotted on this graph for comparison. Discussion and Conclusion: Thus we find that airblast diameter is proportional to crater diameter squared. This result is an important constraint for models of airblast formation. It will also permit additional interpretation of airblasts that lack sufficient context to be understood alone. Finally, understanding airblasts on Mars may be important for developing engineering constraints for possible human habitats on Mars. References [1] M. C. Malin, et al.
