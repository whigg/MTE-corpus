This circular area is interpreted as an“airblast” [1, 2, 3], wherein the shockwave propagating through the atmosphere blows away or otherwisedisturbs a layer of dust surrounding the new crater (orcraters, in the event of an atmospheric breakup of the projectile [4].) Previous work has indicated that the airblastdiameter is not correlated with crater diameter [1, 5].Approximately 250 new martian impact craters havebeen discovered to have formed on Mars [6]. For each ofthese craters there are images of Mars taken both beforeand after the impact, thus we know that these impacts areless than about 10 years old. Many of these impact sitesexhibit the airblast feature. Because the airblast is largeand dark, it makes the new, small impact much easier toidentify from orbital imagery. In this work we performsystematic diameter measurements of a number of theseairblast features and their central craters to ascertain whatcontrols the diameter of the airblast.Method and Results: At each impact site with an airblast feature, we used JMars [7] to measure both thecrater diameter(s) and the airblast diameter. In the caseswhere the projectile broke up within the atmosphere andproduced multiple impacts within a single airblast, wecalculated an effective crater diameter by taking the cuberoot of the sum of the cubes of each individual crater diameter [1, 6].Our initial study of 20 airblast features showed noconsistent relationship between airblast diameter andcrater diameter, consistent with previous studies [1, 5].There are multiple reasons that may explain why the dataare so scattered. For example, factors that could affectairblast diameter include the amount of dust cover on thesurface, the elevation of the impact site, and impact velocity. But another reason could be the age of the airblast; if the airblast fades with time the airblast radiuswill shrink. We know all the airblasts studied here arevery young – less than ten years. However, current workis showing that the airblast features sometimes shrinkand disappear on very short time scales, as short as just ayear or two [8]. Thus, age is likely a very large source ofFigure 1: A: An airblast observed in HiRISE imageESP_013893_1755. Airblast diameter is approximately1 km.

We found such a situation in HiRISE image ESP_014010_1800 (Figure 2). Inthis case, the projectile broke up very high in the atmosphere, resulting in each fragment having its own atmospheric shock wave and creating its own airblast feature.Because of this process, each of these airblasts was created at the same time, on the same terrain, with the sametype of projectile, traveling at the same speed.

Figure 2: Airblasts (green) and impact craters (pink)from one impact event, observed in HiRISE imageESP_014010_1800.the only variable left to consider is projectile diameter.We measured the airblast diameters and crater diametersin this image. The result is plotted in Figure 3. Thisdata is found to be tightly constrained by a power law:y= 3.12x1.96. Thus we find that airblast diameter is proportional to crater diameter squared.We have continued examining additional new impactsites. To date we have examined about 70 of these impact sites. 20 of the sites did not have the airblast features. The remaining 50 did. We find that with the increased numbers, although the scatter is still significant,a definite trend appears. We plot (Figure 4) diameter vs.effective crater diameter (cube root of sum of cubes ofall craters within the airblast.) There is a lot of scatter inthe data, but the general trend matches that found for theairblasts observed in HiRISE image ESP_014010_1800;a line of y = 3.12x1.96 is plotted on this graph for comparison.Discussion and Conclusion: Thus we find that airblastdiameter is proportional to crater diameter squared. Thisresult is an important constraint for models of airblastformation. It will also permit additional interpretationof airblasts that lack sufficient context to be understoodalone. Finally, understanding airblasts on Mars may beimportant for developing engineering constraints for possible human habitats on Mars.References[1] M. C. Malin, et al.
