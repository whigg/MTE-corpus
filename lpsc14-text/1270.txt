These forms have been seen in imagery from Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) and High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) imagery.  Many authors studied gullies attempting to determine the processes creating them [1-6]. Gullies historically have been treated in the literature as a single group of morphological forms with a single process of formation.  Because we know that gully-like forms on Earth are created by a number of different processes, it is logical to assume that numerous processes are working on Mars to create gullies [2,7].  A classification of gully forms was developed based on the combination of morphological components visible on each gully. The objective of the development of the classification is to identify distinct groups of gullies with similar morphologies which may indicate similar modes of formation for further investigation. Methods:  Images from the first 25,000 orbits of the HiRISE website were inspected and 866 were observed using Environment for Visualizing Images (ENVI) 4.4, a software program designed by ITT Visual Information Solutions.   Within ENVI morphometric components of each gully along with total gully length were measured and this data along with the lat/long of each gully was recorded in a database created in the FileMaker® Pro software.  A map of image locations (Fig. 1) was created using Excel to plot the lat/long data to verify that the martian surface was being well sampled.  Figure 1 Image Location Map.  A map of the image locations created by plotting the lat/long data for each imaged as a scatter plot chart. This allowed the images in the database to be seen in their relative positions on Mars.

First was an erosional alcove forming as cohesive forces holding sediments together are overcome by the flow.  Second was a transportational channel that sediments flowed through to the apron.  The third component was a depositional apron that formed at the bottom of the gully as the flow lost velocity and sediments settled out. Figure 2 Gully components.  The gully from a section of ESP_012741_1115 shows a typical alcove, channel and apron.  The alcove forms on the upper portion of the slope and widens through backward erosion.  The flow moves across the surface incorporating sediments and cutting the typical Vshaped morphology of the channel.  Sediments are dropped and settle out of the flow as the apron as velocity of the flow drops.  Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona. Results: Seven classes of gullies were identified based on an analysis of their morphometric components.  The number of gullies in each class is shown in Table 2.  Numerous measurements were collected on each gully and maps of the distribution of each type were created.  A few of these results are reported here. Table 1 Gully Classification.  The number of each gully type along with their percentage of the total number of gullies ednitified. Gully Type Number Percentage Classic 2946 39.2% Complex 1503 20% Gully Lacking an Alcove 143 1.9% Gully Lacking Channels 423 5.6% Abbreviated Alcove 314 4.2% Linear 358 4.8% Mantled 1832 24.3% Total 7519 100% Classic gullies.  The originally identified alcovechannel-apron gullies range up to 3959 m in length.  Classic gullies occur across the globe but are concentrated in two bands.  The more prominent band, with 75% of Classic gullies, lies between 31º and 51ºS with the minor band, containing 12.5%, extends from 23º to 57ºN.   Complex gullies.  Complex gullies also include the alcove-channel-apron morphology but contain multiples of one or more components. They may be as long as 3365 m. Complex gullies also occur in two bands with 75% of them lying between 32º and 49ºS.  In the northern hemisphere they are not concentrated in a band. Gullies Lacking an Alcove.  These gullies lack an alcove.  They exist as a channel that may or may not have an apron. Primarily between 31º and 46º S but are spread across the globe in association with Classic gullies. Gullies Lacking Channels.  These gullies lack an incised channel.  They contain a typical alcove and apron, but the V-shaped channel is missing.  Gullies lacking channels occur from 47º S across the equator to 43º N.  They are more likely to occur on East/West facing slopes than either Classic or Complex gullies Abbreviated Alcove gullies.  Abbreviated alcoves gullies emanate directly from an overlying layer that stopped development of the alcove.  71% occur primarily in a band in the southern hemisphere from 33º to 42º S. Linear gullies.  Linear gullies have very small triangular alcoves or no alcove.  The elongated channels contain levees and there is no apron.  These gullies have only been identified in Russel Crater and two small carters near Newton Crater.  Classic gullies are seen on images with the Linear gullies Mantled gullies.  Mantled gullies are those that have been mantled by unconsolidated debris so that the components are difficult to identify at available resolution.  The majority (70%) occur in bands from 30º to 60º on each hemisphere, but they are seen in almost all images that contain any type of gully. Discussion:  Using our understanding of terrestrial geology to  instruct our study of Mars it becomes clear that the group of forms called gullies are diverse in their morphologies and needs to be separated into distinct groups for further study. Classic gullies.  Classic gullies correlate to Type A2 and both B1 and B2 variants in the Aston et al. classification [8].  The formation of levees on the channel constrain their formation to quick flows of water-sediment mixtures so debris flows are the best analog for their formation [9]. Complex gullies.  Complex gullies usually exhibit redirection in the flow due to changes in the topography of the flow.  This suggests that these may be reactivated gullies.  Braiding in the channels on Earth has been shown to occur in gullies with a higher slope and/or flow rate [10], which suggests that they may have a higher flow rate than Classic gullies. Gullies Lacking an Alcove.  These gullies correlate to Type A gullies by Aston et al. [8].  They occur only within the mantling material.  Their short length, lack of alove and lack of levees show that they are formed by a lower volume or velocity than that forming Classic and Complex gullies [9]. Gullies Lacking Channels.  The lack of a V-shaped channel is characteristic of this class.  Cumulative area distribution plots and a lack of channels have been used to suggest mass wasting and an unnamed process for gullies in Terra Sirenum [9] in this class.  Using the form-process paradigm being developed for Mars we can extend this masswasting process to this class of gullies.   Abbreviated Alcove gullies.  These gullies fail to develop a complete alcove.  They are seen in both Type A2 and B1 gullies in Aston et al. [8].  A welllithified layer in the bedrock remains in the surface and is not eroded by the development of the alcove.  Linear gullies.  Linear gullies form through a unique set of processes that are significantly different than previously discussed gullies [11, 12].  These gullies begin with ground ice melting which initiates a debris flow just above a near-surface permafrost [11].  The final deposit which is significantly water-rich disappears when the water is lost.   Mantled gullies.  Mantling has been seen across the globe.  This class consists of ancient gullies that have been obscured by the mantling material that has fallen into them or by erosion of the sediments. Conclusions: Analysis of the gullies resulted in the development of seven classes of gullies based on the morphology of each.  Having identified these distinct morphologies, the need to focus research on the formation processes for each distinct class becomes apparent.  This will allow further development of a formprocess paradigm for Mars that can be used as more imagery becomes available. References:  [1] Christensen, P.R.
