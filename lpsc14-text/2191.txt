Introduction: Shergottites represent over three quarters of the known Martian meteorites (SNC) after nakhlites and chassignites. Shergottites are broadly divided into basaltic, olivine-phyric and lherzolitic groups based on their mineralogy. SNC meteorites from Northwest Africa (NWA) make up the largest source of samples from Mars and their study has added to our understanding of the Red Planet. In particular, NWA 7034 [1], NWA 5298 [2] and NWA 7533 [3] have provided unique insights about upper and lower mantle conditions and the long-debated mysteries of the origin and age of the shergottites. Recent study of crystal-melt partitions of Ni and S in SNC meteorites and soils [4] suggests that Mars' surface might have oxidized early in its history from which NWA 7034 might have originated at around 2 Ga [1]. The oxygen isotope values of NWA 7034 [1] are heavier and further offset (see Figure 6 of [1]) from the terrestrial fractionation line (TFL) than the main SNC cluster [5-10]. The characteristic petrological and geochemical similarities and oxygen isotope compositions and age variances between NWA 7034 and the SNC group motivated us to study the O-isotopes of NWA shergottites.  Analytical Methods: We prepared 4 NWA shergottites and a representative Shergotty sample for bulk and separated components for O-isotope analyses. New triple O-isotope data from these shergottites (basaltic and olivine-phyric) were obtained using a novel laser fluorination method [11]. Several terrestrial standard samples were analyzed during the course of this study and their  17 O values fall close to the TFL ( 17 O = 0). All the bulk powders and mineral separates were acidleached to remove any terrestrial weathering products. Results: Our CO2 laser fluorination mass spectrometry protocols [11] provide enhanced precision and accuracy. The calibration method for reporting triple oxygen isotope data provides precision and accuracy better than ± 0.1‰. We have succeeded in defining a terrestrial fractionation line [11], a prerequisite to study extra-terrestrial materials, with the largest range so far reported in the literature both in terms of  17 O and  18 O values spanning from -14‰ to +14‰ and -27 to + 27‰, respectively [11]. Bulk materials and physically separated components (maskelynite and pyroxene) of 5 shergottites have been analyzed for O-isotope compositions including NWA 1068, NWA 1110, NWA 1195, NWA 3171, NWA 4468 and Shergotty. Oxygen isotopes of bulk materials. All isotopic values are averages of 3 individual runs of each bulk sample or separated phase of a particular meteorite. The averaged  17 O and  18 O values of 4 NWA bulk shergottite powders (Figure 1a) range from 2.0 ‰ to 2.5 ‰ and 3.4 ‰ to 4.2 ‰ respectively. The overall average  17 O of the bulk samples is 0.30 ± 0.01 (2).  Figure 1. Triple O-isotopes of bulk shergottites (1a); NWA shergottite maskelynite (1b); NWA shergottite pyroxene (1c); all bulk and separated components together (1d). Oxygen isotopes of pyroxene and maskelynite. Pyroxene and maskelynite grains were separated from the NWA shergottites and Shergotty. The averages of 2-3 individual runs of pyroxene and 2-5 individual runs of maskelynite are reported here. The averages of  17 O and  18 O values of 4 maskelynite grains (Figure 1b) range from 2.6 ‰ to 2.9 ‰ and 4.5 ‰ to 4.9 ‰ respectively. The overall average  17 O of the maskelynite grains is 0.31 ± 0.01 (2). Due to the limited sample sizes only two shergottites (NWA 1195 & NWA 3171) could be used to separate pyroxene grains along with Shergotty. The averaged  17 O and  18 O values of NWA 1195 and NWA 3171 (Figure 1c) are 2.9 ‰ & 2.2 ‰ and 5.1 ‰ & 3.7 ‰ respectively. The average  17 O of both pyroxene separates is 0.30. Discussion: The triple O-isotope plots of bulk and separated components of NWA shergottites are shown in Figure 1. All bulk samples fall on a straight line (Martian Fractionation Line; MFL) with a slope of  0.536 (Figure 1a) and with  17 O of 0.30 ‰ from the TFL (slope = 0.5223). On the other hand, triple Oisotope plots of maskelynite (Figure 1b) and pyroxene (Figure 1c) show slopes of 0.540 & 0.515 and offsets of 0.31‰ & 0.30 ‰ respectively. The combined MFL of bulk samples and separated components (Figure 1d) has a slope of 0.528 with an offset of 0.30 ‰. The slope (0.528) obtained from NWA shergottites in this study is broadly consistent with the previous MFL slope of 0.526 achieved by analyzing SNC bulk samples [6]. Given the slopes of our MFL (0.528) and TFL (0.522), it is evident that both planets (Mars and Earth) display broadly homogenized oxygen isotopes. However, the oxygen isotope data of NWA 7034 [1] bulk solids (acid washed, non-acid washed and decarbonated to 1000 oC) are heavier and further offset from the TFL (Figure 2) than the NWA shergottites in this study, which overlaps the combined SNC [5-10] data array (not shown in Figure 2 for simplicity). Oxygen fugacity. The disagreement in oxygen isotope compositions of SNC's and NWA 7034 is possibly due to the presence of multiple oxygen reservoirs on Mars [1] and increased oxygen fugacity at Mars' surface during early history [4]. Our oxygen isotope data for NWA shergottites  and SNC's [5-10] in general compared to NWA 7034 suggest that early oxidation effects on Mars had not yet reached the  deeper upper mantle levels sourced by the SNC's possibly due to the disputed dearth of subduction zones on Mars. Therefore, the shallower upper mantle, represented by NWA 7034, shows heavier oxygen isotope compositions than the SNC's. Recently, it is observed in chondrules that high oxygen fugacity causes to increase the oxygen isotope compositions [12]. Slopes and 17O of oxygen isotope plots. The slopes obtained from triple O-isotope plots (Figure 1a1c) of bulk materials and separated components of NWA shergottites are variable and increase in the order of pyroxene (0.515), bulk material (0.536), and maskelynite (0.540). The slope of the bulk materials is the average of all the minerals making up the meteorite so it is not surprising this slope falls in the middle of both separates. It is noticeable that the maskelynite slope is steeper than the pyroxene slope. As it is a well known fact that maskelynite is the shocked form of plagioclase caused by impact-related events on Mars. The steeper slope of maskelynite (Figure 1b) is probably due to the escape of lighter isotopes during the transition of plagioclase to maskelynite during the impact process. Based on our slopes of the separates in NWA shergottites this fractionation could be ~5% in maskelynite. However, the average slope including both  bulk material and separated components (Figure 1d) agrees well with the MFLs constructed from SNC bulk materials only [6] and bulk and separate materials [10].   The offsets (0.30-0.31 ‰) are identical in both bulk and separated components' plots, which probably reflects the fact that Mars likely experienced more oxidized conditions during its early history of formation than Earth.

Conclusions: Our new shergottite data fall on the MFLs previously reported for SNC's [6, 10] and differ from the NWA 7034 data [1]. The triple O-isotope compositions of bulk NWA shergottites are essentially in agreement with the earlier SNC's data. However, minor slope variations in O-isotope plots of maskelynite and pyroxene are observed, which might be linked to impact-related phenomena, causing fractionations of ~5% magnitude. More data on SNC separates are needed to better determine if the possible impact-related O-isotope fractionations in maskelynite are widespread.
