TITANIUM ISOTOPE SOURCE RELATIONS AND THE EXTENT OF MIXING IN THE EARLY SOLAR SYSTEM EXAMINED BY INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS. Robert C. J. Steele∗ andPatrick Boehnke, Department Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences, UCLA, Los Angeles, California, 90095;∗r.steele@uclmail.netIntroduction: Investigation of the isotopic compositions of early Solar System materials yields evidencefor the nucleosynthetic precursors of the Solar System.For refractory elements with greater than three isotopes,for example Ti, Ni and Mo, the variation in anomalies over different bulk meteorite groups and normalcalcium, aluminium rich inclusions (CAIs) are highlycorrelated [1, 2, 3]. This has been suggested to showmixing between reservoirs with different nucleosynthetic origins [1, 2, 3].There are, however, exceptions to these systematiccorrelations, most notably the FUN (fractionated withunknown nuclear effects) CAIs and the population of hibonite grains from CM chondrites. Hibonite grains andFUN CAIs are relatively poorly understood populationsof refractory inclusions found in primitive chondrites.These populations exhibit some of the largest isotopeanomalies observed in materials found within the SolarSystem yet their origins remain unexplained. Hibonite,the focus of this study, is a highly refractory mineral andis thought to possibly be one of the first solids to haveformed within the Soar System either by condensationor as a refractory residue [4].Several hibonite populations have been observed,see [4, 5]. They are possibly related to each otherand the Solar System because their O isotopic compositions are within what is considered to be the Solar System range [6, 7]. Broadly they can be split into twogroups based on isotopic characteristics and petrology.The first, characterised by platy crystals (PLACs) andblue aggregates (BAGs), show large mass-independentstable isotopic anomalies coupled with little or no evidence for extant short-lived radionuclides (SLRs) [4, 8].While the second, comprising spinel hibonite spherules(SHIBs), show smaller mass-independent anomalies butevidence for SLRs, for example either canonical orsupra-canonical 26Al [4, 8, 7]. The stable isotopeanomalies are thought to represent pre-Solar signaturesbut it is not known whether the events in which thehibonites formed occurred within the Solar System atsome point prior to general chemical and isotopic homogenisation of the proto-solar nebula, or if they wereformed outside the Solar System and so are not isotopically related to the wider Solar System. Therefore it isclearly of great importance to asses the relation of theisotopic variations observed in the hibonites to the variation observed in other Solar System materials.The isotopic composition of Ti has been studied extensively in both hibonites and bulk meteorites and normal CAIs. Titanium is a major element in hibonites andof reasonable high abundance in most meteorites (≥ 500ppm [9]). Moreover, Ti has five stable isotopes produced with varying efficiency by different nucleosynthetic environments, making it suitable as a tracer of nucleosynthetic source relations and mixing in the protoSolar nebula.The Ti isotope variations among the hibonites haveproven somewhat enigmatic. The hibonite grains exhibit some of the largest isotopic anomalies seen forany element with 50Ti enrichments of up to 25 % [8]and deficits of up to 10 % [10], however, there are noconsistent correlations in these data, see figure 1. Various studies [11, 12, 8] have investigated the number oflikely sources by attempting to fit the data to a plane.They find that the data do fit on a plane meaning thatfour or more sources are required produce the variation.The bulk meteorite data, however, show very consistentvariation through the meteorite groups characterised bya correlation between E46Ti 4947and E50Ti 4947[1]. This correlation has been shown to be consistent with input fromthe O/Ne zone of an type II supernova (SNII) [2, 13].Methods: We have re-examined the Ti isotope compositions of hibonite grains in the light of the more recent Ti isotope compositions published for bulk chondrites and normal CAIs [1]. The previous ion probestudies of hibonite grains normalised data for massdependent fractionation using the 46Ti/48Ti normalisation. The more recent measurements of bulk meteorites,however, observed isotopic compositions which weremost consistent with correlated anomalies on the isotopes 46Ti and 50Ti, therefore, they adopted a 47Ti/49Tinormalisation. Thus, the first step was to renormalisethe hibonite data in order to make the data from thetwo groups comparable, this was published in the previous LPSC meeting [14]. The renormalisation hasbeen extended to include uncertainties for individualdata points, rather than a representative average for eachstudy. These were obtained from a Monte Carlo simulation varying around the uncertainties of the original datawith 10000 repeats, see figure 1.We have examined the relationships between hibonites and bulk meteorites by using independent component analysis (ICA), an established technique in signal processing that has only rarely been applied in geochemistry or cosmochemistry [18, 19]. Independentcomponent analysis is a method of blind source separation by which a multivariate dataset can be deconvolved into independent subcomponents [20]. We have1287.pdf

Also shown is thecorrelation observed in bulk meteorites from [1].extended the traditional ICA technique to include uncertainties [21]. This new method offers a powerful toolto examine the mixing of sources in isotopic data andhas potential for use in wider cosmochemical and geochemical data. The ICA returns the compositions ofindependent components, or vectors, required to fullydescribe the variation of the data. That is the compositions of the sources required to have mixed based on thevariation present. These compositions describe a slopealong which a significant proportion of the isotopic variation can be explained. These slopes could representone source mixing to the origin (Solar) composition, ortwo sources mixing either side, therefore, the numberof sources is at least the number of components plusone. As discussed in [20] the ICA algorithm is basedon the assumptions that the sources are statistically independent and a mixed along linear trends, for a fulldescription of ICA see [22].Results: From the ICA we find that two componentsare required to explain the bulk meteorite data becausethere is small but significant variation in E48Ti 4947. Thetwo components that describe the bulk meteorite Ti isotope variation are very well defined because the bulkmeteorite data are very precise and describe a tight correlation, in fact a plane, in three dimensions. The slopewe find between E50Ti 4947and E46Ti 4947is within error ofthe slope observed by [1] determined by York regression[23]. The results of the ICA show that there are threecomponents required to fully explain the hibonite data.Due to the noise in the hibonite data the components describing the variation in this dataset are much less welldefined, however, all three components which describethe hibonite data are resolved, at the 95 % confidenceinterval, from both the components which describe thebulk meteorite data.Discussion: The Ti isotope anomalies in hiboniterepresent the largest Ti isotope anomalies found in Solar System materials but they comprise a very small total mass of anomalous Ti and so their significance for Tiisotope variation in the bulk Solar System is not clear.The bulk meteorites are less anomalous by a factor of200 but represent much more than 200 times the Ti andso represent the bulk of anomalous Ti in the Solar System. The findings from the ICA suggest that these tworeservoirs of anomalous Ti are not related by simplemixing as the dominant source in the bulk meteoritesis not present as one of the components observed in thehibonite grains. This finding can be reconciled in one oftwo ways, firstly the hibonite grains may not be from theSolar System and may be pre-Solar grains which formedin an environment with similar O isotope compositionsto the Solar System. Secondly, this finding may be evidence of a second, unrecorded, event which created theTi source of the bulk meteorites by mixing two or moreof the hibonite sources. These two hypotheses may betested by comparison with other elements (for example,Ca). More Ti, and other element, isotope data in hibonite grains are required to further investigate this.References: [1] A. Trinquier, et al. (2009) Science324(5925):374. [2] R. C. J. Steele, et al.
