Introduction: The Th attached within KREEP materials was thought to be last crystallized at the crust and mantle boundary in the evolutional processes of lunar magma ocean [1] because of its incompatible large ionic radius for the major minerals constituting the crust and mantle of the Moon [2]. Its presence on the lunar surface is the end product of a series of geological evolutionary processes that have changed the surface features. Although Th’s global distribution and small-area features have been observed and discussed in many literatures [e.g., 3-8], little is known for its detailed emplacements on the lunar highlands surface. This is mainly attributed to its relatively low concentration that is not easy to measure accurately by remote sensing techniques [9]. The detection of composition with low concentration arises to the requirement of the instruments with high energy resolution and high sensitivity having the abilities to detect the radioactive elements with low abundances and distinct their tiny spatial variations.  Chang’E-2 Gamma-ray Spectrometer: Chang’E2 (CE-2) spacecraft, the second lunar probe of China, was launched on 1 October 2010, with one of the objectives was mapping the global element distributions by its high-sensitivity and high-resolution (~5% full width at half maximum at 662 keV) gamma ray spectrometer (GRS) [10]. CE-2 GRS was the first instrument using large LaBr3 crystal as its main detector to measure gamma rays at 100-km circle polar-orbit of the Moon. Gamma rays entering into the detector were accumulated within a cadence of 3 second and then recorded as a 512-channel spectrum. The large crystal gave rise to the relatively high instrumental sensitivity by which the small compositional difference on the lunar surface could be distinguished in the spectrum [11]. The derived Th map from CE-2 GRS therefore provides new opportunities to investigate the Th emplacements on the lunar highlands surface.  Th on the Lunar Surface: The global Th map derived from CE-2 GRS (Fig. 2) has a similar distribution to previous Lunar Prospector[4, 12] and Kaguya [9] measurements. The striking character of the Th distribution in the PKT is that all the high-Th regions are located surrounding the Imbrium basin and was thought to be associated with the Imbrium impact event [e.g., 4, 6]. The Th abundance in SPAT has a moderately average value of ~2.5 ppm with a high-Th anomalous component (~3.5 ppm) concentrated in the northwest of SPA basin near the Ingenii basin (33.7oS, 163.5oE). The origin of this anomalously high abundance of Th is considered to be caused by asymmetrical excavation in the formation of SPA basin by an oblique impact [13], rather than the Imbrium [6] or Serenitatis [14] antipode efforts.     -­‐180 -­‐150 -­‐120 -­‐90 -­‐60 -­‐30 0 30 60 90 120 150 1809060300-­‐30-­‐6012345678910 Fig. 1 The global Th map derived from CE-2 GRS.  Most lunar highlands appear to be depleted in Th. An isolated small region with the relatively high Th value of 2-4 ppm is apparently located at the northern highlands between the Compton (55oN, 105oE) and Belkovich (60oN, 100oE) craters. This anomalism high-Th region with a size of 150-300 km has a number of silicic volcanic characteristics [15] that is unusual on the lunar surface. The average Th concentration in the west-farside is ~1.5 ppm and is higher than the average value of the west-limb region (~1.0 ppm). This small difference was observed by Lunar Prospector mission [4] and then confirmed by Kaguya GRS [9] even both portions have low Th concentration. Imbrium Contribution of the Th on the Lunar Highlands: All the high-Th regions in the PKT localized around the Imbrium basin on the nearside gave rise to an assumption that all the Th on the lunar surface including the farside highlands were derived from the ejecta of Imbrium impact [6]. We modeled the Imbrium formation and estimated the Th distributioin on the lunar highlands from Imbrium basin while assuming the impact target was riched in Th. The model shows that the Th concentration ranges from 7.5 ppm to 1 ppm within the distance from the rim of Imbrium basin to its antipode (see Fig. 2). Although the modeled high values in the PKT region are comparable to the observed data, the Th concentration in the lunar 1237.pdf

highlands is relatively lower than the observations. In most highlands surface, the modeled Th values are only 30% to 50% of the observations. However, while considering the actual case, for example, the low-Th feldspathic crust, the varied launched angles of primary ejecta fragments, and the mixing effects of the primary ejecta and substrate, the Th contribution on the lunar highlands from the Imbrium ejecta should be decreased and a rough estimation of 10%-30% is suggested based on our modeling results. 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 60000246810[Radius	  of	  transient	  crater]Distance	  from	  center	  of	  Imbrium	  basin	  (km)  	  Pixel	  Thorium	  Average	  Thorium	  Modeled	  ThoriumThorium	  concentration	  (ppm) Fig. 2 The measured and modeled Th distribution with the distance from center of Imbrium basin.   Indigenous Th on the Lunar Highlands: The feldspar-rich crust of lunar highlands is thougth to be formed early in the crystallization processes of the lunar magma ocean [16]. The subsequent long impact history results in a state of saturation equilibrium [17] for craters on its surface with the size from several meters to several hundred kilometers. The large impact events excavate voluminous deep materials under the target surfaces and then mix with that from other impact events, the surface materials on the most densely cratered areas are therefore the uniform mixtures of the materials pre-existed on the surface of lunar highlands, low-Th projectiles, and excavation from the deep crust (e.g., several to ten kilometers in depth). If the Th concentration on the lunar highlands surface before the Imbrium impact event is lower than that in the Imbrium ejecta, the final Th value on the highlands would be decreased because the high-Th materials will be diluted when mixing with the pre-existed low-Th lunar highlands materials. The later impactor population can only increase the mixing extent and decrease the Th concentration on the lunar highlands. Nevertheless, the relatively higher Th concentration observed by CE-2 GRS than the modeled value (see Fig. 2) implies that the high Th materials have been existed on the lunar highlands surface before the impacting-format event of Imbrium basin at ~3.85 Ga [18].  The native Th on the lunar highlands surface is thought to be a complicated product of the crystallization for the initial plagioclase crust [1] and the modifications by subsequent impact-cratering processes. Although the radioactive elements are not readily accepted into the crystal structure of the minerals in the early crystallization and flotation processes forming the top crust [2], the liquid KREEP materials would be entrained in the long-time crystallization [9]. The formation of the plagioclase crust would thus result in a gradually increased Th concentration with increasing depth [19]. The initial upper crust has no Th composition, but the subsequent heavy and large impacts on the lunar highlands excavate voluminous deep materials with high Th concentration. These ejecta are then mixed with the local substrate materials or other ejecta with low Th value. The long-time impacts would overturn the materials on the upper crust and mix them with deep ejecta uniformly. The surface Th concentration increased and finally keeps a constant value as the impact events reach a saturated state. Associated a standard ratio of excavation (e.g., 0.1 in depth/diameter) with the statistic craters with diameters larger than 20 km on the highlands [17], the constant Th abundance might exist in the current highlands at least of 40 km in depth. This depth is consistent with the assumed thickness of upper layered crust with homogenous composition of the Moon [20].  References: [1] Warren P. H. (1985) An. Rev. Earth Planet. Sci., 13, 201-240.
