DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW TECHNIQUE TO ACQUIRE DIFFUSE REFLECTANCE SPECTRA FROM SINGLE MINERAL GRAINS.  P. Mann1 (p.mann-ra@uwinnipeg.ca) and E.A. Cloutis1.  1Department of Geography, University of Winnipeg, 515 Portage Avenue, Winnipeg, MB, Canada R3B 2E9.         Introduction:  Sample return missions to various planetary bodies are becoming increasingly common.  For example, an asteroid regolith sample has been returned to Earth by the Hayabusa spacecraft in 2010 [1].  OSIRIS-Rex is another asteroid sample return mission set to launch in 2016, with a 2023 sample return.  They plan to obtain at least 60 g of pristine regolith and a surface material sample [2].  To maximize science return from such missions, it is imperative that nondestructive analytical techniques be developed that can work with single mineral grains.  Many techniques are available to analyze these grains non-destructively (e.g., Raman, µXRD, FTIR microscopy) but acquiring acceptable diffuse reflectance spectroscopy upon a single mineral grain has had some limitations and difficulties. Here we report the progress we have had with the continuation of [3] to develop a methodology and accessory to be utilized to acquire acceptable single grain diffuse reflectance spectroscopy.   Fig.1 Single grain diffuse reflectance spectroscopy accessory.       Experimental procedure: We began our development of a single grain sample holder for diffuse reflectance measurements, by using a 6 mm diameter hole drilled into an aluminum block. Results for this configuration were not acceptable for all types of minerals, so we have experimented with changing the previous well configuration to a new bi-level aluminum alloy (T6061) well (fig.1).  The top section of the well still has the same diameter as the steel ferrule of the fiber bundle (6 mm) of the spectrometer to eliminate any external ambient light. The lower section of the well has been reduced in size to be only the diameter of the actual fiber bundle (3.5 mm) while the lowest reach of the well is tapered 60° from normal.   Creating a much smaller void space now permits more light interaction with the surrounding walls to provide a more uniform illumination of the mineral grain from all angles. This will be crucial when dealing with anisotropic minerals.  This new configuration also allows us to be certain the fiber bundle is always in the same position and distance from the sample grain. The depth of the lower sample well was investigated by assessing five single grain spectra of olivine (>1000, 710-1000, 500-710, 250-500, 90-250 µm) collected using sample wells of varying depths (1.7, 2.8, 4.0 mm).  After a visual inspection of the data, it was decided to use the 2.8 mm deep well based on the overall shape of the spectral features and noise level of the spectra.       Spectral measurements were obtained using an Ocean Optics Maya 2000 Pro spectrometer over the range of 350-1130 nm. Samples were illuminated by our external in-house 100W quartz-tungsten-halogen (QTH) light source directed by a bifurcated cable consisting of ~150 fibers.  Randomly arranged, half the fibers deliver illumination to the sample while the other half direct reflected light back to the spectrometer.  Spectra were acquired with the grain at the bottom of the well relative to the empty well as our standard.  A total of 1000 spectra were averaged to increase the signal to noise ratio.      We explored different collection techniques to reduce the noise level in the spectra.  Differentiating between 1000, 5000, and 10,000 averages did not prove to be beneficial and showed no real differences in data quality.  Applying a boxcar or a small moving average to the spectra did provide cleaner data but at the cost of a displacement of band centers. Larger boxcars resulted in a loss of narrow spectral features. Another technique that was investigated was the "shoot & shake" technique.  Because we found increasing the number of averages above 1000 did not increase the quality of that data, we tried collecting multiple sets of 1000 spectra, "shaking" the well between each set to change the orientation of the grain.  These multiple sets were then averaged to acquire a single spectrum (Fig 2).   2349.pdf

Fig. 2 Spectra of a single garnet grain (250-500 µm) using the "shoot and shake" technique.            Results: The results presented in [3] show that a single mineral grain (500-1000 µm) measured with this configuration can produce reflectance spectra comparable to that of a powder.  Here we use the larger single grains as a reference to assess the quality of the spectra of the smaller grains. Ilmenite grains 250-500 µm and 90-250 µm do in fact present comparable spectra to the 500-1000 µm grain (Fig. 3).  Both show broad features at ~430 nm and ~1000 nm.  The slope of the 250-500 µm grain appears to be similar to the reference grain but the 90-250 µm has become bluer.     Fig. 3 Ilmenite single grain spectra plotted against the empty well.        Olivine, being optically anisotropic, tests the design of our reflectance accessory along with the methodologies. All three randomly orientated single grain spectra of olivine (Fig. 4) show similar spectra.  The band centers of the absorption features are all within 25 nm from each other but are really shallow and broad features.  Fig. 4 Olivine single grain spectra plotted against the empty well.       Conclusion:  This study is an ongoing development of a new technique. The results presented here suggest that single mineral grains <250 µm using this methodology can produce reflectance spectra comparable to a powder.  As we continue to make advances with the new technique, we plan to expand our library of single grain spectra to include mineral associated with the OSIRIS-REx mission (magnesite, brucite, serpentine, and magnetite).           Future Work:  We are continuously trying new concepts to increase the quality of the data while decreasing the sample size.  The diffusivity of the well is an important factor, we will assess sandblasting the well to increase light interaction with the grain. More photons being supplied is another concept we are considering. A 150W QTH light source is our next option but we will need to incorporate some type of filter to avoid saturating the detector.  Expanding this technique to other fiber optic spectrometers is our goal.  Expanding the wavelength range further into the IR would be very beneficial.  Ultra-violet reflectance is another aspect we are investigating.           Acknowledgments: This study was supported with grants from the Canadian Space Agency, NSERC, and the University of Winnipeg.
