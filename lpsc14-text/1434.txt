Introduction:  Lovina was found as an 8.2 kg  metal mass on Lovina beach, Bali, in 1981 [1]. It has been classified as an ungrouped ataxite [1-2], and its chemical composition and texture has been considered within the context of melting and crystallization inside an asteroid [3]. However, very low abundances of cosmogenic nuclides have led some to question the extraterrestrial origin of Lovina [4]. In order to futher consider the origin of Lovina we have determined minor and trace element concentrations, including some highly siderophile elements (HSE: Re, Os, Ir, Ru, Pt, Pd), and measured 187Re-187Os and Cr isotopic compositions.  Sample:  Previous studies have reported that the main mass of Lovina consists of weathered nickel-iron with cm-scale pyramids projecting from the surface as well as cm-sized vugs [1-2]. The dominant Fe-Ni phases are taenite and awaruite. Kamacite is absent. Troilite is a common additional phase. Flemming et al. [2] and Teplyakova [3] have noted chemical and textural similarities to some other types of iron, but neither study recognized a good match to Lovina. Methods: Samples were prepared for trace element analysis by isotope dilution and laser ablation ICPMS. Trace element abundances were determined on a small polished slab at UMd by rapid rastering of a 25-100μm diameter laser beam (New Wave UP213) over a precleaned sample surface. Ablated material was entrained in a stream of He for analysis by ICPMS (ThermoFinnigan Element 2).  Data reduction was carried out using LAMTRACE [5]. HSE abundances and 187Os/188Os were measured for one bulk sample (270mg) at UMd using our standard dissolution, purification and mass spectrometric methods using a Thermo Triton and Nu Plasma [e.g., 6]. Two sample pieces (222 and 133 mg) of Lovina were analyzed for Cr isotopic composition at UC Davis using our standard methods [7]. In brief, samples were dissolved in 6N-HCl in Teflon vials. About 80 % of the sample aliquots were taken for Cr isotope measurements. Purification was achieved via a two step column chemistry. Since 54Fe is an isobaric interference of 54Cr, column steps were repeated several times to completely remove Fe.  Chromium isotopic composition was determined using a Thermo Triton-Plus TIMS at UC Davis. All sample runs were bracketed by Cr standard, SRM 979. Instrumental mass fractionation effects were corrected according to an exponential law, using a 50Cr/52Cr of  0.051859 [8]. Interferences on 50Cr and 54Cr from 50V and 54Fe, respectively, were corrected for by monitoring 51V and 56Fe.  Results:  Figure 1 shows results for the laser ablation analysis of trace elements in bulk Lovina comapred with terrestrial material and the IIE iron Elga [15].  All data have been normalized to CI chondrites.  Absolute abundances of HSE range between 4.38 (Re) and 584 ng/g (Ru). The CI-normalized HSE pattern for bulk Lovina bears no resemblance to any magmatic or non-magmatic irons we have previously analyzed. In Fig. 2, typical patterns for high and low Ni IVA irons are shown for comparison. The 187Os/188Os ratio of the bulk piece of Lovina analyzed is 0.12664±0.00003, which is well within the range of bulk chondrites and many iron meteorites. It is also well within the range of the modern terrestrial mantle. The 187Re/188Os of 0.116, however, is more than a factor of 3 lower than for any known bulk chondrites or iron meteorites. The present day Os isotopic composition, coupled with the very low Re/Os, requires either major open-system loss of Re, to a level we have never previously observed in irons, or recent formation (i.e. terrestrial origin).  Chromium isotope results are presented in Table 1, together with data for a terrestrial sample (San Carlos Cpx). Compared to the Cr isotope data for the iron meteorite Carbo (IID) [9], Lovina has a very low, nearly terrestrial Cr isotopic composition, in constrast to Carbo, which is characterized by a high level of spallogenic 54Cr, due to its long exposure age of 850 Ma [10]. The ε53Cr data for duplicate analyses of Lovina are not resolved from terrestrial Cr, whereas one of the two pieces (L4) has slightly higher ε54Cr (Fig. 3). The data for Henbury (IIIA) [9] highlight the challenges of obtaining high precision Cr isotope composition out of iron matrix. Table 1. Chromium isotope results for Lovina.

Carbo ε54Cr is ca.+100ε units), or the specimen we analyzed came from the deep interior of a large body, prior to atmospheric entry. This result is consistent with [4].
