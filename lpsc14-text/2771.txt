Introduction:  Large impact basins on the lunar nearside are filled with basaltic lava flows: the lunar maria. Lava flow emplacement requires ascent of the basaltic magma from the mantle source region, through the crust, to the surface. Melt buoyancy, defined as Δρg = (ρrock - ρmelt)g, where ρ is density and g is planetary gravity, is a key driver of magma ascent in many terrestrial and planetary settings [1, 2]. Basaltic melt buoyancy is strongly negative (adverse to magma ascent) in the lunar crust due to the low density of crustal material, as revealed by data from the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission [3]. The ascent-promoting effects of lithospheric tectonic stress gradients [4], induced by flexural support of loads related to super-isostatic lunar basin mass concentrations (mascons) [5] and sub-isostatic crustal annuli around basins [6], have been invoked as a means of creating zones of enhanced magma ascent in the vicinity of such loads. However, the adverse buoyancy of basaltic melts in crust is still large enough to present problems to such scenarios. Further, the intersection of loading stress profiles with the "Byerlee" bounding envelope for frictional sliding on faults [7] will tend to create adverse tectonic stress gradients in the uppermost lithosphere. An additional positive contribution to magma ascent comes from overpressure via gas generation [8], such as generation of carbon monoxide (CO) gas as determined from analysis of Apollo 17 orange glass [9]. Here we reconsider the driving forces for magma ascent in dikes, merging the stress gradient calculations [5, 6] with the more traditional approach of balancing the positive buoyancy of melts in the mantle with the negative buoyancy in the crust [e.g., 1, 2, 10], to determine the minimum depth in mantle from which melts can ascend and how this depth is affected by loading stresses in the lithosphere, brittle failure, and volatile generation. Methods: We use an analytic loading solution [1113] that includes both flexural and membrane support to calculate deflections and stresses of an elastic lithosphere from super- and sub-isostatic loads. The loading stresses are used to predict locations of favored magma ascent based on two criteria: stress orientations at the top and bottom of the lithosphere (horizontal extension [14]) and stress gradients throughout the lithosphere (extension increasing upwards, [4]). For flexural loading alone, one of these criteria is violated somewhere in the lithosphere [5]. However, for small planets like the Moon, membrane stresses can place segments of the lithosphere into extension with positive stress gradients [5, 6], allowing direct ascent of magmas from the mantle to the surface. We make the simplifying assumption that the elastic lithosphere (Te) and crustal (Tc) thicknesses are the same. We calculate magma ascent velocity uz in a dike of width w [4]: uz = (1/3 η) w2 (dΔσy/dz + dΔP/dz -Δρ g )           (1) where η is magma viscosity, Δσy is the tectonic stress (tension positive), or horizontal stress σy minus vertical stress σz, dΔσy/dz is the vertical gradient in tectonic stress, dΔP/dz is the gradient in overpressure, and -Δρ g is magma buoyancy (g is negative in our coordinate system so positive buoyancy increases uz). We calculate an "effective buoyant density" [4, 6] by equating the first and third terms in the rightmost parentheses and solving for Δρefb. For the elastic core of the lithosphere, the stress-related contribution to buoyancy Δρefbec is calculated using dΔσy/dz from the loading model. For the part of the lithosphere where stresses exceed the Byerlee criterion (brittle failure), the contribution to buoyancy Δρefbbf has a value close to -2000 kg/m3. For overpressure contributions, we calculate an effective buoyant density as follows. Since the initial generation depth is where volatile pressure first exceeds lithostatic, with ascent to some higher level the volatile pressure will exceed lithostatic by the difference in lithostatic pressures at the two levels: thus, the effective buoyant density for gas generation Δρefbga is simply ρcrust. Following [1, 2, 10] we evaluate the pressure in a standing column of magma that spans the thickness Tm + (Tc - Tb) + Tb where Tc is the crustal thickness, Tm is the minimum depth below the base of the crust of the melt source region, and Tb is the thickness of the brittle failure region (atop the crust/lithosphere). and equate it to the lithostatic pressure within a column of the same dimensions, yielding the following equation for Tm  Tm = (Δρ2(Tc - Tb) + Δρ3 Tb)/(- Δρ1 )                  (2) where Δρ1 = ρmantle - ρmelt, Δρ2 = ρcrust - ρmelt + Δρefbec , and Δρ3 = ρcrust - ρmelt + Δρefbbf. Tm corresponds to the minimum base level of a dike in which magma could 2771.pdf

reach the surface. For the case with a generation depth Tx (less than Tb) we add a layer and eqn. (2) becomes   Tm = (Δρ2(Tc - Tb) + Δρ3 (Tb - Tx)+ Δρ4 Tx)/(- Δρ1)  (3) where Δρ4 = ρcrust - ρmelt + Δρefbga. Results: For a model load corresponding to the Serenitatis basin with Te and Tc = 40 km (Fig. 1), the adverse stress gradient induced by brittle failure keeps Tm (red line) at a deep level in the mantle, significantly below the level at which it would be in a stressless lithosphere (red dotted line, calculated without the Δρefb terms). However, when volatile generation is added (green line), Tm shows a marked minimum at about 470 km radius, demonstrating that magma ascent is enhanced vs. the stressless case over a broad region. For a thinner lithsophere (Te = Tc = 30 km), Tm reaches the base of the crust near r = 410 km, minimizing the vertical extent of dikes required to allow ascent to the surface. For a thicker lithosphere (Te = Tc = 50 km), the proximity of Tm to the base of the crust is reduced, as is the elevation of the Tm curve over that for the stressless case. For larger loads such as Imbrium (Fig. 2), increased stress gradients allow Tm to intersect the crustal base at higher Te values than for Serenitatis.  Discussion: The calculations of Figs. 1-2 demonstrate that the combined effects of lithospheric stress gradients and volatile generation can enhance magma ascent and eruption around large loads on the Moon. In the case of Serenitatis basin, stresses from the initial basin-filling loading raise the level of the interface Tm in an annular zone around the basin, corresponding to the relative location of the Tranquillitatis basalts [5], that include high-density titanium-rich magmas.     In the absence of overpressure from volatile generation, lithospheric stresses are likely to be a main driver of magma ascent [5, 6], subject to dike arrest at the depth of the brittle failure envelope. We also calculated an effective Tm for ascent to the level of brittle failure (Tb, blue curves) in the absence of overpressure, shown as the red dashed curves in Figs. 1 and 2. These curves are very similar to those that include overpressure (green lines), again demonstrating loading-enhanced magma ascent in relatively shorter dikes than for the stressless case. When the dikes encounter the failure envelope at depth -Tb, lateral rather than vertical propagation of basin-radial dikes is favored, with this depth becoming an effective level of neutral buoyancy of the dikes. A radial dike scenario may account for the Serenitatis-radial Rimae Cauchy in Tranquillitatis. Ease of magma ascent increases with decreasing lithospheric and crustal thickness, the former by increased stress gradients in the elastic core of the lithosphere and the latter because the region of adverse density contrast (the crust itself) is thinner [1, 2]. The trend with lithosphere thickness suggests an optimum thermal state for stress-enhanced magma ascent, with Te comparable to Tc and not significantly larger. References: [1] Solomon, S. C.
