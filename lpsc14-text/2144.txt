Dust coverage is of concern because it impacts the ability to characterize rock textures by Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) and compositions by Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS), and therefore to interpret the geology. Within the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) landing ellipse in Gale Crater, rocks are generally dustier than have been encountered at other Mars landing sites [e.g., 3, 4].  In addition, use of the Dust Removal Tool (DRT) to brush away surface dust has been limited to only 3 rock targets.  This particularly affects interpretation of APXS analyses because interregation depths to the region where 90% of the X-rays originate varies as a function of Z (~2 to 80 µm for Na to Fe) [5].  The dust also contributes significant S and Cl and a well understood SO3/Cl of ~8 [6]. With this in mind, we devised a method to determine dust coverage using MAHLI images.  Our focus is on a suite of rock targets from Yellowknife Bay (YKB) where compositions are relatively uniform and bedrock SO3 contents are low (to 0.89 wt% in brushed surfaces) [7]. Methods: The MAHLI takes pictures of targets from ~2, 5, 10, and 25 cm standoffs using a 2megapixel colour camera [1]. The images taken at one standoff are merged to produce a best focus image (focus merge) [1].   To determine dust coverage of MAHLI focus merge images at maximum magnification, we used the freeware ImageJ, a particle analyzer program. For each image, we first found the average range of grey value for bare bedrock and then adjusted the threshold values to exlude the bare bedrock, i.e.,  dust coverage. Dust coverage was determined for the APXS field of view of ~1.7cm [3]. The determined dust coverage values were then plotted against the APXS compositions to see if there was any correlation between dust coverage and chemical composition recorded by the APXS.   Results: Our analysis includes 19 rock targets in YKB, of which two were brushed by the DRT (Ekwir and Wernecke).  Rock surfaces are generally flat and shadows by rover parts were taken into account. The YKB targets exhibit variable dust coverage ranging from 24 % to 72 % (Table 1). An error analysis was conducted to account for factors that might affect the perceived areal coverage of dust. These factors include, reflective rock surfaces (such as ridges) and placement of the APXS ~1.7cm diameter area relative to the center of the MAHLI images (this can differ by as much as 7 mm) [3].  All together the relative error is < ±10% for the dust coverage determinations.     Table 1.

Discussion: Of the 19 rocks involved in this study, only two were brushed. It is therefore important to evaluate how dust coverage affects APXS chemical composition and to evaluate the effectiveness of the DRT. Concentrations of S and Cl decrease in after brushing.  For example, Ekwir_1 had a SO3 concentra   tion of 6.26 wt% and after brushing this concentration dropped to 2.59 wt%. The areal dust coverage fell from 72% to 24% (Fig 1a to b) with brushing. Brushed rock surfaces are therefore not pristine, although they are much better than unbrushed surfaces for interpreting rock compositions.   Comparing dust coverage against compositions determined by APXS, we find a positive correlation between dust coverage and SO3/Cl, trending toward the local soil (Portage [5]) value (Fig. 2a). Outliers in SO3/Cl include high-SO3 targets (e.g., Mavor) that contain abundant white vein material interpreted to .be composed of a CaSO4 phase [8], and the Cl-rich target Cumberland.  Nevertheless, this plot illustrates the usefulness of SO3/Cl as a proxy for surface dust coverage (r = 0.825, excluding outliers).    Although the martian dust is thought to contain elevated Ni due to a meteoritic component [9], our analysis does not demonstrate a correlation with dust coverage (Fig 2b). Based on X-ray yields determined for Fe, Ni concentrations are affected by dust at coverages >20-30 µm [5]  Variability seen in Ni concentrations (and in other heavy elements) in YKB rocks therefore reflects the underlying rock and not the dust.    Dust depth is relatively difficult to determine. If we assume the dust particles are spherical, then we can get a a general idea of dust depth. The smallest particle that can be seen by MAHLI depends on the pixel scale of the image. For example the best resolution MAHLI images are 16 µm/pixel at a 2 cm standoff, and the smallest particle size that can be measured is in these images is 16 µm.  It is therefore difficult to rule out the effects of smaller sized particles on concetrations of the lightest elements (Na, Mg). However, we note that consistency between rock targets in YKB and the geochemical variability seen between the different classes of rocks (e.g., high Na in Jake M which had ~59% dust coverage [10]) in these elements indicates that dust coverage does not completely obscure light element concentrations.
