Figure.2 shows the FTIR spectra of the nontronite samples at room pressure conditions. Both the FTIR and thermal studies confirmed the presence of hydrous component about 20 wt %. The FTIR spectral data obtained for the Deccan trap are found to be in good agreement with the data obtained for the pure synthetic nontronite [9,10].  High-pressure phase stability of phyllosilicates.  Our high pressure experiments on the ferrous saponite and nontronite samples from the Deccan Trap showed that the samples treated at 8 GPa were found be almost  amorphous with a broad XRD peak centered at 1.52 nm for nontronite and at 1.54 nm peak for saponite. The hydrous content on the pressurized samples were found to be almost 20 % of the starting materials. Our studies support the earlier suggestions made by Gavin and Chevrier [2] that phyllosilicates were not formed post impact on the Noachian Martian surface.Our high pressure and high temperature studies on the phyllosilicates from the Deccan trap suggest a transformation of phyllosilicates from a crystalline phase to amorphous or glassy nature by meteorite impact. High pressure and temperature studies on the saponite and nontronite suggest a pressure induced partial dehydration of  the phyllosilicates during the impact process.
