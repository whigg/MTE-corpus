Introduction: Primitive solar system materials contain small quantities of presolar grains that formed in the winds of evolved stars or in the ejecta of stellar explosions [1]. The SiC grains are the best characterized presolar mineral. Most of these grains belong to the mainstream (MS) population which formed in the winds of 1-3 M asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars of about solar metallicity. The type AB SiC grains have 12C/13C ratios <10 and constitute a few % of all SiC grains. Their origins is still a matter of debate. Among the proposed stellar sources are J-type carbon stars and born-again AGB stars, such as Sakurai's object [2]. Recent S isotope measurements of AB grains revealed significant 32S enrichments (250 ‰) in 3 grains. Born-again AGB stars are predicted to produce significant amounts of radioactive 32Si (half life: 153 yr) and the 32S excesses may be the result of 32Si decay [3], which was proposed for the SiC type C grains of supernova origin [4]. To substantiate this possibilty further, it is necessary to identify more AB grains for further S isotope measurements, to evaluate the effects of Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) on S-isotopic compositions that may be recorded in MS grains, and to investigate the condensation behavior of S into SiC. We present results from (i) a search for a large number of AB grains by automated C and Si ion imaging which will be studied for S-isotopic compositions later, (ii) measurements of S-isotopic compositions and abundances of SiC MS grains, and (iii) condensation calculations for S into SiC. Experimental: The SiC grains were separated from a 48 g sample of the Murchison CM2 meteorite using a procedure similar to that of [5]. Thousands of grains were deposited from liquid suspension onto two clean Au foils (samples "Mur2012B-3/4"). By ion imaging with the MPI NanoSIMS (Cs+ primary ions, ~100 nm beam size, ~1 pA) [6] we measured the C- and Si-isotopic compositions of ~1100 SiC grains found in 347 30 x 30 m2-sized areas. Additional areas not screened by ion imaging were inspected in the SEM. This led to the identification of 59 large (>1 m) grains of which 23 were measured for C- and Siisotopic compositions by recording high-resolution images of 12C, 13C, 28Si, 29Si, and 30Si (2-9 x 2-9 m2, Cs+  primary ions, ~1 pA). After intense pre-sputtering for cleaning, the S-isotopic compositions were measured for 9 of these grains (all of MS type) by acquiring high-resolution images of 28Si, 32S, 33S, and 34S with long integration times (160 min/grain, divided into 30 image planes). Sulfur isotope data were normalized to those of S impurities in a synthetic SiC standard.    Figure 1. Si-isotopic compositions of large (1-6 m) presolar SiC grains from Murchison sample Mur2012B-4. Errors are 1. MS line: 29Si = -20 + 1.37 x 30Si [7].  Results and Discussion: Fourty-two AB grains were found by ion imaging, representing 3.8% of all measured SiC grains. Ion imaging revealed one interesting C grain (250 nm) with 12C/13C = 68 ± 1,  29Si = 490 ± 14 ‰, and 30Si = 2135 ± 26 ‰. All of the large grains have Si-isotopic compositions along the characteristic MS line (Fig. 1), and 12C/13C ratios between 3 and 134.     Figure 2.

the data reduction that apparently have no or only small contributions from S contamination (Fig. 2). One grain with a very rough surface texture still shows a very high S concentration and will not be considered in the following discussion. The S isotope and abundance data of 8 grains (for one grain only 34S/32S data are available) are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. Visual inspection of Fig. 3 suggests a positive correlation between 33S and 34S. However, a statistical treatment of the data shows only moderate statistical significance, with a confidence level of 75% for a slope >1. Mass-weighted averages are 33S = -9 ± 56 ‰ and 34S = 11 ± 23 ‰. Close-to-solar S isotope compositions are in general agreement with S isotope data for 9 very large SiC grains from the Murchison LS + LU series [8], and with predictions for the 3rd dredge-up in 1.5-3 M AGB stars of solar metallicity (33S = 10-51 ‰, 34S = 6-17 ‰ for the final pulse [9]).    Figure 3. S-isotopic compositions of 8 MS grains from this study. Errors are 1. The regression line has a slope of 1.5.  The S isotope data in the single grains have larger errors so they are not very diagnostic for the range of S-isotopic ratios in their parent stars and for GCE modeling. We now discuss the elemental S abundances. Using equilibrium condensation calculations [10] the observed S abundances of MS grains can be reproduced, e.g., at C/O = 1.05, p = 10-5 bar, and T 1400 K (Fig. 4). This assumes ideal solid solution of CaS (major) and MgS (minor) in SiC; and that sulfides do not form as pure phases. If the solution is not ideal, the calculated amounts of CaS are too high and predicted S/Si ratios represent upper limits; the same results if CaS (& MgS) condense separately from SiC. The inferred temperature is 100 K higher than what was inferred for other trace elements in SiC [10], indicating that ideal solution does not apply, that separate formation of CaS and MgS occurred, or both. The predicted S/Si ratios strongly depend on T and a decrease by 100 K even matches the 100x higher S abundances of AB grains with the 32S excesses [3]. If conditions for condensation in born-again AGB stars are comparable to that in normal AGB stars then a 100x higher S abundance in AB grains is hard to understand. Unlike born-again AGB stars, the AGB parent stars of MS grains can only produce tiny levels of 32Si [9] and direct condensation of S into SiC is the most plausible origin of S in the grains. The low levels of S in MS grains provide further evidence that 32S excesses in AB grains are not the S-isotopic signature of their parent stars but are best explained by a mixture of radiogenic 32S (from in situ 32Si decay after formation of SiC with 32Si/28Si 10-3) and isotopically normal S, mostly contamination. The high level of S contamination in AB grains is consistent with their smaller size, which did not allow for an extensive cleaning before analysis.
