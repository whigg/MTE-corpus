AN UNUSUAL UNEQUILIBRATED LITHIC CLAST IN NWA 7965 LL 5-6 CHONDRITE BRECCIA.  A. B. Love1, 1Department of Geology, Appalachian State University (Boone, NC 28608 loveab@appstate.edu)   Introduction: Melting of chondritic target rock produces a great variety of melted to partially melted rocks and fragments [1, 2]. Lithic fragments in ordinary chondrites fall into two classes: (1) fragments that are genetically related to the host rock and have experienced partial to complete melting that altered their chemical composition and textures; and (2) true xenoliths containing phases that are chemically unrelated to the host rock.  NWA 7965 is an equilibrated LL 5-6 ordinary chondrite breccia. The breccia contains a lithic fragment composed of granular material from a prior shock event mixed within an igneous matrix composed dominantly of enstatite. The purposes of this invesitgation are to report on the petrographic and compositional information of this clast and to infer a mechanism for the clasts origin. Analytical Methods: Two polished thin sections from NWA 7965 were examined using Optical Light Microscopy, Cathodoluminescence (CL) Microscopy, SEM, and EPMA. Optical and Cathodoluminescence observations were done in the Department of Geology at Appalachian State University (ASU). Backscattered electron (BSE) images were collected using the FEI Quanta SEM in the Dewel Miscroscopy Facility at ASU. Quantitative analyses were performed on JOEL 8600 Superprobe in the Department of Geology at the University of Georgia and on the Cameca SX-100 in the Science and Engineering Research Facility at the University of Tennessee. Accelerating voltages of 15kV and 30nA beam current were used to analyze major elements for silicate phases, and Si, S, Fe, Co, Ni, P, Mg, Al, Ti were determined for metal and sulfide phases. Results: The 7mm clast is light colored, irregular- shaped and has sharp boundaries with its host. The boundaries are marked by a discontinuous rim of glassy material. The clast is cut by an FeS vein that terminates at the clast boundaries. The clast is dominated by hypidiomorphic granular texture consisting of a heterogeneous mixture of grains (avg. length 135µm) in a matrix of finer-grained (avg length ~58µm) euhedral enstatite and olivine and interstitial diopside and glass. Some regions of the clast display intersertal texture, of the same mineral assemblage. Large, rounded irregular masses of troilite and rounded, mixed FeNiFeS nodules occur in the matrix.  Optical, CL and BSE images show two distinct textural populations of mineral grains. One population is defined as clasts with the following characteristics: anhedral olivine and orthopyroxene grains containing inclusions of Si glass, FeNi, chromite and FeS. These grains have ragged boundaries, embayed margins and lack CL. The second population is defined as phenocrysts with the following characteristics: euhedralsubhedral crystals of olivine with clean interiors some of which contain enstatite melt inclusions (showing red CL) and some of which display skeletal textures; and subhedral to euhedral crystals of pyroxenes some of which contain curvilinear trails of FeS blebs, diopside rims and show bright magenta and violet CL. Matrix enstatites are finer-grained, lath-shaped euhedral crystals that display polysynthetic twinning, curvilinear trails of FeS blebs and bright magenta CL. Diopside, which occurs as euhedral crystals interstitial to olivines and as rims on clast-orthopyroxene, displays yellow CL. Quench-textured glass that occurs as an interstitial phase and as rims on FeS grains displays blue CL. All grains display undulatory extinction and planar fractures. Mineral compositions are given in Table 1. Olivine grains in the clast and elsewhere throughout the breccia have the same equilibrated compositions (Fa 28.83+/-0.76). Pyroxene compositions fall into two groups corresponding to the textural types. Pyroxene clasts are Fe-rich (Fs 12.07+/-3.47). Pyroxene phenocrysts, matrix grains and melt inclusions are Mg-rich (En 99+/-0.82).  Discussion: Textural relationships and compositional data suggest that the clast is composed of two discrete components, (1) shocked granular debris from a prior event, and (2) an igneous matrix that caused partial melting of the debris. Euhedral crystals of olivine and pyroxene with inclusion-free interiors and melt inclusions are igneous in origin. Rounded to angular grains of olivine and orthopyroxene with embayed margins and reaction rims show interaction with the melt phase. Fayalite compositions and Fe/Mn (59.36) ratios in the clast and olivine phenocrysts, and Co-content of kamacite are consistent with LL chondrites [3]. Compositional data show clast-pyroxenes are unequilibrated and have compositions similar pyroxenes found in H-chondrites. Compositions of enstatite in the matrix are out of equilibrium within the clast, the host breccia and they fall outside of the range of pyroxenes in ordinary chondrites. One of the major challenges of this study is to identify the source of, or a mechanism to produce Mg-rich pyroxene in an ordinary chondrite. There are several mechanisms by which Mg-rich pyroxene can form in a lithic clast. (1) The pyroxene 1404.pdf

could have been introduced via a enstatite-rich impactor. (2) The pyroxene could have formed under reducing conditions during crystallization of an impact melt. Or, (3) the pyroxene could have formed during rapid crystallization of an impact melt before equilibration of mineral compositions occurred.  Magenta CL is observed for orthorhombic low-Ca pyroxenes primarily occurring in metamorphosed and impact-melted EL chondrites. However this kind of pyroxene has been observed by the author in a lithic clast containing Mg-rich olivine in an unequilibrated ordinary chondrite [4]. A search for other reduced metal phases commonly found in EL chondrites was made, but none were identified in NWA 7965. Without oxygen isotope data, the lack of reduced mineral phases challenges the idea of contamination from an enstatite impactor.   Hutson et al. 2013 [5] describe a shock melt vein from the Buck Mountains 005 L6 chondrite containing Mg-rich pyroxenes and coexisting ferroan olivines and ascribed this to a lack of equilibration with the melt subsequent to resolidification. Buck Mountains 005 contains features such as reverse zoning in olivines and pyroxenes and Mg-rich reaction rims, neither of which are observed in this lithic fragment. The lithic clast from NWA 7965 lacks a corresponding Mg-rich olivine phase and lacks any evidence of zoning that would be indicative of reduced melts. Additionally, the lithic clast does not appear to have experienced metal- loss that would indicate reduced condtions during melting [6].  The small grain-size of matrix phases (enstatite and interstitial diopsides), mixed metal assemblages, skeletal olivine phenocrysts and interstitial glass collectively suggest rapid crystallization. As previously stated, magenta CL is commonly associated with orthorhombic pyroxenes, but has also been observed in orthopyroxenes with shock-related stacking disorder caused during shock events [4]. The FeS vein that crosscuts the clast, undulatory extinction and planar fractures within olivine and pyroxene grains, and the curvilinear trails of FeS blebs that crosscut some phenocrysts and matrix phases provide clear evidence that the lithic clast experienced shock events subsequent to its formation. It is possible that subsequent shock events or thermal metamorphism obscured important features, such as mineral zoning that could provide clues regarding melt relationships and the crystallization and cooling history for this clast. Additionally overprinting by shock or thermal equilibration may be responsible for equilibration of olivine compositions within the clast.  Conclusions:  The lithic clast from NWA 7965 is composed of fragmental debris that has been partially melted and likely represents an impact melt breccia clast. Fragmental debris is likely related genetically to LL chondrite material in the host breccia. Evidence suggests that rapid cooling occurred after to crystallization of the enstatite-rich matrix. Rapid cooling may have prevented clast-pyroxenes from reaching chemical equilibrium with the melt phase. Information about melt relationships and cooling history may have been erased by annealing during subsequent shock or thermal events. Equilibration of olivine within the clast may have occurred during subsequent annealing events.  Modal reconstruction analysis to determine bulk composition may confirm a relationship to a chondritic source. Appropriate application of the Lindsley 2pyroxene thermometer would provide estimates for cooling rates [7]. Compositions of inclusions and embayed regions of clast-olivines may aid in interpretation of relationships between clast, matrix and phenocryst phases.
