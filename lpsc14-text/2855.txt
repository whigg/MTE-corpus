Introduction:  In 2005, a large quantity of the mineral gypsum was unexpectedly identified on Mars in the high latitude dune sands of Olympia Undae [1]. Because gypsum is formed in the presence of liquid water, the discovery of this extensive deposit has important implications for the climatic and sedimentary history of the currently cold and dry north polar region of Mars. CRISM data indicate that gypsum sand grains appear to concentrate at dune crests [2-4], but it is not clear whether aeolian processes alone could be responsible for this effect, nor what the significance of this pattern may be. To investigate how aeolian processes distribute soft and hard sand grains (e.g., gypsum and quartz, respectively) across active dunes, we performed a field investigation of four barchan/barchanoid dunes at White Sands National Monument in New Mexico, USA. The Monument contains the largest known gypsumdominated dune field on Earth (>400 km2), and has long been the subject of aeolian studies [e.g., 5,6]. Preliminary laboratory analyses of our field samples are informative, with implications regarding the preservation potential of harder aeolian-transported grains. Study area:  Four barchan/barchanoid dunes were sampled in the field study during April 7-10, 2013 (see Fig. 1). Dunes 1 and 2 were selected from preliminary reconnaissance of the area upwind of the main dune field, with the intention of studying how very coarse gypsum grains interact with similarly-sized terrigenous grains. Dune 3 is located at the northern edge of the  Figure 1. Field sample sites at the White Sands National Monument, NM, USA.  Figure 2. Sampling locations of Dune 3, including the main traverse (labeled by flag numbers 1 through 9), the barchanoid slip face, and two coarse-grained ripples. Monument, downwind from exposed beds of dolomite. Dune 4, located in the center of the main dune field, represents a well-studied part of the Monument; results from this dune will be used to tie our study on Dunes 13 to previous work. Dune 3 (see Fig. 2) is a barchanoid dune on the western (upwind) edge of the main White Sands dune field. Unlike the more southern (and more commonly studied) portion of the dune field, dunes at the northern border of the Monument are located downwind from eroding lake sediments rich in dolomite. Coarsegrained ripples armor much of the surface on and upwind of these dunes (see Figs. 1 and 2). Very coarse (1-2 mm) grains on these ripples appear to be composed partly of dolomite and other darker minerals. As a result, the area around Dune 3 became a primary focus of our investigations.

Lab analysis:  The mineralogical composition of several field samples has been determined through two methods. X-ray diffraction (XRD) uniquely distinguishes several minerals, including different calcium sulfates and quartz. The portable Terra (Olympus NDT) XRD instrument is similar to the XRD on CheMin, an instrument onboard the Mars Science Laboratory (Curiosity) [7]. Work presented at this meeting [8] demonstrates the instrument's capability of identifying and quantifying mixtures of gypsum/dolomite, and gypsum/quartz. Quartz was found in all samples, although at a low level (~2-6%). Different grain size fractions (smaller than or larger than 1 mm) were found to have different compositions, with gypsum dominating the smaller grains and dolomite dominating the larger grains. Visible and near infrared (VNIR) spectra have also been used to characterize the composition of Dune 3 sand. Work presented at this meeting [9] shows VNIR spectra are sensitive to both gypsum and dolomite. Samples from Dune 3 were sieved into 8 size fractions. As with the XRD results, VNIR spectra show that only >1 mm (very coarse) grains are dolomite-rich. The darker coarse grains display a range of compositions, including dolomite, calcite, gypsum, and clays. Preliminary conclusions:  Although calcite and dolomite are not hard minerals, they are harder than gypsum, and thus they may interact in ways that can give clues to the interaction of gypsum and mafic grains in the Olympia Undae. Not surprisingly, harder minerals at White Sands are less likely than gypsum to be broken into sand-sized grains, and therefore they dominate the coarser fraction of aeolian materials.  The striking shift in composition at ~1 mm is likely related to the two aeolian modes of transport, saltation and creep. Creeping grains move slowly, only when bombarded by the impact of saltating grains. The impact of saltating gypsum may not carry enough energy to comminute harder minerals, but it is certainly capable of abrading itself [10]. A major implication of this finding is that larger grains representing harder minerals may concentrate in coarse-grained ripples, whereas softer gypsum grains may dominate dune sediments. Dune cross-strata are dominated by grainflows, produced by the oversteepening of sand grains that have saltated over the brink of a dune [11]. The poor preservation of coarse-grained ripples indicates they are underrepresented in the sedimentary record [12]; as a result, calcite and dolomite are likely also underrepresented in preserved dune cross-strata at White Sands. Because they are so prevalent on Mars, our results underscore the need to identify the characteristics of preserved coarse-grained ripple strata for a more complete understanding of the sedimentary history of Mars. Our preliminary results suggest that the gypsum sand identified in Olympia Undae is of a similar or smaller grain size relative to the mafic sand that represents the bulk of aeolian materials. A significantly different size difference between the two mineral sand populations would have become apparent through selfsegregation into different aeolian morphologies.  Future work: Further analysis of field samples will include determination of relative mineralogical abundances of different size samples along the main traverses of all four studied dune sites (especially quartz). Of particular interest is comparison of these results of those of slip face samples, which represent grains most likely to be incorporated into aeolian crossstrata. References: [1] Langevin et al.
