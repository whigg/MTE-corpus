Introduction:  Clays are an important indicator of aqueous processes and have been identified in numerous locations on Mars using OMEGA and CRISM data [e.g. 1,2]. Most studies base the detections of clays on lab spectra of pure minerals. Here we have measured spectra of clay-bearing rocks in order to compare these with Martian spectra. We have acquired both visible/near-infrared (VNIR) reflectance spectra and thermal region infrared (TIR) emissivity spectra in order to enable coordinated analyses of both datasets. Clays have not been observed above the detection limits in TES data using lab spectra [3], so this new data set may further TES analyses of Martian clays. XRD has also been measured in order to confirm the clay components and for comparison with CheMin data [4]. Samples:  Several clay-bearing rocks were obtained for this study. The Nau-1 rock is a nontronite standard from the Clay Minerals Society and the beidellite rock is from Delamar Mine, ID (from W. Gates). A hisingerite-bearing rock came from Western Australia; remaining rocks were collected in Loma Mar and Coyote Hills, CA. Additional sample information is presented in Table 1.  Methods:  The rocks were processed for VNIR reflectance spectra using an ASD FieldSpecPro spectrometer that measured from 0.35-2.5 µm under ambient conditions. TIR emissivity spectra were measured using the Nicolet Nexus 670 at the Arizona State University (ASU) Thermal Infrared Mineral Spectroscopy Laboratory as in previous studies [5]. All samples were heated in an oven for ~12 hours prior to measurement and retained in a 0-2% humidity chamber during measurement. XRD was run at NASA-Ames on crushed samples sieved to 45-150 µm.

Table 1    Sample ID Sample Name XRD Results Sample Info JB931 Beidellite smectite,           ~5-10% quartz soft, white, waxy JB1480 Hisingerite hisingerite, siderite, quartz, feldspar, serpentine med-hard, brown, shimmery, flaky JB1486 Loma Mar-Lg opal or glass, dolomite, quartz, smectites hard, tan, grainy JB1487 Loma Mar-Sm smectite, opal, quartz, feldspar hard, tan, grainy JB1488 Coyote Hills 1 quartz hard, brown w/trnsl veins JB1489 Coyote Hills 2 quartz hard, red-bwn w/trnsl veins JB1490 Nontronite smectite med-hard, lime green, chalky  Results:  VNIR spectra of phyllosilicates are best identified in remote sensing data by the OH combination bands near 2.1-2.4 µm [e.g. 6]. VNIR signatures indicative of clay minerals include stretching and bending overtone bands at 1.4 µm, an H20 band near 1.9 µm, and stretching and bending combination bands near 2.20-2.21 µm for Al/Si, 2.29 µm for Fe3+, and 2.30-2.31 µm for Mg.  Spectra of Al-clay rocks are shown in Figure 1; all of these samples exhibit bands near 1.4, 1.9 and 2.2 µm. The spectrum of the Delamar Mine beidellitebearing rock is similar to the spectrum of the Alsmectite beidellite. XRD showed this rock to be primarily smectite with ~10 wt.% quartz, which does not exhibit features in the VNIR region. The two Loma Mar samples are similar including Al-smectite, opal, quartz and feldspar from XRD, but rock JB1486 also contains dolomite, which contributes a band near 2.32 µm to the spectrum. These spectra also have bands near 1.4, 1.9 and 2.2 µm but are observed close to the band centers expected for montmorillonite and opal.  Figure 3.  TIR emissivity spectra of Al-rich clay-bearing rocks. Relative emissivity spectra of pressed pellets of montmorillonite [7] and opal [8] spectra and inverse reflectance spectra of dolomite and quartz [9] are shown for comparison. Spectra of Fe-rich rocks containing hisingerite and nontronite are shown in Figure 2. Hisingerite is an amorphous material similar to allophane but with a higher Fe content. As no spectrum is available for hisingerite, a spectrum of allophane is shown along with that of nontronite for comparison. Spectra of the Nau-1 and hisingerite rocks have bands at 1.42, ~1.9 and 2.29 µm. The H2O band occurs near 1.91 µm for nontronite, similar to that of montmorillonite, but occurs at 1.92 µm for hisingerite and is broadened, similar to the feature observed for allophane. TIR spectra of dioctahedral phyllosilicates exhibit a doublet near 450-600 cm-1, while trioctahedral phyllosilicates have a single band near 475 cm-1 [e.g. 10]. The beidellite rock spectrum in Figure 3 is similar to the montmorillonite spectrum with an Si-O band near 1050 cm-1 and an Si-O bending doublet near 470 and 550 cm-1. The Loma Mar samples contain both smectite and opal and have an asymmetric doublet for the bending vibration. The spectrum of Loma Mar rock JB1486 also has carbonate features consistent with dolomite. Although the spectrum of the Coyote Hills rock JB1489 looks very similar to that of quartz in this spectral range, it exhibits bands consistent with Al-clay or opal in the VNIR region. In Figure 4, the hisingerite and Nau-1 spectra exhibit Si-O vibrations consistent with Fe-clays. The Nau-1 rock spectrum is similar to the particulate nontronite spectrum, but has stronger features. The hisingerite rock spectrum has broader bands similar to its cousin allophane; however there is a single broad Si-O bending vibration rather than a doublet as observed in the spectra of nontronite and allophane. This single band is indicative of absorbtion band overlap seen in trioctahedral clays.    Figure 4.
