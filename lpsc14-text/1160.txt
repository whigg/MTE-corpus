CONSTRAINING THE LITHOSPHERIC THICKNESS OF IO FROM A MODIFIED HEAT-PIPE MODEL.  L. M. Jozwiak1, 1Department of Geological Sciences, Brown University, 324 Brook St, Providence, RI 02912. (lauren_jozwiak@brown.edu)  Introduction: Io is the closest moon of Jupiter, and the most volcanically active body in the solar system [1]. Io also presents an enduring paradox relating to its lithospheric thickness. As the closest moon of Jupiter, Io experiences high amounts of tidal heating, with an estimated tidal dissipation of ~1015 W [2]. This is higher than the Galileo observed heat flux of 2.1 0.7 W/m2 [3] and telescopically observed heat flux of 2.5 W/m2 [4] which correspond to a heat flow of  ~1014 W. Based on the high heat flow constraint, early models for the lithospheric thickness of Io placed it at 8-18 km [5]. Seemingly contrary to the heat flow argument for a thin lithosphere, are the observations of over 100 mountains in excess of 1 km elevation [6]. These mountains appear to be compensated at depth, and the result of shallow thrust faulting and contraction within the crust [7]. Keszthelyi & Mc Ewen [1997] [8] proposed a lithospheric thickness in excess of 50 km to explain the presence of these compensated mountains. O'Reilly and Davies [1981] [9] used a heat-pipe model to allow for a thick lithosphere, while still allowing high heat flow. We present here a modified heatpipe model which considers additional conductive heat transport through the lithosphere and also does not locally constrain the rate of volcanically advected material relative to the rate of subsidence and melting at depth. Heat-Pipe Model: The heat-pipe model originally proposed by O'Reilly and Davies [1981] assumes all heat is transported out of Io's interior by advection in volcanic pipes where it is then deposited on the surface. This process is balanced by the heat added to the interior by the melting of material at the base of the lithosphere as it subsides. This model assumes that the rates of advection and subduction/melting are equal, and arrives at a lithospheric thickness of ~100 km [9]. Our model contains two significant modifications to the O'Reilly and Davies [1981] model: 1) we include a term for conduction of heat through the lithosphere in addition to advected heat, 2) we do not require the rates of advection and subduction/melting to be equal. Although the mass for a representative column is not required to be conserved, we still assume that mass is conserved over the entire moon, the consequences of which we will address in the Discussion. Our model is shown schematically in Figure 1. Equation 1 is the heat flow in our modified heat-pipe model.   (     ) ( (      ))                    (1) Here Q is the total heat flow of Io, set to 1014 W [3], and r is 1821.6 km, the radius of Io. Vv and Vs are the volume of volcanically advected material and volume of subducted material, respectively, in units of m3/s, and yL, is the lithospheric thickness. As there is a lack of definitive compositional data for Io, we assume a generic silicate basaltic composition. The resulting physical parameters include: density, ρ, equal to 3000 kg/m3, the latent heat of melting, L, equal to 4 x 105 J/kg, specific heat capacity, cp, equal to 1000 J/kgK, and thermal conductivity, k, equal to 3.3 W/mK [10]. The temperature difference, ΔT, is 1500 K, which is the difference between the melting temperature of dry basalt and the average surface temperature of Io.  Results and Sensitivity: The results of plotting Eq.1 can be found in Figure 2. Although not shown in Figure 2, the value of (Vv -Vs) can assume negative values for cases of runaway heating of the interior. The solution to our modified heat-pipe model for Io's currently observed heat flow, indicates an equilibrium lithospheric thickness of ~25 km, which corresponds to Vv =Vs . However, we believe this thickness really represents a quasi-equilibrium around which the actual lithospheric thickness oscillates. This conclusion is drawn by assessing the model sensitivity to changes in lithospheric thickness. Eq. 2 describes how the flux of volcanically advected material changes in response to increases in the lithospheric thickness [10].       (         ) (      )                          (2)  Plotted in Figure 3 is the solution to Eq. 2 assuming Io's currently observed heat flow. The results show that the volcanically advected flux is extremely sensitive to changes in the lithospheric thickness up to ~ 100 km, at which point heat transport by conduction becomes negligible and all heat must be transported by advection, the same result found by O'Reilly and Davies [1981].  Discussion: Our modified heat-pipe model shows an equilibrium lithospheric thickness of ~25 km for Io's present heat output. Small increases in lithospheric thickness lead to increased flux in material that must be volcanically advected (Figure 3), a process which could result in runaway thickening of the lithosphere. However, there exists a balance to this process which has been proposed qualitatively in McKinnon et al. [2001] [11], and can be addressed quantitatively by our modified model (Eq. 1).

any given time the following process could occur: 1) volcanoes erupt material onto the surface of Io, thickening the lithosphere. 2) conduction transports less heat from the interior requiring higher volcanic output 3) the volcanic transport rate is constant requiring an increase in temperature at the base of the lithosphere 4) increased melting at the base of the lithosphere reduces the amount of heat which must be removed by advection 5) the system returns to equilibrium. In a perfectly balanced system the lithospheric thickness would never depart from equilibrium, however, it is more feasible to suspect that the lithospheric thickness oscillates over a finite range around its equilibrium.  McKinnon et al. [2001] invokes periodic thickening and thinning of the lithosphere as a way to produce the mountains observed on Io's surface. In this scenario the mountains are isolated fractured crustal blocks produced by compressive stresses associated with lithospheric thickening. These blocks then founder and tilt during the phase of lithospheric thinning, resulting in the characteristic morphologies of the mountains [11]. Because our model does not require conservation of mass in local regions, but rather over the entire body, it follows that different parts of the body will experience different stages of the crustal cycle at different times. This is manifested on the surface by the wide variety of observed mountain degradation states, hailing from different lithospheric cycles.  Conclusions: By modifying the classic heat-pipe model of heat transport to include conduction and variable rates of advection and melting, we predict an equilibrium lithospheric thickness of ~25 km for Io. This lithospheric thickness is between the classically proposed "thick" and "thin" lithospheres for Io, and involves periodic thickening and thinning of the lithosphere in response to variable balancing of the rates of volcanically advected heat and heat returned to the interior by melting of the subsiding lithosphere. The implications of this model serve as a quantitative counterpart to the work of McKinnon [2001] which proposed a cyclic lithospheric thickness on the basis of mountain morphology. Further modeling work will constrain the amplitude range of the lithospheric thickness oscillations.   References: [1] Lopes et. al. (2004). Icarus 169: 1, 140-174. [2] Segatz et. al. (1988).

Figures:   Figure 1: Schematic diagram of modified heat-pipe model. Heat is advected through the lithosphere and deposited as volcanic flows on the surface with a volume Vv. Heat is added back to the interior by melting of the bottom of the lithosphere Vs. Heat is also conducted through the lithosphere.

Figure 3: Flux of volcanically advected material as a function of lithospheric thickness. As the lithosphere thickens, conduction becomes less efficient, and a correspondingly larger flux of material needs to be advected in order to maintain the observed heat flow.        1160.pdf
