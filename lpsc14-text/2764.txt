TURBULENT CONCENTRATION OF MM-SIZE PARTICLES IN THE PROTOPLANETARY NEBULA: SCALEDEPENDENTMULTIPLIER FUNCTIONS. J. N. Cuzzi1, T. Hartlep2, B. Weston3, and K. Shariff1, Jeffrey.Cuzzi@NASA.gov;1Ames Research Center, NASA, MS 245-3, Moffett Field, CA, USA; 2BAERI inc.; Sonoma, CA; 3U. C. Davis; Davis, CA..Introduction: The initial accretion of primitive bodies(asteroids and TNOs) from freely-floating nebula particles remains problematic. Here we focus on the asteroids whereconstituent particle (read "chondrule") sizes are observationally known; similar arguments will hold for TNOs, but theconstituent particles in those regions will be smaller, or will befluffy aggregates, and are unobserved. Traditional growth-bysticking models encounter a formidable "meter-size barrier"[1] (or even a mm-cm-size barrier [2]) in turbulent nebulae,while nonturbulent nebulae form large asteroids too quicklyto explain long spreads in formation times, or the dearth ofmelted asteroids [3]. Even if growth by sticking could somehow breach the meter size barrier, other obstacles are encountered through the 1-10km size range [4].Another clue regarding planetesimal formation is an apparent 100km diameter peak in the pre-depletion, pre-erosionmass distribution of asteroids [5]; scenarios leading directlyfrom independent nebula particulates to this size, which avoidthe problematic m-km size range, could be called "leapfrog"scenarios [6-8]. The leapfrog scenario we have studied in detail involves formation of dense clumps of aerodynamicallyselected, typically mm-size particles in turbulence, which canunder certain conditions shrink inexorably on 100-1000 orbittimescales and form 10-100km diameter sandpile planetesimals. The typical sizes of planetesimals and the rate of theirformation [7,8] are determined by a statistical model with properties inferred from large numerical simulations of turbulence[9]. Nebula turbulence can be described by its Reynolds number Re = (L/η)4/3, where L = Hα1/2 is the largest eddyscale, H is the nebula gas vertical scale height, and α the nebula turbulent viscosity parameter, and η is the Kolmogorov orsmallest scale in turbulence (typically about 1km), with eddyturnover time tη . In the nebula, Re is far larger than anynumerical simulation can handle, so some physical model isneeded to extend the results of numerical simulations to nebulaconditions.Cascade model and multiplier distributions: The spatial distribution of particle concentration can be captured statistically by a cascade model [7,9] which predicts the probabilitydistribution functions (PDFs) for dense particle clumps; thesePDFs are essentially volume fractions in the nebula havingthe necessary properties (solids mass and local vorticity) forplanetesimal formation. A cascade model presumes that, asenergy flows from large eddies to smaller ones, particles andfluid properties are partitioned unequally at each "level" ofthe cascade from "parent" into "daughter" eddies. The probability distribution functions (pdfs) of the so-called multipliersby which particle and fluid properties are partitioned havewidths that are given by 1/β; smaller β means larger width,or a higher probability of strongly asymmetrical partitioningwhich, repeated over a number of levels, leads to clumpier ormore intermittent local values of particle and fluid properties.The wide range of scales between L and η is looselycalled the inertial range; in this range the equations of motion are scale-free, and the multiplier pdfs for dissipation ofturbulent kinetic energy �, which, like our preferred particles,Figure 1: The symbols indicate the multiplier pdfsfor turbulent dissipation in high-Re atmospheric turbulence [10], showing scale invariance over 300-3000η. Thered β-functions (β=3, 6, and 48) provide context for βvalues in figure 2. In [7] we adopted level-independentmultiplier pdfs with β ∼ 3 based on our own simulations.is characterized by Kolmogorov eddy timescales, are knownto be scale-independent in atmospheric flows across hundredsto thousands of Kolmogorov lengthscales [10; figure 1]. Thisfact motivated us to assume in [7] that the multiplier pdfs forparticle concentration, which we denote by Φ, were also independent of nebula turbulent eddy lengthscale. While thisassumption was checked and seemingly validated (see figure4 of [9]), we have always been concerned about it [7], and discrepancies between our model predictions and recent resultsof [11] have led us to determine more precisely the range ofscales over which our assumption is or is not valid.Here we report a scale dependence of the widths of the multiplier pdfs for both � and Φ, over a range of the largest scales,covering a decade or more between the energy-containing orintegral scale L and the top of a more rigorously scale-freeinertial range. This scale dependence probably explains thedifferences between [7] and [11], and will affect the formationrate and masses of primary planetesimals in the scenario of[7,8].Method and results: We obtained a complete datasetof particle trajectories in direct simulations covering 6 largeeddy turnover times (TL) in high Re isotropic turbulence, for2− 6× 105 "inertial" particles at each of a range of gas dragstopping times (ts > 0), and for fluid tracers (ts = 0) [12,13].The original simulation was on a cube of 2048η on a side, andhad an integral scale of about 1024η. The data are thus similarto [9,11] but at a considerably higher Re, and showed a clearinertial range [12] extending over tens to nearly 1000η basedon the second order velocity structure function.

Eachcurve represents the situation at a different lengthscale(in units of η). Note that particles with St > 1 but stillon the order of unity approach β ∼ 5− 10 by 64η ∼ L/16and generally stay there with the minimum β shiftingslowly to smaller St at smaller scales and deepeningtowards the asymptotic value β ∼ 3 (dashed line).separated by TL/2 to ensure their independence. We thendetermined the multiplier pdfs in the manner described by [9],but now over a range of spatial scales between roughly 12-512ηand a range in St ≡ ts/tη = 0.6−70, roughly correspondingto 1mm - 10cm particle diameter under nebula conditions inthe asteroid belt region. The dissipation � was known at thelocations of the tracers, so its multiplier pdfs could also bedetermined as a function of spatial binning scale. The spatialdistribution of the St = 0 tracers agreed well with a Poissondistribution, as they do not undergo preferential concentration.Because the number of inertial and tracer particles in thisstudy was smaller than used in [9,11], the average numberof particles per 32η-scale grid cell (for example) was onlyabout 2.5. This led to several small-number-statistics sampling biases that needed to be allowed for. These biases ledto artificial intermittency; that is, the widths of the apparentmultiplier pdfs were larger than their true values. This effectbecomes worse at smaller scales where we typically find fewerparticles per bin, even if there are more bins. We ran a number of Monte Carlo simulations, and found that the bias waspredictable and iteratively correctable, depending only on thenumber of particles in a bin and the true width of the multiplierpdf. For instance, a very broad pdf (small β) was not biased asmuch by this effect as was a very narrow one. We also realizedthat smaller bins could be sampled on shorter timescales thanTL/2, because of the shorter eddy times and faster refresh ratesassociated with smaller lengthscales; this provided improvedstatistics for the smaller bins.Figure 2 implies that, at least for the top decade or so ofeddy lengthscales, multiplier pdfs are slightly narrower (largerβ) than we had assumed and particles of St ∼ 2 − 10 aremore concentrated (ie, have broader multiplier pdfs than thosefor St = 1). By contrast, particles of dm-size and larger havenarrow multiplier pdfs at all but the very largest scales. Ourpreliminary results for � are similar to the particle results, inthat the multiplier pdf which is so level-independent over awide range of scales in atmospheric turbulence (figure 1) alsostarts out very narrow at the largest scales and only approachesβ ∼ 3 at 64η or so, roughly 1.5 decades below L. We havenot yet completed the correction of the � results for bias as ofthis writing.Thus, the multiplier pdfs for both � and Φ paint a consistentpicture. In the top decade of lengthscales, turbulent stretchingand vortex tube formation (see [8] and references therein) havenot yet reached their fully developed state, so the statistics of� and Φ of particles with Kolmogorov-eddy stopping times donot either. However, both � and Φ multipliers approach theasymptotic value of β ∼ 3 at slightly different but comparablescales of ∼ L/30, and we know from atmospheric turbulencethat this asymptotic value then continues to hold over the entire inertial range, at least for �. The important implication isthat multiplier statistics are not characterized by their scale asa multiple of η but as a fraction of L. Observed level independence of � to 3000η in atmospheric flows [10] is consistentwith their much larger L, such that 3000η < L/16.The cascade model for planetesimal formation by turbulent concentration [10] can now be modified easily to allowfor the observed level-dependence in the multipliers (figure2), and since scales are resolved in the calculations reportedhere to almost the scale where level-independent pdfs are attained, future uncertainties in calculated IMFs for planetesimalformation will be greatly reduced. Moreover, particles that become most densely concentrated (are most intermittent, or havebroader multiplier pdfs) in the range of eddy scales near theinertial scale have stopping times perhaps 2-10 times largerthan we previously assumed, consistent with some previouswork [11,14]. At smaller scales, St = 1 particles will increasingly dominate (figure 2). Because nebula properties such asturbulent intensity and gas density are not known to factors oforder unity, these findings do not qualitatively change the outlook for the scenario (note the basic timescale revision foundby [8]), but will lead to quantitative changes in predictions ofplanetesimal IMF and chondrule size distributions.References: [1] Brauer, F. et al 2008 A&A 480, 859;[2] Zsom A. et al 2010, A&A 513, id.A57; [3] CuzziJ.N. and Weidenschilling S.J. 2006 in "Meteorites andthe Early Solar System II, Univ.
