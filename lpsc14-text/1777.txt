CRATER IDENTIFICATION AND CLASSIFICATION BASED ON EJECTA USING RADIAL BAND FFTSubhalakshmi Krishnamoorthy, Scientist, Laboratory for Electro Optics Systems,Indian Space Research Organisation, Bangalore, India, email: jslakshmi@leos.gov.inIntroduction: Comets and asteroids strike theMoon at a wide range of impact speeds. Such ahigh-speed impact will produce a crater that is10 to 20 times larger in diameter than the impacting object. Lunar craters exhibit varyingshape, size, chronology etc. and they are excellent records of the history and evolution of thelunar surface.Classification of Lunar Craters : Differentcriteria has been used in classification of Lunarcraters.The lunar crater categorization as per the Lunar & Planetary Lab (LPC): ALC — small, cup-shaped craters with a diameter of about 10 km or less, and no centralfloor. BIO — similar to an ALC, but with small,flat floors. Typical diameter is about 15 km. SOS — the interior floor is wide and flat,with no central peak. The inner walls are notterraced. The diameter is normally in therange of 15–25 km. TRI — these complex craters are largeenough so that their inner walls haveslumped to the floor. They can range in sizefrom 15–50 km in diameter. TYC — these are larger than 50 km, withterraced inner walls and relatively flat floors.They frequently have large central peak formations. Lunar craters classified morphologicallybased on a number of parameters: Rim degradation state. Presence of terraces and slumping on the internal slopes. The external rim character. Presence of central peaks, ridges and mountains on the floor. Presence of chains and fissures. Character of the floor. Presence of lava on the floor. Ray systems.Crater Ejecta: When a large body hits theMoon, a huge amount of material is thrown outfrom the resulting impact crater. Material thatis travelling slowly overturns as it is ejectedfrom the crater and builds up the crater rim.Other material gets strewn across the surface,surrounding the craters. This is called the‘Ejecta’. The ejecta is typically brighter/lighterin shade than older materials due to exposure tosolar radiation for a lesser time (relativelyyounger craters). The ejecta material may getstrewn across the surface, extending tens, hundreds or may be even thousands of kilometresfrom the crater itself as bright crater ray systems. The craters exhibiting ray system arenamed as ‘Ray Craters’ and these are relativelyyounger impact craters.Fig.1. EjectaImportance of the ejecta : The ejecta material represents fresh sub-surface material andforms an ideal target for studying the mineralogical composition of the lunar sub-surface using hyperspectral RS data. The classification ofcraters with ‘Ejecta’ as a criteria has the following objectives:• Identification and Classification of Craters forpresence or absence  of ejecta – Based on Reflectance.SCHEMATIC CROSS-SECTIONS OF SIMPLE AND COMPLEX CRATERS AND OF ATRANSIENT  CAVITY  (GORDON R.OSINSKI, ET AL)Simple Impact CraterComplex Impact CraterTheoretical  Cross-s ection through a Transinet Cavi ty Showingthe Locations of Metamorphosed  Targets Li thologies1777.pdf

• Automated Classification of Craters for thepresence or absence of ejecta using FFTtechnique.Results: Using the software tool (developed byDDU, Planex research team) and C++ Program, the FFT [5th column] is generated for 4Craters, 2 with Ejecta and 2 without ejecta.Conclusion : Ejecta is an important paramterfor classifying the craters, and FFT techniquemay be effectively used in automatic classification of caters with ejecta. As the ejecta from theyounger crater can form an important materialfor sample collection for elemental/mineralogical analysis, this can be an important criteria for the landing site selection.Acknowledgement : The author acknowledgesthe guidance from Dr. H.S.Mazumdar, Professor, Dharmsinh Desai University, Planex research team and their software tool.
