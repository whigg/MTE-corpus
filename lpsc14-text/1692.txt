Introduction:  Relative to the Sun’s photosphere, alkaline elements are more or less depleted in the inner solar system bodies (Earth, Moon, Mars and Vesta) and all meteorites except CI-chondrites [1].  This depletion implies that volatility-controlled elemental fractionations could have occurred in the early solar nebula (e.g. [2]).  In relatively few cases, very alkali-rich materials have been observed in chondritic breccias: KRb-Cs-rich igneous rock fragments in Bhola (LL3–6), Krähenberg (LL5), Y-74442 (LL4), Siena (LL5) and Acfer 111 (H3–6) [3–7], and halite and sylvite in the Zag (H3–6) and Monahans (1998) (H5) chondrites [8,9] as well as in returned samples from 25143 Itokawa [10,11].  Cosmochemical studies on these alkali-rich materials provide good opportunities to understand fractionation processes of moderately volatile elements that occurred on their parent bodies or at an early stage of the solar system evolution [3,5,7,8,12].  Moreover, the alkali-rich materials might have caused a large alkali/alkaline earth fractionation, which, in turn, could be possible more precise age dating utilizing the parent-daughter pairs of long-lived radionuclides (87Rb-87Sr and 40K-40Ca isotopic systems [3,7,13]). For such purpose, nondestructive identification and separation of small-sized alkali-rich materials prior to chemical and isotopic analyses are preferred because the alkali enrichments are often limited within very small spots, say usually less than a few mm across.  In order to discriminate and separate alkali-rich fragments from others, we have conducted autoradiography experiments on small rock fragments from the brecciated chondrite Y-74442 using an imaging plate (IP).  The IP is composed of a plastic plate coated with photostimulable phosphor crystals (BaFBr:Eu2+) which absorbs incoming radiation and emits photostimulated luminescence (PSL) by a He-Ne laser scan [14]. Experimental:  Control samples (KCl crystals and KCl solution dried down on teflon sheets) put in heatsealed polyethylene bags were prepared.  These samples were laid on IPs (Fujiﬁlm, model BAS III-2040) and were put in a plastic cassette case.  They were stored in a lead-armored chamber at the Radioisotope Research Center, Jikei University School of Medicine for one to three weeks at room temperature. Potassium-rich fragments in Y-74442 were identified by autoradiography using a similar technique described by [15] with resultant improved sampling of material for this study.  The Y-74442 sample was coarsely crushed in a boron carbide mortar and small fragments were examined under a binocular microscope.  Dark grey-colored fragments of Y-74442 were weighing and photographed.  We have designed a sample holder made of acrylic material (3 mm thick) which can also hold the IP of 96 x 129 mm in size.  Individual sample and KCl standard were stored in doubly wrapped, heat-sealed polyethylene sheets (sample bags) and were laid on an acrylic plate holding by double-stick tapes. The exposed IPs were run through an LD 650 nm laser scanner with an IP filter (GE Healthcare, model Typhoon FLA7000) that read and digitized the images with a 25 µm pixel-size resolution at the Radioisotope Research Center, Jikei Univ. School of Medicine.  PSL-value (IP volume) was derived from the background corrected, averaged blackening of a certain area of the resulting image. After the radiography experiments the rock samples were taken out from the bags and were decomposed in a mixture of HF and HClO4, and then combined with mixed 87Rb-84Sr and 40K-48Ca spikes.  Calcium, Sr and (K + Rb) were separated using a cation exchange column.  The K, Ca, Rb and Sr abundances were determined by isotope-dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry (ID-TIMS) [7,13]. Results and Discussion:  We used acrylic IP holders and polyethylene sample bags.  As a result, background noises during exposure were reduced down to 0.4 volume/pixel/day.  In addition to radiations from radionuclides contained in the samples, natural background radiations (cosmic-rays and natural γ-rays) also contribute to further ionization of some Eu2+ to Eu3+ in the phosphor screen.  Thus, for samples with K in the low µg range, which will require several weeks to generate an image, it is necessary to store the IP in a shielded area. Figure 1 shows correlations between K (in μg) and PSL-value (IP volume, a.u.) for different exposure times.  Fading of the stored images on the IP could have occurred after several weeks' exposure [16].  Exposure time depends on the concentration of the radioactive emitters in the sample.  Total incident is expected to be ~30 decay events of 40K per day for the sample containing 10 µg K.  In order for samples containing several µg K to be visible, a longer exposure 1692.pdf

time is necessary.  Finally, we have undertaken radiography experiments for fifty days under a nitrogen purge to reduce particles from decay of radium at the Lowlevel Radioisotope Measurement Facility, Institute for Cosmic Ray Research, Univ. of Tokyo, which is located in a basement 23 m from the surface.  Among twenty-seven rock-fragments weighing 0.23 to 17.3 mg, we have regarded at least eighteen as K-rich (Fig. 2). The autoradiography method cannot discriminate between different types of radioactivity (α-, β- and γradiations).  A certain level of radioactivities could have come from radionuclides other than 40K, such as 87Rb and decay series of 235,238U and 232Th.  Alkali-rich rock fragments in LL-chondritic breccias, Rb and U contents are 100 ppm and 0.02 ppm, respectively [5,7].  Thus, total amounts of Rb, U and possibly Th in the samples become 1 µg, 0.2 ng and 1 ng at most, respectively, suggesting that the samples do not contain sufficient amounts of radionuclides, except 40K, that produce PSL on IP.  Polyethylene films reduce α-particles from the samples.  Moreover, γ-rays only weakly interact with the radiosensitive screen.  These facts suggest that the obtained PSL are mainly come from decay of 40K.  We futher take into account self-shielding within the sample material. Conclusions:  The autoradiography using IPs are useful to identify not only K-rich rock fragments in chondritic breccias but also K-rich chondrules as well as sylvite in chondrites without serious contamination if appropriate sample preparation and shielding from natural radiations are conducted.  Detection limits to identify K-rich materials are considered to be ca. 10 µg of K in mm-sized samples. References: [1] Palme H. et al. (1988) Meteorites and the Early Solar System.
