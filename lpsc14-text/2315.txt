(z.c.wu@sdu.edu.cn)Introduction: The Martian atmosphere is composed of 96.0% carbon  dioxide, 1.89% nitrogen, 1.93% argon,  and  trace amounts  of  other  constituents  such  as  oxygen,  carbon  monoxide,  water vapor and methane at ∼9 mbar[1]. However, it also contains 2-10 μm dust uploaded by high winds[2]. Due to Mars' low atmospheric pressure and frequently windy  enionment, the dust on  the surface of Mars is susceptible to triboelectric charging and subsequent electrical discharges which is easy to geneate the low temperature plasma (LTP) by exciting  the martian atmosphere at ambient conditions.In spite of the extreme low temperature (room temperature), LTP contains abundant high-energy electrons in the range of 1~10eV [3] with higher density of 1014~1015 cm-3 [4] which may cause space weathering of Mars rocks or mineral dust by electronimpact reactions. LTP could be one of the most important chemical weathering factors except the UV radiation.Herein, a simulated space weathering of hydrated sulfates (gypsum, CaSO4.2H20) by using LTP bombardment was reported. Gypsum dehydration is a significant process of weathering analyzed by ATR (Attenuated Total Reflection) fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy.Analytical Experiments:  Gypsum (analytical pure) was ground into powder with over 200 mesh and then was used for direct ATR FT-IR spectrometric analysis as unweathered sample. ATR measurements were performed with Vertex 70 FT-IR spectrometer (Bruker Optic) equipped with a KBr beamsplitter and a DLaTGS detector. The spectra were recorded from an accumulation of 64 scans in 2000-800 cm-1 range with a resolution of 4 cm-1 under a room temperature . After that, the analysed powder (0.5g) was  then pressed into a tablet for LTP bombardment. LTP was generated by a cylindrical dielectricbarrier discharge (C-DBD) which was made of a quartz tube (1.0 mm i.d., 2.0 mm o.d., 100 mm long). Two separated copper wires were connected to the outside of the quartz tube as outer ring electrodes and the distance was set to be 23 mm. The wall of insulating quartz tube serves as the dielectric barrier to improve the stability and homogeneity of the highfrequency discharge and isolate the electrodes from contamination. When the two ring electrodes of CDBD were connected to high-voltage power supply (neon power supply) at a voltage of ~1700V and the carrier gas (High purity argon, 99.99% ) was inducted into this plasma generator at a fixed flow rate (0.6 L.min-1), the generated low temperature plasma jet can be observed outside of the tube and directly impacted on the gypsum tablet for simulated space weathering with various time (i.e. 10min, 20min, 30min) .After electrons bombardment, the weathered table was ground into powder again for another ATR spectrometric analysis. Finallly, the two kind of IR fingerprint data were then compared and analyzed to investigate weathered spectral characteristics of samples.Results:  The normalized (at 1105 cm-1) ATR spectra of various bombardment times were shown in Fig.1. 800100012001400160018002000Wavenumber (cm-1)Absorbance (a.u.)abcd Fig.1 Representative ATR specta of CaSO4.2H20  of various weathering time showing changes in: (a) unweathered sample; (b) after 10 minutes of LTP bombardment; (c) after 20 minutes of LTP bombardment; (d) after 30 minutes of LTP bombardment.The band at  ~1105 cm-1 is due to SO42-(v3 mode). The bands at ~1682 and ~1620 cm-1 are due to the structural H2O band (bending mode) which are showing more rapid H2O loss, especially band at ~1682 cm-1 (Fig.1). Obviously, gypsum dehydration is a significant process of LTP weathering. However, the other changes in composition and structure of samples were not detected using FT-IR method.
