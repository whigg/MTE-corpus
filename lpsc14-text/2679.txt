Introduction: The Procellarum region is a broad area on the nearside of the Moon that is characterized by low elevations [1], relatively thin crust [2], and high concentrations of heat-producing elements [3]. The Procellarum KREEP terrain (PKT) likely experienced a unique history because of the enhanced heat flow. Procellarum has been interpreted as an ancient impact basin approximately 3200 km in diameter [4, 5] on the basis of photogeologic interpretations of basin rims and rings. Here we use data from the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission [6] to examine the subsurface structure of Procellarum. The results reveal a quasi-rectangular pattern of border structures, interpreted as volcanically flooded rift valleys intersecting at 120°-angle triple junctions. Methodology and results: We examined the subsurface structure of the Procellarum region using GRAIL Bouguer gravity data (gravity field corrected for the contributions of surface topography [6]) and gravity gradients (second horizontal derivatives of the Bouguer potential [7]). The Procellarum region is revealed to be bounded by narrow belts of negative gravity gradients (Fig. 1) and positive gravity anomalies, indicating narrow zones of positive density contrast in the subsurface. We inverted the gravity field in the spherical harmonic domain under the assumption that the anomalies arise from variations in the thicknesses of both the maria and underlying crust. The results suggest the presence of elongated mare-filled depressions in the feldspathic crust, with widths of ~150 km and depths of 2-6 km, underlain by crust-mantle interfaces that have been uplifted by up to 8 km (Fig. 2).  These inversion solutions are consistent with thickening of the maria over linear depressions formed by crustal thinning, as would occur in volcanically flooded rift valleys. The branching of anomalies of the western border structure and the triple-junction intersections at some corners are consistent with the behavior of planetary rifts. The elevated heat flux in the PKT [8] coupled with passive mantle upwelling during rifting would have led to widespread partial melting of the underlying mantle, so extensional tectonics would have been accompanied by dike intrusion and volcanism. These structures are interpreted as the magma plumbing system of many of the nearside maria, which served as conduits connecting magma reservoirs to the surface. The Procellarum border structures are the only known lunar structures consistent with large-scale rifting of the crust.   Figure 1.

In a polar projection centered on the PKT, the border structures delineate a quasi-rectangular shape (Fig.1). The short arcuate rim segments of the proposedProcellarum basin are seen in the GRAIL data to be asmall fraction of this continuous set of well-expressedstructures that trace out a polygonal pattern consistingof predominantly straight sides and angularintersections. The northeast and northwest corners ofthe structure deviate from the proposed circular basinrim [4] by 215 km and 175 km, respectively. Thisquasi-rectangular pattern is in contrast with the circularor elliptical shapes of all other large impact basins [9],including the hemispheric-scale Borealis basin onMars [10]. Furthermore, the negative gravity gradientsof the border structures do not match the signatures ofknown impact basins, which are characterized bypaired positive and negative gradients of equalamplitude along the rims and negative gradientsthroughout the basin interiors. Thus, the structuresbordering the PKT are not compatible with theirinterpretation as marking the rim of a basin. The location of the structures at the edge of thePKT suggests that the elevated heat flux in this region[8] may have played a role in the extension inferredfrom the gravity modeling. Although the PKT wasalways warmer than its surroundings, it would havecooled at a greater rate due the declining radiogenicheat production. The cooling and thickeninglithosphere would then have experienced thermalcontraction, driving extension at its margins. A finitedifference model was used to represent the conductivethermal evolution of the Moon, given the equivalent of10 km of KREEP basalt at the base of a 40-km-thickcrust within a spherical cap 2000 km in diameter [8,11]. The model predicts a temperature decrease of thePKT relative to its surroundings of >600 K between4.0 and 3.0 billion years ago (Ga). The stressesresulting from the thermal contraction of thelithosphere and the buoyancy-driven pressure from theunderlying mantle between 4.0 and 3.0 Ga werecalculated with an elastic finite element model [12].Cooling and contraction of the lithosphere within thePKT resulted in predicted extension throughout thelithosphere at the edge of the PKT, consistent with theinferred crustal rifting.In order to explain the observed rectilinear patternof structures, it is necessary to break the azimuthalsymmetry. Volumetric contraction beneath a freesurface generates fracture patterns with characteristiccorner angles of 120°, resulting in six-sidedcontraction polygons at a range of scales. However, asthe size of the structure becomes large relative to theradius of the planet, surface curvature becomesimportant. A polygon with 120° corner angles willhave five or four sides when the lengths of the sidesreach 32° or 80° of arc, respectively. The mean lengthof the PKT border structures is 2150 km or 71° of arc,and the angles of the vertices range from 109° to 125°.Thus, at the scale of the PKT, a set of linear riftsintersecting at 120°-angle junctions around acontracting cap will form a quasi-rectangular structure.Conclusions: GRAIL Bouguer gravity anomaliesand gravity gradients reveal a pattern of narrow linearanomalies that border the Procellarum region and areinterpreted to be the frozen remnants of lava-filled riftsand the underlying feeder dikes that served as themagma plumbing system for much of the nearsidemare volcanism. The discontinuous surface structuresthat were earlier interpreted as remnants of an impactbasin rim are shown in GRAIL data to be a part of thiscontinuous set of quasi-rectangular border structureswith angular intersections, contrary to the expected circular or elliptical shape of an impact basin [9]. Thesestructures are interpreted as having formed in responseto the cooling and contraction of the PKT that resultedfrom the declining radiogenic heat production. Figure 2.
