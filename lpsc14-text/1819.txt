Introduction: The Moon does not possess an internally generated magnetic field at the present day, though extensive evidence shows this was the case between at least 4.2 and 3.2 billion years ago [1, 2, 3]. In addition, the strength implied for this field, up to Earth's values of several tens of microteslas, is very high for such a small body. Previous studies trying to explain the long-lived lunar magnetic field include dynamos driven by secular cooling [4, 5, 6] and dynamos driven by differential rotation between the mantle and core induced by either precession of the lunar mantle spin axis [7] or impacts [8]. None of these models are entirely satisfactory and recent paleomagnetic data, which tend to increase even further the duration of the lunar magnetic era [9, 10], will help discriminate between the potential scenarios. The existence of a metallic lunar core is now firmly established [11], and we investigate here the influence of inner core growth on generating a dynamo. We couple the results of a 3-D spherical thermochemical convection model of the lunar mantle to a 1-D thermodynamic model of its core. We compute the energy and entropy budget of the core to determine the inner core growth rate and its efficiency to power a dynamo. We consider sulfur as the main alloying element and we investigate how different sulfur abundances and initial core temperatures affect the model outcomes. Method: In order to estimate the surface magnetic field, the power available to drive the dynamo has to be calculated [12]. This power is directly linked to the sum of the thermal and chemical buoyancy forces within the core. Laneuville et al. [13] proposed thermochemical evolution models for the Moon considering the asymmetric distribution of heat sources at its surface [14]. This model solves the conservation of mass, momentum and energy for an incompressible fluid under the Boussinesq assumption. The rheology is Newtonian and the energetics of melting is taken into account. The assumption made in Laneuville et al. [13] of localizing about one third one the lunar heat sources in the Procellarum KREEP Terrane does not play a major role on inner core growth as long as most of the heat sources are still concentrated in the upper layers of the Moon. We thus use the same setup for the present study. We use a 1-D geometry to model the thermodynamic evolution of the core. The liquid outer core is assumed to follow an adiabatic temperature profile, which follows from the assumptions of a well-mixed outer core, and the solid inner core temperature is that of the inner core boundary. Assuming homogeneous cooling throughout the entire core, the thermal state is entirely determined by the temperature at the core mantle boundary and the heat flow to the mantle. We then compute the inner core size by solving the energy budget of an Fe-FeS alloy, including the contributions of secular cooling, latent heat release and chemical buoyancy. The entropy budget finally allows us to estimate the available fraction of that energy available for dynamo generation. We then use the scaling law of Aubert et al. [12] to estimate the surface magnetic field at any given. The energy and entropy budget for a typical case can be found in Figure 1. Results: Figure 2 shows the inner core size and surface magnetic field for several initial conditions. The initial core mantle temperature difference (∆T) controls when inner core crystallization occurs. For a wide range of initial sulfur content (χ0), crystallization starts between 4.4 and 4 billion years ago. Once the inner core is crystallizing, a global magnetic field is expected at the surface with an almost constant intensity as a function of time. The field amplitude is marginally dependent on sulfur content and is expected to be sustained up to the present day. We find that for an initial sulfur content of 2 to 8 wt.%, a solid inner core between 100 and 200 km will be produced. Though most simulations predict the existence of a core dynamo today, one way to stop magnetic field generation is by a transition between a bottom-up and top-down core crystallisation scheme (see LPSC abstract of Rückriemen et al.). This can happen when the slope of the solidus changes due to the concentration the alloying element in the outer core. If this explanation is plausible, a model with 6 to 8 wt.% sulfur in the core would produce a 120 to 160 km inner core and explain the timing of the lunar dynamo. Conclusions: We have shown here that under standard conditions, a solid inner core is expected to form on the Moon. The induced chemical buoyancy is then large enough in order to sustain a chemical dynamo for several billion of years. This is the only process able to explain such a long-lasting magnetic field, as predicted by paleomagnetic studies [10]. Thermal dynamo models predict magnetic eras that are too short, the impact induced model [8] cannot produce a global magnetic field after the last giant impacts 3.7 Ga ago, while the precession  0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.04.5 Time before present [Ga] 10-2 10-1 100 101 102 103 Qi [ mW /m 2] Adiabatic heat flow range QCMB Qs Qg QL 0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.04.5 Time before present [Ga] 10-9 10-8 10-7 10-6 10-5 Ei [ mW /m 3] ΣEg EL Es Figure 1: Typical energy (top) and entropy (bottom) budgets. The 's', 'L' and 'g' subscripts correspond to the secular, latent heat and chemical fraction of the budgets, respectively. The gray region in the energy budget corresponds to the range of heat flows carried along the adiabat. The dashed line in the entropy budget corresponds to the threshold required to power a dynamo. The solid black line (Σ) corresponds to the sum of the entropy sources. These budgets correspond to the case with ∆T = 300 K and χ0 = 6 wt.% S. model of Dwyer et al. [7] predicts the end of the dynamo 2.7 Ga ago. In our models, a surface magnetic field of about 0.3 µT is present at the surface and is expected to last up to the present day. However, no magnetic field is present today and this could mean one of two things. Either the Moon never had an inner core, which implies sulfur content of about 10 wt.% or more, but this is in disagreement with recent studies [11]. The second option is that a transition between the bottom-up and top-down inner core crystallization regime occured at some point in the evolution. We have shown that this scenario is realistic for initial sulfur contents between 6 and 8 wt.%. 0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.04.5 Time before present [Ga] 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Rel at iv e in ne r c or e [R c] ∆T=400 K, 2 wt.% S ∆T=400 K, 4 wt.% S ∆T=300 K, 6 wt.% S ∆T=200 K, 8 wt.% S 0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.04.5 Time before present [Ga] 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 Sur fa ce m ag ne tic fi el d [µ T] ∆T=400 K, 2 wt.% S ∆T=400 K, 4 wt.% S ∆T=300 K, 6 wt.% S ∆T=200 K, 8 wt.% S Figure 2: Comparison of the predictions made for several different initial conditions.
