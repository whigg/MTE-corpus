A LONG-LIVED LUNAR DYNAMO POWERED BY CORE CRYSTALLIZATION M. Laneuville1, M.Wieczorek1, D. Breuer2, J. Aubert2, G. Morard3, T.

In addition, the strengthimplied for this field, up to Earth's values of several tensof microteslas, is very high for such a small body.Previous studies trying to explain the long-lived lunar magnetic field include dynamos driven by secularcooling [4, 5, 6] and dynamos driven by differential rotation between the mantle and core induced by eitherprecession of the lunar mantle spin axis [7] or impacts[8]. None of these models are entirely satisfactory andrecent paleomagnetic data, which tend to increase evenfurther the duration of the lunar magnetic era [9, 10],will help discriminate between the potential scenarios.The existence of a metallic lunar core is now firmly established [11], and we investigate here the influence ofinner core growth on generating a dynamo. We couplethe results of a 3-D spherical thermochemical convection model of the lunar mantle to a 1-D thermodynamicmodel of its core. We compute the energy and entropybudget of the core to determine the inner core growthrate and its efficiency to power a dynamo. We considersulfur as the main alloying element and we investigatehow different sulfur abundances and initial core temperatures affect the model outcomes.Method:In order to estimate the surface magnetic field, thepower available to drive the dynamo has to be calculated[12]. This power is directly linked to the sum of the thermal and chemical buoyancy forces within the core.Laneuville et al. [13] proposed thermochemical evolution models for the Moon considering the asymmetric distribution of heat sources at its surface [14]. Thismodel solves the conservation of mass, momentum andenergy for an incompressible fluid under the Boussinesqassumption. The rheology is Newtonian and the energetics of melting is taken into account. The assumption made in Laneuville et al. [13] of localizing aboutone third one the lunar heat sources in the ProcellarumKREEP Terrane does not play a major role on inner coregrowth as long as most of the heat sources are still concentrated in the upper layers of the Moon. We thus usethe same setup for the present study.We use a 1-D geometry to model the thermodynamicevolution of the core. The liquid outer core is assumed to follow an adiabatic temperature profile, whichfollows from the assumptions of a well-mixed outercore, and the solid inner core temperature is that ofthe inner core boundary. Assuming homogeneous cooling throughout the entire core, the thermal state is entirely determined by the temperature at the core mantleboundary and the heat flow to the mantle. We then compute the inner core size by solving the energy budget ofan Fe-FeS alloy, including the contributions of secularcooling, latent heat release and chemical buoyancy. Theentropy budget finally allows us to estimate the available fraction of that energy available for dynamo generation. We then use the scaling law of Aubert et al.[12] to estimate the surface magnetic field at any given.The energy and entropy budget for a typical case can befound in Figure 1.Results:Figure 2 shows the inner core size and surface magnetic field for several initial conditions. The initial coremantle temperature difference (∆T) controls when innercore crystallization occurs. For a wide range of initialsulfur content (χ0), crystallization starts between 4.4and 4 billion years ago. Once the inner core is crystallizing, a global magnetic field is expected at the surfacewith an almost constant intensity as a function of time.The field amplitude is marginally dependent on sulfurcontent and is expected to be sustained up to the presentday.We find that for an initial sulfur content of 2 to 8wt.%, a solid inner core between 100 and 200 km willbe produced. Though most simulations predict the existence of a core dynamo today, one way to stop magneticfield generation is by a transition between a bottom-upand top-down core crystallisation scheme (see LPSC abstract of Ru¨ckriemen et al.). This can happen when theslope of the solidus changes due to the concentration thealloying element in the outer core. If this explanation isplausible, a model with 6 to 8 wt.% sulfur in the corewould produce a 120 to 160 km inner core and explainthe timing of the lunar dynamo.Conclusions:We have shown here that under standard conditions,a solid inner core is expected to form on the Moon.The induced chemical buoyancy is then large enoughin order to sustain a chemical dynamo for several billion of years. This is the only process able to explainsuch a long-lasting magnetic field, as predicted by paleomagnetic studies [10]. Thermal dynamo models predict magnetic eras that are too short, the impact inducedmodel [8] cannot produce a global magnetic field afterthe last giant impacts 3.7 Ga ago, while the precession1819.pdf

These budgets correspond to the casewith ∆T = 300 K and χ0 = 6 wt.% S.model of Dwyer et al. [7] predicts the end of the dynamo 2.7 Ga ago.In our models, a surface magnetic field of about 0.3µT is present at the surface and is expected to last up tothe present day. However, no magnetic field is presenttoday and this could mean one of two things. Eitherthe Moon never had an inner core, which implies sulfurcontent of about 10 wt.% or more, but this is in disagreement with recent studies [11]. The second option is thata transition between the bottom-up and top-down innercore crystallization regime occured at some point in theevolution. We have shown that this scenario is realisticfor initial sulfur contents between 6 and 8 wt.%.0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.04.5Time before present [Ga]0.00.20.40.60.81.0Relative inner core [Rc]∆T=400 K, 2 wt.% S∆T=400 K, 4 wt.% S∆T=300 K, 6 wt.% S∆T=200 K, 8 wt.% S0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.04.5Time before present [Ga]0.000.050.100.150.200.250.300.350.40Surface magnetic field [µT]∆T=400 K, 2 wt.% S∆T=400 K, 4 wt.% S∆T=300 K, 6 wt.% S∆T=200 K, 8 wt.% SFigure 2: Comparison of the predictions made for several different initial conditions.
