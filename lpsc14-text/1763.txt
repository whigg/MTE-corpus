It contains crustal magnetic anomalies and a number of small regions of high albedo with uncertain origins. Many lunar magnetic anomalies are correlated with bright markings and dark lanes on the surface, most commonly known as swirl[1]. Optical properties such as these show time-integrated evidence of solar wind effects on the lunar surface ("space weathering") and crustal magnetic fields may alter these effects due to solar wind deflection[1] or possibly electrostatic dust lofting[2,3]. Previously, no swirls have been reported at Mare Crisium[4]. But a thorough investigation has not been performed. For these reasons, here we investigate how the magnetic features at Mare Crisium correlate with optical maturity and albedo to identify any evidence for swirl-like feature. Methods:  For the investigation of magnetic field anomalies at Mare Crisium, we use Lunar Prospector (LP) magnetometer data[5] on 72 day of 1999. We processed the data using a custom software package that automatically groups magnetometer data from similar orbits[6]. The data we use here include 12 orbit segments, 744 measurements and an average altitude of 22.3 km. All data were collected from magnetically quite times when LP was in the lunar wake (lunar night). We produced contour maps of the radial, north, and east components of the field, and display them on the albedo maps. Also, for investigation of optical maturity (OMAT), we use Clementine UV/VIS data[7]. OMAT is defined by the properties of the reflectance at 750 nm compared to the ratio of reflectance at 950 nm to reflectance at 750 nm. OMAT has been shown to provide a good estimate of the spectral effects of the space weathering[8,9], and swirls show distinctive properties in 750 nm vs 950/750 nm plots[2]. Results: Mare Crisium has two strong magnetic anomalies in the northwest and southeast (figure 1). In figure 1-a, the peak observed magnetic field strength of the northwest is 9.0 nT and for the southeast anomaly it is 6.8 nT. In the case of the northwest anomaly, the magnetic field lines resemble a vertical dipole field, which is similar to the magnetic field line structure at Airy swirl (figure 1-b) [7]. In the case of the southeast anomaly, the magnetic field lines resemble a horizontal dipole field, and are more similar to the magnetic field line structure at Reiner Gamma swirl (figure 1-b) [7]. In figure 1-c, the north magnetic field component shows structure similar to a vertical dipole in the northwest anomaly. In the future, we plan to model the source-region magnetization directions. Magnetic anomalies at Mare Cirisum are correlated with some bright features on the Clementine 750 nm albedo map. Figure 2-a shows 750 nm vs 950/750 nm plots for the regions in the northwest anomaly and points are illustrated on figure1-a. On the graph, the black and pink points are fundamental background distribution of spectral properties at Mare Crisium. However, the northwest anomaly seems to contain new bright trends, shown in yellow and green. The bright regions with those unique trends are roughly co-located with the magnetic anomaly. Figure 2-b shows the same 750 nm vs 950/750 nm plot for the southeast anomaly and points are illustrated on figure1-c. The black points are same as for figure 2-a. The southeast anomaly also shows some interesting trends that we plan to investigate further. Discussion:  We have found some tentative evidence for correlations between magnetic anomalies and swirl-like spectral properties in Mare Crisium. However, these findings are not enough evidence for swirls at Mare Crisium. In the future, to test if these correlations can be attributed to swirl-like processes, we plan to: 1) Examine the statistics of the correlation between spectral properties and magnetic field direction and strength, and 2) Determine the amount of local contamination from highland-crater ejecta-rays from the western flank of Mare Crisium.
