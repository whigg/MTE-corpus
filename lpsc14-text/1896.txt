Planetaryembryos grow by accreting smaller bodies from theirso called 'feeding zone' and collide with one anotherwhen they enter each other's feeding zones. The energyinvolved in each collision causes large-scale melting,which allows metal-silicate segregation to occur, thus resulting in an episode of core formation. To develop amodel of the compositional evolution of our rocky planets, based on a collisional history predicted by N-bodyaccretion models [2], estimates of the amount of melting and the pressure and temperature conditions at thebase of the magma ocean are required. To determinethe amount of melting for each of the several hundred toseveral thousands of collisions, as calculated from an Nbody model, a reliable and efficient shock/melting modelis needed.Depth of melting: Full three-dimensional modelsare computationally too time consuming, whereas twodimensional models cannot be used for non-vertical impacts due to their assumed symmetry in the third dimension. Therefore, a parameterised model is used whichdescribes the amount and depth of melting based on theenergy needed to melt a dunite mantle (and in cases ofdeep melting an iron core), Em, and the energy availablefrom the impact [3]. The available energy depends on theimpact angle and velocity (θ and v resp.) as well as onthe impactor diameter, Dp and the densities of both theprojectile and the target (ρp and ρt resp.).Vmelt =pi6kE−3µ/2mρpρtD3pv3µ sin2γ θ (1)Taking into account the temperature increase withdepth, the energy needed to melt the material at depthis corrected as follows:Em = E0m(1− Cp(Ts +dTdz dm)CpdTLdP P (dm) + Lm), (2)where Cp is the specific heat, Ts the surface temperature,dm the depth of melting, Tl the liquidus temperature, Pthe pressure and Lm the latent heat of melting.

Two different N-bodyaccretion models are used, a model with a large numberof relatively small bodies (2:1-0.25-10A) and a modelwith a smaller number of large bodies (CJS2).Once the depth of melting is known, the pressure andliquidus temperature at that depth can be determined, andour aim is to use such conditions to model core formationand siderophile element partitioning. Ideally, these results should be independent of the specific N-body modelused for the collision history. However, calculations using two different N-body accretion models with a different size distribution of the initial bodies show that thisis not the case. Figure 1 shows the pressure at the melting depth for all impacts on the body that forms the finalEarth-like planet as a function of the mass accreted. Itcompares a N-body model with a large amount of smallinitial bodies (2:1-0.25-10A) and a model with a smallernumber of larger bodies (CJS2). A more detailed description of these two models is given in Table 2.1896.pdf

The initial sizedistribution of the bodies in the N-body models thereforeinfluences the results. In an attempt to solve this issue,the assumption of solidification between impacts is investigated.Magma ocean crystallisation: To investigate the assumption of solidification between impacts, a model isused to estimate the cooling time of each global magmaocean [10]. This model balances the heat flux (F )through the planet's surface with the latent heat releasedduring crystallisation (H) and the heat released throughsecular cooling:4piR2F =drdtρH4pir2 − 43piρCpddt[T (R3 − r3)] (3)The heat flux is approximated by a constant value. However, this value is strongly dependent on the amount ofatmosphere present. It is likely that large impacts removemost of the atmosphere of the target, thereby increasingthe surface heat flux. However, degassing of a magmaocean creates a new, possibly very dense atmosphere, decreasing the heat flux through the surface by as much as3 orders of magnitude. Calculations have been done forboth end members. For the case with no atmosphere,black body radiation gives an estimate for the heat fluxand for the case with a dense atmosphere, estimates ofthe limit of atmospheric radiation are available. From themagma ocean crystallisation times of Lebrun et al. 2013[11], we calculated heat fluxes of about 200,000 W/m2and 475 W/m2 for these cases respectively, which fitswell with the available constraints.In general, at the start of accretion the impacts areclose together. Most of these impacts are small and willcause only small amounts of melting, which will not result in a global magma ocean. However, some of thesecollisions are collisions between two similar-sized bodies resulting in a deep magma ocean that cannot crysFigure 2: Crystallisation time versus time until thenext impact for the CJS2 model. All points above theline represent magma oceans that crystallise before thenext impact. In the case where there is no atmosphere(flux=200,000 W/m2) only one impact happens on amolten surface. When a dense atmosphere is taken intoaccount (flux=475 W/m2), a large number of impactswould happen on a molten surface.tallise before the next impact. Figure 2 shows resultsfor a model with relatively large bodies. With the assumption of no insulating atmosphere, all but one of themagma oceans crystallise before the next impact. Witha dense atmosphere present, a more significant numberof magma oceans would still be molten when the nextimpact occurs.Conclusions and outlook: Further research willlook into the time scales of formation of global magmaoceans, compared to the crystallisation time of a meltpool. Furthermore, the differences between impacts ona magma ocean compared with a solid surface will bestudied, since at least some of the impacts will occur ona molten surface.References: [1] O'Brien, D.
