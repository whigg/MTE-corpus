Introduction: Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy provides chemical information from atomic, ionic, and molecular emissions from which geochemistry can be deciphered. For the ChemCam instrument onboard the Curiosity rover, the secondary mirror of the Mast Unit's Cassegrain telescope is translated to accommodate for interrogation distances from 1.6 to 7m. This provides focus at selected distances with laser spot sizes at the sample varying from ~350 to 550 microns [1].  While the laser energy maybe identical at two different distances between 1.6 and 7 meters, the delivered irradiances and corresponding spot sizes are not. Researchers have reported that parameters including optical collection, sampling geometry, the temporal and spatial characteristics of the laser pulses and the samples to be interrogated are critical to emission intensity, mass ablated, and plasma temperature [2, 3].  Intensity changes are confirmed by laboratory studies with the ChemCam instrument, which is a slight complication for curent interpretation and comparison between targets observed at different distances for Partial Least Squares Regression (PLS).    Table 1: Using a partial least squares regression model built with laboratory data taken with the ChemCam instrument at 3m, the table above reports differences in oxide prediction for the same homogeneous target, Quartet, measured at different distances.  Distance Effects within 360 sols data: When we compare homogeneous targets which are interrogated with ChemCam LIBS at multiple distances during the first 360 sols we observe insitu distance effects. (Homogeneity is defined by comparing the average spectra (with the first 5 shots removed) of different raster points on the same target.) The multiple distance targets have distance bias in oxide prediction using PLS (Table 1). Overall the ChemCam targets have clustered relatively close to 3m, with 12% of targets from sols 13 to 360 at distances >4.3m. We implement distance correction to lines selectively, correcting lines which improve agreement of compositional prediction between the same target at different distances.  Comparison between the same targets observed at different distances after correction will be discussed. We demonstrate its performance on several ChemCam targets observed at distances ranging from 2.6 to 6.2 meters. Proxy Standard Classification:To calibrate the effect of distance and correct spectra, we have developed one key result: the elemental composition generated with the first several laser pulses, often up to the first 5, is similar to that of the global Martian fine dust [5, 6].  This composition has been studied extensively by scientists on previous rover and remote sensing missions [7, 8], and is found to be uniform on a global scale. With windblown dust covering all surfaces, spectra of dust are observed at many distances and provide an internal compositionally standard target.   Figure 1: TVAC spectra at different distances as measured and as distance corrected to 5m.

position from first shot ChemCam LIBS spectra with data from the first 360 sols on Mars. These ratios allow the selection of a standard while avoiding a distancebiased interpretation of composition. Once the standard is selected, the effect of distance is calibrated for individual emission lines. Individual emission lines within the spectra are normalized to the correction distance with the proxy standard calibration curves. Using this approach removes artifacts that would be introduced by a laboratory calibration. The method is shown to be effective for improving spectral reprodicability of laboratory data (Figure 1). The method also minimizes the bias in PLS prediction imparted by distance for 8 of 10 of the oxides predicted (Table 2).   Table 2: PLS predictions are made of Thermal Vacuum data (TVAC) and TVAC data corrected for distance of the 3m (the distance of the training set data). Presented in the table are the average differences between the predicted and actual compositions for all spectra predicted. Root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP), data at 1.6m (1.6m), data at 1.6m corrected to 3m (1.6 DC 3m), etc., are given.  Applying Distance Correction to ChemCam data sols 13-360: To calibrate and improve distance correction for the Martian LIBS data Using multiple distance LIBS targets we calibrate the selection of the dust for a "best composition". The "best composition" accommodates the impact of distance to the Martian targets. The optimized standard creates a distance correction which minimizes the difference or residual of emission lines corrected to a normalization distance and those measured at the normalization distance. The optimized dust standard and distance calibration curves are applied to LIBS emission lines individually (Figure 2). Bonnet Plume is shown as an example; more targets will be shown. We see improvements in spectral agreement for targets tested. The multiple distance targets have distance bias in oxide prediction using PLS (Table 1). We implement distance correction to lines selectively, correcting lines which improve agreement of compositional prediction between the same target at different distances.  Comparison between the same targets observed at different distances after correction will be discussed. We demonstrate its performance on several ChemCam targets observed at distances ranging from 2.6 to 6.2 meters.  Figure 2: Using a proxy standard generated from 1st shot LIBS from sols 13-360, distance calibration curves are applied to Bonnet Plume spectra when observed at 6.3m correcting individual emission lines to 3.4m and compared to Bonnet Plume spectra when observed at 3.4m.   Conclusions: We have demonstrated that ChemCam spectral interpretation can be improved by distance correction. Distance correction minimizes change in compositional prediction for the same target measured at different distances within the 360 sol Martian dataset. This improves comparison of targets measured at all distances and compositional determination. Quantitative effects of these results will be discussed.  This approach creates a new opportunity for better understanding of remote LIBS for space exploration and Earth-based remote LIBS measurements.
