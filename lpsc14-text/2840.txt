SHERGOTTITES: PARTIAL MELTS OF A DEPLETED MARTIAN MANTLE. E. Médard1 and M. Collinet2, 1Laboratoire Magmas et Volcans, Université Blaise Pascal-CNRS-IRD, 63038 Clermont-Ferrand, France, E.Medard@opgc.univ-bpclermont.fr. 2Université de Liège-F.R.S.-FNRS, B20 Département de géologie, 4000 Liège, Belgium.   Introduction: two end-members of martian magmatism. Unlike most basaltic compositions that have been analyzed at the surface of Mars, shergottites are characterized by a strong depletion in incompatible elements (LREE, Na, K), elevated CaO/Al2O3 ratios, and higher Mg#. These puzzling differences between the meteoritic population and the surface analyses strongly suggest a sampling bias during impact, i.e. the martian meteorites are not representative of the bulk of the Martian crust. Both types of rocks, "regular" basalts and shergottites, however, are present on Mars, indicating that at least two major "magmatic series" have been produced on the planet.  A widespread near-primitive mantle component on Mars: Although there is no direct access to the composition of the primitive martian mantle, various estimates based on cosmochemical arguments, geophysical arguments, and the composition of martian meteorites, all converge towards very similar bulk compositions [1,2,3]. [4,5] performed melting experiments on the estimated primitive mantle composition of [1], and produced tholeiitic to alkalic primary melts similar to basalts analyzed at Gusev Crater [6], surface compositions analyzed by GRS [7], as well as potential parental melts of the newly discovered Northwest Africa (NWA) 7034 meteorite [8]. Most of the ancient martian magmatism, from the earliest 4.4 Ga crust sampled by NWA 7034 [] to the younger 3.7 Ga basalts from Gusev Crater, can thus be explained by melting of a near-primitive mantle composition, with melting conditions in the range 1.0-2.5 GPa / 1300-1400 °C [4,9]. These results indicate that the major part of the martian mantle, at least during the first Ga of the planet's history, was near-primitive, and did not suffer major reprocessing as would be expected by the fractional crystallization of a planet-wide magma ocean [10].  The depleted shergottite end-member: The major and trace element characteristics of the younger shergottites cannot, however, be reproduced by melting of a primitive mantle. With the possible exception of the nakhlites, the isotopic compositions and incompatible trace element ratios of all known Martian meteorites plot on a mixing line between the depleted shergottites and an enriched end-member that may be associated with the source region of the NWA 7034 meteorite, i.e., the primitive martian mantle. Most of the Martian magmatism could thus be produced by melting of two major mantle reservoirs: a nearprimitive enriched reservoir, and a depleted reservoir source of the depleted shergottites.  The two most primitive depleted shergottites, Yamato (Y) 980459 and Northwest Africa (NWA) 5789, are in equilibrium with their olivine megacryst cores according to the Fe/Mg distribution coefficients between olivine and liquid and are inferred to represent primary or near-primary melts [11,12,13]. They are characterized by a Mg# around 67 (they are in equilibrium with Fo86 olivines), and CaO/Al2O3 ratios around 1.2. Compared to "regular" martian basalts, they are also characterized by quite higher melting temperatues, up to 1550 °C [11]. These peculiar characterisitcs of the depleted shergottites, together with their young ages, suggest that they may be produced through melting of a strongly depleted mantle source, in a hot-spot like environment. In this study, we investigate the possible compositions of a depleted martian mantle (DMM), and if the major characteristics of depleted shergottites (the high CaO/Al2O3 and Mg#, and the low LREE) could be explained by remelting of a residual, depleted mantle, as is the case for terrestrial MORB.

CaO/Al2O3  of the residues does not change significantly at high pressure, but increases from 0.8 to at least 1.0 at lower pressures (0.5-1 GPa), as a consequence of the high alumina content of the low-pressure melts. The Mg# of the residue also increases with melt fraction, however, reasonable melt fractions up to 0.3 only lead to an increase of about 3.5 units, from Mg#75 in the primitive source up to Mg#78.5 in the residual mantle. Higher residual Mg# can in theory be obtained at higher oxygen fugacity, since Fe then becomes more incompatible as Fe3+ [14]. For example, pMELTS calculations at FMQ+0.5 increases the Mg# by almost two log units, from 78.5 to 80.5 at a melt fraction of 0.3, compared to the FMQ-2 experiments of [4]. It is thus possible to generate a residual mantle source with CaO/Al2O3 ratios around 1.0 and a Mg# close to 80 by high degree melting of a primitive martian mantle. Using a sligthly different starting mantle composition with a Mg#77 [2,3] could in theory produce mantle residues with a Mg# close to 82. Maximum possible estimates of the martian mantle (Mg#80) can raise the Mg# of the residual mantle up to 85. Another factor that should be taken into account for the production of an alumina-depleted (thus with a high CaO/Al2O3) source is the influence of water. As described by [15], low-degree hydrous melts are even more enriched in Al2O3 than dry melts. Extraction of low-degree hydrous melts will thus results in residues that have even higher CaO/Al2O3 than residues of dry melting.   Fig.2. Composition of partial melts of various depleted Martian mantle compositions. The residual mantle after wet melting is taken from [15].  Partial melts of the depleted martian mantle:  Melting of the possible depleted martian mantle compositions (0.5-1.0 GPa residual melts) has been estimated with pMelts. Comparison between pMelts calculations and the experiments of [4] indicates that it slightly underestimates the CaO/Al2O3 ratio of the melts, so pMelts calculations should be considered minimum values. Fig. 2 indicates that partial melting of depleted mantle compositions, particularly the most depleted ones with the highest melt fraction extracted, can indeed produce melts with CaO/Al2O3 ratios larger than 1, and possibly up to the value of 1.2 required for depleted shergottites. Other factors that have not been taken into account so far could contribute to producing even higher CaO/Al2O3 ratios : the possible presence of CO2 in the mantle source [16] or the influence of pressure which increases the CaO/Al2O3 ratio of the partial melts [17]. Shergottites are young rocks, likely produced by the young hotspot volcanoes of the Elysium and Tharsis areas. The mantle source of shergottites has, however, been produced in the early stages of the martian history. The high temperatures associated with longlived hotspots may explain the remelting of mantle domains that have been isolated due to their low fusibility for most of the planet's history.
