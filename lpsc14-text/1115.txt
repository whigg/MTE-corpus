LATE NOACHIAN ICY HIGHLANDS: PATTERNS OF ICE ACCUMULATION AND FLOW. James L.  Fastook1 and James W. Head2, 1University of Maine, Orono, ME 04469, fastook@maine.edu, 2Brown University, Providence, RI 02912.  Introduction: The record of non-polar ice deposits throughout the Amazonian suggest a cold and dry climate not significantly different from the present climate observed on Mars [1], where latitudinal movement of ice is largely in response to the varying obliquity component of the spin-axis/orbital parameters [2]. When one looks further into the past to the Noachian, the record is less clear and the characterization of the early martian climate is less certain. The existence of liquid water that flowed across the surface [3, 4, 5, 6] as well as open- and closed-basin lakes [5] has lead many to suggest that early Mars was “wet and warm” [7, 8]. Others argue that the early martian climate was more likely much colder and considerably drier [9, 10] based on a number of lines of evidence that include proposed phyllosilicate formation mechanisms [11], low erosion rates [12], poorly integrated valley networks with the open-basin lakes that suggest shortterm episodic fluvial formation rather than long-term pluvial activity [13], as well as the possibility that the form of most precipitation might have been nivial [14]. The existence of a late-Noachian south circumpolar ice sheet [15] for which modeling studies suggest a meanannual temperature well below freezing [16] also argues for a “cold and dry” early Martian climate. Terrestrial analogs from the Antarctic Dry Valleys demonstrate that fluvial activity can take place at temperatures well below freezing [17, 18]. Recent estimates of the rate of water lost to space [19] has reduced the amount of water available for a “wet” Mars, and evidence from Martian meteorite requiring lower atmospheric pressures [20], when coupled with the faint young Sun, makes it very difficult for atmospheric modelers to produce a “warm” Mars [21]. “Extreme” events such as meteorite impacts have been proposed, whereby an ephemeral “steam” atmosphere lasting a few thousand years might exist and produce the observed landforms [22, 23, 24], however, landform evolution modeling seems to contradict these findings [25].  Recent atmospheric modeling results [26, 27], demonstrate that moderate pressures accompanied by a full water cycle produce an atmosphere where temperature declines with elevation following an adiabatic lapse rate, in contrast to the current situation on Mars, where temperature is almost completely determined by latitude. Lower temperatures at higher elevations encourage the movement of water from the warmer lowlands to the colder southern highlands, where it is sequestered in the form of regional ice sheets above an ice stability line that occurs close to 1000 m elevation. This ice, effectively “stored” at higher elevations can then be released by “extreme” events, such as meteorite impacts or volcanism, without the need to invoke the “steam” atmosphere. Further geological implications of this “cold and icy” scenario are explored in [18]. Any meltwater produced seasonally during these episodes would flow naturally to the lowlands in exactly the areas where the geologic record requires liquid water to be present and flowing across the landscape [18]. As the climate cooled again, water frozen below the ice stability line would sublime and return to the highlands as snowfall [27]. We analyze the nature and development of the “icy highlands” using glacial flow models.   Results: A modeling exercise using a Mars-adapted University of Maine Ice Sheet Model [16] with a climate defined by [27], (i.e., with both a latitudinal and an elevation lapse rate, warmer towards the equator and colder to higher elevations) is run in a “supplylimited” scenario [28] for a range of available water (1 to 20 times the current polar cap volume), a range of Late Noachian geothermal fluxes (45-65 mW/m2). The bed for the gridded model area (Fig. 1) and results displayed in grid coordinates for the 5X-65 mW/m2 case  (Fig. 2) are shown. Note that the south pole is located at grid (0,0) and the x- and y-axes are in km.  A supply-limited model is required because if we allow unlimited growth, the ice sheet volume quickly exceeds the known inventory of water available on Mars. By maintaining separate positive (accumulation) and negative (ablation) mass balance components we can limit growth to a specific volume by reducing the positive component as the computed volume of the ice sheet approaches the supply-limited volume. Results for various supply limits and geothermal fluxes are shown in Table 1.  1115.pdf

   Average thicknesses range from a few hundred m for the 1X case to well over a km for the 10X and 20X cases. With the thin ice required by the 1X and 2X cases no bottom melting is observed, even in the infilled craters where the ice thickness approaches 1 km. Very limited bottom melting in craters, ~1% by area, is first observed with a supply limit of 5X. Increasing supply to 10X increases the number of craters with basal melting, but still does not produce any widespread areas of melted bed. Only at the unreasonable supply of 20X does any widespread melting occur, with most in the thick interior of the now much larger ice sheet. These subglacial lakes, analogous to terrestrial lakes such as Vostok in Antarctica, would infill with sediment, perhaps helping to explain the shallow, degraded character of Noachian highland craters. Our conclusion is that the Noachian icy highlands are unlikely to have ever had widespread wet bed conditions, although the presence of limited “lakes” in deep craters is a possibility. While coldbased ice sheets such as we expect for the Noachian icy highlands are known from terrestrial analogs to leave few traces on the landscape, internal movement within the ice sheet might be expected to produce landforms indicative of that flow. The thin ice sheets, with velocities ranging from 0.1 to 1 mm/year for the 1X case and up to 4-5 mm/yr for the 2X case do not show the organized flow of an equilibrium ice sheet (radial flow from a dome center toward the lower-elevation ice sheet margins). Instead, with an almost uniform layer draping the terrain, most flow follows topographic slopes down mountainsides and scarps, and into crater interiors. This pattern of flow with thin ice cover should enhance the shedding of rim debris onto the ice surface that is carried into the crater, potentially producing CCF-like filling of the crater floors [28]. Even the 5X case, with velocities in the 10-20 mm/yr range, displays a very disorganized flow pattern typical of flow down topographic slopes. The 10X case, with velocities of 30-50 mm/yr away from the margins, does display the flow pattern of an equilibrium ice sheet. In this case, narrow regions of “fast” flow with velocities exceed 100 mm/yr, are observed near the margin and concentrated in topographic low areas. These “ice streams” are even more pronounced in the 20X case, with velocities of 500-700 mm/yr. Our conclusion for the Late Noachian Icy Highlands is that the velocities in general are very low, less than a few mm/yr, and that the flow pattern is disorganized and follows topography, with no radial flow pattern typical of an equilibrium ice sheet.
