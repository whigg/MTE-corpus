With active sand dunes [1], a central mound whose formation, erosion, and likely exhumation has been heavily driven by aeolian processes [1-6], and evidence for abrasion reflected in measured exposure ages of rocks [7], wind has been and remains a major geologic agent. The active dunes in Gale provide a unique opportunity to study active Martian sand dunes at a range of scales ranging from HiRISE orbital images to small bedforms and even sand grains. With Curiosity's payload of high resolution imagers [8-10] and the REMS meteorological package [11], the potential exists to correlate dune and ripple migration with current conditions.   On Curiosity, Mastcam provides stereo color imaging with two cameras, M34 (34 mm focal length) (left eye) and M100 (right eye), with pixel scales of 220 and 74 µrad, respectively [10]. RMI, at 19.6 µrad/pixel [8,9], is the highest resolution remote imager ever put on a planetary surface in terms of pixel sampling, exceeded only in spatial scale by microscopic imagers placed close to rocks and soils. With these pixel scales, RMI and M100 exceed the resolution of HiRISE (27 cm pixel scale from 270 km) at distances of ~14 and 3.6 km, respectively. Curiosity's landing point at Bradbury was about 2.5 km from the "Bagnold" dune field to the south, with the rover getting closer to the dunes since leaving Yellowknife Bay. Therefore, already the resolution exceeds that from HiRISE. This abstract reports on initial observations of sand dunes with combined M100 and RMI images. Although the timespan and colocation of MSL images is thus far insufficient to document changes, we show that ripple patterns at scales finer than that seen from orbit offer the promise of monitoring future dune dynamics    Methods  During MSL surface operations, RMI and M100 were specifically targeted on the "Bagnold" dune field surrounding Mt. Sharp (Table 1). Images were processed by the MSL Team using standard pipelines and procedures (e.g., 9) and mosaics made where there were two or more frames.

This compares with 12 HiRISE images each acquired before  (4/22/07-8/1/12) and after (8/6/12-9/30/13) landing. The MSL images show clear ripple sets that, as seen in HiRISE, are located on sand patches (Fig. 2-3). Future work will register the features seen in the two datasets. No barchans dune slip faces are yet seen from the surface because they are occluded by foreground topography.  1849.pdf

Discussion  Although the dunes in the vicinity of MSL have not yet been analyzed for changes in HiRISE images, those to the southwest with similar morphologies have migration rates of ~ 0.4 m per Earth year [1]. With proper registration and assuming that changes over three pixels can be discerned, RMI and MCAM at 2.5 km distance should see such changes in just ~130 and 500 days, respectively (Fig. 4). Presently, topographic obscuration and temporal coverage have not yet allowed detection of movement. However, as Curiosity gets closer to the dunes, such changes should be easier to see both because of the higher spatial resolution and lower required temporal baseline. Primary and secondary ripples, which should have migration rates faster than larger dunes, will be seen at correspondingly smaller time scales. Through such studies, migration rates and sand fluxes from ripples and dunes [12] can be determined.  Figure 3: Schematic diagram of bedform displacement vs. elapsed time. Horizontal lines delineate 3 pixel displacements that can be discerned by HiRISE from a 270 km slant distance and M100 and RMI from 2.5 km. The diagonal dashed line is Gale dune migration rate of 0.4 m yr1 as determined by [1].  References [1] Silvestro, S. et al. (2013), Geology, 41, 483-486 [2] Malin, M. C., and K. S.
