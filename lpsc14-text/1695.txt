Thermal Emission Photometry of Three Near-Earth Asteroids in L' and M' Lucy F. Lim1, Nicholas A.Moskovitz2, Cristina Thomas3, Ellen Howell4, Josh Emery5, Lance Benner6, 1NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,(lucy.f.lim@nasa.gov), 2Lowell Observatory, 3ORAU/NASA GSFC, 4NAIC/Arecibo Obs., 5U. Tenn. Knoxville, 6JPLWe successfully acquired JKL'M' (1.2-4.7 µm; [1])spectrophotometry of three sub-km near-Earth asteroidradar targets during 2013. Thermal emission measurements in L' and M' were taken in order to characterize the sizes and thermal properties of the targets. Reflectance data in J and K were taken to aid in separatingthe thermal from the reflected flux in L'. In addition, weused the J band as a reference filter to characterize the rotational variability in the asteroid lightcurves during thethermal observations.Asteroid (163249) 2002 GT was observed usingNIRI on Gemini North [2]. Numerous coordinating observations of this asteroid were made as part of a campaign to characterize it in advance of a potential spacecraft encounter (e.g. [3]) which resulted in a rotation period of 3.77 h and an S-complex spectral classfication(likely Sq or Q, [4, 5, 6]). The H magnitude was determined to be H=18.63 ± 0.04 and the R-band magnitudeslope parameter to be G=0.18± 0.02 (formal errors; realerrors up to 2x higher (P. Pravec, pers. comm.)).Potentially hazardous asteroids (277475) 2005 WK4and (137126) 1999 CF9 were observed with NSFCam2on the IRTF [7] and were also successfully measuredfrom the Goldstone and/or Arecibo radar observatories.Radar imaging of 2005 WK4 shows a spheroidal shapeand a diameter of 250 ± ≈20 m. SpeX data indicatethat both 2005 WK4 and 1999 CF9 are also S-complexobjects. Further analysis of these data are in progress.Table 1: Summary of ObservationsData Date ∆ Phase Vmag(UT) (AU) (Degrees)2002 GT, Gemini North/NIRIJKL'M' 2013-Jun-13 0.136 52.8 16.6JKL' 2013-Jun-19 0.125 65.2 16.42005 WK4, IRTF/NSFCam2JKL'M' 2013-Aug-12 0.026 44.3 13.951999 CF9, IRTF/NSFCam2JKL'M' 2013-Aug-28 0.086 45.6 14.45Acknowledgements: The authors would like to expresstheir appreciation to the observatory staff from Geminiand IRTF, especially Andrew Stephens, Mike Connelley, Bill Golisch, Dave Griep, Chad Trujillo, and Marcel Bergmann.

Thermal model fluxes shown correspond to the asteroid standard thermal model [8] withsubsolar-point temperatures of 372 K (low thermal inertia), 336 K (moderately high thermal inertia) and 313 K(high thermal inertia). Data are consistent with a moderately high thermal inertia. Error bars are very approximate.for this work.References[1] A. T. Tokunaga, D. A. Simons, W. D. Vacca, PASP 114,180 (2002).[2] K. W.
