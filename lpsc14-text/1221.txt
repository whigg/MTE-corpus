Introduction: Arabia Terra is the largest expanse of ancient highlands material north of the Martian equator. Crater size-frequency distribution analysis indicates the region formed during the Noachian and has been exposed to various geologic processes since that time. Orbiters and the Opportunity rover provide abundant evidence that long-lived subsurface and surficial volatiles have influenced the geologic evolution of the Arabia Terra region [e.g., 1-4]. In this study, we use information provided by impact craters to investigate the role of volatiles in the history of this region. Impact crater morphologies provide insight into (a) the presence of subsurface volatiles at the time of crater formation, (b) presence of surface volatiles since crater formation, particularly from deposits contained within the craters, and (c) timing of specific geologic processes through the use of crater size-frequency distribution analysis. This discussion focuses on the regional distributions of subsurface volatiles, surface glacial features, and surface fluvial processes. Methodology: We are classifying interior and ejecta morphologies of all craters ≥1-km-diameter within the Arabia Terra region north of the Martian equator (generally 0-40°N, 30°W-85°E, exclusive of Syrtis Major) using Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) Context Camera (CTX) imagery (6 m/pixel resolution) [5]. We have completed classification of ~97% of all craters ≥5-km-diameter within the study region and of ~20% of all craters in the 1 to 5 km diameter range. This discussion focuses on results from the 6577 craters ≥5 km in diameter. Diameter measurements are made using the crater measurement function in JMars. Ejecta morphologies are classified into the standard layered (single, double, multiple) and non-layered (radial) classes [6]. Interior morphologies are divided into approximately 30 subclasses, of which 15 are related to volatiles. Ejecta and interior classes are further subdivided into whether they are indicative of volatiles present at the time of crater formation or due to activity subsequent to crater formation. The data are collected in an Excel spreadsheet and imported into ArcGIS to produce distribution maps. Age information from crater size-frequency distribution analysis is obtained using the CraterStats program [7]. Volatiles Contemporaneous with Crater Formation: Ejecta morphologies and certain interior structures are representative of conditions at the time of crater formation. Layered ejecta morphologies are associated with interaction of ejected material with volatiles (either subsurface or atmospheric) during the crater excavation stage [8]. Central pits on Mars are generally considered to form by impact vaporization or melting of volatile-rich target materials [9-11]. Pitted terrain consists of multitudes of small pits formed by volatile degassing in hot impact melt deposits [12, 13]. Terrain softening results from relaxation of sharp topographic features due to the presence of substantial quantities of ice in the target [14]. Nested craters, which display a topographic bench interior to the crater wall, form when craters excavate through an overlying weak layer into stronger bedrock. Terrestrial marine craters display this type of structure and thus some researchers have proposed that Martian nested craters could be indicative of water-covered landscapes either during or preceeding crater formation [e.g. 15]. Our analysis reveals that layered ejecta blankets and central pit craters occur throughout the Arabia Terra study region, suggesting the long-term presence of subsurface volatiles. Pitted terrain is more localized but present in most of the fresher craters in the region, which also is consistent with a wide distribution of subsurface volatiles. Terrain softened craters are primarily found within the northern section of the study region. The distribution of these combined morphologies is shown in Fig. 1.  Figure 1: Distribution of craters indicating subsurface volatiles. Background map is MOLA colorized topography. Nested craters, if formed by impact into sediments deposited in a marine environment, should preferentially be found at lower elevations where water would pond. However, as shown in Fig. 2, we find nested craters at various elevations throughout the Arabia Terra region, with no particular concentration along the putative northern ocean shoreline along the dichotomy boundary in this area. In fact, the highest concentration of nested craters in the study region is in the higher elevation terrain west of Syrtis Major. This suggests  that the weaker overlying layer needed for nested crater formation is not necessarily of marine/lacustrine origin.  Figure 2: Distribution of nested craters. Note that the highest concentrations are found in the higher (yellow to brown color on background MOLA map) terrains. Volatiles Subsequent to Crater Formation: Impact craters serve as catchment basins for materials deposited by other geologic processes and can therefore retain evidence of processes operating during past epochs when climatic conditions differed from today's cold, dry environment. Craters in Arabia Terra retain a number of features indicative of liquid water and ice. Features indicating the role of liquid water include sediments at the terminus of rim-cutting channels, layered floor deposits, channels cutting the crater floor, and gullies along the crater wall. Figure 3 shows the distribution of these water-related morphologies within the Arabia Terra study region. We find that surface water activity has mainly been concentrated along the dichotomy boundary in northern Arabia and south of ~20°N.  Figure 3: Distribution of craters containing evidence of fluvial processes. A number of morphologies are interpreted as being ice-rich and are likely associated with increased midlatitude snowfall during high obliquity periods [e.g. 16]. Features associated with contain substantial quantities of ice include lineated terrain, floor deposits topped by polygonal terrain, and irregular depressions suggestive of thermokarst. A thin deposit often seen covering both the crater and the surrounding terrain consists of small hummocks, which we have termed hummocky fallout material. We also find deposits which show combinations of lineated terrain, polygonal terrain, irregular depressions, and fractured materials suggestive of viscous flow, which we have termed anomalous terrain. Figure 4 shows the distribution of these ice-related morphologies within the study area. Most are located north of 25°N latitude.  Figure 4: Distribution of craters containing ice-rich materials.  Unusual Ejecta Morphology: In the course of this study, we have identified layered ejecta deposits which display morphologic characteristics unlike those seen elsewhere on the planet. These ejecta deposits display many of the same characteristics as the anomalous terrain: i.e., lineated terrain, polygonal terrain, irregular depressions, and fractured materials suggestive of viscous flow. They are typically found in the same areas where we see other features indicative of ice-rich materials which are undergoing flow. We therefore propose that these unusual ejecta deposits result from incorporation of much larger quantites of ice than normal ejecta morphologies. We suggest that this morphology results when craters form in the ice-rich surface materials deposited during high obliquity periods.
