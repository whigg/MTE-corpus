Reed Rock (RR) and South ReedRock (SRR) are two basaltic hydrovolcanoes locatedwithin the Fort Rock Volcanic Field (FRVF) in CentralOregon that erupted in the late Pleistocene in the presence of an ancient pluvial lake that once existed there[1]. The discovery of endolithic microbores (microbialichnofossils) in the RR and SRR tuffs indicates thatsimilar to previously studied ocean crust, submarineand subaqueous basalts and hyaloclastites [e.g. 2, 3, 4,5], these types of deposits are habitable. These deposits, however, were not habitable throughout their history. We present a record of observed textures andprimary and secondary mineralogy of these tuffsrepresenting a substrate for a habitable environmentand infer a sequence of stages that eventually lead totheir habitability. Textural characteristics provide arecord of eruption dynamics [6] and primary and secondary minerals identified in these deposits haveformed under specific temperature and pH conditions,providing constraints on the crystallization and hydrothermal histories.Methods: Representative samples of basaltic tuffwith a range of alteration textures, colours, grain sizesand/or stratigraphic relationships were collected fromtwo adjacent tuff rings (RR and SRR). An OlympusBX51 System microscope was used for petrographicanalysis. Micro X-ray diffraction (µXRD) was doneusing a Bruker D8 Discover diffractometer with 300µm and 100 µm nominal beam diameters. This allowsanalysis of rock sample mineralogy in situ and enablescorrelation of microscopic data from a polarizing microscope with crystal structural data [7]. A RigakuGeigerflex diffractometer was used for powder XRD.Stage 1 (Eruption and Deposition): RR and SRRerupted in the presence of abundant external water (hydro- phreatomagmatic). Indurated pyroclastics of multiple <1 cm to m-scale quaquaversal beds moderatelyto poorly sorted with alternations between coarser andfiner lapilli and ash rich layers typify surges and ashfalls deposited in individual explosions during sustained explosive events and sporadic pulses [8]. Finerash layers show slight undulatory forms (Fig.1A), lesscommon massive (>1 m) layers are highly altered(Fig.1B). Bomb sags (Fig.1C), vesicular matrix andscoria cored accretionary lapilli suggest external nonmagmatic water contents of at least 15-20% [1].Coarse angular accidental lithics up to 1 m in diameterand lensoidal explosion breccia interbeds indicate considerable groundwater involvement. RR contains aresistant lava cap and intrusive dike that represent adecrease in explosivity and transition to effusive volcanism in the form of a small lava pond at the vent asgroundwater was drawn down and excluded from theconduit [9]. Further indications of brittle chilling/waterinduced rapid cooling are the 25-37% angular blockyglassy pyroclasts (Fig.2) of lapilli to fine ash with fracture networks [6, 9], and primary undercooled mineraltextures including swallow tail plagioclase and hopperolivine crystals. Overall crystallinity is low (~1-10%).Stage 2 (Hydrothermal Alteration): The magmatic heat source drove penecontemporaneous and postdepositional hydrothermal alteration. The initial glassalteration product to form was palagonite. Volatilestrapped within vesicles produced rims propagatingoutward 5-40 µm thick (Fig.3A) and condensed steamon pyroclasts in hot cohesive tuff produced palagoniteFig.1. Representative features at RR.

Temperature constraints on hydrothermal and microbial bioalteration in Reed and South Reed Rock basaltictuffs. (Modified from Chipera & Apps, 2001)propagating inward from margins (Fig.3B) at temperatures of ~25-120 ± 5ºC (Fig.5) [6, 11]. Secondaryminerals chabazite (zeolite), and nontronite (smectite)are present as components of palagonitic material. Apparently no olivine altered to smectite, constraining theupper hydrothermal temperature at 120ºC (Fig.5) [10].The lack of chabazite at SRR indicates temperatures>80ºC whereas an abundance of palagonitic andassociated pore filling chabazite at RR suggest temperatures <80ºC. During compaction, hot aqueous fluidsmigrated through heterogeneous temperature regimesand fluid pathways of fracture networks and coarseclast supported layers producing variable alterationthroughout. Abundant pore and fracture filling calcite,which occurs over wider temperature range (~0-270ºC)[11], was precipitated throughout the duration of alteration. A second heating was likely caused by the lateeffusive lava flow and dike intrusion at RR.Stage 3 (Microbial Bioalteration): Following hydrothermal alteration, temperatures decreased enough(~25ºC) for microorganisms to tolerate. Microbes wereintroduced by ground and/or surface waters that migrated through fractures into vesicles (Fig.4), and produced endolithic microbores as they dissolved and oxidized the glass. Tubules propagate beyond palagoniticalteration fronts (Fig.4A) and show no evidence ofalteration within them. They were therefore producedbelow the temperature range of palagonite/nontroniteformation (<25ºC) (Fig.5) [10, 11]. At this time, calcitecontinued to precipitate within vesicles and voids asevidenced by microtubules radiating from calcite filledvesicles (Fig.4B). The abundance of calcite also indicates neutral to alkaline conditions during microbialactivity.Significance to Astrobiology (Mars): This studydemonstrates that hydrothermally altered, subaeriallyerupted, basaltic hydro-phreatovolcanic tuffs are habitable environments under certain conditions. Basalticrocks are the dominant lithology on Mars and hydrovolcanic landforms have been identified in variousstudies [e.g. 12]. Amorphous basaltic glass, a highquality substrate that promotes microbial growth [13],and its devitrification products (hydrated phyllosilicates) are indicated by orbital and rover based studies[e.g. 14, 15]. This opens up new possibilities in thesearch for habitability and extraterrestrial life, particularly on Mars.References: [1] Heiken GH (1971) JGR, 76 (23),5615-5626. [2] Fisk MR et al.
