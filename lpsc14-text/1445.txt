Introduction: The habitability for microbial life in subaerially erupted tuff deposits, formed by volcanic eruptions driven by the interaction between basaltic magma and external ground or surface water, have received little attention. Reed Rock (RR) and South Reed Rock (SRR) are two basaltic hydrovolcanoes located within the Fort Rock Volcanic Field (FRVF) in Central Oregon that erupted in the late Pleistocene in the presence of an ancient pluvial lake that once existed there [1]. The discovery of endolithic microbores (microbial ichnofossils) in the RR and SRR tuffs indicates that similar to previously studied ocean crust, submarine and subaqueous basalts and hyaloclastites [e.g. 2, 3, 4, 5], these types of deposits are habitable. These deposits, however, were not habitable throughout their history. We present a record of observed textures and primary and secondary mineralogy of these tuffs representing a substrate for a habitable environment and infer a sequence of stages that eventually lead to their habitability. Textural characteristics provide a record of eruption dynamics [6] and primary and secondary minerals identified in these deposits have formed under specific temperature and pH conditions, providing constraints on the crystallization and hydrothermal histories. Methods: Representative samples of basaltic tuff with a range of alteration textures, colours, grain sizes and/or stratigraphic relationships were collected from two adjacent tuff rings (RR and SRR). An Olympus BX51 System microscope was used for petrographic analysis. Micro X-ray diffraction (µXRD) was done using a Bruker D8 Discover diffractometer with 300 µm and 100 µm nominal beam diameters. This allows analysis of rock sample mineralogy in situ and enables correlation of microscopic data from a polarizing microscope with crystal structural data [7]. A Rigaku Geigerflex diffractometer was used for powder XRD. Stage 1 (Eruption and Deposition): RR and SRR erupted in the presence of abundant external water (hydro- phreatomagmatic). Indurated pyroclastics of multiple <1 cm to m-scale quaquaversal beds moderately to poorly sorted with alternations between coarser and finer lapilli and ash rich layers typify surges and ash falls deposited in individual explosions during sustained explosive events and sporadic pulses [8]. Finer ash layers show slight undulatory forms (Fig.1A), less common massive (>1 m) layers are highly altered (Fig.1B). Bomb sags (Fig.1C), vesicular matrix and scoria cored accretionary lapilli suggest external nonmagmatic water contents of at least 15-20% [1]. Coarse angular accidental lithics up to 1 m in diameter and lensoidal explosion breccia interbeds indicate considerable groundwater involvement. RR contains a resistant lava cap and intrusive dike that represent a decrease in explosivity and transition to effusive volcanism in the form of a small lava pond at the vent as groundwater was drawn down and excluded from the conduit [9]. Further indications of brittle chilling/water induced rapid cooling are the 25-37% angular blocky glassy pyroclasts (Fig.2) of lapilli to fine ash with fracture networks [6, 9], and primary undercooled mineral textures including swallow tail plagioclase and hopper olivine crystals. Overall crystallinity is low (~1-10%). Stage 2 (Hydrothermal Alteration): The magmatic heat source drove penecontemporaneous and postdepositional hydrothermal alteration. The initial glass alteration product to form was palagonite. Volatiles trapped within vesicles produced rims propagating outward 5-40 µm thick (Fig.3A) and condensed steam on pyroclasts in hot cohesive tuff produced palagonite Fig.1.

Temperature constraints on hydrothermal and microbial bioalteration in Reed and South Reed Rock basaltic tuffs. (Modified from Chipera & Apps, 2001) propagating inward from margins (Fig.3B) at temperatures of ~25-120 ± 5ºC (Fig.5) [6, 11]. Secondary minerals chabazite (zeolite), and nontronite (smectite) are present as components of palagonitic material. Apparently no olivine altered to smectite, constraining the upper hydrothermal temperature at 120ºC (Fig.5) [10]. The lack of chabazite at SRR indicates temperatures >80ºC whereas an abundance of palagonitic and associated pore filling chabazite at RR suggest temperatures <80ºC. During compaction, hot aqueous fluids migrated through heterogeneous temperature regimes and fluid pathways of fracture networks and coarse clast supported layers producing variable alteration throughout. Abundant pore and fracture filling calcite, which occurs over wider temperature range (~0-270ºC) [11], was precipitated throughout the duration of alteration. A second heating was likely caused by the late effusive lava flow and dike intrusion at RR. Stage 3 (Microbial Bioalteration): Following hydrothermal alteration, temperatures decreased enough (~25ºC) for microorganisms to tolerate. Microbes were introduced by ground and/or surface waters that migrated through fractures into vesicles (Fig.4), and produced endolithic microbores as they dissolved and oxidized the glass. Tubules propagate beyond palagonitic alteration fronts (Fig.4A) and show no evidence of alteration within them. They were therefore produced below the temperature range of palagonite/nontronite formation (<25ºC) (Fig.5) [10, 11]. At this time, calcite continued to precipitate within vesicles and voids as evidenced by microtubules radiating from calcite filled vesicles (Fig.4B). The abundance of calcite also indicates neutral to alkaline conditions during microbial activity. Significance to Astrobiology (Mars): This study demonstrates that hydrothermally altered, subaerially erupted, basaltic hydro-phreatovolcanic tuffs are habitable environments under certain conditions. Basaltic rocks are the dominant lithology on Mars and hydrovolcanic landforms have been identified in various studies [e.g. 12]. Amorphous basaltic glass, a high quality substrate that promotes microbial growth [13], and its devitrification products (hydrated phyllosilicates) are indicated by orbital and rover based studies [e.g. 14, 15]. This opens up new possibilities in the search for habitability and extraterrestrial life, particularly on Mars. References: [1] Heiken GH (1971) JGR, 76 (23), 5615-5626. [2] Fisk MR et al.
