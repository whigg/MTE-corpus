Introduction: The Syrtis Major volcanic province, including the entire Syrtis Major Planum, is located near the Martian highland/lowland transitional zone west of Isidis Planitia. It covers ~7.4×105 km2 and contains two low-shield volcanic edifices with N-S elongated calderas named Nili and Meroe Paterae. The estimated thickness of erupted material in the province ranges from approximately 0.5 km to 1.0 km with a total volume of about 1.6-3.2×105 km3 [1]. The timing of volcanic activity in the Syrtis Major volcanic province has been suggested to be restricted to the Hesperian Period [1-4]. In the geological map of Greeley and Guest [2], volcanic material of Syrtis Major was assigned an Hesperian age based on the density of observed craters larger than 5 km in diameter. Using the same crater density range, recent studies of Hiesinger et al. [1] and Tanaka et al. [3] and Tanaka et al. [4] assigned an Early Hesperian and Early to Late Hesperian age, respectively, for the entire province. Werner [5] and Robbins et al. [6] determined formation ages for caldera (segments) of Nili and Meroe Paterae. They report model ages of 2.33/3.73 Ga [5] and 230 Ma to 3.77 Ga [6] for Meroe Patera, and 1.613.55 Ga for Nili Patera [6]. In this study we mapped lava flows, lava channels, and major lava-flow margins and report model ages for lava-flow formation and caldera segments of Nili and Meroe Paterae. The objective of this ongoing survey is to better understand the eruption frequency of this volcanic province. Methods: The identification and mapping of regional geological units and the surface expressions of successions of lava flow units in major volcanic provinces requires simplification of the surface geology. This is due to the fact that small and narrow features such as lava flows are often not resolveable at small scales. As a result, episodes of volcanic activity and associated erupted materials are summarized in flow fields, members, or sequences. However, the premise is that numerous lava flows and flow margins are identifiable. In the case of Syrtis Major Planum, clear lavaflow margins are only sporadically observed due to airfall dust and ash deposition and, more importantly, extensive contractional phases forming intersecting networks of wrinkle ridges. At small map scales, such as used for global geological maps of Mars, the volcanic materials of the Syrtis Major volcanic province are mapped as Syrtis Major Formation unit (Hs) [2] and Early Hesperian volcanic unit (eHv) [3]. Estimating the formation age of regional geological units, Tanaka [7] and Werner and Tanaka [8] defined timestratigraphic period and epoch boundaries based on crater densities. Here, cumulative numbers of craters larger than 1 km (N1), 2 km (N2), 5 km (N5), and 16 km (N16) were used for epoch boundary assignments [7,8]. Based on the N(5) value, the Syrtis Major volcanic province (unit eHv) was formed during the Early Hesperian [3]. Due to (a) the areal variability of geological units, (b) the heterogeneous distribution of large impact craters, and (c) the different degrees of impact crater burial across Syrtis Major Planum, the N(5)-based age likely represents the beginning of formation of the uppermost 100 m or so of material (in which rims of 5 km diameter craters remain exposed). Thus, there may be older flows at greater depths as well as younger flows in the mix of flows at or near the surface. Extracting these ages in greater detail, of which the latter are available for closer scrutiny, enables reconstruction of a more comprehensive temporal evolution of the province's volcanism. To this end, we targeted individual lava flows across the volcanic province and mapped them on the THEMIS IR daytime global mosaic (100 m/px) at a map scale of 1:100,000. We also mapped isolated major lava-flow margins and lava channels. In order to achieve representative statistical data, mapping and crater size-frequency determinations should cover proximal, medial, and distal reaches of the province. However, this approach was restricted by the availability and quality of high-resolution image data, as well as suitable exposures in the mapping data. In addition, dust/ash mantling in various portions of the province as well as the extensive presence of wrinkle ridges locally inhibited clear identification of lava-flow boundaries. To obtain age estimates for volcanic units exposed in distal reaches, we have included volcanic intra-crater surfaces at the periphery of the province.  Crater size-frequency distributions (CSFD) were mapped on HRSC and CTX imagery using CraterTools [9]. CSFDs were analyzed and model ages determined in Craterstats [10] using the production and chronology functions of Ivanov [11] and Hartmann and Neukum [12], respectively.

Volcanic material encompasses the grey area with other colours representing surrounding cratered highland and lowland (in Isidis Planitia) units [3].

Fig. 1: Aggregated age measurements. See Platz and Michael [14] for more details on producing this plot. of the utilization of the crater-counting technique and its limitations with respect to small-scale mapping is given in Platz et al. [13]. Results: In total, we mapped 67 lava flows, caldera segments, and intra-crater fillings of which 55 were dated. Model ages range between 838 Ma (Middle Amazonian) to 3.6 Ga (Late Hesperian) [Figs 1 and 2].  Figure 1 shows a plot of aggregated age measurements including the frequency of best-fit ages. In our survey, a broad age peak occurs between 2 to 2.6 Ga, continuously declining thereafter. We note that three caldera units show Middle Amazonian and later Early Amazonian best-fit ages. A light-toned deposit within Nili Patera was dated at 0.96 Ga. In Meroe Patera, the outer and central caldera floors were chosen for crater counting returning 1.42 Ga and 1.85 Ga, respectively. Discussion: The spectrum of model ages derived for lava flows, intra-crater fillings, and caldera segments range from Late Hesperian to Middle Amazonian. It clearly points to a long-lasting volcanic activity in this province, although the majority of erupted material was formed during the Early Hesperian Epoch or earlier, decreasing thereafter. Because most studied lava flows experienced post-emplacement contractional deformation, the tectonic history also extended into the Amazonian Period. References: [1] Hiesinger H. and Head J. W.
