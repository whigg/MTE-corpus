Introduction:  The howardites are polymict brecciated meteorites of the HED group. Pyroxenitic rock and mineral fragments represent the diogenitic component of the howardite breccias and are generally assumed to originate from the mantle or lower crust of the HED parent body. A fragment of atypical unequilibrated orthopyroxenite from the Yurtuk howardite was studied by optical microscopy, SEM and EMP. We propose that the pyroxenite represents a portion of the melt from the upper layer of a diogenite magma chamber that was quickly cooled during an impact event. Results: The large 6 x 4 mm elliptical rock fragment mainly consists of subhedral pyroxene grains  150 - 1000 µm in size (92 vol%) (Fig. 1). The pyroxene grains are normally zoned from En77-82Wo0.5 (Fe/Mn=37) in the cores to En66-63Wo1-4 in the rims. Orthopyroxene crystals poikilitically enclose a minor olivine (4 vol%) forming anhedral grains or skeletal crystals 100-150 µm in size (Fig. 1, 2) of homogeneous composition (Fo65.5; Fe/Mn = 48). Most are surrounded by discontinuous rims of fine-grained (1-3 μm) symplectites of chromite and orthopyroxene replacing the olivine, described by [1].  The interstices of the orthopyroxene grains (4 vol%) are filled by fine-grained mineral aggregate (mesostasis, Mes) of three different compositional types: 1) graphic-like Cpx (En40.9 Wo44.6) and Fsp (An90Ab10) (Fig. 3); 2) graphic- to granular textured Cpx - low-Ca Px (En65.7Wo1.5) - Fsp (Fig. 3); and finegrained polymineral pyroxene aggregate (En31Wo46, minor En73Wo3.5,), feldspar (An92), silica, minor troilite, Fe-metal (2.8 wt.% Ni, Ni/Co = 1.4), chromite and ilmenite (Fig. 4). The narrow discontinuous bounds of Cpx (En38Wo48) intergrowing with minor feldspar and silica are developed along the contacts of mesostasis and orthopyroxene (Fig. 4). Narrow interstices usually are filled by Mes 1) or 2). Large interstices are filled by Mes 1) gradually changing from Mes 2) and Mes 3) to the central parts of the interstices. The pyroxenitic rock is fractured with most of the closed cracks crossing the pyroxene and olivine and disappearing at the contacts with the mesostasis.  Some cracks are filled with chromite.  Discussion: The pyroxene composition of the pyroxenitic fragment is in the range of diogenites [2-4]. The olivine is less magnesian than that of diogenites [5] and is similar in composition to that from olivine diogenite NWA 1459 [6]. Modal mineral composition of the rock corresponds to diogenites [7]. The average composition of the pyroxene of the pyroxenitic clast is En72.9Wo1.2, so the difference of MG# between the pyroxene and olivine of pyroxenite clast from Yurtuk is only slightly larger than that observed in NWA 1459 (En65.3-67.3Wo4.7-6.5 and Fo64, [6]) The higher MG# of Opx in comparison with that of Ol is also typical for olivine diogenites [5]. Possibly, both minerals of the pyroxenite clast could be crystallized from the same melt, and the source of the pyroxenite could be close to that of ferroan olivine diogenites. However, the disparity in MG# between zonal pyroxene (65.2 - 82) and olivine (65.5) could also indicate that Ol gains are xenoliths captured and partially resorbed by pyroxenitic magma. The bulk composition of the pyroxenitic clast, calculated from the modal mineral data, points directly to the diogenite area on the CaO - MgO plot. However, the clast is richer in Al2O3 and TiO2 than most diogenites and lies on the end of the fractionating trend of diogenites [2]. The composition of pyroxenes of the mesostasis is in the range of magnesial dolerite and norite fragments found in howardites [8, 9]. The calculated bulk composition of the mesostasis (Table 1) is close to the composition of cumulate eucrites [10] but has higher MG# and lower SiO2 contents. An abundance of FeNi metal in the mesostasis is a feature of some cumulative pyroxenites [11]. This may suggest that some HED mafic rocks are related to ferroan diogenites. The more fine-grained texture of the orthopyroxenite in comparison to that of the diogenites reflects a higher cooling rate of this rock. However, the texture of the pyroxenite is more coarse-grained than that of typical impact melts and most probably the rock has magmatic origin. The temperature of equilibration of low- and high-Ca pyroxenes in the "mesostasis", estimated using two-pyroxene thermometer [12] is 700°C. Pyroxene zoning and absence of zoning of olivine on the border with more magnesian Opx indicates that the pyroxenite did not experience sufficient thermal metamorphism.  Conclusion: The pyroxenitic fragment from the Yurtuk howardite could be related to the ferroan diogenites and magnesian cumulate eucrites. The rock  was formed due to quick crystallization of diogenitic melt that could be induced, for example, by a loss of heat through the roof of a magma chamber destroyed by an impact. However, the melt could also have been generated and deeply buried by a large scale impact event.  References: [1] Khisina et al. (2014), this volume; [2] Fowler G.W. et al. (1995) Geochim.
