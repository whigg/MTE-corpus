EXPERIMENTAL CONSTRAINTS ON THE THERMAL STATE OF THE LUNAR MANTLE AND THE COMPOSITIONS OF MARE BASALT SOURCES THREE BILLION YEARS AGO. S. M. Elardo, C. K. Shearer, F. M. McCubbin, and A. S. Bell. Institute of Meteoritics, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131. selardo@unm.edu   Introduction:  The youngest known basalts from the Moon show a dichotomy in major and trace element geochemistry. Four of the five youngest basalt samples, the lunar meteorites Northwest Africa (NWA) 032, NWA 4734, LaPaz Icefield (LAP) 02205, and the olivine gabbro lithology in NWA 773, are Fe- and incompatible trace element-rich relative to other low-Ti basalts collected during the Apollo missions [15] (Fig. 1). The fifth sample, Northeast Africa (NEA) 003 lithology A, has a higher Mg# and some of the lowest incompatible trace element abundances among low-Ti mare basalts [6] (Fig. 1). All five samples have crystallization ages between 2931 and 3089 Ma and are concordant within error [5-9].  The origin of these mare basalts and their geochemical characteristics is important for understanding the thermal state of the lunar interior as well as the compositions of their source regions that were melting during periods of low-Ti mare basalt production. Borg et al. [9] used Sr and Nd isotopic compositions to show that the olivine gabbro in NWA 773 has a clear connection to KREEP, and they argued, as others have [e.g., 10, 11], that KREEP is an important heat source for mantle melting late in lunar history. However, using multiple geochemical and isotopic constraints, Elardo et al. [5] showed that KREEP was not involved directly (i.e., in the source) in the petrogenesis of NWA 032, NWA 4734, and LAP 02205.  Some workers [e.g., 4] have argued that the Fe- and incompatible trace element-rich compositions of the NWA 4734 group of basalts are the result of extensive fractional crystallization, and this is currently the prevailing model for many Fe-rich mare basalts. Conversely, based on the lack of evidence for the involvement of KREEP and the depth of their Eu anomaly, Elardo et al. [5] suggested that low degree partial melting of relatively late-stage lunar magma ocean cumulates could plausibly produce such compositions without the need for extensive fractional crystallization. Assuming the scenario that NWA 4734 represents an unfractionated primary partial melt of its source (although unlikely), and using the olivine and pyroxene Mg-Fe KD values from our 1 bar experiments (see below), the NWA 4734 source region should have an Mg# of 64-67. The depth of the negative Eu anomaly (Eu/Eu*= 0.43) in NWA 4734 is an inherited compositional characteristic of the source region (in the absence of assimilation, residual plagioclase in the source and/or low pressure plagioclase fractionation) and can be informative in constraining the point during LMO crystallization at which the source region formed. In the widely utilized model of LMO crystallization from Snyder et al. [12], source regions with the appropriate Mg#, Eu/Eu*, and TiO2 content for the NWA 4734 source occur concurrently between 8695% solid. This confluence of the appropriate Mg#, Eu/Eu*, and TiO2 in cumulates in an LMO crystallization model lends credence to the possibility that the composition of NWA 4734 is indicative of derivation from a late-stage, low solidus temperature LMO cumulate source.  Melting in the lunar mantle at ~3 Ga also produced basalts with characteristics that contrast significantly with the NWA 4734 group of basalts. NEA 003A, after removal of ~10% accumulated olivine, has a higher Mg# of 47, low abundances of REEs (~10x CI) with a relatively flat REE pattern and a small negative Eu anomaly (Eu/Eu* = 0.90) [6]. Although it may have also experienced fractional crystallization after separation from its source, its low abundances of REEs suggest that if so, it was minimal.  In order to test the two contrasting models for the origin of young, Fe- and incompatible trace elementrich mare basalts, as well as investigate the composiFig. 1: Bulk rock Eu/Eu* (=[Eu]N/(0.5*[Sm]N+[Gd]N)) vs. molar Mg# for low-Ti Apollo mare basalts and basaltic lunar meteorites. The Mg# for NEA 003A has been adjusted to account for ~10% accumulated olivine [e.g., 6].  2745.pdf

tional, pressure, and temperature conditions of the lunar mantle at 3Ga, when the youngest known lunar mantle melts were formed, we have begun a set of high-temperature and both high- and low-pressure petrologic experiments. The two bulk compositions we are investigating are, 1) the bulk composition of NWA 4734, LAP 02205, and NWA 032, which are essentially the same bulk composition, and 2) the composition of NEA 003A with accumulated olivine removed. Even in the likely case that these liquid compositions are not primary, such experiments can still be informative in constraining the average or at least minimum depth and temperature of melting. Methods: We have begun both 1-bar and highpressure crystallization experiments on the bulk composition of NWA 4734-LAP 02205-NWA 032, with experiments on NEA 003A starting in the near future. 1-bar crystallization experiments are run in a Deltech vertical gas-mixing furnace at the University of New Mexico (UNM). The fO2 of the experiments is controlled using a mixture of CO-CO2, and is estimated to be within 0.2 log units of the IW buffer [13]. Starting material is suspended in solution of polyvinyl alcohol and placed on a Reo wire. Experimental durations were from 19-24 hours, and were dropped-quenched into water.  High pressure experiments were conducted in the Depths of the Earth QUICKpress at UNM. Iron was added to the experimental starting materials using synthetic fayalite (Fe2+/ƩFe = 1), and experiments were run in graphite capsules within anhydrous salt-Pyrex cells. Therefore, we expect the fO2 of the experiments to be near the IW buffer. MgO inner parts were dried at 800° C in a box furnace before being stored in a 105° C desiccated drying oven under vacuum before use, and experimental starting materials were stored in the same drying oven. These steps are taken to minimize unwanted water in the experiments. Temperature was controlled using a Eurotherm 2416 controller and monitored with a type-C thermocouple. Experimental durations were between 5.5 and 8.5 hours. Run products were analyzed for major and minor elements with the JEOL JXA 8200 electron microprobe at UNM using a 30 nA beam current and a 15 kV accelerating voltage.  Results: Olivine is the liquidus phase in our 1-bar crystallization experiments on the NWA 4734-LAP 02205-NWA 032 bulk composition. The liquidus temperature is likely slightly higher than 1130° C, which is our highest temperature olivine-bearing experiment thus far. Plagioclase and a low-Ca pyroxene both appear with olivine between 1100° C and 1080° C. A Crrich spinel is present as sub-micron sized grains in all experiments thus far. At 5 kbar, a low Ca-pyroxene + Cr-spinel is present at 1160° C with plagioclase joining the assemblage by 1135° C. Olivine was not observed in the 1160° C experiment, nor was olivine observed at 10 kbar and 1150° C.  Discussion: The liquid composition represented by NWA 032, NWA 4734, and LAP 02205 is not, in the traditional sense, a good candidate for high P-T experimental work. It does not have a primitive major element composition and it has high abundances of incompatible elements (Mg# ~36.5, [La]N = 52 in NWA 4734; Fig. 1), both of which are indicative of extensive fractionation [e.g., 4]. However, the compositional ranges observed in mare basalts and volcanic glasses, and modeling and experimental simulations of LMO crystallization [e.g., 12, 14] all indicate that lunar differentiation produced a highly heterogeneous mantle that was not thoroughly homogenized by mantle convection. Therefore, there is no reason to conclude a priori that the fractionation event that resulted in the low-Mg# and high incompatible element abundances in the NWA 4734 group occurred after the partial melt left a more primitive source and not during formation of the source region itself (i.e., during LMO crystallization). Our results thus far indicate either the multiple saturation point for this composition is at lower pressures than 5 kbar, or that olivine is indeed the liquidus phase at one or both pressures, but has reacted out of the stable assemblage by the temperatures investigated. The former would support the composition having experienced low pressure fractional crystallization, but the latter would be consistent with a deeper source region. Future higher temperature experiments will constrain these possibilities as well as the conditions of multiple saturation. Our experiments to this point, however, suggest that plagioclase is not likely to be present at the multiple saturation point, but this conclusion also requires additional experiments. If it is present at the multiple saturation point, plagioclase could be responsible for the deep negative Eu anomaly. If not, the conditions of multiple phase saturation on the liquidus could provide insight into (at least) the minimum temperature and pressure of mantle melting, thus providing constraints on the thermal state of a portion of the mantle at 3 Ga.
