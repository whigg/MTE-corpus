Results from the rover analyses have shown that the bedrock contains mineral and textural characteristics that require the interaction of, and possibly an overall formation by, water-related mechanisms in order to be explained [1]. Additionally, remote sensing studies of the region have suggested that the rocks sampled in places by the MER rover consist of many distinct layers extending over an area of more than 3 × 105 km2 spanning 20º of longitude [2].  Geologic Mapping: To address the origin and history of these unique materials, we have completed a PG&G-funded geologic, stratigraphic, and thermophysical properties study of this widespread terrain. Specifically, we have drafted a geological map covering the full extent of these water-related deposits that has gone through final peer-review and is now being prepared for USGS publication. This task served several purposes including gaining an understanding of the complex nature of these materials, their potential sources region(s), and their timing of emplacement; as well as to place the observations by the Opportunity Rover in a broader context. We have completed a detailed geologic mapping at 1:2M-scale in the Meridiani region. The study area is defined here as 5S-15N, 15W eastward across the prime meridian to 15E. This covers portions of the quadrangles MC-11, MC-12, MC-19, and MC-20. The numerous units in the study area were refined from recent works [2-4] and new data and analysis. Formal geological mapping used a 100-m-resolution THEMIS base map combined with MOLA gridded data. Additional data for mapping included MOC WA images, THEMIS daytime and nighttime IR data, some THEMIS visible data, HRSC mosaics and topography, TES and THEMIS thermal inertia, MOC NA, CTX and HiRISE images. Additionally, we have identified and characterized all craters in the region down to 1.0 km diameter [5] for age-dating. Geologic History Determined from Mapping (Figure 1): From our mapping, cross-cutting and superposition relations, and crater counts, the geologic history of the region can be reconstructed. The end of the bombardment period is still preserved in the ancient highland cratered materials (Nhc1 and Nhc2) found underlying all other materials. The Nhc2 underwent significant modification, primarily by fluvial erosion and local deposition.   Etched terrains (NMe1, NMe2, HNMe3, HNMeu,) likely formed from the Middle-Late Noachian to the Early Hesperian. Several hypotheses have been put forth to explain the deposition of these sub-horizontal highly erodible materials including eolian, lacustrine, groundwater, ice-related, and/or volcanic depositional processes. The occurrence of many outliers of these materials throughout the central part of the map region, including layered fill within large craters, suggests that the deposits could have had a larger and more contiguous extent. Crater statistics and stratigraphic relationships suggest that the hematite-rich HMh unit likely formed during the Early Hesperian. The unit is exclusively associated with the etched terrains and its outcrops represent smooth surfaces overlying the HNMe3 unit. HMh could have formed as a primary or diagenetic product from either water-related (e.g. precipitation from solutions or groundwater alteration) or possibly volcanic processes. The occurrence of isolated patches around the main extensive outcrop suggests that the deposits could have had a larger and more contiguous extent over the region.  Almost contemporarily to the HMh unit, the Hp unit likely started to form around the Early Hesperian in the lowlying plains surrounding the central region of the map. The unit of almost certain multisource volcanic origin generally overlies all the units of the highlands and Meridiani groups. Finally, the Hpct unit is cropping out only in the southwestern portion of the map area as an eastern extension of the large chaotic complex of Iani Chaos located just west of the mapped region.
