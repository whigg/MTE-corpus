 STRUCTURAL MODELING FOR THE LOW-MASS TRANSITING EXOPLANETS:KEPLER-70B AND KEPLER-70C. P. Futó1 1  Department of Physical Geography, University of West Hungary, Szombathely, Károlyi Gáspár tér, H-9700, Hungary (dvision@citromail.hu) Introduction:NASA's  Kepler  Space  Telescope  has discovered  two  interesting  small  sized exoplanets,named Kepler-70b and 70c.Their  host star is a post-red-giant,hot B subdwarf (sdB)  [1] wich can be observed in the direction of Cygnus constellation. Kepler-70b is a less massive planet than the c with a mass of 0.44  M,a radius of  0.759 R  and an orbital period of  0.240104 days   [2].The Kepler-70c is a 0.66 Earth-mass  sub-Earth  sized  planet  0.867  times  the radius of Earth orbiting in a 0.342887 day orbit. According  to  a  plausible  scenario,both  planets  were originally  giant  planets  which  were  orbited  in  the extended  envelope  of  the central  star  during the  red giant  phase.  Vaporizing  their  gaseous  envelope,this planet   was  stripped  down,remaining  the  solid rocky/iron  cores,they  became terrestrial-type  objects. This objects can be categorized into a new hipothetical class  of  planets  nominated  "Chthonian  planets" [3].During their formation,planetary cores of the onetime  gas  giants  or  Neptune-like  planets  had  been differentiated within a relatively short time. The main purpose of this study is to obtain plausible interpretation  for  the  measured  data  concerning  the composition  of  the  planets  Kepler-70  b  and c.Moreover,I  attempt  to  characterize  several  key physical  properties  of  these  planets  including  their surface  gravities,average  densities  and  the  central pressures,respectively. Internal structure models for Kepler-70b and c:In both cases,the upper mantle composed of olivine [(Mg, Fe)2 SiO4],wadsleyite and ringwoodite. The thin lower mantle  mostly  consists  of  silicate-perovskite  plus wustite  [(Mg,Fe)  SiO3 +(Mg,  Fe)  O].Planetary cores have Fe0.8  Ni0.2  composition.  Vinet  equations  of  state [4,5]  have been used to derive approximate structure models for both low-mass transiting planets. Results:Interpreting the observational data,the average density and surface gravity are 5.55 g cm-3 and 7.5 ms-2 for the Kepler-70b and are 5.584 g cm-3 and 8.623 ms-2 for the Kepler-70c. The internal structures of  planets to present are shown in Figure 1.The yielded  core  radii  are  0.497 R and 0.528  R for  Kepler-70b  and  c.  Both  planets  have relatively great core mass fraction (CMF) compared to the  total  mass.  As  shown  in  Figure  1,Kepler-70b contains  core  mass fraction  with a  radius  (65.48  %) that is 4,58% larger compared to the total radius than that  of  Kepler-70c  (60.9%).Comparing  their composition,it is also ascertainable that both transiting objects  are  relatively  high-density  planets  with  core mass fractions which are greater  than the half of the total mass. Central  pressures  have  also  been  theoretically calculated: 99.76 GPa (70b) and 133 GPa (70c). Figure 1.Interior structures for Kepler-70b and -70 c are  shown  with  relatively  great  fractions  of  their metallic cores. Summary:Dozens  of  low-mass  exoplanets  are expected  to  confirm  inside  of  a  decade  including similar and smaller sized planets than Earth. References: [1] S.Charpinet et al.
