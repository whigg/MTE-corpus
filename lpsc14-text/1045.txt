STRUCTURAL MODELING FOR THE LOW-MASS TRANSITING EXOPLANETS:KEPLER-70B ANDKEPLER-70C. P. Futó1 1  Department of Physical Geography, University of West Hungary, Szombathely, KárolyiGáspár tér, H-9700, Hungary (dvision@citromail.hu)Introduction:NASA's  Kepler  Space  Telescope  hasdiscovered  two  interesting  small  sizedexoplanets,named Kepler-70b and 70c.Their  host staris a post-red-giant,hot B subdwarf (sdB)  [1] wich canbe observed in the direction of Cygnus constellation.Kepler-70b is a less massive planet than the c with amass of 0.44  M,a radius of  0.759 R  and an orbitalperiod of  0.240104 days   [2].The Kepler-70c is a 0.66Earth-mass  sub-Earth  sized  planet  0.867  times  theradius of Earth orbiting in a 0.342887 day orbit. According  to  a  plausible  scenario,both  planets  wereoriginally  giant  planets  which  were  orbited  in  theextended  envelope  of  the central  star  during the  redgiant  phase.  Vaporizing  their  gaseous  envelope,thisplanet   was  stripped  down,remaining  the  solidrocky/iron  cores,they  became terrestrial-type  objects.This objects can be categorized into a new hipotheticalclass  of  planets  nominated  “Chthonian  planets”[3].During their formation,planetary cores of the onetime  gas  giants  or  Neptune-like  planets  had  beendifferentiated within a relatively short time.The main purpose of this study is to obtain plausibleinterpretation  for  the  measured  data  concerning  thecomposition  of  the  planets  Kepler-70  b  andc.Moreover,I  attempt  to  characterize  several  keyphysical  properties  of  these  planets  including  theirsurface  gravities,average  densities  and  the  centralpressures,respectively.Internal structure models for Kepler-70b and c:Inboth cases,the upper mantle composed of olivine [(Mg,Fe)2 SiO4],wadsleyite and ringwoodite. The thin lowermantle  mostly  consists  of  silicate-perovskite  pluswustite  [(Mg,Fe)  SiO3 +(Mg,  Fe)  O].Planetary coreshave Fe0.8  Ni0.2  composition.  Vinet  equations  of  state[4,5]  have been used to derive approximate structuremodels for both low-mass transiting planets.Results:Interpreting the observational data,the averagedensity and surface gravity are 5.55 g cm-3 and 7.5 ms-2for the Kepler-70b and are 5.584 g cm-3 and 8.623 ms-2for the Kepler-70c.The internal structures of  planets to present are shownin Figure 1.The yielded  core  radii  are  0.497 R and0.528  R for  Kepler-70b  and  c.  Both  planets  haverelatively great core mass fraction (CMF) compared tothe  total  mass.  As  shown  in  Figure  1,Kepler-70bcontains  core  mass fraction  with a  radius  (65.48  %)that is 4,58% larger compared to the total radius thanthat  of  Kepler-70c  (60.9%).Comparing  theircomposition,it is also ascertainable that both transitingobjects  are  relatively  high-density  planets  with  coremass fractions which are greater  than the half of thetotal mass.Central  pressures  have  also  been  theoreticallycalculated: 99.76 GPa (70b) and 133 GPa (70c).Figure 1.Interior structures for Kepler-70b and -70 care  shown  with  relatively  great  fractions  of  theirmetallic cores.Summary:Dozens  of  low-mass  exoplanets  areexpected  to  confirm  inside  of  a  decade  includingsimilar and smaller sized planets than Earth.References: [1] S.Charpinet et al.
