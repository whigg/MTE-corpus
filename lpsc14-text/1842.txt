Introduction: Observations performed by the various space missions over the past decade have revealed a complex mineralogical and aqueous history of Mars, which could be associated with habitable environments, see for example [1-3]. The significant support of these studies has been provided with the orbital neutron and gamma spectroscopy measurements onboard Mars Odysey [4-6] revealing global distribution of water ice poleward 60N/60S and distribution of bound water at equatorial latittudes with horizontal resolution 300 x 300 km (see figure 1). Currently it is supported with ground truth active and passive neutron spectrometry observations as  part of MSL mission Curisoity performed with DAN instrument [7] along the traverse of Curiosity rover [8,9], see also Figure 2. The latest DAN measurements show significant discrepenacy in estimation of water abundance between low resolution Odyssey observations and in situ DAN measurements in vicinity of Gale crater [10]. It should be subjected to the comprehensive detailed analysis using comparison of  instrument data reduction procedures, instrument surface resolutions and different models of subsurface water depth distribution [10,11].          Figure 1. The global distribution of subsurface water at moderate and equatorial latitutdes on Mars measured by HEND instrument onboard Osyssey.  Instrumentation. In the nearest future one may expect significant increase of exprimetal possibilities to continue sophisticated analysis of subsurface water distribution on Mars based on incoming orbital and surface martian missions, such as ExoMars (ESA) and Mars2020 (NASA). This analysis will be implemented using a comparison between high resolution neutron spectroscopy orbital observations and network of surface measurement probes provided with similar neutron spectrometers installed onboard landing platforms and rovers.  0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 -50.00 150.00 350.00 550.00 750.00 950.00 1150.00 1350.00 1550.00 1750.00 1950.00 Content (%) Odometry (m) Top water Bottom water  Figure 2. The measurements of subsurface water distribution by DAN instrument along Curiosity traverse in Gale crater.  In 2016 ESA plans to study the martian atmosphere and the surface from the Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO). Currently the ExoMars program is agreed, as the joint effort of ESA with the Federal Space Agency of Russia (Roscosmos). The Fine Resolution Epithermal Neutron Detector (FREND) will be Russian contributed instrument for ESA's TGO. The FREND experiment concept is based on the heritage of neutron collimated instrument LEND onboard NASA moon LRO mission [12,13].The TGO spacecraft will have the orbit with inclination of 74° and altitudes of 350 - 420 km. Such orbit allows to map the Martian surface from the equator upward to very high latitudes of 74° N and S. The primary goal of the FREND investigation will be mapping of epithermal neutron emission from the martian surface with high spatial resolution about 40 km. It is significantly better than neutron observations  onboard Mars Odyssey and is comparable with the size of Gale crater, which  opens possibility to improve comparsion between orbital and surface observations of water distrubtuon at MSL landing site.  Another ExoMars mission planned for launch in 2018 will consist of landing platform and rover and will be focused on a detailed surface studies including search for subsurface water distribution. These measurements will be based on the stationary active neutron and gamma methods (analog of DAN instrument onboard of Landing platform) and mobile passive neutron spectroscopy and ground penetration radar observations (ADRON and WISDOM instruments onboard rover). It will provide another  set of ground truth data ac1842.pdf

quired at the equatorial lattitudes and new area of comparison with orbital Odyssey and TGO water mapping, monitoring of seasonal changes of atmosphere thickness and seasonal cycle.  We also hope that neutron and gamma spectrometry observation could be selected as instrumentation package for Mars 2020 rover. It gives us possibility to compare the whole ground "network" of neutron and gamma observations (acquired by MSL, ExoMars landing platform ExoMars rover and Mars2020) with orbital observations to create 4-D picture of Mars neutron emission: measurements on the orbit, measurements on the surface, propogation of a neutron flux through the atmosphere, evolution of neutron emission as a function of Mars seasons. Then it will be deconvolved into the seasonal evolution of global and local maps of subsurface water distribution at equatorial latittudes.    References:  [1] Squyres S.
