Introduction:  The origin of Q and its noble gases remains a subject of debates in the cosmochemical community for the last 40 years. It is still unknown how many different carriers Q consists of, why some of them are resistant to HF/HCl treatment but the others are not and what is the noble gas elemental composition in the carriers. And although Q is most likely carbonaceous in composition [1], representing probably a sort of an organic material [2], its carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions remains unknown, though some estimation for  15 N in Q have been made [3]. In this study we analysed a number of fractions obtained by separation of bulk Saratov meteorite using physical methods only with the aim to establish how the Q carrier is distributing between the fractions.        Methods:  Schematic of the fraction separations is shown below. 7 fractions (shown in the schematic in bold) have been prepared including the bulk sample and a fraction of chondrules with diameter <0.28 mm. The results for chondrules are also discussed in the other abstract of the conference [4]. The fractions were analysed for C, N and noble gas concentrations and isotopic compositions using Finesse machine [5] by stepped combustion in the temperature range from 200 to 1400 oC with 100 o increment. The results are shown in the Table.         Results: Carbon. The carbon concentration varies in the samples by 2 orders of magnitude; the lowest concentrations are observed in the chondrule fraction and the bulk and the highest - in the fine grain fraction (#3) with density >1.65 g/cm 3. The isotopic composition of carbon is more or less uniform (-19--24‰) for all the fractions, except for the chondrules (Table). The typical release patterns and isotope profiles are shown in Figure 1. It appears that most of carbon in the fractions represents an indigenous macromolecular material. This is confirmed by a good correlation between carbon and noble gas concentrations and an observation of an additional peak of C at 600 oC for some (mostly enriched with carbon) fractions (Table and Fig. 1).  Figure 1. Carbon release and isotope profile for stepped combustion of some Saratov fractions.         Nitrogen. The concentration of nitrogen in the samples analysed varies by more than a factor of 300; it is more than observed for carbon. Therefore N/C ratio is also variable (by a factor of 5). The highest N/C ratio is observed in the samples with the highest C and N contents (Table). In most of the samples the nitrogen isotope variations are within -1 to 8‰ in terms of the  15 N notation. An exception is the fraction #4 where it is 37‰. Figure 2 shows the typical release of N and  15 N profile observed for the samples.   Figure 2.  Nitrogen release and isotope profile for stepped combustion of some Saratov fractions.    The characteristic feature of the nitrogen isotope profiles for all the samples analysed (except for the bulk) is an excursion to an isotopically light composition at 1000-1100 oC (Fig. 2).

All the samples contain radiogenic 40 Ar and cosmogenic 21 Ne in variable amounts with difference between the max. and min. concentrations by a factor 3-4 (Table). The 4 He concentrations are well correlated with the 40 Ar concentrations suggesting that most of helium is radiogenic in origin. In contrast to 4 He and 21 Nec, the 40 Ar release is bimodal with variable ratios between the low- and high-temperature releases (Fig. 3). 21 Nec has a wide range of the release temperatures: higher for the bulk and chondrules and lower for 0 1 10 32 10 33 10 34 10 35 10 36 10 3-35 -30 -25 -20 -15 -10 -5 05 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 Bulk C13 CC ar bo n y ie d,  n g1 3C , ‰ Temperature, o C0 2000 4000 6000 8000 1 10 41.2 10 41.4 10 41.6 10 4-35 -30 -25 -20 -15 -10 -5 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 Fraction 4 C13 CC ar bo n y ie d,  n g1 3C , ‰ Temperature, o C0 100 200 300 400 500 -20 -15 -10 -5 05 10 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 Fraction #1 N15 NN it ro gen y ie d,  n g1 5N , ‰ Temperature, o C0 510 15 20 25 30 35 -40 -30 -20 -10 010 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 Fraction #6 N15 N1 5N , ‰ Nit ro gen y ie d,  n gTemperature, o C  the fractions with the high C content (Fig. 3). This probably is due to the grain-size effect on the diffusion rate of 21 Nec, since the highest its diffusion rate is observed for the fine grain-size fraction.        The variations in the concentrations of the trapped (planetary) 36 Ar and 132 Xe in the fractions are extremely high: almost 2 orders of magnitude (Table). The release pattern of the gases are bimodal similar to that observed for 40 Ar (Figs 3, 4). The relative abundance of the low- and high-temperature peaks for 36 Ar and 132 Xe are different although the bulk 36 Ar/ 132 Xe ratios are very similar in all the samples and well correspond to the planetary (Q) component [6]. Finally, all the fractions contain variable (within one order of magnitude) concentrations of 129 Xe (from the decay of 129 I) which is released at a high (>1100 oC) temperature.  Figure 4. 36Ar and 132Xe release patterns from the Saratov fractions during stepped combustion.       Discussion: Obviously we achieved a significant separation of the components present in the bulk sample Saratov meteorite. It includes separation of the organic macromolecular material into compounds with essentially different N isotopic compositions and N/C ratios. The isotopically light N observed at 1000 oC is obviously compromised by the presence of cosmogenic N. A correction for the cosmogenic 15 N using the measured concentrations of 21Nec and the (atomic) production ratio of 15 Nc/ 21 Nec=4.5 [7]  gives the  15 N for the N released at T>900 oC to be <-66‰ for the fraction #5. This N may be associated with Q and/or nanodiamonds. Though it is not clear in this case why nanodiamonds are combusted at such a high T. On the other hand, there are certain amounts of the trapped 36 Ar and 132 Xe released in this T range (Fig 4) that seem to be associated with Q.        The most interesting observation is the similarity in 132 Xe and 40 Ar, on one hand, and a significant difference in 132 Xe and 36 Ar, on the other, release patterns (Figs 3 and 4). For 132 Xe and 40 Ar this can be explain if both elements have been trapped in the same carrier, though this is unlikely, since 40 Ar is rather  a product of 40 K decay. However, if both the low-temperature 40 Ar and 21 Nec have been formed within silicate minerals it is very difficult to explain why 21 Nec is released at higher temperature than 40 Ar. This issue can possibly be resolved by dissolving silicates in HF/HCl. As to 132 Xe and 36 Ar is concerned, it seems to be that there are different Q carriers with different 132 Xe/ 36 Ar ratios that combusted at different temperatures. And though being less likely, but it is not possible to exclude a redistribution of Q noble gases between different phases during parent body metamorphism.
