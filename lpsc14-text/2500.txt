RADIOGENIC, COSMOGENIC AND Q NOBLE GASES, AND CARBON AND NITROGEN IN FRACTIONS OF SARATOV (L4) METEORITE OBTAINED BY PHYSICAL SEPARATION METHODS. A. B. Verchovsky1, A. V. Fisenko2 and  L. F. Semjonova2, 1The Open University, Walton  Hall, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, UK (a.verchovsky@open.ac.uk); 2Vernadsky Institute RAS, Moscow, Russia.         Introduction:  The origin of Q and its noble gases remains a subject of debates in the cosmochemical community for the last 40 years. It is still unknown how many different carriers Q consists of, why some of them are resistant to HF/HCl treatment but the others are not and what is the noble gas elemental composition in the carriers. And although Q is most likely carbonaceous in composition [1], representing probably a sort of an organic material [2], its carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions remains unknown, though some estimation for 15N in Q have been made [3]. In this study we analysed a number of fractions obtained by separation of bulk Saratov meteorite using physical methods only with the aim to establish how the Q carrier is distributing between the fractions.        Methods:  Schematic of the fraction separations is shown below. 7 fractions (shown in the schematic in bold) have been prepared including the bulk sample and a fraction of chondrules with diameter <0.28 mm. The results for chondrules are also discussed in the other abstract of the conference [4]. The fractions were analysed for C, N and noble gas concentrations and isotopic compositions using Finesse machine [5] by stepped combustion in the temperature range from 200 to 1400oC with 100o increment. The results are shown in the Table.         Results: Carbon. The carbon concentration varies in the samples by 2 orders of magnitude; the lowest concentrations are observed in the chondrule fraction and the bulk and the highest - in the fine grain fraction (#3) with density >1.65 g/cm3. The isotopic composition of carbon is more or less uniform (-19--24‰) for all the fractions, except for the chondrules (Table). The typical release patterns and isotope profiles are shown in Figure 1. It appears that most of carbon in the fractions represents an indigenous macromolecular material. This is confirmed by a good correlation between carbon and noble gas concentrations and an observation of an additional peak of C at 600oC for some (mostly enriched with carbon) fractions (Table and Fig. 1).  Figure 1. Carbon release and isotope profile for stepped combustion of some Saratov fractions.         Nitrogen. The concentration of nitrogen in the samples analysed varies by more than a factor of 300; it is more than observed for carbon. Therefore N/C ratio is also variable (by a factor of 5). The highest N/C ratio is observed in the samples with the highest C and N contents (Table). In most of the samples the nitrogen isotope variations are within -1 to 8‰ in terms of the 15N notation. An exception is the fraction #4 where it is 37‰. Figure 2 shows the typical release of N and 15N profile observed for the samples.   Figure 2.  Nitrogen release and isotope profile for stepped combustion of some Saratov fractions.    The characteristic feature of the nitrogen isotope profiles for all the samples analysed (except for the bulk) is an excursion to an isotopically light composition at 1000-1100oC (Fig. 2).

All the samples contain radiogenic 40Ar and cosmogenic 21Ne in variable amounts with difference between the max. and min. concentrations by a factor 3-4 (Table). The 4He concentrations are well correlated with the 40Ar concentrations suggesting that most of helium is radiogenic in origin. In contrast to 4He and 21Nec, the 40Ar release is bimodal with variable ratios between the low- and high-temperature releases (Fig. 3). 21Nec has a wide range of the release temperatures: higher for the bulk and chondrules and lower for 01 1032 1033 1034 1035 1036 103-35-30-25-20-15-10-505200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400BulkC13CCarbon yied,  ng13C, ‰Temperature, oC020004000600080001 1041.2 1041.4 1041.6 104-35-30-25-20-15-10-5200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400Fraction 4C13CCarbon yied,  ng13C, ‰Temperature, oC0100200300400500-20-15-10-50510200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400Fraction #1N15NNitrogen yied,  ng15N, ‰Temperature, oC05101520253035-40-30-20-10010200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400Fraction #6N15N15N, ‰Nitrogen yied,  ngTemperature, oC2500.pdf

the fractions with the high C content (Fig. 3). This probably is due to the grain-size effect on the diffusion rate of 21Nec, since the highest its diffusion rate is observed for the fine grain-size fraction.        The variations in the concentrations of the trapped (planetary) 36Ar and 132Xe in the fractions are extremely high: almost 2 orders of magnitude (Table). The release pattern of the gases are bimodal similar to that observed for 40Ar (Figs 3, 4). The relative abundance of the low- and high-temperature peaks for 36Ar and 132Xe are different although the bulk 36Ar/132Xe ratios are very similar in all the samples and well correspond to the planetary (Q) component [6]. Finally, all the fractions contain variable (within one order of magnitude) concentrations of 129Xe (from the decay of 129I) which is released at a high (>1100oC) temperature.  Figure 4. 36Ar and 132Xe release patterns from the Saratov fractions during stepped combustion.       Discussion: Obviously we achieved a significant separation of the components present in the bulk sample Saratov meteorite. It includes separation of the organic macromolecular material into compounds with essentially different N isotopic compositions and N/C ratios. The isotopically light N observed at 1000oC is obviously compromised by the presence of cosmogenic N. A correction for the cosmogenic 15N using the measured concentrations of 21Nec and the (atomic) production ratio of 15Nc/21Nec=4.5 [7]  gives the 15N for the N released at T>900oC to be <-66‰ for the fraction #5. This N may be associated with Q and/or nanodiamonds. Though it is not clear in this case why nanodiamonds are combusted at such a high T. On the other hand, there are certain amounts of the trapped 36Ar and 132Xe released in this T range (Fig 4) that seem to be associated with Q.        The most interesting observation is the similarity in 132Xe and 40Ar, on one hand, and a significant difference in 132Xe and 36Ar, on the other, release patterns (Figs 3 and 4). For 132Xe and 40Ar this can be explain if both elements have been trapped in the same carrier, though this is unlikely, since 40Ar is rather  a product of 40K decay. However, if both the low-temperature 40Ar and 21Nec have been formed within silicate minerals it is very difficult to explain why 21Nec is released at higher temperature than 40Ar. This issue can possibly be resolved by dissolving silicates in HF/HCl. As to 132Xe and 36Ar is concerned, it seems to be that there are different Q carriers with different 132Xe/36Ar ratios that combusted at different temperatures. And though being less likely, but it is not possible to exclude a redistribution of Q noble gases between different phases during parent body metamorphism.
