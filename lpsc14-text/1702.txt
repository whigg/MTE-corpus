It has also produced some of the best tests of General Relativity (i.e., the Strong Equivalence Principal, the Inertial Properties of Gravitational Energy, the Constancy of the Gravitational Constant G, etc.).  This analysis has been based on a time series of range measurements, continuing to the present, to the retroreflector arrays placed on the moon during the Apollo missions.  However, the combination of the design of the Apollo arrays and the lunar librations are now the limit the accuracy of the range measurements.  The "next generation" retroreflector package being developed[1] and technical challenges of these measurements to the Apollo array will be discussed. History of Lunar Laser Ranging: A brief history of the background of the existing Apollo arrays, including the origin of the concept, the development of the design and the implementation of the arrays. The reasons for looking to the next generation of retroreflectors and the history of the development of the "Lunar laser Ranging Retroreflector Array for the 21st Century" (LLRRA-21) will be addressed. Science Results and Recognition for Next Generation Retroreflectors: The Apollo arrays, with the Lunahod arrays, have resulted in a wealth of unique new results in Lunar Physics, Gravitational Physics and General Relativity Tests.  Although they are still operating and producing new science, Ground Stations (GSs) have improved by a factor of 200.  As will be discussed below, there is now the need for a set of next generation retroreflectors.  This has been recognized by various community studies (i.e., the Decadal Surveys), NASA Studies and National Academy of Science Studies.  These will be briefly reviewed. Need for Next Generation Lunar Retroreflector:  As the moon liberates, the Apollo arrays of 100 Cube Corner Reflectors (CCRs) become tilted with respect to the direction toward the GS.  This means that a photon reflected from the far corner of the tilted panel has a greater measured range than a photon that is reflected from the near corner.  Since the GSs stations have improved by more than a factor of 200, this is now a limiting error.  Thus the path to new lunar physics, gravitational tests and General Relativity tests is a new generation of lunar retroreflectors. Current Status of the LLRRA-21: This project, centered at the University of Maryland which was the center of the development of the Apollo arrays, is being conducted within an international collaboration, in particular Italian collaboration with INFN and ASI.  A nominal design, at TRL 6 is currently being refined.  A detailed optical/thermal simulation has been developed and is being used to refine the package design and to define the optimal thermal-control coatings. Optical Thermal Simulation of Apollo Arrays:  Although the Apollo arrays are still operating and providing the same level of ranging accuracy as when deployed, the magnitude of the return signal has very significantly decreased.  A detailed simulation has been developed to identify the causes of the degradation in order to minimize their impact in the design of the LLRRA-21.  The thermal/optical simulation is then compared to the observed returns from the Apollo arrays.  It is especially helpful that the APOLLO station was able to obtain detailed observations during a lunar eclipse.  During such an eclipse, the time constant of the changes of solar illumination is similar to the time constants of the CCRs and the array panel, thus providing critical new information for the simulation. Future: The main issue at present is determining how to transport the LLRR-21 to the moon.  We are presently working with two of the Google Lunar X Prize groups, Moon Express and Astrobotics.  In addition, a formal collaboration including Japan is addressing the optimal type of retroreflector for the future Japanese lander.  Further discussions with other possible contributors are of critical interest, since at least three new retroreflectors are needed to accomplish the next generation science. Further emplacements beyond the minimum of three will provide an improved selenodetic coordinate system and will improve the science products, especially the Lunar Physics.
