In particular, the surface of Mercury shows a wide variety of impact structures corresponding to different modification processes that they have experienced since their formation. In this work we present an analysis of an unusual feature: a steep-sided cone within an impact crater, surrounded by a trough. The aim of this work is to establish if this cone corresponds to the central peak of the crater and if this unusual morphology is due to pyroclastic volcanism, or if this structure is caused by constructive volcanic processes. To achieve this goal we have studied this 40 km diameter crater through numerical modelling. Geological context:  High-resolution images obtained by the MESSENGER spacecraft since it went into orbit around Mercury in 2011 reveal a cone-like feature at -136° E, -6° N (Fig. 1). This cone has a basal radius of ~6 km and steep sides (up to 23.5°). It lies at the centre of an extensive area of relatively bright, relatively red material with diffuse outer edges. Such deposits have been suggested to be pyroclastic in origin [1], so their presence at this location may suggest that this cone has a volcanic genesis. If this hypothesis is correct, it represents the only example of a steep-sided volcanic edifice recognized thus far on Mercury.

It is located at the centre of an impact crater, where a central peak might be expected, but it is wider than a typical central peak. In addition, it is surrounded by a trough that extends to lower elevations than might be expected for the crater floor (up to 2.6 km deep). We have observed that putative pyroclastic pits in other impact craters are often located circumferential to central structures. This observation leads us to suggest that the cone is in fact the central peak of an impact crater, and its unusual morphology is due to the formation of a moat-like pit around it caused by pyroclastic volcanism. If this hypothesis is correct, it supports the suggestion that faults and fractures associated with impact craters play a controlling role on the location of pyroclastic vents on Mercury [2].  In order to distinguish between these two hypotheses, it is necessary to determine the original morphology of the host impact crater. We therefore used numerical modelling to investigate the mode of formation of this crater and how its expected initial structure differs from its present morphology, shown in the profile below (Fig. 2).

tile with an impact velocity of 30 km/s [9] and an impact angle of 90°. The ordinary constitutive model accounting for changes in material shear strength [5] must be supplemented by a transient target weakening mechanism, called acoustic fluidization model, to allow the development of central peaks and terraced walls, characteristic of the gravitational collapse of large impact craters [10]. This is implemented in iSALE using the "block-model", which is controlled mainly by the viscosity and the decay time. We have modeled the Hermean surface as a double layer made up of a brecciated 4-5 km basalt layer overlying an intact basalt layer.  We have used a density for the target equal to 2900 kg/m3, ignoring the porosity of the target; while we have fixed a projectile porosity at 10%. The thermodynamic behavior of both the projectile and the target materials is described by tables generated using the ANalytic Equation Of State (ANEOS) adopting different values of the material strength for the two different layers forming the target, shown in the table below (Tab. 1).

Results and Discussion:  The preliminary results obtained from the simulations show that the projectile responsible for a crater of this size should be in the range of 1.2-1.5 km in diameter. Additional simulations will be necessary to reproduce the predicted depth of the crater that could be from 1 km to 2 km; these values are obtained using the general depth-todiameter ratio of complex craters of 0.034 ± 0.010 [11]. Therefore, we have to carry out a series of simulations over a broad range of parameters with the goal of understanding and improving the knowledge of the morphology of this crater, in particular its cone-like structure. In fact, combining the results from simulations with the morphological considerations of [11] we will be able to obtain further information about the pyroclastic event that affected this crater after the impact process.
