Tabb_Prissel@Brown.edu   Introduction: Lunar samples of the highlands Mgsuite are comprised of dunites, pink spinel troctolites (PST), troctolites, norites, and gabbronorites. The Mgsuite are most notably characterized by high Mg# (Mg/[Mg + Fe]) mafic silicates positively correlating with the An# (Ca/[Ca + Na]) of coexisting plagioclase and in general have elevated (KREEP-like) trace element signatures [1-5]. The rock types are thought to be comagmatic [1,6] (i.e. can be explained through the low-pressure crystallization sequence of a basaltic melt [7]), though the parental melt composition and petrogenetic history are still in question [4,5].   Of primary interest to Mg-suite petrogenetic models are the lunar troctolite samples [1-5], which are plutonic igneous rock types containing forsteritic olivine and anorthitic plagioclase. This is an unusual pairing considering that most basaltic melts must fractionate olivine (lowering the Mg/Fe ratio of the residual melt) before reaching plagioclase saturation. In this scenario, plagioclase would be expected to coprecipitate with relatively Fe-rich olivine (inconsistent with Mg-suite mineralogy). Two main hypotheses have been used to explain this phenomenon: (1) ultramafic melts on the Moon are brought to plagioclase saturation through assimilation of anorthositic crust [1,2] and more recently (2) partial melts from a hybridized source region (including KREEP, ultramafic cumulates, and plagioclase-bearing rocks) would produce troctolitic melts [3-5].  A subset of the lunar troctolites (PST) contain MgAl2O4 pink spinel (minor Fe, Cr, hereafter referred to as Mg-Al spinel) in relatively minor modal abundance. Although troctolite mineralogy (ol + plag) has played a large role in determining parental melt compositions of the Mg-suite, the presence and composition of spinel is far from trivial [8-11] and may help distinguish between the two hypotheses above. Here, we have designed a series of experiments to test whether parental melt compositions predicted from (2) produce spinel compositions consistent with PST. We also characterize the mineralogy of a PST clast from lunar sample 15455 in order to make lab-consistent comparisons with the natural data.   Premise: The vast majority of lunar spinels are Fe and Cr-rich trending from chromites (Fe2+Cr2O4) to ulvöspinel (Fe22+TiO4), which are the expected products of crystal fractionation from basaltic melts [12,13]. Mg-Al spinel is quite rare and typically found only within the PST samples. As with the mafic silicates, the Mg# of spinel is largely controlled by the Mg# of the melt from which it crystallizes. Additionally, a strong correlation between the Alcontent of parental melts and the Al-content of crystallizing spinel has been observed in several terrestrial volcanic and magmatic systems including MORB-type lavas and abyssal peridotites [9-11]. Here, greater Al/Cr ratios in the parent melt may result in lower Cr# (Cr/[Cr + Al]) spinels (see Fig. 1). Mg-Al spinel has been experimentally produced during the interaction between Mg-suite melts predicted from [4] and anorthite [8,14]. Though the experiments focused on mineralogy produced in plagioclase-contaminated regions of the melt (and MgAl spinel production therein), Cr-rich spinels with Alrich rims were observed away from the melt-rock interface (implying they were an early crystallizing phase from the uncontaminated Mg-suite parent composition). The presence of Cr-rich spinel suggests one of the following: a) the Al/Cr ratio of Mg-suite parent compositions predicted from (2) may be too low to explain Mg-Al spinel production, b) assimilation is required to raise Al/Cr ratios of the parental melt to levels that facilitate Mg-Al spinel production, or c) Mg-suite rock types are not co-magmatic (i.e. multiple source regions are required). Experimental & Analytical Summary: The starting composition was modeled and synthesized  Figure 1. Trend between Cr# of spinel and Cr# of parental melts.

The experimental mix was conditioned at the IW buffer inside a horizontal gas-mixing furnace at 900oC for 3h.  To avoid contact with the sealed sample container (Pt), each charge was housed inside an open-top, thin graphite sleeve and then engulfed by graphite powder.  Experimental charges were run in an internally heated pressure vessel (IHPV), Ar gas P-medium, at 1kbar confining pressure for 3h at the T of interest.  Each experiment was drop quenched by tilting the IHPV to a vertical position allowing the charge to fall to the cold end of the furnace.   All analyses for both the experiments and 15455,266 were performed on a CAMECA SX 100 Electron Microprobe (Brown University).   PST 15455,266: Lunar sample 15455,266 contains a PST clast dominated by cumulus olivine, Mg-Al spinel, and anorthite (Fig 2a,b). Phases are chemically homogenous with the following average compositions and 2! standard deviations: olivine Mg# ~89 +/- 1, plagioclase An# ~92 +/- 4, and spinel Mg# ~81 +/- 2, Cr# ~ 5 +/- 1. Preliminary Experiments: Experiments at 1330oC produced an assemblage of olivine + Cr-spinel + plag + liquid. Cr-spinels were too small (< 5!m in diameter) to obtain reliable measurements. However, RGB images were produced from X-ray element maps (Mg, Cr, Al), which confirm the presence of Cr-rich spinel (Fig. 2c). Future work includes quantifying spinel compositions and determining melt chemistry required for Mg-Al spinel production.  Discussion: Which of the two models can then best explain Mg-suite petrogenesis from the perspective of spinel? Given the absence of Cr-spinel within PST samples, results from this study suggest Mg-Al spinel production requires an ultramafic melt that is more plagioclase-normative (i.e. higher Al/Cr) than previously thought (Fig. 1). Because the Mg-suite rocks are thought to be co-magmatic, multi-saturated melts from a hybridized source region would not only have difficulty explaining Mg-Al spinel compositions, but also the production of primitive Mg-suite dunites [17,18].  If, on the other hand, ultramafic melts intrude the lunar crust, small proportions of dunite could form (consistent with the scarcity of dunites among the lunar samples) prior to the melts becoming plagioclasesaturated (+/- Mg-Al spinel) during assimilation. Thermodynamic analysis indicates assimilation was likely minor during mare basaltic volcanism due to a cold lunar crust [3,19]. However, recent observations suggest this may not have always been the case, specifically during the formation of Mg-suite. Large, linear gravity anomalies were recently detected globally on the Moon, inferred to be ancient igneous intrusions [20]. A partially molten lunar crust may have contributed to the large widths of these intrusions. Here, the lunar crust would be more prone to assimilation (and Mg-Al spinel production). Thus, we conclude assimilation should be revisited as a petrogenetic process for early rock types of the Moon, particularly the Mg-suite.  References: [1] Warren P.H. (1986) JGR, 91.
