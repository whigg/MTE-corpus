Abstract: The comet was discovered last year on September  24th  by  Vitali  Nevski  and  Artyom Novichonok  (Rusia)  and  named  "C/2012  S1",  and though it had promise of being very bright at the end of the  current  year  and  the  beginning of  2014,  but  the close  encounter  with  the  Sun  (November  28th)  was devastating; the comet couldn't survive this event. To this  day  (December  31th  2013),  it   hasn't  yet  been possible to detect the debris left in orbit not even by employing the Hubble Space Telescope.  In this work the comet's light curve and the orbital parameters are obtained,  using  high  precision  data.  We  have photographed  and  studied  the  comet  from  the University of Nariño's Observatory (Pasto-Colombia) since January 31st , 2013.   The pictures of the comet were  captured  with  the  following  equipment:  CGE PRO  1400  CELESTRON  (f/11  Schmidt-Cassegrain Telescope) and STL-1001 SBIG camera.         Introduction: The brightness' variation of a comet with respect to the heliocentric distance is given by the following equation:       m  =  mo + 2.5 n log ( r ) + 5 log ( ∆ )m   =   magnitude as observed from the Earthmo  =   absolute magnitude r    =   distance of the comet in relation to the Sun  ∆   =   distance of the comet in relation to the Earth  n   =    index of cometary activityThe absolute magnitude informs us about the intrinsic brightness  of  the  comet.  The  term  related  with  the geocentric  distance  involves  a  variation  of  the brightness  with  the  square  distance's  inverse.  At  the same  time  the  term  related  with  the  heliocentric distance holds the factor ( n )  which varies from comet to comet and is important because its value is related with the physical processes that take place in the coma. By example, if the brightness varies by pure reflection then  n=2,  but  in  most  of  the comets  the brightness doesn't vary solely by reflection and there also exist processes  of  fluorescence  caused  by  the  Sun. Therefore,  the  brightness  changes  more  rapidly with the variations of the heliocentric distance, and the "n" value  indicates how fast this change is. The  law  of  a  comet's  brightness  variation   can  be explained by means of the following equation:                           I = Io Φ ( α )  /  rn  ∆2               Where  Φ ( α ) = phase´s function       Summary And Conclusions: We obtained  the following orbital parameters: eccentricity = 1.000009, orbital  inclination  =  61.92926  deg,  longitude  of  the ascending  node  =  295.72536  deg,  argument  of perihelion  =  345.51426  deg,  perihelion  distance  = 0.01249335  A.U.  The  parameters  were  calculated based on 22 observations (2013 Jan 31-May 17) with mean residual = 0.387 arcseconds.
