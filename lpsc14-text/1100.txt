VESTA STRUCTURE AND SOME PETROLOGIC CONSTRAINS FROM THE STUDY OF GRAVITATIONAL POTENTIAL BY THE DAWN MISSION.  S. A. Voropaev, GEOKHI RAS, Moscow, Kosygina str. 19, 119991 voropaev@geokhi.ru   Introduction:  Space mission Dawn targeted 4 Vesta provides a number of remarkable results concerning as surface coverage as physical parameters of the surviving protoplanet. It was confirmed that Vesta differentiated and Rheasilvia, a giant impact basin at the the south polar region, is the most likely source of howardite-eucrite-diogenite (HED) meteorites [1]. But, degree of Vesta’s primary hondritic body melting is not clear till now and depends on the time of its formation at the beginning of the life of the Solar System [2]. So, the core/mantle size and the composition of theirs rocks remains questionable.   Analytical procedure: If the gravitational potential of Vesta is modeled by a spherical harmonic expansion in the body-fixed reference, then  the main part in second  order is [3]  U(r,θ,φ) ≈ GM/r {1 + 1/r2 [(A+B-2C)/2M ½(3 cos(θ)2 -1) + (B-A)/4M cos(2φ) 3sin2(θ)]}  where A < B < C are principal moments of inertia, M is mass and G is the gravitational constant. The unnormalized coefficents (the reference radius of the body is 265 km) are defined as [4]  C – (A+B)/2 = J2RMR2, J2R = 0.071060892; B – A = C22R 4MR2,  C22R = 0.002818457.       Most recent and relevant data from Dawn are [4] major axes of the best-fit ellipsoid,  a/b/c - 284.5/277.25/226.43 (km); mass, M - 2.59076 x 1020 (kg); bulk density, ρb – 3456 (kg/m3); rotation rate, ω - 1617.333119 (deg/day).  For our purpose, the shape of Vesta is reasonably well approximated by a twoaxial oblate ellipsoid, a1 = b1 = 280.85 (km), c1 = 226.43 (km) and B = A at second harmonic degree.  In this case using equatorial axes a as the reference radius is more convenient     C – A = J2Ma2 where J2 = J2R (R/a)2 and  J2 = 0.063266. An exact analytical treatment provides for homogeneous twoaxial oblate ellipsoid (with an arbitrary bulk density)  J2 (0)  = 1/5 ε12 , where eccentricity ε12 = 1 – c12/a12.  So, for homogenous Vesta, J2 (0) = 0.069998 (ε1 = 0.5916)  and J2 < J2 (0) is a clear indication of the more dense core relative mantle.      In order to explore the implications of the gravity and shape for the interior structure of Vesta, simple two-layer  mass-balance model was explored with an assumed core as twoaxial oblate ellipsoid with major axes a2 = b2 > c2 and eccentricity ε22 = 1 – c22/a22. In this case,  M = M1 + M2, where M1 = 4π/3 ρ1 a12 c1,  ρ1 is the mantle’s density, M2 = 4π/3 (ρ2 - ρ1) a22 c2,  ρ2 is the core’s density. So, mass-balance provides 1 = ρ1/ ρb + (ρ2 - ρ1)/ρb (a2/a1)2 c2/c1 or  (a2/a1)2 c2/c1 = (ρb - ρ1)/ (ρ2 - ρ1)      (1)    For two-layer model an exact analytical treatment provides  J2 (1)  =  1/5 [ M1/M ε12 + M2/M ε22 (a2/a1)2 ]           (2) After comparison with (1) we have  ε22(a2/a1)2 = [5J2 (1) - ρ1/ρb ε12]/(1-ρ1/ρb) = D1(ρ1) > 0 (3)                     Fig.1  We assume that the core’s eccentricity ε2 < ε1 as for more dense rocks relative mantle and a2/a1 < 1/2. In this case  left part of (3) should be less then 0.087. For  J2 (1)  = J2 = 0.063266, the right part of the later expression - D1(ρ1) set the following limits for the unknown mantle’s density  as shown on Fig.1  3.0 < ρ1 <  3.13 (g/cm3)  At hydrostatic equilibrium, an exact analytical treatment provides for homogeneous twoaxial oblate ellipsoid with bulk density ρb , eccentricity ε2 = 1 – c2/a2 and rotation rate ω the following relation   ω2/2π ρbG = 1/l3[arctg(l)(3 + l2) – 3l] =  F(l),  2.8 2.9 3 3.10.20.100.10.20.1730.104D1 x( )00.0873.22.8 x       1100.pdf

Fig. 2  where l(ε) = ε/ √1 - ε2 (see Fig.2).  So, for Vesta with the rotation rate ω = 1617.333119 (deg/day) or rotation period T = 5.342 h and bulk dencity ρb = 3456 (kg/m3)   ω2/2π ρbG = 0.074  and F(l) provides ε(0) = 0.518 while Vesta’s eccentricity ε1 = 0.5916. So, ε(0) < ε1 is clear indication of the nonequilibrium figure. The Vesta’s Bouguer anomaly mapped to the 290x265-km ellipsoid through harmonic degree 15 [4] shown non-compensated relief as well.  Results and discussion: The above discussed simple core/mantle model provides reasonable value for mean mantle’s density. Diogenites are currently believed to originate from deep within the crust of the Vesta and relatively unbrecciated olivine-rich diogenites consist of an equilibrium assemblage of olivine (3.27-3.37 g/cm3) and magnesian orthopyroxene – harzburgite (2.99-3.2 g/cm3) [5]. So, we can use this model at analytical treatment for more detailed analyses of the gravity of  Vesta and implications for internal stresses [6].   It is clear now that the evolution of Vesta was a complex process and in the initial stage its rocks were more mobile than currently. Additional investigation of the relation between rotation rate and figure of Vesta given its heterogeneity and petrological constraints is required and will be followed.     References:  [1] S.
