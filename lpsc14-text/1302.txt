Because of harsh space environmental conditions during and after launch, instrument performances may degrade at launch and during on orbit. Since Moon radiometric properties are extremely stable for a very long term (> 1 Million year [1]), Lunar calibration treating Moon as a known brightness light source is one of useful calibration methods on orbit. Spectral Profiler onboard SELENE, a Japanese Lunar orbiter, provided a new Moon reflectance and photometrical model with 6-8 nm spectral sampling interval, which enables to simulate Lunar observation conducted by any satellites. Comparing observed and simulated Moon images, sensor degradations will be validated.  SELENE/SP based Hyperspectral Lunar reflectance Model: Because multi-spectral and hyperspectral sensors onboard Earth observing satellites usually have lots of spectral bands and ability to obtain high spatial resolution images, lunar calibration for these sensors requires a reflectance model which is composed of enough spectral bands and has high spatial resolution. A new lunar reflectance model has been proposed based on hyper-spectral data of Spectral Profiler (SP) onboard SELENE which was a Japanese Moon satellite operated in 2007 - 2009 [2]. The model covers a wavelength range from 500 nm to 1600 nm and it also involves lunar surface photometric properties depending on incident, emission and phase angles. The information of reflectance and photometric properties enables to simulate lunar observations from any position around the Earth. This new SP based lunar calibration model will be opened to public. The model resolution reaches 0.5 x 0.5 degree in longitude and latitude and the model has totally 720 x 360 grids. This resolution is comparable to the resolution of lunar images by a planned hyper-spectral imager such as Hyperspectral Imager Suite (HISUI), which is a Japanese next-generation Earth observation project that is composed of a hyperspectral imager with the ground sampling distance of 30 meters and a multispectral imager with the ground sampling distance of 5   Figure 1.

This new SP based lunar calibration model is useful for not only HISUI but also other existing and future multi-spectral and hyper-spectral mission. For demonstrating the utilization of the model, we simulated lunar observations by Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) onboard Terra using Band 1 (centered at 560 nm), Band 2 (660 nm) and Band 3 (810 nm) [4] conducted on April 13, 2003 and by Operational Land Imager (OLI) onboard Landsat-8 using Band 3 (560 nm), Band 4 (655 nm), Band 5 (865 nm) and Band 9 (1610 nm) [5] conducted on June 24, 2013 (Figure 1). Following previous studies [6] [7], we compared observed and modeled radiance at every pixel (Figure 2). Since correlation coefficients of observed and modeled radiance exceed 0.99 for all bands of both sensors, we confirmed the model describes the lunar surface photometric properties correctly. These highly correlation coefficients indicate 1302.pdf

Figure 2. Scatter plots comparing observed and simulated Moon radiance for ASTER/Band 2 and OLI/Band 5. Grey lines represent the positions where both radiance are same.   that SP model has good ability to validate relative degradations of sensors. Absolute radiance ratio of observed/simulated images are 1.04 +/- 0.04, 1.00 +/- 0.04 and 0.96 +/- 0.04 in ASTER/Band 1, Band 2, and Band 3, respectively, while they are 1.08 +/- 0.03, 1.05 +/- 0.03, 0.98 +/- 0.03, 0.95 +/- 0.03 in OLI/Band 3, Band 4, Band 5 and Band 9. From these values, the model enables to simulate the absolute radiance in some bands, although it has the tendency of being darker than observation in shorter wavelength and brighter than in longer wavelength. Since ASTER/Band 1 and OLI/Band 3 and Band 4 are located shorter wavelength of the SP/VIS band sensor, one possible reason of this tendency is the calibration accuracy of SP/VIS sensor according to SP calibration reports comparing other Lunar observation sensors [8] [9]. In this presentation, we show the advantage of SP lunar reflectance model for radiometric calibration of Earth observation sensors and we demonstrate current SP based lunar calibration system (lunar observation simulator). In addition, we will discuss comparisons of other lunar reflectance models such as the ROLO model [8] and future development plan (e.g., incorporation of SP/NIR2 band data and topographic effects) for improving the absolute accuracy of the SP model.
