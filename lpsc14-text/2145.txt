Chlorides were detected in >200 ancient low albedo sites on Mars using THEMIS data [1,2,3]. Chlorides were found together with phyllosilicates at Terra Sirenum in a coordinated THEMIS-CRISM study [4]. Visible/near-infrared (VNIR) spectra of hydrated chloride salts contain broad H2O bands [5] different from the H2O bands observed in spectra of H2O ice [6,7]. This lab study seeks to document the VNIR spectral properties of hydrated chloride salts that form at a variety of temperatures.Samples:  Anhydrous and hydrated chlorides were acquired for this study and several hydrohalite samples were collected from hyper-saline springs at Axel Heiberg island for another project [8]. The Axel Heiberg samples melted and refroze before spectra could be acquired so they are not in the same form that they were in the field. However, spectra of samples collected during the winter (MW1,2,3) and summer (MW4,5,6) field seasons appeared visually distinct and exhibited different properties, so we infer that they represent different forms of cold hydrated salts. Several pure chlorides were analyzed that are stable under ambient lab conditions. Other hydrated chlorides are stable only below 273 K. Selected hydrated chlorides were crystallized from a brine solution in a dry ice/acetone bath at ~195 K.Spectral Measurements:  VNIR reflectance spectra were measured using an ASD FieldSpecPro spectrometer. The samples stable at room temperature were measured as particulate grains on a black teflon dish. The samples formed under subzero temperatures were placed on a large teflon disk in contact with a block of dry ice to keep the samples cool during measurement. All samples still melted significantly within minutes during the measurement process.VNIR Spectral Analyses of Room Temperature Chlorides:  VNIR spectra of several hydrated chlorides stable at room temperature are shown in Figure 1. These exhibit strong, broad bands near 1.0, 1.2, 1.45, 1.8 and 1.95 µm. The band centers vary with changing cations and hydration state as observed previously by  Hanley et al. [5]. Spectra were measured of these samples as received out of the bottle and the "anhydrous" chlorides all have distinct water bands. Spectra of the hexahydrated samples are nearly saturated due to the strong water bands. Spectra of the Fe2+Cl2.4H2O, CuCl2.2H2O and CaCl2 samples all contain a band near 1.8 µm and this feature is split into a doublet for Ca Cl2. Spectra of hydrated perchlorates generally have stronger bands near 1.4-1.5, 1.9-2 and 2.4 µm that also vary with cation [9]. The spectrum of hydrated Ca perchlorate also exhibits a doublet near 1.8 µm attributed to H2O in a constrained space [9].Figure 2.

Spectra of less hydrated samples are shown at the top and spectra of more hydrated samples are shown at the bottom.Figure 1.

VNIR Spectral Analyses of Low Temperature Chlorides:  Spectra of synthetic hydrohalite (NaCl.2H2O) and hydrated MgCl2, Fe2+Cl2, and Fe3+Cl3 are shown at the bottom of Figure 3. The low temperature forms of these chlorides have been found to contain 6 or more H2O molecules per cation [11, 12, 13], which is consistent with the highly saturated spectra observed. However, the H2O bands in the spectra of the hydrated Mg, Fe2+, and Fe3+ chlorides near 1.01 and 1.22 µm are similar to the features observed for hydrohalite and distinct from those of H2O ice.VNIR Spectral Analyses of Axel Heiberg Samples:  Spectra of the samples collected on Axel Heiberg island are shown at the top of Figure 3. Spectra of the samples collected during the winter season (e.g. MW2) are different from spectra collected during the summer season (e.g. MW6), although both are consistent with the presence of hydrohalite.  The spectral features also changed as the samples melted during measurement. The band at 1.77 µm in the summer sample changed to a shoulder at 1.80 µm and the doublet at 2.18 and 2.22 µm disappeared as the sample melted. The position of the H2O bands also shifted towards shorter wavelengths as the samples melted during measurement.  Interestingly, the band centers for H2O ice are all at slightly longer wavelengths so we were not measuring the spectra of H2O ice as the hydrohalite-bearing field samples melted. The band centers for these features are summarized in Table 1. The features observed at 2.18-2.22 µm are not found in hydrohalite or most other chlorides and will be investigated further using chemical analyses of the sample sites [8].Applications to Mars:  Hydrohalite has been found in sediments of the subzero Antarctic Dry Valeys [14] and may be present on Mars as Cl has been found on the surface of Mars by nearly every mission [15, 16]. We hope that the data collected in this study can be used in future analyses of CRISM data at the low albedo sites where chlorides have been identified using  THEMIS data in order to refine the chloride detections on Mars.Acknowledgements:  Funding for the spectral measurements from NASA's EXO and MFR programs is appreciated.
