At the reduced oxidation states (<FMQ) of many planetary basalts Cr is present in melts in both divalent and trivalent forms. The ratio of trivalent to divalent Cr present in the melt has many consequences for the stability and Cr concentration of magmatic phases such as spinel, clinopyroxene, and olivine. However, understanding the Cr valence in quenched melts has historically been plagued with analytical obstacles, and only recently has reliable methodology for quantifying Cr valence in quenched melts been developed. Despite this substantial difficulty, the pioneering works of Hanson and Jones [1] and Berry and O’Neill [2] provided important insights into the oxidation state of Cr in in silicate melts. Here we present a series of 1-bar gas mixing experiments performed with a Fe-rich basaltic melt in which we have determined the Cr redox ratio of the melt over a range of fO2 values by measuring this quantity in olivine with X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy (XANES). The measured Cr redox ratio of the olivine phenocrysts can be readily converted to the ratio present in the conjugate melt via the ratio of crystal-liquid partition coefficients for Cr3+ and Cr2+ [3]. We have applied these results to model Cr spinel stability and Cr redox ratio in a primitive, iron-rich martian basalt.  The Petrologic Importance of Cr-Spinel: Crspinel plays many significant roles in modulating the concentrations of important trace elements. Cr spinel has been demonstrated to be a potentially important sink of highly siderophile elements (HSEs) such as Rh, Re and Ir [4, 5]. CrSpinel is also an important host for transition metals such as Ni, Co, and V. Additionally, the composition of Cr-spinel is highly sensitive to changing melt chemistry and fO2 during magmatic differentiation; these relationships render Cr-spinel crystals a sensitive petrologic indicator [5]. Within this work we attempt to lay a framework with which fundamental questions about the link between magmatic Cr-spinels and their conditions of formation can be addressed. In broad terms the data and modeling presented in this abstract will ultimately help answer outstanding questions such as: 1) How much  Cr3+ is required to meet the threshold for a melt to attain Cr-Spinel saturation, and what implications does this have for the fO2 and bulk Cr contents of planetary magmas? 2) How is the Cr redox ratio in the melt (changing as a function of fO2) manifested in the equilibrium composition of Cr-spinel? 3) What can the composition of early formed Cr-spinel in martian meteorites reveal about the undifferentiated melt composition, redox state, and chemistry of its mantle source?  Experiments: Wire loop experiments were conducted in the one-bar gas mixing laboratory at NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC). The experiments were performed using Re loops to prevent Fe-loss with the exception of experiments run at oxygen fugacity values near the FMQ buffer, which employed Pt-Rh loops. The starting materials consisted of a composition patterned after the whole rock composition of Martian meteorite Yamato 980459 (Y-98). Experiments were performed at temperatures of 1300˚C, 1320˚C and 1380˚C. Experimental fO2 was controlled with CO-CO2 mixtures that were calibrated with a zirconia electrochemical oxygen sensor. X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy (XANES) Data Acquisition and Reduction:         Chromium K-edge XANES data were acquired with the x-ray microprobe of GSECARS beamline 13-ID-E at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory, Illinois. The x-ray source at APS beamline 13ID-E was a 72-pole, 33 mm period undulator. Cr valence ratios measured with XANES in olivine have been re-calculated to reflect the liquid from which they grew (using the ratio of DCr3+/DCr2+ and the mole fractions of Cr3+ and Cr2+ in the olivine). Cr Valence in the Experimental Melts: As a first order observation, the calculated Cr2+/ΣCr values for the melt show a distinct trend as a function of the experimental fO2 values. The trend in the data suggests that the Cr valence ratio in the olivine is indeed sensitive to the oxidation state of the experimental charge, and, Figure 2.

Additionally, plots of the average corrected ln[Cr3+/Cr2+] vs. lnfO2  yield a linear array. Fitting the data via linear regression yields a line with a slope of 0.24 and a correlation coefficient of R2 = 0.97.  The observed relationship between ln[Cr3+/Cr2+] and lnfO2 is  in excellent agreement with the stoichiometry of the homogenous Cr2+Cr3+ oxidation equilibrium [3]. Using the calculated Cr3+/Cr2+ of the experimental melts it is possible to model the Cr3+/ΣCr of the melt as a function of oxygen fugacity. Figure 1 presents a plot of the modeled Cr3+/ΣCr values vs. fO2 for the experimental Y-98 melts.                  How Much Cr3+ is Required in the Melt to Attain Cr-Spinel Saturation? Cr-spinel is a stable phase in nearly all of the experimental charges, with the notable exception of experiments conducted at fO2 values below the IW buffer.  Using the XANES measured Cr redox ratios of the melt we have calculated the concentration of Cr3+ in the experimental melts. Figure 2 shows the calculated Cr3+ contents of the experimental melts as well as model curves for the Cr3+, Cr2+ and Fe3+ content of the experimental melts.  Our measurements indicate that the elemental Cr3+ concentration in the liquid must exceed 1450ppm to achieve Cr-spinel saturation. The most reduced experiments (IW-1) contained only 750ppm Cr3+, and therefore did not contain any spinel. As the fO2 of the experimental charges was increased, the Cr3+ content concurrently increased until reaching the level required for spinel saturation. From this point the presence of Cr-Spinel buffers the concentration of Cr3+ in the liquid at a constant value (at a fixed Cr-spinel composition).             the oxidized experiments appear to have required less Cr3+ in the liquid to maintain Cr -spinel saturation. This observation can be readily explained considering the precipitous      increase of Fe3+ present in both the melt and the spinel. The Cr-spinels in the most oxidized experiments (FMQ) have a much larger magnetite component than do the other spinels. The fact that the spinels from the oxidized experiments have a lower mole fraction of the chromite component, is consistent with the lower abundances of Cr3+ required to maintain Cr-spinel saturation in these experiments. This observation suggests that the stability field of Cr-spinel can be greatly expanded (in fO2 space) when a small quantity (~1-2 wt. %) of ferric iron is present in the liquid.  Conculsions: Assuming that the effects of pressure on the Cr redox equilibrium are minimal, results from this work suggest that the primitive, Y-98 melt may have contained significant quantities of both trivalent and divalent chromium at temperatures below 1380˚C. Results from our modeling also suggest that a substantial quantity of Cr3+ is required in the melt to attain Cr-spinel saturation in iron rich martian basalts. One implication that falls out of this observation is that Cr-spinel may not be a liquidus phase but rather a late crystallizing phase in relatively Cr poor liquids, even at moderately oxidizing fO2 values.
