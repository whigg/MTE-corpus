 DETERMINING BAND CENTERS FROM ASTEROID SPECTRA.  T. H. Burbine, Astronomy Department, Mount Holyoke College, South Hadley, MA 01075, USA (tburbine@mtholyoke.edu).   Introduction:  One of the most important indicators of an asteroid's mineralogy is the presence or absence of absorption features at ~0.9 and ~1.9 µm due to olivine and/or pyroxene.  The wavelength positions of these features are indicative of the chemical composition of these minerals.   However, there is no standard way of determining band centers and their associated errors.  Storm [1] developed a routine for determining Band I centers by fitting the bottom third of the band with a second-order polynomial.  In his method, initially only the three lowest reflectance points in the band are fit.  The reflectance minimum and corresponding wavelength are then solved for.  All reflectance values are then randomly resampled using a Gaussian distribution of the given uncertainty for each reflectance value.  This resampling, fitting, and determining band minima is done 100 times.  Then the number of points in the band that are to be fit are expanded and the fitting procedure is repeated until the whole bottom one-third of the band is fit.  The mean band minimum is then determined by averaging all calculated wavelength positions of the band minima.  A standard deviation for each band minimum can then be calculated.  I have developed a MATLAB® program for determining Band I and II centers for S-type asteroid spectra based primarily on the method of Storm [1] but with a few modifications that hopefully improve on his method.   Program:  The MATLAB program inputs the wavelength, reflectance, and error values of a spectrum.  Fourth order polynomials are first fit over the maxima at ~0.7, ~1.5, and ~2.5µm to determine peak positions.  The continua over Band I and Band II are then divided out using the maxima as tangent points.  The bottom one-third of each band is then fit with a second-order polynomial and the wavelength of the band minima is determined.   All reflectance values are then randomly resampled using a Gaussian distribution of the given uncertainty for each reflectance value.  After the resampling, the bottom one-third of each band is then fit.  This resampling is then done 999 times for each band.  A mean band minimum and a standard deviation for each band can be determined from all calculated wavelength positions of the band minima.  This program was previously used in a study of near-Earth asteroids [2]. The program then calculates whether the band minima are consistent with H, L, and/or LL chondrites.  The band minima ranges of the ordinary chondrites are determined from the spectra used in the Dunn et al. [3] study.  For objects with band minima consistent with ordinary chondrites, the average fayalite (Fa) and ferrosilite (Fs) contents are also calculated by the program from the Band I center positions using formulas derived by Dunn et al. [3].  The uncertainties are 1.3 mol% for the calculated Fa contents and are 1.4 mol% for the calculated Fs contents.  No temperature corrections are done to the asteroid band minima.   Results:  I have calculated the Fa and Fs contents (Table 1) for a number of asteroids that have band positions consistent with ordinary chondrites.  Spectra were taken from the SMASS (Small Main-Belt Asteroid Spectroscopic Survey) website.  The derived mineralogies can be compared to the Fa and Fs ranges for ordinary chondrites [4].  Hebe and Massalia have Fa and Fs contents very similar to H chondrites.  Hebe has been previously linked to H chondrites by Gaffey and Gilbert [5].  Juno and Hecuba have Fa and Fs contents very similar to L chondrites.  Eunomia and Ariadne have Fa and Fs contents very similar to LL chondrites.  Koronis and Lacrimosa have Fa and Fs contents similar to both H and L chondrites.  Ausonia has Fa and Fs contents similar to both L and LL chondrites.    Table 1.
