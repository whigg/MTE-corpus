Co-occurring minerals and geologic context suggest that many Martian phyllosilicates formed as a result of hydrothermal alteration at depth [3,4]. Studies of basalt alteration in terrestrial hydrothermal systems have shown that phyllosilicate formation often occurs isochemically and at elevated temperature [5,6]. These are the conditions predicted for many detected outcrops on Mars [3].  Smectites and other phyllosilicates detected to date in Noachian deposits contain primarily ferric iron [1,2]. However given the expected low partial pressure of oxygen in the early Martian atmosphere and no other plausible oxidants at the surface it has long been predicted that ferrous phyllosilicates should have formed at this time [7,8]. The Curiosity rover recently discovered a ferrous trioctahedral smectite just below the surface in the Sheepbed Mudstone of Gale Crater [9].  This indicates that anoxic fluids were responsible for a significant portion of secondary mineral formation in this unit. In addition, ferric phyllosilicates observed from orbit in diverse terranes likely formed in the subsurface from low-temperature or hydrothermal alteration [E1], which are not conducive to iron oxidation. This suggests that these clays were oxidized subsequent to deposition. Using Martian phyllosilicates to establish conditions at the time of their deposition thus requires an understanding of their formation processes and transformations that occur upon iron oxidation. Understanding trace element repartition during these processes, which appear to have occurred in phyllosilicate units at Endeavor Crater [10], may provide additional insight into formation conditions. We have thus investigated mineral formation and trace element fate during the alteration of a series of mafic rocks. Methods:   For this study three terrestrial USGS igneous rock standards (BCR-2, Columbia River basalt; BIR-1a, Icelandic basalt; and DNC-1a, North Carolina dolerite) were chosen for their compositional similarity to basalt rocks examined at Gusev Crater by the Spirit Rover [11].  A dunite (DTS-2b, Twin Sisters dunite) was also studied to investigate an ultramafic rock that may produce serpentine during alteration. The rock standards were first ground in a micronizing mill to a particle size range of 1-5 μm. Once ground they were loaded with pure deionized water into PTFE-lined hydrothermal reaction vessels and reacted for 3 weeks at 200oC in an anoxic nitrogen environment. The altered basalts were then brought into an anoxic glovebox where they were dried for characterization. Mineralogy was determined via XRD using a Bruker D8 Advance powder diffractometer.  Imaging of particle size and secondary mineralization was accomplished using a JEOL 7001LVF SEM. Fe K-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectra were collected at the Advanced Photon Source on beamline 12-BM in transmission mode for all rock samples and at 5-BM for mineral samples. Additionally Mn and Zn K-edge spectra were collected in fluorescence mode at 12-BM for DNC-1a only.  This technique quantifies oxidation state and characterizes local coordination environment which together indicate how these elements partition into secondary minerals during alteration. Results:  SEM images show that individual grains form aggregates up to tens of microns across. Secondary minerals appear on the surface of primary grains and have a leafy texture (Fig. 1). They are sparse in all but DNC-1a where they can occasionally cover the entire surface of large aggregates of primary minerals. The visual texture of these minerals corresponds to smectites and this is corroborated by the appearance of smectite (001) and (060) reflections in the XRD patterns of BIR-1a and DNC-1a (Fig. 2). BCR-2 is the only sample in which there was very little observed alteration. Fe XAFS spectra revealed almost no deviation in the XANES region and only slight changes in the EXAFS region, indicating that Fe remained primarily in primary phases. Comparing the XAFS to the other rock standards all of the BCR-2 samples very closely resemble the altered BIR-1a. SEM imaging shows some slight surface alteration with a similar texture to that seen in the DNC-1a but it was very rare and represented by individual growths rather than domains of growth. It is possible that BCR2, being from surface basalt flows, may have had more prior contact with fluids than the other samples. The changes observed in the XAFS spectra of BIR1a and DNC-1a upon alteration agree well with the spectrum of a synthetic trioctahedral ferrous smectite (Fig. 3) (labeled clay F in [12]). The XAFS spectrum of unaltered DTS-2b is dominated by olivine indicating that nearly all the iron in the dunite was in this phase (Fig. 3). DTS-2b showed the greatest changes in both the EXAFS and XANES regions, although the post-alteration Fe mineralogy is currently unclear.  Additional measurements investigated trace metal repartitioning in DNC-1a during alteration. These studies indicate Mn is mobilized during alteration, incorporating into a new phase (Fig. 4), while Zn stays in its original host mineral. The Mn EXAFS spectra are similar to the Fe EXAFS spectra for altered DNC1a, suggesting Mn is incorporated into a phyllosilicate (Fig. 4). Zn in this rock standard may exist in a spinel phase that is resistant to alteration. These measurements suggest that trace metals may show distinct repartitioning behavior during rock alteration.
