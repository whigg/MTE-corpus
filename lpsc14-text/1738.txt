Abstract The dwarf planet  Ceres is the largest of the minor bodies,  and is located in the main asteroid belt with a semi-major axis 2.77 AU.  Current observational evidence shows that the boundary between rocky bodies and icy bodies is probably within the asteroid belt or a little further and Ceres is a key object to understand the water story in the solar system.  We applied the numerical model described in [1,2,3] to simulate  the thermal surface properties of  asteroid Ceres in the light of the Dawn NASA mission[4],  planned to arrive  to  Ceres in the  spring 2015.  Introduction  Ceres represents the key, together with Vesta, to answer  some important questions relative to the role of physical protoplanet sizes  and water content in determining their subsequent evolution. Ceres is thought to be differentiated into a silicate core with an icy mantle [5,6,7],  hydrated minerals were found on its surface [8]. Moreover, the presence of water emission from Ceres was  suggested from a marginal detection of the photodissociation product OH [9].  It is a rock-ice body 950 km in diameter and it may have active hydrological processes leading to  seasonal polar caps of water frost. It  also may have  a thin, permanent or transient  atmosphere distinguishing it from the other minor planets.  In the literature, we find several previous works dedicated  to the study of this asteroid [5,7]. They are mainly devoted to simulating the thermal evolution of the body since its formation.   The current work, conversely, uses a quasi 3D approach, derived from thermal evolution of cometary nuclei,  to study the thermal properties  of the surface and the possible water activity.    The thermo-physical  model  The model uses a quasi-three-dimensional approach  in which diurnal and latitudinal temperature variations  are calculated by the insolation on the bodies. The numerical code is derived by a cometary model that simultaneously solves the heat and vapor transfer equations by a CrankNicholson  implicit scheme.  The model assumes Ceres to be a spherical body with fixed radius and made of a homogeneous mixture of dust  and ices   in different proportions. The initial composition is composed by water ice, dust and organic materials, in specified proportions. The dust grains are distributed in different size classes having different physical and thermal properties. The surface temperature is derived from the balance among solar input,  energy re-emitted in space, conducted in the interior and used to sublimate  ices.  A mesh of quadrilaterals describes the  shape. The illumination for each of the facets making up the full shape is   calculated by the angle between the local normal and the direction to the Sun. The thermal evolution of each grid surface is calculated by taking into account the solar illumination and the properties of the material beneath the surface. The heat diffusion through the porous mixture of ice and dust is computed, determining the water ice phase transition and the sublimation rate of the ices. The  temperature is also computed for each element, providing thermal maps at the surface and at depth.  We have developed several geophysical and thermal scenarios, changing the proportion of ice and dust, surface albedo, and the  presence and absence of ice  on (and below) the  surface.  For a surface in radiative equilibrium at 2.77 AU (Ceres mean orbital radius) and an albedo of 0.09, the equilibrium surface temperature is 163 K (assuming a solar constant of 1330 W m-2 and an emissivity of 0.9). A typical results of the model is  depicted in fig.1, where the case without ice on the surface is described.   Fig.1 Top: Surface temperature map for a case without on the surface ( ice is at  2.5 cm beneath the surface and the proportion  silicatic dust / H2O ice is  2.5; bottom: equatorial daily variation of temperature for the same case as described above. Conclusion The Dawn mission  will arrive  to orbit Ceres in Spring 2015 and  is expected to acquire  key measurements about  the thermal state and possibly,  on the water outgassing behaviour of Ceres. The model here described will be used to further understand the Ceres water regime. In particular it will provide simulation of the water sublimation  and ice stability to be compared with the Dawn measurements. In fact two of the instruments on DAWN, VIR-the near-infrared spectrometer and GRaND-the Gamma Ray and Neutron Detector [10,11], can  contribute significantly to understanding the role of water on Ceres.
