Scientific  investigations  of  NEOs  inform  ourknowledge of the origin of our solar system. Resourcesavailable in NEOs provide a potential economic returnon Earth and in-situ utilization of such resources canbenefit  future  space  endeavors.  In  addition  to  thesebenefits, NEOs also pose a threat to civilization. The15  February,  2013  Chelyabinsk  meteor  incident  reminded the public of the dangers of impacting NEOs. In order  to properly analyze,  mine, relocate,or mitigate the threat posed by a NEO, spacecraft willneed to operate properly in the close-proximity NEOenvironment.  NEO close-proximity operations pose achallenging spacecraft navigation problem due to theirtenuous, complex gravitational field, and other perturbing  forces  (i.e.,  solar-radiation  pressure  (SRP)  andthird-body perturbations)  [1].  As  a  result,  there  is  aneed to implement a control algorithm to our spacecraftin order  to properly fulfill  our  mission requirements.Additionally,  there  is  a  need  for  autonomy with thespacecraft control methodology due to the delay timesin communication between the spacecraft and missioncontrol.The  Japanese  Aerospace  ExplorationAgency's  recent Hayabusa mission to  asteroid 25143Itokawa accurately demonstrated the navigational challenges  that  arise  during  autonomous  satellite  operations. Most notable were the anomalies that arose during  the  sample  recovery  touchdowns  during  theHayabusa mission  [5]. With the information receivedfrom the Hayabusa mission, we may test  our controltheory in a simulated, “real-world” environment.NEO Environment: To generate the Itokawaenvironment we utilized AGI's System Tool Kit (STK)software.  Two gravity models are  being used  in  thisstudy: a point-mass model and a degree and order 4,spherical harmonic gravity model found in [3]. Usingboth models allows for the testing of sensitivity of thesatellite to each perturbing factor independently as wellas collectively.  Our STK simulations have found thatthere  are  three  regions  of  influence  around Itokawa.For a spacecraft's orbit to be gravitationally bound tothe asteroid, it must be within the Hill radius. The Hillradius of Itokawa varies from 25km to 45km depending on Itokawa-Sun geometry [3].  Within this radius,simulations revealed that a satellite in a circular orbitabout Itokawa with semi-major axis of 3km or greaterwas ejected from the system before completing one orbit due to the influence of SRP and third-body perturbations. It  was found that orbits below 1km in semimajor axis were more susceptible to the complex gravity of a rotating, non-uniform body with the spacecrafteither impacting or being ejected after only a few orbits. Spherical harmonic gravity models are only validoutside  a  circumscribing  sphere  around  the  asteroid.Once the spacecraft’s orbit penetrates this sphere, thegravity model breaks down [2]. Therefore we chose notto run simulations with a semi-major axis within thissphere.  For our STK simulation of Itokawa, this wasthe surrounding sphere of radius 277.9m [3].Figure 1- The influence of both SRP (squares)and point-mass gravity (diamonds) that a 500kg spacecraft is exposed to around Itokawa at semi-major axis5km is shown. Depending on where Itokawa is withinits orbit  affects the forces  imposed on the spacecraft(true anomaly of orbit). As the spacecraft moves to ahigher  altitude,  gravitational  attraction  decreases  andSRP becomes more  prevalent.  Moving closer  causesSRP to slowly become less of a perturbing force. Analysis also revealed areas of natural stability.  This stability was found when the spacecraft  wasplaced  in  a  circular  orbit  with  semi-major  axis  11.5km. This is in agreement with Scheeres [3]. Orbitstability increased again as the spacecraft were placedin polar and retrograde orbits.

the close-proximity NEO environment and basic orbitalmechanics  allows for  the  mission planners  to  utilizethese regions of natural stability to better control thesatellite while it performs its mission. Spacecraft  Orbit  Control: With  the  NEOenvironment well-characterized in our STK simulation,a classical control method can be implemented to testsits reliability for close-proximity NEO operations. Theclassical  control  scheme  implemented  is  the  wellknown  Proportional,  Integral  and  Derivative  (PID)controller [4]. The controller uses an error function todetermine when input is needed.  Proportional, Integraland  Derivative  terms  define  the  function  used.  PIDcontrol can be cost-effective and be easily tuned basedon the performance specifications. PID control is wellunderstood for linear systems. First the error from the desired orbit is determined and used in a feedback control loop. The orbit isdivided  into  finite  time steps  and  the  difference  between the desired position and current position is determined.  This  difference  in  position  (altitude  for  ourstudy) is the error used by the PID controller. STK wasmerged with Matlab to accomplish this task. This allows for  customized  control  algorithms to  be  developed and simulated within the STK simulation.Figure 2- High-level overview of the program writtento test or control schematic for our spacecraft.The study found that the PID controller alonedemonstrated some limitations for  optimal orbit  control. The controller constantly tries to correct for an error  value  based  solely  on  its  instantaneous  positionwithout regard to future behavior.  The initial  controltests were conducted in an environment in which theprimary body (Itokawa) was treated as a point mass inorder to tune the control system. In  initial  simulations it  was found that  spacecraftthruster levels were very low  (mN).  The levels keptthe spacecraft in the desired orbit, but resulted in largetransfer times. Another method tested was to break themaneuver into two sections; the transfer and stabilization. Though promising initially, when SRP was introduced into the system the thrust output from the previously tuned PID controller did not keep the satellite ina stable orbit. The SRP influence is sufficiently large torender the previous method ineffective. The sensitivityis not ideal for missions to new asteroids with unknowngravitational fields and changing environments leavingthe autonomous PID control algorithm working in vain.Figure  3-  Top:  Transfer  orbit  from 3km to5km  using  an  autonomous  PID  controller.  Bottom:Same controller settings, however the spacecraft is nowunder the influence of SRP. SRP overpowers the systems and the spacecraft ejects.Results: We have shown that the classic PIDcontroller is not a robust control theory to implement inour close-proximity NEO operations due to large perturbation in the relatively weak gravitational  field.  Iforbital  mechanics  and  advanced  control  theory  aremerged  together  to  create  a  smart  controller  there  ispromise that it will be an effective tool for close-proximity autonomous NEO operations.
