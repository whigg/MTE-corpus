Introduction:  The Curiosity Rover has been exploring the sedimentary deposits in the informally named region of the Bradbury Rise, Gale crater, since August 2012. Two locations with iron-rich rocks (Link and Rocknest) have been identified via ChemCam and APXS data sets [1,2,3,4].  Williams et al. [1] found that a ChemCam observation in the Link conglomerate had an elevated Fe abundance, potentially resulting from Fe-rich cement. APXS data found elevated iron in the rock Et Then (located at the Rocknest sand shadow) and suggested the presence of an iron coating or cement [2,3].  We used the ChemCam data set to investigate the prevalence of iron-rich cements in the Bradbury rise region and explore the implications for their abundance and distribution.  Data from Rocknest will be highlighted and other potential iron rich sediments identified. Data: ChemCam is a Laser Induced Breakdown Spectrometer (LIBS) with an integrated Remote Microscopic Imager (RMI) to provide context of where each LIBS spectra is collected. ChemCam LIBS works by firing a laser focused to a 350-550 µm diameter spot that produces plasma from the rock. Spectra of elemental emission lines are recorded from 240850 nm and used to determine the elemental composition of the rock [5,6, for more details on ChemCam and data analysis]. Chemical compositions were generated from individual spectra using the ChemCam team standard Partial Least Squares 1 analysis to produce an elemental oxide abundance for SiO2 Fe2O3, CaO, MgO, Al2O3, TiO2, Na2O, and K2O [e.g. 7,8, 9]. Rocknetst: The Rocknest site consists of a local topographic high that marks the northern edge of a broad, aeolian sand shadow which was the first sampling site for Curiosity. While there, ChemCam collected 119 separate ChemCam analyses from 7 different rocks that were exposed from the sand.  The rocks at Rocknest, which is part of the Glenelg facies, are situated stratigraphically below the Bathhurst Inlet outcrop and above the other facies (Gillespie Lake and Sheepbed) explosed within Yellowknife Bay [10].    Detailed examination of RMI images suggest that Rocknest samples consist of fine-grained sedimentary rocks.  Rock surface textures range from rough to smooth, can be pitted or grooved, and show various degrees of wind erosion. Some rocks display poorly defined layering while others seem to show possible vertical flow features. Narrow vertical voids are present in Rocknest-3, one of the rocks showing the strongest layering (Figure 1). Several lines of textural and geomorphic evidence point toward these rocks being sedimentary in origin, with at least one potential diagenetic event.  Ready abrasion of rock surfaces suggest that rock strength is not compatible with that expected from extrusive or intrusive igneous rocks. Finely laminated rocks are consistent with small changes in grain size, porosity, or cementation in sedimentary rocks.   Possible diagenetic features in these rocks include the distinctive pitting,  tapered cracks in the laminated rocks, and the fractures in the massive rocks.     Figure 1.  Post-LIBS RMI images of Rocknest 3 with laser shots numbered (Seqid: ccam01082) showing laminations, verticle voids, pits indicative of sedimentary origin.    Figure 2.  ChemCam average rock MgO and Al2O3 for representative rocks seen in Gale Crater.  In spite of the textural variation in the rocks, chemically the rocks are similar.   In general the ChemCam data show that the rocks are basaltic in composition with high and variable iron compared to most Martian basalts, and with very low magnesium. Analysis of the major elements indicates that detrital source material was a mixture of felsic and basaltic rock. Sulfur and soluble calcium phases are also present. Rocknest rocks, however, are depleted in magnesium compared to surrounding rocks and soils, suggesting that if the sediments were made from locally derived igneous material, magnesium loss must have occurred— potentially during digenesis (Figure 2) [4]. While iron is elevated in Rocknest (averaging around 20 wt% FeOT with values as high as 26 wt%), iron is not well correlated with other elements such as Ti, MgO.  Comparison with SiO2 shows the highest abundances of FeOT correlating with moderate SiO2 abundances.  We interpret these geochemical trends to indicate that the excess iron is present as non-silicate cement, likely some type of nano-phase iron oxide since spectral evidence does not find evidence for well crystalline hematite at this location. Beyond Rocknest: In general the rocks on Bradbury Rise are dominated by felsic conglomerates [11]. Iron content is generally low.   However two additional observations have been identified that show clear evidence for excess iron, likely as cement. One is from low albedo float rock (Watterson Sol 329) that has some similarities to Rocknest (but also substantial textural/chemical differences) and the other outcrop from the end of drive position on Sol 363 (Labyrinth Lake).  Detailed analysis of individual observations (and bulk trends will be undertaken to evaluate how widespread iron bearing cements might be.  Additional 2component modeling on this topic is also ongoing [12]. The results of these ongoing studies will be used to address whether iron-rich cements are widespread in the Bradbury rise, perhaps indicating common processes for these deposits that are distinctive from those that occurred with Yellowknife Bay sediments.
