Introduction: Shock levels in chondrites are calibrated against shock recovery experiments on nonporous or low-porosity crystals and rocks [1]. But chondrites are complex materials: zero-porosity mmsized chondrules set in a porous aggregate of sub-μm monomers. Meteoritic data, experiments, and model predictions all suggest chondrites were compacted from an initial high porosity; that internal pressure in meteorite parent bodies was too low for gravitational compaction; that compaction was not a local (m-scale) process, but occurred on a large (parent body) scale; and that it was also non-uniform across a parent body [2-6]. These observations point to impacts as the principal driver of compaction. Here we use numerical models to study how impact-induced compaction affected the bimodal materials that were primordial chondritic precursors. Model: We have developed a 2D 'mesoscale' numerical approach to quantify the spatial variability in peak shock pressures P(peak) and post-shock temperatures T(final) during the shock compaction of a mixture of chondrules and matrix using the iSALE hydrocode [7,8]. This approach complements and extends studies that track impact-induced porosity reduction in analogue samples [2]. Our simulations allow us to observe how PT and porosity vary during an impact within and between chondritic components at 100µm scales. Results: Although low velocity impacts are expected to produce minor effects in CCs [1,9], resolving at the 'mesoscale', we find that this is not the case (Fig 1). Impact velocities as low as 2km/s are capable of heating chondrite matrix >1000K while adjacent chondrules are virtually unheated (ΔT(final) 77K) (Fig 1b). Chondrule P(peak) here is not sufficient to generate shock textures. In addition, PT is heterogeneous, varying by 10GPa and 1000K over 100µm length-scales. Chondrule P(peak) also varies with matrix fraction. At 2km/s chondrule interiors in CC-like simulations experience P(peak) of 4-5GPa; in UOC-like simulations ~12GPa; and in nonporous dunite (EOC-like) ~24GPa: precursor matrix fraction generates shock level variability of S1-S4 at constant velocity. Discussion: Previous studies examined shock effects in porous targets, or nonporous targets, but not mixtures of the two. Impacts into porous materials result in much more heating as shock energy is expended in collapsing pores. Primitive chondrites are compacted, but appear texturally and compositionally unmetamorphosed. Our data indicate that this was a consequence of the juxtaposition of two materials with very different initial porosities: matrix was heated rapidly to 100's degrees above ambient, but chondrules stayed 'cold', acting as a heat sink. Cooling to equilibrium bulk T(final) occurred in 10s seconds. Only when bulk T(final) exceeded temperatures typical of CC peak metamorphism would macroscopic effects be apparent. Model results showing PT heterogeneity at 100µm scales suggest an explanation for anomalous features of chondrite petrography (e.g. matrix pyroxene polymorphs requiring T>1300K followed by rapid cooling [10]) and texture. Flattened, oriented, or indented chondrules are found in many weakly shocked primitive meteorites (e.g. Renazzo, S2). In our modelling these chondrule textures become apparent at 2km/s (Fig 1b) (chondrule P(peak) would be consistent with shock level S1-2). We conducted a detailed TEM study of matrix in the CR2 chondrite GRA06100, and devised a novel methodology that used temperaturerelated crystallographic transitions to quantify matrix temperatures. We observed 1000K heterogeneity on 100µm length-scales, with chondrules showing no shock metamorphism, observations consistent with model predictions (in this case, a 1.5km/s impact). The apparent connection between shock level (increasing from CCs, through UOCs, to EOCs) and asteroid metamorphism has prompted the suggestion that asteroid thermal metamorphism was a result of large impacts [11]. Mesoscale simulations showing PT variability with matrix fraction provide an alternate explanation. Shock level is derived from observation of textures in chondrule olivines. There is a widely held view that it is a function of impact velocity and impactor mass. But our data suggest that the way we record shock level can bias our interpretation. It is not required that varying impact energy caused the differences in shock level between the chondrite groups. Rather, varying matrix proportion in chondrite targets controlled the level of shock metamorphism recorded by the chondrules within them. Chondrule formation defines an upper limit on chondrite accretion times. Chondrites could not have accreted prior to the formation of the youngest chondrules that they contain. Both absolute and relative chondrule ages suggest that CCs and OCs accreted no     Figure 1.

Our mesoscale simulations allow us to define a 'speed limit' for the major compressive impact event(s) following accretion at this time. A comparison between our results and meteorite data (porosity, fabric, petrography, local PT heterogeneity) suggests compaction from high initial porosity at velocities from 0.75-2km/s. Evidence for velocities >2km/s (generating thermal metamorphism in CCs, and matrix melting in OCs) is not observed. To translate the mesoscale 'speed limit' into a constraint on asteroid-scale impact velocity we performed additional hydrocode modelling at the macroscale. We find that, of the material that is compacted to meteorite-like porosities, >20% would experience high bulk T(final) (in CC targets), or widespread matrix melting (in OC targets), if collision velocities exceeded ~4km/s during compaction. Although the specific 'speed limit' will depend on a variety of model assumptions, it is apparent that a) initial impact velocities for OC and CC parent bodies were similar, and b) they were low. The chondrule age upper limit on accretion time indicates that these general constraints applied at ~3-4Myr after solar system formation. A 4km/s speed limit has relevance for dynamical models of giant planet migration. According to recent models [17], OC-like parent bodies formed at 0.7-3AU and CC-like bodies formed between the giant planets and from 8.0-13.0AU. The migration of Jupiter resulted in an early (4-5Myr) depletion and excitation of the asteroid belt region [17]. It was then repopulated with material from these two source regions [17]. Estimates for asteroid collisional velocities at 4Myr from models that do not involve early migration of Jupiter are 5-9km/s [18]. Grand Tack variants would produce higher mean impact velocities. This is not consistent with our observations. In addition, if OCs and CCs derived from very different source regions we would expect to see evidence for different initial impact velocities. We do not. With respect to the planetary dynamics of the early solar system, our speed limit constraint is consistent with a relatively 'late' phase of main belt collisional evolution, rather than the early, rapid depletion of a massive main belt [17].
