It consists inthe condensation of a part of the atmosphere into seasonalCO2 ice caps during the polar night, and its sublimationduring spring. This cycle triggers various seasonal surfaceprocesses,  such as  cold  gas  jets  and  flows  [2].  CO2 iceacting  as  a  cold  trap  for  water,  this  cycle  has  also  animpact  on  the  water  cycle  on  Mars  [3].  Thecharacterization  of  these  seasonal  deposits  and  theirevolution  appears  as  a  key  to  constrain  the  exchangesbetween  the  surface  and  the  atmosphere,  the  seasonalprocesses and in general the Martian climate. We propose aradiative  transfer  inversion  to  retrieve  quantitatively  thesurface state (composition, grain size, compacity, surfaceroughness…). This method is based on the construction ofa synthetic spectral database, and the comparison of actualCRISM hyperspectral data with it. Method : CRISM dataset. The inversion method presented can beused with any hyperspectral instrument. We chose CRISMon board MRO [4], for its spatial resolution, and targetedobservations,  and  because  it  takes  measurements  of  thesame  place  always  at  the  same  local  solar  time.  Thatallows to follow the evolution of  the surface during theseason, without taking into account daily variations. Thedata is corrected from the atmospheric contributions (gasand aerosols) [5], using pressure prediction for gases [6]and aerosols optical thickness estimations from M. J. Wolff[7].  We  used  for  the  inversion  the   247 CRISMwavelengths within the range 1 µm - 2,6 µm.Direct  model:  synthetic  spectral  database.  The  firststep is to sample the parameters space. The direct model isan  analytic  multi-layer  radiative  transfer  model  [8].  Weconsider a contaminated CO2 ice slab over the regolith (seeon Figure 1). The parameters  to  be  sampled are:  thethickness of the slab, the proportion and grain size of waterice and the proportion of Martian dust in intimate mix inthe slab. We use for water and CO2 the optical constantsestimated  by  B.  Schmitt  and  S.  Douté  [8],  and  wedetermined for the dust a couple of grain size and opticalconstants that is consistent with the orbital data, using aMonte Carlo method based on Shkuratov model [9]. Thedirect  model  computes  high  resolution  spectra,  that  arethen  down  sampled  to  the  resolution  of  CRISMinstrument, using its spectral PSF [4]. We also added thepossibility of a linear mixing within a pixel between thecontaminated  slab  described  above  and  optically  thickdust.  This  mix  describes  the  possibility  of  a  granulardeposit  at  the  surface  as  well  as  a  pixel  composed  ofpatches of ice over the regolith.Figure 1 : Description of the surface model. A slab of CO2ice, contaminated with water ice and dust grains upon theregolith. The free parameters are: the slab thickness, waterice content and grain size, and dust content. Inversion. The inversion consists in the comparison ofa  measure  to  the  whole  database,  using  a  likelihoodfunction L described as :where dsim and dmes are respectively synthetic and measuredspectra, and  C  is a  nb×nb  covariance matrix,  nb being thenumber of spectral bands used. C is the covariance matrixof  the  measured  spectra  we  expect.   In  the  bayesianframework under gaussian hypothesis, it shall represent thestate of uncertainty of the data [10]. C will traduce (i) theuncertainties  of  the  measure  itself  (noise),  (ii)  theuncertainties we expect from the atmospheric corrections(aerosols optical thickness...), and (iii) the uncertainties inthe estimation of the geometry (incidence and emergence),due  to  local  topography.   The  interest  of  using  such  amatrix instead of a much easier least squares method, isthat  the  evaluation  of  the  likelihood  of  a  simulation  isdetermined with a physical criterion, and uncertainties oneach parameters are estimated.Results: We used this method to follow the evolutionof the same CRISM pixel throughout the local spring, untilthe total sublimation of the seasonal ice layer (see Figure2).  This pixel  is  located in Richardson crater dune field(72,0085°S/179,4218°E).  The  preliminary  results  showgood agreement of our look up table with the data.  The1148.pdf

figure 2 shows the CO2 slab thickness as a function of timefor the said pixel. It is decreasing as expected from generalsublimation  of  the  seasonal  cap.  The  Mars  ClimateDatabase [6] gives results of the same order of magnitudebut always larger. That could be due to a local effect ofslope. The results on the slab contents in impurities,  thewater ice grain size and the linear mixing at the surfacewith optically thick dust are also consistent,  and will bediscussed.  Nevertheless,  we  cannot  retrieve  the  slabcontent  in  dust,  its  manifestation being too close  to  theatmospheric aerosols effect.  Figure 2 : Preliminary result showing the evolution of theslab  thickness  throughout  the  local  spring  during  theMartian year 28. The levels of green represent in log scalethe  likelihood  of  the  parameter  value  for  a  givenobservation, the maximum being marked with a circled redcross.Discussion and conclusion: This study shows that ourmethod  is  able  to  retrieve  quantitatively  most  of  thecharacteristics  of  the  icy  surface  with  reasonableuncertainties.  The CRISM data  used for  these  inversionhas been corrected in gas and aerosols using M. J. Wolffestimations for the aerosols optical thickness [5]. It seemsthat  the  atmospheric  aerosols  optical  thickness  issometimes  overestimated  in  our  cases,  resulting  in  aovercorrection of the spectra. The high uncertainty on thedust content in the slab could be improved using a moreprecise method of atmospheric correction. Besides, as thegeometry  of  the  illumination  and  the  measure  has  animportant  impact on the spectrum, it  is  important  to getinformation on the local topography. For a large number ofinversions, it is necessary to have digital terrain models. References :  [1] R.  B.  Leighton  and  B.  C.
