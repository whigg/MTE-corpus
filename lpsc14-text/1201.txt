Introduction: Thermo-physical properties of surface of a small body in the solar system are informative for investigating what the surface condition is like under a low gravity field and why it is so now. In the previous planetary exploration, thermal radiation measurement has been among a method of remote sensing. Recent progress in two dimensional arrayed detector in thermal infrared wavelength enables to take images (or  thermograph) of thermal emission off the surface of small body. Here we present a plan of thermal imaging of C-class asteroid 162173 (1999JU3) by Hayabusa2. Its science objectives, its instrumentation, on-ground calibration, and observation plan are briefly described. Hayabusa2 and the Target Asteroid: Hayabusa2 is the second asteroid sample return mission planned in Japan, which will be launched in December 2014, arrive at asteroid 162173 (1999JU3) in July 2018, depart from asteroid in December 2019 after 1.5 year-long stay for observation and sample collection, and  return to the Earth in December 2020. Although it resembles Hayabusa, the first mission for asteroid sample-return, Hayabusa2 has new payloads such as Small Carry-on Impactor (SCI), the surface lander MASCOT as international collaboration between European community. TIR (Thermal InfraRed imager) is prepared for thermal imaging of asteroid for scientific and operational use. The asteroid 162173 (1999JU3) is classified as a C-class in taxonomy and of relatively rounded shape with about 0.9 km diameter. Its preliminary discintegrated albedo and thermal inertia are about 0.05 and 200-300 Jm-2K-1s-1/2, respectively. Its solar distance is from 0.96 AU (perihelion) to 1.42 AU (aphelion). The rotation axis is not clearly determined so far. Thermal Measurements in Hayabusa2: In Hayabusa2, thermo-physical measurements are planned using TIR as well as radiometer (MARA) on MASCOT. TIR images thermal emission off the sunlit hemisphere of asteroid, complementary to MARA measuring surface radiation through day and night.  In the previous small body missions, thermophysical properties have not well investigated. C-class asteroids are considered less dense (or more porous) in bulk density than S- or V-class asteroids and assumed that they are loosely-bound rubble-pile bodies. Comet 9P/Temple-1 was observed from 1.5 to 4.4 m wavelength during fly-by in Deep Impact mission and discussed about its surface regional variation of thermophysical properties [1]. Temporal profile of thermal emission by asteroid rotation could solve thermophysical properties of each local site more easily, since the peak temperature decreases and the time to reach the peak delays for higher thermal inertia. TIR Imager:  TIR images thermal emission off the asteroid surface in 8-12 m single band. TIR adopts a uncooled micro bolometer array NEC 320A with 328 x 248 pixels. A pair of images with its shutter open and closed is taken. Such on-board data analysis is conducted in DE (Digital Electronics) as summation of multiple images, subtraction between images with shutter open and closed, and data compression. TIR is based on LIR onboard Akatsuki [2], Venus climate orbiter mission. TIR performance is so sensitive to surrounding temperature that temperature of detector is controlled within ± 0.1K by thermo-electric device as well as that of optics is within ± 0.5K by HCE (Heater Control Electronics) in the spacecraft. Characteristic performance of TIR is shown in Table 1.  Objectives of TIR:  To understand the asteroid origin and evolution: Thermo-physical properties indicate the formation and evolution processes of asteroid or in its parent body: the interior exposed inside huge craters, or big boulders standing on the surface. Surface physical condition or size distribution shows its history of asteroid such as past compression or impact process in its parent body, sedimentation or granular flow under microgravity. TIR data is also useful for subtracting thermal radiation from 3 m absorption band which is affected by existence and alteration of hydrated minerals.  To characterize the current state of small body: Yarkovsky or YORP effects which show orbital and rotational evolution of asteroid respectively are caused by thermal effects. Asteroid size and thermal inertia are related based on ground-based observations [3]. TIR images thermal inertia of asteroid, as a 'groundtruth'. Geologic features are sometimes better investigated by thermal infrared rather than optical imagery, especially for those surfaces with different porosity from their surroundings (crater ejecta, veins, grooves, or buried structures). Dust clouds around the asteroid, which might be supplied by electrostatic forces or meteoritic impacts are possibly detected by thermal imaging. Landing site selection: Thermal inertia derived from TIR observations indicates typical particle size of regolith, so that the landing site best suitable for sample collection can be selected from the viewpoint of particle size (ca. 1mm diameter) from Home Position.  Highest temperature ever experienced in history at a given depth is estimated at any site using TIR data, provided that the asteroid past trajectory could be traced. So it is informed what kinds of organic matters are lost or still remain on the asteroid surface. Safe descent operation of spacecraft: It is natural that a high priority is placed in Hayabusa2 to confirm using TIR data whether the solar distance and the surface conditions are suitable or not for conducting safe descent and touchdown operation.  Performance Test and Calibration of TIR: TIR will observe thermal emission off the surface of sunlit hemisphere of asteroid, where the temperature ranges from 250 to 400K. We believe that the surface is like a black body since the thermal emissivity of C-class asteroid is assumed equal to that of carbonaceous chondrites, 0.95 ± 0.03.  We prepared two apparatuses for TIR calibration at lower temperature (220 to 290K) in a vacuum chamber and at higher temperature (290 to 420K) in a clean booth.  Original TIR image has 328 x 248 pixels with 12bits for each pixel and its frame rate is 1/60s, and it can be summed for 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, or 128 images. Typically 128 or 32 summed TIR images are used for the observations at high or low altitude, respectively. In those cases, the summed TIR images are treated as 15 bit data by bit-shifting. TIR has been proven to show good performance from 226 to 423K using a same onboard flat noise pattern data within absolute temperature of ± 1K and NETD of 0.3K, if more than four summed images are taken continuously.  Operations of TIR: From Home Position (20km altitude), TIR globally images the asteroid during an asteroid rotation and construct an asteroid thermal model for the purpose of science, landing site selection, and safe operation assessment. The image sets will be obtained every week to take a trend from various solar distances (0.96 to 1.42 AU) and solar phase angles (20° to +40°). To map polar regions, observation at large phase angle is needed. TIR takes high-resolved asteroid images at lower altitude (1-5km) to obtain detailed thermo-physical properties of geologic features as well as to confirm whether the candidate landing site is favorable. Close-up images will be taken during the descent operation for obtaining a geologic context.  TIR imaging is also carried out for searching and characterizing the impact crater or ejecta formed after SCI impact experiment. TIR will try to image the SCI released from the spacecraft. Ejected dusts are also planned to be traced. Dust environments surrounding the asteroid or tiny orbiting moons will be also taken. References: [1] Davidsson, B et al., 2013, Icarus 213, 154-171.
