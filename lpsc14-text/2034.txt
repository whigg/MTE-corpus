Contact: dirk.elbeshausen@mfn-berlin.de; http://www.isale-code.de  Introduction:   While the formation process of small, bowl-shaped (so-called “simple”) craters is reasonably well understood, the formation of larger craters, which undergo massive modifications, such as gravitational uplift of the crater center and slumping of the rim, is still not fully understood. This is particularly true for the formation of peak ring craters. Various mechanisms for peak ring formation have been suggested for far [1-8]. The most common explanation is the gravitational collapse of a central uplift [1]. Here we study different aspects of peak-ring formation by conducing two- and three-dimensional numerical simulations. The following principal questions are addressed in this study:  • How do peak ring craters form?  • What mechanisms for local and temporary material weakening are suitable to explain peak ring formation?  • How does the impact angle affect this formation process? • How does the target stratigraphy (in particular, the crust/mantle interface) influence the morphology of peak-ring craters, especially during oblique impacts?  Methods: Numerical simulations are carried out with the hydrocode iSALE [9-14], both in 2D by using a cylindrical, axisymmetrical geometry, and in 3D. The code is especially designed to study hypervelocity phenomena and is carefully validated against laboratory experiments [15], analytical data [9,16], and other hydrocodes [17]. In this study we utilize the code to calculate the formation of lunar basins. The numerical results are validated and compared with (i) morphological and morphometrical observations, and (ii) gravity anomalies as derived from the GRAIL mission [18].  The role of strength degradation during peak ring formation:  To explain the formation of complex craters a mechanism for local and temporary material weakening is required. Several mechanisms have been proposed so far. Thus, one focus of this study is to identify a suitable mechanism. One commonly used is the “acoustic fluidization” [19]: Acoustic waves emitted by a meteorite impact cause shaking of the subsurface material which has been fractured by shock release shortly after the impact. This results in a fluidlike rheology and, thus, temporal material weakening. This mechanism is implemented – in a slightly simplified way, using the so-called “block model” [20,21] – in iSALE. Other suggested weakening mechanisms exist, such as frictional melting [22,23]. These different approaches will be tested and their results compared with observations and gravity measurements of GRAIL [18]. This part of the study will provide more detailed insights into the formation mechanism of peak-ring structures and the expected subsurface structure of complex craters – though simplified by neglecting effects of impact angle and target heterogeneities, which are considered in subsequent investigations. The aim is to describe the mechanism of peak-ring formation and to quantify the effect of target properties on the formation process. Besides the properties of the target material, the thickness of layer such as the crustmantle interface, as well as the distribution of temperature, porosity, and strength in the target, might all influence the crater formation. Extensive and systematic numerical studies are performed to quantify these effects.  The influence of the impact angle on peak ring formation:   We investigate how an oblique angle of incidence influences the cratering process of large complex craters by conducting high-resolution 3D simulations of oblique impacts. We systematically vary the angle of incidence while keeping the target conditions constant. The main questions addressed here are: • How does the impact angle influence the crater collapse and especially the collapse of the central uplift (and, thus, the formation of peak rings)? • Are there any asymmetries in the peak-ring structure that can be related to an oblique impact angle? What morphologic features in peak-ring structures exist which are diagnostic for oblique impacts? • How does the impact angle affect the subsurface structure, such as the distribution of molten or damaged material?  Figure 1 Central peak formation after a vertical (top) and an oblique impact. Front face shows tracers colored by their initial depth. The results of 3D-simulations show strong asymmetries within the central peak that are related to an oblique impact angle. How these asymmetries affect the collapse of the central peak and, thus, the formation of a peak-ring-structure is still unknown.  2034.pdf

   Conclusions: Our modeling provides insight into the formation of peak ring structures. We study the formation mechanism and how this is influenced by an oblique angle of incidence and stratigraphy. New constraints on possible weakening mechanisms can be derived by combining numerical simulations with gravity anomalies from the GRAIL mission to Moon [18].

Vertical impact of a 14 km size projectile (ANEOS for granite) at 12 km s-1 into granite target covered by Cretaceous sediments (ANEOS for calcite) of 3 km thickness. Dunite has been used to approximate the mantle material. A strength model for rock [12] has been used for all materials. Acoustic fluidization is implemented through the block-model as described in [20,21] and damage accumulation is calculated with the approach presented in [13].

Collapse of the peak results in the formation of the ring structure.  Right: Tracer particles (right side) colored by peak pressure distribution (0…50 GPa) in the final crater structure.
