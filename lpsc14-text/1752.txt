It permits studying the atmospheric structure, major and minor compounds. The present time version of the calibration [2,3] is limited by the effects of mechanical vibration [4], currently not corrected. We proposed here a new approach to correct for the vibrations based on semiblind deconvolution of the measurements. This new approach shows that a correction can be done efficiently with 85% reduction of the artifacts, in an equivalent manner to the stacking of 10 spectra. It may be applied on the complete PFS dataset, correcting the large-scale perturbation due to microvibrations for each spectrum independently. This approach is validated on actual PFS data of Short Wavelength Channel (SWC), perturbed by microvibrations. More generally, this work may apply to numerically "deshake" Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS), widely used in space experiments or in the laboratory.  Method: Using some mathematical reorganization and simplification, the analytical expression of mechanical vibration due to periodic misalignment and optical path errors can be written as a convolution products in complex form [5,6]:     To estimate the signal from Mars IMars, from the observed spectra IPFS , without knowing the kernel KPFS due to microvibration, we need to perform a blind deconvolution. Our approach is based on cost function that must be minimized [7]:    The first terms represent the data fit, the second the sparsity regularization and the third a smooth regularization. We proposed to minimize the function iteratively by estimating IMars, and KPFS. We use an initial guess of the Martian spectra as the first step and estimate KPFS with the sparsity regularization only. We then estimate IMars with smooth regularization only. The iterative loops between those two steps are performed until to reach convergence (see figure 1).    Figure 1: Scheme of the proposed iterative deconvolution algorithm   Results:  Figure 2 represents the results for the PFS spectra ORB0032 # 106 in the useful domain, not perturbed by the laser line (0 to 5000 cm-1). This spectrum is taken as an example due to its high level of perturbation. The artifacts, called "ghosts", are pointed by arrows in the raw spectra (at the top). Ghosts features are significantly removed by 85% and the noise standard deviation is reduced from 0.17 to 0.07. To reach the same level of ghosts removal, a stacking of 10 spectra raw is required. Figure 3 represents the results in the laser line domain (5000 to 8330 cm-1), where the microvibrations artifact of the reference laser line occur. The laser line modulated through filter, aliasing and vibration kernel KP F S �(desired spectra) (noise) �(acquisition data) IMars IP F S (instrument) Figure 3: Modelisation of acquisition by the PFS instrument The assumption of a reduced wavenumber domain is valid in first approximation due to the sentitivity of the detector and the typical Martian signal, leading to a misfit factor of x0.8 to x1.2 that is reasonable for this case. In addition, our strategy is to use blind deconvolution algorithm, without a priori shape of the spectra, in order to ensure the best fit any kind of spectra. This way, the wavenumber domain of significant signal has not to be defined explicitely. Including to our model an additive noise � which stands for the others sources of acquisition noise besides the mechanical vibrations and the error due to our PFS modelisation by a convolution kernel KPFS , PFS spectra in signal domain as illustrated in Fig. 3, are obtained through: IPFS(σ) = IMars(σ) � KPFS(σ) + � . (5) 2.1.2. Laser line domain (5000 to 8330 cm−1) Unfortunately, from the laser line domain it is not possible to realize an inversion to estimate KPFS because there is twice unknown variables in comparison to known variable due to aliasing. Under strong hypothesis, it is possible to estimate an approximation of K̂approxPFS [11]. Nevertheless, the recent analytical formulation of the mechanical effects on the laser line, allows us to compute the exact effect of the mechanical vibration on the laser line, knowing the vibration kernel KPFS (see complex expression in [11]). After the estimation of KPFS , one simple test of coherence would be to compare the observed laser line ghost to the one predicted. 6Figure 2: Model of acquisition by the PFS instrument 2.2. Inversion From the direct model of the PFS instrument described above, see Eq. (5), we propose here a semi-blind deconvolution method to solve the inverse problem: estimation of the desired spectra IMars from the PFS spectra IPFS although the convolution kernel KPFS is unknown. We qualified our method as semi-blind because the only spectral a priori information is Î0Mars, known ab initio. We also used two a priori information : ÎMars is smooth and K̂PFS is sparse. The notation X̂,means the estimation of quantity X. A classical approach consists in introducing a cost function C whose minimum provides an estimation: ÎMars, K̂PFS = argmin IMars,KP F S C(IMars, KPFS) = argmin IMars,KP F S 12 �IPFS −KPFS � IMars�22 + λK�KPFS�1 + λMars 2�D � IMars�22 . (6) Three terms appear in C 1. A data fit term 12�IPFS − KPFS � IMars� 22 that quantifies how well the estimated sources match the measured data. This term takes into account the characteristics of the noise supposed to be white and gaussian. This data match term is sensitive to high frequency noise and must be balanced with regularization term which corresponds to a mathematical prior on the expected solution (Idier, 2008). 2. A sparsity regularization term �KPFS�1 is chosen for the kernel, i.e. : the �1 norm (sum absolute value) of the kernel must be low. Indeed, the PFS kernel is supposed to be composed with few diracs at mechanical vibration frequencies. 3. A smooth regularization term is chosen for the Mars spectra : �D�IMars�22, where D is a discrete first-order derivation operator. This prior promotes smooth solution in order to avoid noise improvement. All these terms are balanced with two hyperparameters λK and λMars , both positive. The functional 6 is convex for each variables - convex in IMars when KPFS is fixed and vice versa - but not from the couple (IMars, KPFS). The 5 is compatible with the observation. The L2 distance is relatively small (∼ 0.013).  In addition, a complete ab initio approach allows us to estimate the vibration frequencies from different sources: reaction wheels, Inertia Measurement Units and PFS eigenmodes. Thanks to telemetry data from ESA, it is possible to estimate the frequencies of reaction wheels for ORB0032, spectra No 106 at 56.7 Hz, 33.3 Hz, 40.6 Hz and 30.3 Hz. Astrium technical specification of MEx states that the IMU dithering onboard MEx are at 513.9 Hz, 564.3 Hz and 617.4 Hz. The PFS eigenmodes are around 135 Hz and 160 Hz. Not all of these micro-vibration frequencies are expected to be active, depending on the relative phase. Figure 3 represents the ab initio expectation of the micro-vibration effect on the laser line in gray color. The four main picks are compatible with ab initio informations, but also smaller picks.

The microvibrations effect on the laser line computed ab initio using telemetry is in gray.  Discussion and conclusion: We described the approximated direct problem and an algorithm able to correct for the mechanical vibration of the PFS instrument. For the first time, we show that it is possible to reduce significantly the ghosts from the observed signal from 3-5 % of the total energy to 0.4-0.7 %. Our estimation is coherent using three quantities: ghosts in the signal domain, laser line ghosts, distance to approximated kernel. Thus the global shape of PFS SWC spectra can be corrected with our algorithm, allowing to better estimate temperature, and thermal profile on each PFS measurement, improving the few % of spectra with high χ2 that could not be processed with current calibration. Also, our correction may avoid the continuum removal step in the minor species retrieval. When the signal to noise ratio is high enough, our correction will also reduce the stacking procedure. In the future, we would like to propose an algorithm to correct the complete archive that would require: efficient algorithm, timesaving implementation, and fully automatic procedure. Also, new correction procedure must be developed to treat the whole orbits currently available (>6400 at the date of writing).  Reference: [1] Formisano, V., et al. (2005) PSS 53 (10), 963-974.
