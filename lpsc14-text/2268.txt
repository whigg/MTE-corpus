KAGUYA TERRAIN CAMERA MOSAICS.  C. Isbell1, L. Gaddis1, P. Garcia1, T. Hare1, and M. Bailen1, 1U.S. Geological Survey, Astrogeology Science Center, 2255 N. Gemini Dr., Flagstaff, AZ  86001 (cisbell@usgs.gov).   Introduction:  Scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Science Center have compiled and are releasing multiple near-global mosaics derived from data acquired by the Selenological and Engineering Explorer (SELENE) "Kaguya" Terrain Camera (TC) instrument. These five mosaics were produced at 4096 pixels/degree (7.4 meter spatial resolution) and include two versions each of both low-sun Morning (early or right-to-left lowangle solar illumination) and Evening (late or left-toright solar illumination) illuminations, along with a merged best-of "Ortho" version, a Kaguya team term indicating  simulated vertical illumination. Kaguya Mission and Objectives: The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) launched the SELENE or so-called "Kaguya" spacecraft to the Moon in September 2007. The mission ended in June 2009 with data collection and mapping efforts resulting in "the largest lunar exploration project since the Apollo program" [1]. The high-performance optical TC, a 10-meter spatial resolution stereo-camera, was part of the Lunar Imager/Spectrometer (LISM) instrument suite [2], along with the Multi-band Imager (MI, 20 m/pixel; [3]) and Spectral Profiler (SP; [4]). Objectives for the TC instrument included production of global, high-resolution, high-contrast mosaicked map-projected tiles of the Moon [5, 1]. Two Morning and two Evening illumination near-global tile sets were released by the SELENE team; the second set was a spatially redundant but improved version, with increased image coverage and fewer mis-registrations and image offsets. The Morning tile sets cover ~88% of the lunar surface and the Evening sets provide ~89% spatial coverage. In addition, a global orthographic or "Ortho" product is available; the latter has been gapfilled with MI data to achieve ~95% global coverage. These tile sets are the source data for the five mosaics described here. Source Data Compilation:  We retrieved source tiles from the online Kaguya archive system (l2db.selene.darts.isas.jaxa.jp). For each near-global product, 3x3-degree mosaicked tiles (7,200 nominal count) are available in map-projected form at a 4096 pixels/degree (~7.4 m/pixel) mapping resolution. The tiles are spatially co-registered to the Kaguya global Digital Terrain Model (DTM) [6].  Mosaic Generation and Product Description:  The Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers (ISIS) [7] along with local compute and storage cluster configurations were used to generate the products. Each mosaic is presented in Simple Cylindrical projection with a 16-bit image array sized at 1,474,560 samples by 737,280 lines and requires ~2 TB digital storage. Access and download of select smaller sized regions and reduced resolution versions are described below (see Product Availability). The following paragraphs provide brief product descriptions. TC Morning (v2 & v4). Map-projected mosaicked TC data taken under east solar azimuth illumination conditions. Each pixel has reflectance value for incidence, emission, and phase angles of 30, 0, 30 degrees, respectively. Coverage consists of 6,371 (v2) and 7,200 (v4) available tiles from the 7,200 possible tiles. TC Evening (v2 & v4). Map-projected mosaicked TC data taken with west solar azimuth conditions. Each pixel has reflectance value for incidence, emission, and phase angles of 30, 0, 30 degrees, respectively. Coverage consists of 6,409 (v2) and 7,200 (v4) available tiles from the 7,200 possible tiles. TC Ortho (v2). Map-projected mosaic of appropriate TC ortho data from plural DTM TC Ortho products. TC ortho pixel values are in radiance units. Although all 7,200 tiles are available, coverage within each tile can contain data gaps. Science Impact and Relevance:  With Kaguya DTM coregistration, the source tiles match very well with the positions of the Apollo Lunar Retroreflector array (-17 to 5 m longitude, -20 to 48 m latitude, 3 to 5 m elevation; [6]). Quality of registration, high spatial resolution, and image clarity are impressive and these data provide excellent complements to color data such as those from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Wide Angle Camera (LROC WAC) and the Clementine Ultraviolet/Visible (UVVIS) mosaic products for geologic studies, mapping, and morphologic and structural analyses of the lunar surface. One of the primary goals for the Kaguya mission was to augment the high-resolution image data available for the lunar surface, particularly the far side. At 10 m/pixel globally, the TC data effectively bridge the resolution gap between the LROC WAC (100 m/pixel) and the LROC NAC (~1 m/pixel) data and thus they provide invaluable contextual information. The data have enabled discoveries of relatively small lunar features such as lava-tube skylights [8], small impact craters used to determine relative age [9], lack of exposed ice at Shackleton crater (lunar south pole, [1]) and mare eruption ages [10].   Availability of the global TC data will greatly facilitate a wide variety of 2268.pdf

lunar studies, including relative and absolute chronology (e.g., crater counting), geologic mapping, structural analyses, site characterization, etc. to better understand the Moon's geologic record. The low-sun and dual-illumination TC data provide unmatched morphologic information that support geologic and feature mapping at local to regional scales (~1:50,000 to ~1:250,000). The availability of coverage at multiple illuminations (e.g., Figure 1) will help to ensure that any given site can be studied.  Product Availability:  The Astrogeology Science Center has developed a cartographic catalogue or data portal called Astropedia [11], through which the TC mosaics, along with other cartographic and science products are available. Delivery of the Kaguya TC mosaics through this system allows access at select scales and coverages and provides products in the primary ISIS format. The TC products are searchable via the "Moon" link at the primary catalogue site (astrogeology.usgs.gov/search), or directly at astrogeology.usgs.gov/maps/moon-kayuga-tc-globalmosaic. To facilitate additional user-defined parameters such as extent clipping, map re-projection, and file conversion, we intend also to provide these products via a recently developed mapping interface called Map-A-Planet 2 (MAP2) [12]. Through this interface, additional image format output capability is planned (e.g., PNG, JPEG, GeoTiff, GeoJPEG2000, and PDS).
