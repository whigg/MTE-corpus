Introduction: A planet's topography at the surface and subsurface can provide clues to resolve unknown aspects of the planet's evolution. Since in situ measurements of the heat flux on Venus are not yet possible, modeling - particularly lithospheric modeling - has played an important role in unraveling the mystery of the planet's thermal history. Previous works have used the evolution of the topography of large craters to study the thermal evolution of the planetary bodies [15]. While the surface of Venus lacks numerous large craters, Mead Basin, with a diameter of ~270 km (the largest crater on this planet), is the best target for our current study. Here, we investigate the viscoelastic relaxation of Mead at the surface and subsurface. The mantle is uplifted beneath large craters that form on terrestrial planets [e.g., 6]. After a large impact, the formation of an unstable transient crater is followed by gravitational collapse, uplifting the mantle [7]. Thus, while a depression is created at the surface, the crust-mantle boundary is uplifted to a point of near isostatic equilibrium with the surface basin [e.g., 7, 8]. Sufficiently high temperatures within the lower crust plus the pressure gradient due to the crustal thickness variation might cause lower crustal flow [1, 2]. Lower crustal flow displaces the material laterally through the lower crust and reduces the mantle topography. Loss of buoyancy then leads to the transfer of the support of topography to the lithosphere. As the lithosphere flexes upward in response, the surface basin undergoes shallowing. This process is very sensitive to the thickness of the flow channel, to the viscosity of the material in the lower crust (which is a function of temperature), and to the rheology of the crust and mantle. In this study, we constrain the background heat flux of Venus in the vicinity of Mead in the epoch immediately after its formation. Using the fact that the relaxation is sensitive to the rheology, we also constrain the rheology of the crust and mantle materials. Method: We investigate the relaxation of the crustmantle boundary beneath Mead because it is the only crater sufficiently large to be resolved in current gravity models of Venus (reliable resolution of 125-150 km). Indeed, the study of Banerdt et al. [9] showed that there is no (or limited) topography at the crustmantle boundary; this observation could be an indication of the near complete relaxation of the mantle topography due to lower crustal flow. Here, we use the Marc finite element package to simulate the deformation of Mead at the surface and subsurface [1, 2]. We apply a 2-layer axisymmetric mesh of one radial plane, with surface topography (the surface depression, rim, and ejecta blanket) and topography at the crust-mantle boundary underneath the crater depression. In our mesh, a nominally 30-km thick crust with a density of 2900 kg m-3 sits over the mantle with a density of 3300 kg m-3. The number of elements in our meshes reaches up to 40000. Construction of the mesh is followed by a thermal simulation, the results of which are input into a mechanical simulation. Thermal Simulation. Here, we perform a steadystate conductive simulation that finds the equilibrium between the surface temperature of 740 K, a specified background heat flux, and a constrained temperature at the crust-mantle boundary. In order to approximate the impact heat, we fix the temperature of the uplifted mantle underneath the crater to that of the mantle far from the basin. This action leads to isotherm uplift and serves as a proxy for the impact heat. The crust and mantle have thermal conductivities of 2.5 and 4 W m-1 K-1. This thermal solution determines the temperature field, which is piped into the mechanical simulation. Mechanical Simulation. Here, we fix the nodes at the bottom of the mesh and set the side nodes to be free-slip. A gravitational acceleration equal to that of Venus (8.87 m s-2) is applied to the entire mesh. In our simulations, we employ a viscoelastic rheology with no plasticity, as brittle failure is a minor (to nonexistent) contributor to the relaxation of a crater [1, 2]. We apply typical values of the elastic moduli consistent with the terrestrial planets. The Poisson's ratio is nominally 0.25, while the Young's moduli are 70 and 150 GPa for the crust and mantle, respectively [10, 11]. However, in order to fix the problem of the selfcompaction of the material under its own weight, we increase the Poisson's ratio to be very close to the incompressibility limit of 0.5. To preserve the flexural rigidity of the lithosphere, the Young's moduli are then decreased by a factor of 0.8 [11]. For the viscous behavior of the materials, we test the various parameters of both wet and dry rheologies [12-14] for the crust and mantle. We run the simulations for a time frame of 100 Myr [see 1, 2], and constrain the minimum viscosity of the material to 1021 Pa s-1, hence keeping the running time of the simulations tractable. Results: Our success criterion is to compare the current mantle topography with the simulated one. Surface topography is of secondary value, because it is subject to change due to surficial processes (e.g., infill ing from volcanic material). Since the topography at the crust-mantle boundary is eliminated (or very limited), we search for the background heat flux that relaxes the mantle topography to a very high degree. Phillips and Hansen [15] stated that the recent background heat flux of Venus is in the range of 36-55 mW m-2. In our simulations with a crustal thickness of 30 km and dry rheologies, the crust-mantle boundary only relaxes to this degree with a background heat flux of more than 75 mW m-2. In contrast, simulations using wet rheologies demonstrate near complete relaxation not only for the crust-mantle boundary but also for the surface topography, even for the lowest heat fluxes considered. Discussion: The rheology of the material can be an indication of the volatile content of the crust and mantle. In this study, we apply both wet and dry rheologies to the crust and mantle of Venus. In our simulations, the wet crustal rheology of Caristan [12] not only reduces the entire topography of the crust-mantle boundary, but also leaves no topography at the surface, which is not consistent with the current surface topography of Mead Basin. This result indicates that the wet rheology is not suitable. Additionally, we test the two rheologies for dry Maryland and dry Columbia diabases [13] for the crust. The simulations with the stiffer Maryland diabase require an unreasonably high heat flux to yield enough deformation equal to the current mantle topography. Hence, the dry Columbia diabase, which yields enough deformation under a more reasonable heat flux, seems to be the most appropriate rheology for the crust. Similarly, the flow rule of a dry peridotite for the mantle rheology is preferred to a wet peridotite. Phillips and Hansen [15] stated that around 1 Ga, the average surface temperature of Venus was higher than at present, possibly up to 1000 K. Therefore, we test higher surface temperatures. The results of our study indicate that the final topography at the surface and subsurface is sensitive to large differences in surface temperature. For these higher surface temperatures, the relaxation at the surface and subsurface increases. Thus, the required heat flux for the reduction of the topography to the current state becomes smaller. Various studies have estimated the average Venusian crustal thickness to be ~30 km [e.g., 16, 17]. The surface of Venus is covered mostly with volcanic deposits and superposed tectonic features [18]. Thus, vertical crustal accretion and regional tectonism appear to be the dominant surficial processes. Mead, whose floor is covered by volcanic materials, is located in an area that is surrounded by coronae. Since the thickness of the crust is variable [17], we test different crustal thickness values of 35 and 40 km. We find that the final results of our simulations are sensitive, to a certain degree, to the crustal thickness values. As the crustal thickness increases, the background heat flux required to relax the crust-mantle boundary decreases. The minimum required background heat flux for cases with thicker crusts of 35 and 40 km is 70 and 65 mW m-2, respectively, compared to the 75 mW m-2 needed for a 30 km crust. All these values are significantly higher than the previous estimates from thermal models [e.g., 15]; however, this could simply reflect a regional variation in the global heat flux. With more candidate craters, this method could be useful to determine the thermal history of Venus with a better spatial and temporal distribution than other methods, such as we have done for Mars [1, 2]. However, higher resolution gravity data is needed, which in turn requires lower flying spacecraft, a real difficulty considering Venus's thick atmosphere. Thus while we cannot trace the evolution of Venus, we can use Mead to help constrain it. References: [1] Karimi et al. (2012) 43rd LPSC, Abstract# 2712. [2] Karimi M. and Dombard A. J.
