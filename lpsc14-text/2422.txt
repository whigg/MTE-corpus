Introduction:  Volcanic flows emplaced to the east of Lichtenberg crater include some of the youngest basalts on the Moon [1-3].  Remote measurements indicate that these and other high-titanium basalts on the western nearside have different mineralogies than older lunar maria [e.g. 4-6].  The stratigraphy and mineralogy of basalts surrounding Lichtenberg are investigated here using Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) spectral data as part of a larger study of late-stage mare volcanism in Oceanus Procellarum and Mare Imbrium [7,8].          Background: The observation that basalts embay the eastern margins of the bright-rayed crater Lichtenberg led to their early identification as relatively young products of lunar volcanism [9] as well as estimates for their emplacement as recently as 1 Ga [1].  Crater dating has resulted in somewhat older age estimates of 1.7 Ga [2] and 2.1 Ga [3] for these basalts which still place them among the youngest dated flows on the Moon.  Compositional and spectroscopic studies of these and other late-stage high-titanium basalts also indicate that they have very high iron contents [5,6] and may contain unusually high abundances of olivine [4,5,7].  The unique age and inferred mineralogy of these basalts relative to lunar samples, their location within the Procellarum KREEP terrain and stratigraphic relationship to Lichtenberg makes this region an important site for studies of the Moon's volcanic history.  Data:  M3 acquired visible to near-infrared reflectance data at spatial and spectral resolutions capable of measuring discrete basaltic flows within the lunar maria.  For this study, a large mosaic of global-mode M3 data has been created at its full spectral and spatial resolution using over 30 orbits of data from optical periods 1B and 2A.  This data covers the wavelength range of ~0.43 to 3.0ms in 85 spectral bands at a spatial resolution of 140 m/pixel.  The mosaic incorporates the final PDS delivered reflectance calibrations [10, 11] as well as more recent photometric corrections [12].  An additional M3 targeted observation of Lichtenberg with 10nm spectral resolution and 70m/pixel spatial resolution has also been examined.  LROC and Selene topographic data and images are also being used to further examine the stratigraphy and geologic setting of this region.   Results and Discussion:  The youngest basalts (labelled "a" in Fig. 2) are dated at 1.68 Ga by [2] and are observed to embay the raised terrain and ejecta of Lichtenberg crater in the M3 target data (Fig. 3).  The   Figure 1: M3 mosaic showing large-scale spectral units surrounding the 20km wide crater Lichtenberg (white box and Fig. 3).  Stratigraphically younger flows (outlined in white) appear as redder hues due to weaker 2m ferrous bands relative to absorptions at 1m while feldspathic materials appear blue.  Red=1m Integrated Band Depth (IBD), green=2m IBD, blue= 1.58m.  Figure 2:  M3 mosaic of study region shown at 2.78m in which high-titanium basalts appear dark.  Letters indicate mare units discussed in the text; dashed lines mark additional spectral boundaries (boundaries within the low-titanium maria are not indicated here). a b c d e 50 km 50 km  eastern slope of Lichtenberg has similar spectral properties to optically mature regions of the older low titanium basalts where it meets the younger high-titanium flows.  M3 spectra of a basalt outcrop within the crater wall also appear consistent with fresh exposures of the surrounding low-titanium basalts as previously mapped by [13].  Brighter feldspathic materials, appearing blue in Figure 3, are deposited directly around the rim and primarily to the northwest, consistent with the interpretation of primary materials causing the persisting brightness of these rays rather than optical maturity [14].  Evidence for flow boundaries within unit A are observed in the M3 data (smaller dashed line in Fig. 2) indicating that this spectral unit is composed of multiple volcanic events with stratigraphically younger basalts east of the flows that embay Lichtenberg.  Boundaries within the southern portion of this unit (below the curved dashed line in Fig. 2) appear partially obscured by the extensive rays of the farside Ohm crater that cross this region.   M3 spectra of optically immature craters in the youngest high-titanium flows (unit a) and the stratigraphically older unit b (dated at 2.76 Ga by [2]) have been presented previously by the authors [7].  Craters within these basalts display broader and longer wavelength absorptions at 1 m and significantly weaker 2 m absorptions than the older surrounding low titanium basalts (unit e) consistent with higher olivine to pyroxene ratios [7].   Not anticipated from previous studies was the identification of two small regions of basalts adjacent to these youngest units with somewhat lower (moderate) inferred titanium contents but spectral properties indicating similarly increased concentrations of olivine (regions c and d in Fig. 2).  Figure 4 compares spectra of mare craters within unit c to the youngest and most olivine-rich basalts identified in the high-titanium flows (unit a) as well as mare craters from the surrounding low titanium basalts (unit e).  Optically immature craters from unit c lack significant pyroxene absorptions at 2m while displaying a very strong long wavelength 1m absorption consistent with olivine despite having a higher albedo, brighter continuum and somewhat lower UV/VIS ratio.  Comparison to Clementine UV/VIS and albedo images also indicate lower titanium and opaque contents in these mare soils.  Unit d, dated at 2.9 Ga by [2], is more variable and appears to have a large degree of vertical and lateral mixing with small craters displaying reflectance properties consistent with both olivine-rich materials as well as more typical pyroxene rich basalts.  Future work will apply quantitative modeling [15, 16] to the spectra of optically immature craters from these various basalts to better assess their mineralogy.    Figure 3.
