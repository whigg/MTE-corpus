Future sample return missions, such as Hayabusa-2 [5] and OSIRIS-REx [6] are currently planned.  The link between remote sensing, in-situ and sample return science can be achieved with multiple landings and in-situ measurements over a variety of asteroid terrains. An agile, lightweight, highly capable mobile platform is desirable [7]. The German Aerospace Centre (DLR) is currently developing in collaboration with CNES and ISAS/JSPEC/JAXA a lander (MASCOT) in the class of a nanosatellite for the Hayabusy-2 mission.  With a total mass of ~ 10kg, MASCOT carries four scientific instruments [8]: a camera (DLR), a hyperspectral microscopic imager (IAS), a magnetometer (TU Braunschweig) and a radiometer (DLR). The payload cumulatively weights ~3kg. Once landed in 2018/19 on the C-type asteroid, (162173) 1999 JU3, the four instruments will study in-situ its surface morphology and geological setting, its regolith structure, texture and composition, the thermal and magnetic properties of the surface on 2-3 landing sites, enabled by MASCOT's ability to hop across the asteroid.   Lander Concept:   The MASCOT bus has a total volume of about 0,3 x 0,3 x 0,2 m3. The structure is of lightweight carbon fibre sandwhich framework [9] supporting the payloads (P/L), a common electronic box and the passive thermal control surfaces and the antennae for communication during surface operation. To upright itself into correct instrument orientation and to perform relocation via hopping on the asteroid surface, MASCOT is equipped with a mobility mechanism [10] and a suite of GNC sensors.  Control, housekeeping, autonomy, data handling and local processing power are provided by a redundant on-board computer (OBC). Power is supplied by primary battery via a redundant power subsystem (PCDU). The design goal is to operate up to two asteroid days (one asteroid day is ~7,5 h) on the surface. Communications to Earth is established via relay by the mothership. Due to the short duration of surface operations (<16hrs), the amount of direct telemetry to and control commands from Earth is extremely limited, requiring almost complete autonomy of the lander. During cruise and the first phase of target reconnaissance, MASCOT is carried in a mechanical and electrical support structure (MESS) attached to the HY-2 spacecraft. Within this time MASCOT is mostly inactive; thermal control and power supply for incruise operations are provided by the mothership.   Figure 1: CAD model of MASCOT inkl. PL and S/S    Mission Concept:   The interplanetary cruise will take approximately 4 years, with MASCOT nominally off except for commissioning and periodic monitoring and calibration activities. After arrival at (162173) 1999JU3, Hayabusa-2 (HY-2) will first perform a global mapping in order to characterise the asteroid, and also to assist with landing site selection for it's sample return touchdown and MASCOT deployment. With the landing site selected (based on local geology and thermal constraints), MASCOT will be released to the surface, either during a dedicated descent or during one of the sampling touchdown rehearsals. HY-2 will descend to the seperation altitude of 100 m at which point MASCOT will get ejected via a spring mechanism. The lander will fall to the asteroid surface under the effects of the weak gravity field, before touch-down in an unknown orientation.  2601.pdf

The descent to the asteroid after ejection will take approximately 20mins, with communications to Hayabusa-2 maintained throughtout. If possible, MASCOT will also take camera images of the asteroid during descent.    Figure 2: Sketch of Separation & surface operation concept  Once landed, the highest priority of MASCOT is to upright and perform the scientific measurements. After completion of the first science cycle, the lander will relocate and start the 2nd science cycle.  References:  [1] Soderblom, L.A. et al. (2002) Science, 296, 1087-1091. [2] Yeomans D.K. et al.
