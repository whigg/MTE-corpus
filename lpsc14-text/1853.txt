DH1 3LE, UK (v.r.eke@durham.ac.uk), 2BAER, NASA Ames Research Center, MS 245-3, Moffett Field, CA 94035, USA The distribution of volatile molecules in permanently shaded polar craters remains a topic of great interest. Knowing what is squirreled away in these extremely cold regions would both provide an inventory of what was delivered to the inner solar system over billions of years and potentially provide a valuable resource for future explorers. One technique that provides information about the composition and structure of the near-surface regolith is radar. Both Mini-SAR on Chandrayaan-1 and Mini-RF on LRO transmitted circularly polarised 13.6cm radar at the Moon and coherently sensed two orthogonal linear polarisations of the reflected signal, allowing a full reconstruction of the Stokes parameters of the returned radiation. In this way, maps have been constructed of the ratio of returned power in the same sense of circular polarisation as transmitted to the opposite sense. Large values of this Circular Polarisation Ratio (CPR) can imply the presence of low-loss icy surfaces. There have been disparate interpretations of radar reflectivity data for the Moon. Clementine discovered a high CPR return from the lunar south pole, but the inference of the presence of a significant amount of reasonably pure water ice [1] was called into question by subsequent analyses. These showed high CPR regions where water ice would not be stable and hence concluded that rough surfaces were most likely to be responsible [2]. The north pole CPR mosaic from Mini-SAR has been used to show that fresh craters have high CPR both inside and outside their rims, as would result if surface roughness were responsible [3]. However, a set of "anomalous" polar craters was found that only showed high interior CPR values. Assuming that roughness is weathered away at the same rate inside and outside craters it was suggested that the presence of water ice would naturally explain this observation [3]. Furthermore, the abundance of these anomalous craters was higher at the poles than at lower latitudes [4]. However, Mini-RF data show that non-polar anomalous craters appear indistinguishable in their CPR distributions from polar anomalous craters [5]. Also, LROC images show boulders within and not outside the rims of the non-polar anomalous craters [5]. Topographical data from the LOLA experiment and surface temperatures inferred from the Diviner radiometer will be used to shed light on what is responsible for the high CPR measurements interior to the anomalous polar craters. Figure 1: The stacked Mini-SAR relative CPR maps for 33 anomalous north pole craters. North is to the top and the map is in terms of crater radius rc. Figure 2: As for Fig. 1, just using the Mini-RF CPR data. Crater CPR maps Using 33 of the previously identified anomalous north pole craters [3], the Mini-SAR and Mini-RF mosaics from the PDS were used to make an average CPR map with north aligned in the +y direction for each crater. The crater radii (rc) were determined from the LOLA   2DEM and crater centres in the CPR mosaics were found by eye for each crater, because the available mosaics were not orthorectified to a consistent base map. Stacking together the crater CPR maps in terms of their mean interior CPR values leads to Figures 1 and 2 for the MiniSAR and Mini-RF data sets respectively. It is apparent that the same craters give rise to very different maps in these two cases. This is because of the different look directions typically being used by the Mini-SAR and MiniRF instruments, coupled with the dependence of CPR on the angle of incidence of the radiation on the surface. Comparison with the LOLA DEM In order to undo the effect of the incidence angle on the CPR maps, one needs to match the radar mosaic to the LOLA DEM. The currently available PDS mosaics are not corrected for radar parallax, an effect that distorts range distances when the surface being viewed is not flat. The impact of this is to delay signals returned from lower parts of the surface, which are thus inferred to be at larger distances from the detector. Consequently, the near walls of craters, which are viewed at larger incidence angles, occupy more than half of the pixels in the craters in an unrectified map. The measured CPR increases with angle of incidence as shown in Figure 3, determined from a CPR mosaic that has been corrected for parallax before matching with the LOLA DEM. This variation means that the distribution of pixel CPR values for the crater interior and exterior should not be the same, even if they have identical compositions and roughnesses. Using CPR mosaics that are unrectified will exacerbate this bias, creating even more "anomalous" craters where no surface differences exist. The measured CPR differences between the insides and outsides of anomalous craters imply more than just differences due to incidence angle effects. Figure 3 shows how the variation of typical CPR with angle of incidence changes with distance from the crater centre out to 1.5 crater radii. The CPR values for the central regions of anomalous craters are indistinguishable from those somewhat outside the crater rims. It is only on the steeper inner walls of the crater where significantly higher CPR values at any given incidence angle are to be found. Other considerations The relatively high CPR regions inside anomalous craters show no strong correlation with the surface temperatures inferred from Diviner measurements. This is not what one would expect if significant deposits of water ice were responsible for the high CPR values. Also, Figure 3: Variation of the median Mini-SAR CPR with incidence angle for the 33 anomalous craters. Different curves show annuli at different cratercentric distances both inside and outside the crater. Errorbars represent the uncertainty on the median curve. the anomalous craters have lower diameter-to-depth ratios than typical craters in the north polar region. This is suggestive that they are relatively young and maintain some "roughness" on the steeper slopes, such as seen for the non-polar anomalous craters [5]. References [1] S. Nozette, C. L.
