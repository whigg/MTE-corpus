On boardLRO is the sensitive UV-spectrograph, LAMP (the Lyman Alpha Mapping Project) that covers the spectralrange 575 to 1965 A˚. LAMP is typically oriented toward the surface in order to map the Moon at these UVwavelengths. However, LAMP can also observe the tenuous lunar atmosphere when the surface is in darkness,but the column of atmosphere below LRO is in sunlight. These "twilight" observations occur twice per orbit, about 11-12 times per Earth day. In a typical orbit,the duration in twilight is about 600 seconds and the observations are concentrated around the north and southpoles of the Moon (latitudes > 80◦). These periods extend to about 3600 seconds, and examine all latitudes,near the solstices. We have used such twilight observations to examine the sparse lunar atmosphere.LAMP has successfully observed the permanentlyshadowed regions [1], observed plumes caused by theLCROSS [2] and GRAIL impacts [3], detected andmeasured variations of He in the Lunar atmosphere[4, 5, 6], detected H2 [7] and provided stringent upperlimits for 27 other species [8].The first compositional analysis of the lunar atmosphere was made in situ with the Lunar AtmosphericComposition Experiment (LACE) mass spectrometerthat was deployed by Apollo 17 [9]. LACE, whichconducted useful operations, primarily during the lunarnights because of count saturation during the lunar daytime, functioned for nine lunations (December 1972 toOctober 1973). Among the masses detected by LACEwere masses 4 and 40 amu, which have been attributedto He and Ar, respectively. Spectroscopic observationsby LAMP have confirmed the presence of atmosphericHe [4]. But until now, LAMP has only been able to provide an Ar upper limit [8].For our analysis, we selected LAMP observations by(i) local time and (ii) latitude of the observations. Thefirst criterion requires that the data be acquired when thesun is between 0 and 15 degrees below the local horizon(i.e. 1 hour equivalent post-sunset or pre-sunrise). Theoriginal detection of mass 40 by LACE showed that thenumber density after sunset is between (0.6-1.0)×104cm−3. This number density slowly declines during thenight as Ar gets adsorbed onto the lunar surface. Arreaches a minimum of a few hundred cm−3 shortly beFigure 1: The average LAMP spectrum since January2012. This spectrum has an effective exposure time of8.2 days. We have removed signals from the reflectedsky and telluric lines, which accounts for 99% of theobserved signal.fore dawn. As sunrise approaches, liberated Ar from thesunlit side begins to interact with the adsorbed Ar whichfrees it from the surface. The Ar number density rapidlyrises to (1-4)×104 cm−3 shortl1y before dawn. Despitethe greater pre-dawn enhancement of Ar, the time average density in the hour before sunrise and after sunsetis 800 cm−3 and 9000 cm−3, respectively. Thus, withLAMP we are more likely to see Ar in the post-duskdata. The second data criterion is selected because recent models of Ar by [10], show that at sunset the Arconcentration is greatest near the equator.Given our selection requirements for the data, our observations are obtained at orbit β angles (the angle between the orbit plane and the vector to the Sun) closeto 90◦. Such alignment occurs twice a year, near Juneand December. At these β angles, LAMP observes thesurface just before dawn and after dusk near the equator.A summed LAMP spectrum from 1020 to 1100 A˚ isshown in Fig. 1. Two features are seen at approximately1052 and 1069 A˚, a few A˚ redward of the expected Arpositions (1048 and 1066 A˚). To date, this is the bestevidence we have available for the detection of Ar using LAMP. We consider this only a suggestive Ar detection because (i) the lines are red shifted 3-4 A˚ fromexpected locations and (ii) the width of each line is nar2788.pdf

However, the lines are separated appropriately andonly appear at post-dusk (as expected based on LACEresults).The tentative detection of Ar after January 2012 iscoincident with a change in LRO's orbit. Prior to thischange, observations near the equator were made at analtitude of 40-65 km. After the change in LRO's orbit,its altitude over the equator was 60-160 km. Therefore,our possible detection after January 2012 might suggestthat Ar is at a larger scale height than anticipated. In[8] we assumed a temperature of 120 K for the atmosphere at night. This corresponds to a scale height of∼15 km for Ar. If Ar is at altitudes > 4×, then thiswould suggest a temperature > 480 K. Therefore, ourpossible detection of Ar just after dusk would suggestwe are possibly seeing the relatively warm part of thepopulation of Ar atoms which have yet to accommodatevia bounces on the cold night surface of the Moon.Assuming the features in Fig. 1 are due to Ar, we examined the data in two different ways. First, we lookedat how the Ar surface density changes for each time βapproached 90◦ since January 2012. We found that theargon features appear in each June period, but are absent in each of the December periods. This finding isshown in Fig. 2. This may suggest that the argon density is variable on timescales of 6 months or less. Thetime scale appears to be in agreement with [10] who examined the evolution of argon after it is released froma single source. They showed the Ar number densityreaches a steady state 70 days after Ar is released.Next, we used our tentative Ar detection to examinethe Ar number density over different ranges of latitude.We binned the LAMP observations into exclusive 20 deFigure 3: Surface density of argon vs. latitude (blackpoints). Latitude bins are 20◦ wide centered at the equator. This plot shows the greatest concentration of Ar islocated near 10◦ S. Red dashed line shows the LACEtime average at post-dusk. Green points are based onmodels from [10] at solar angle 11.25◦ below the horizon.gree latitude bins from 70◦ N to 70◦ S. We found that thepeak emission is very near the equator, perhaps centerednear 10◦ S. We show this in Fig. 3 and compare this tomodels based on [10]. The depletion of Ar toward thelunar poles might suggest that Ar is getting cold trapped,which is also in agreement with predictions by [10].Our tentative detection of Ar using LAMP may be thefirst spectroscopic detection of Ar. We note that thespectral features are not always present in the data, butwe have seen it at two separate observing periods. Eachtime the spectral features were detected, the estimatedAr surface density was similar to, although smaller than,the original LACE detection. We also see that the spectral features are most strongly seen near the lunar equator, or possibly slightly south of it. These findings, alongwith the work of [10], may suggest that Ar originatesfrom a point source that does not continuously releaseAr. In the periods between the release of argon, it canbecome cold trapped.References: [1] Gladstone, G. R., et al. (2012)Journal of Geophysical Research (Planets)117:E00H04. [2] Gladstone, G. R., et al.
