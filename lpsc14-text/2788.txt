On board LRO is the sensitive UV-spectrograph, LAMP (the Lyman Alpha Mapping Project) that covers the spectral range 575 to 1965 Å. LAMP is typically oriented toward the surface in order to map the Moon at these UV wavelengths. However, LAMP can also observe the tenuous lunar atmosphere when the surface is in darkness, but the column of atmosphere below LRO is in sunlight. These "twilight" observations occur twice per orbit, about 11-12 times per Earth day. In a typical orbit, the duration in twilight is about 600 seconds and the observations are concentrated around the north and south poles of the Moon (latitudes > 80◦). These periods extend to about 3600 seconds, and examine all latitudes, near the solstices. We have used such twilight observations to examine the sparse lunar atmosphere. LAMP has successfully observed the permanently shadowed regions [1], observed plumes caused by the LCROSS [2] and GRAIL impacts [3], detected and measured variations of He in the Lunar atmosphere [4, 5, 6], detected H2 [7] and provided stringent upper limits for 27 other species [8]. The first compositional analysis of the lunar atmosphere was made in situ with the Lunar Atmospheric Composition Experiment (LACE) mass spectrometer that was deployed by Apollo 17 [9]. LACE, which conducted useful operations, primarily during the lunar nights because of count saturation during the lunar daytime, functioned for nine lunations (December 1972 to October 1973). Among the masses detected by LACE were masses 4 and 40 amu, which have been attributed to He and Ar, respectively. Spectroscopic observations by LAMP have confirmed the presence of atmospheric He [4]. But until now, LAMP has only been able to provide an Ar upper limit [8]. For our analysis, we selected LAMP observations by (i) local time and (ii) latitude of the observations. The first criterion requires that the data be acquired when the sun is between 0 and 15 degrees below the local horizon (i.e. 1 hour equivalent post-sunset or pre-sunrise). The original detection of mass 40 by LACE showed that the number density after sunset is between (0.6-1.0)×104 cm−3. This number density slowly declines during the night as Ar gets adsorbed onto the lunar surface. Ar reaches a minimum of a few hundred cm−3 shortly beFigure 1: The average LAMP spectrum since January 2012. This spectrum has an effective exposure time of 8.2 days. We have removed signals from the reflected sky and telluric lines, which accounts for 99% of the observed signal. fore dawn. As sunrise approaches, liberated Ar from the sunlit side begins to interact with the adsorbed Ar which frees it from the surface. The Ar number density rapidly rises to (1-4)×104 cm−3 shortl1y before dawn. Despite the greater pre-dawn enhancement of Ar, the time average density in the hour before sunrise and after sunset is 800 cm−3 and 9000 cm−3, respectively. Thus, with LAMP we are more likely to see Ar in the post-dusk data. The second data criterion is selected because recent models of Ar by [10], show that at sunset the Ar concentration is greatest near the equator. Given our selection requirements for the data, our observations are obtained at orbit β angles (the angle between the orbit plane and the vector to the Sun) close to 90◦. Such alignment occurs twice a year, near June and December. At these β angles, LAMP observes the surface just before dawn and after dusk near the equator. A summed LAMP spectrum from 1020 to 1100 Å is shown in Fig. 1. Two features are seen at approximately 1052 and 1069 Å, a few Å redward of the expected Ar positions (1048 and 1066 Å). To date, this is the best evidence we have available for the detection of Ar using LAMP. We consider this only a suggestive Ar detection because (i) the lines are red shifted 3-4 Å from expected locations and (ii) the width of each line is nar mailto: jccook@boulder.swri.edu Figure 2: Surface density of argon vs. time. LAMP has seen a variable abundance of Ar in the lunar atmosphere going from near LACE levels to statistically zero in the span of 6 months. rower than expected (∼10 Å vs. 28 Å FWHM for a filled slit). However, the lines are separated appropriately and only appear at post-dusk (as expected based on LACE results). The tentative detection of Ar after January 2012 is coincident with a change in LRO's orbit. Prior to this change, observations near the equator were made at an altitude of 40-65 km. After the change in LRO's orbit, its altitude over the equator was 60-160 km. Therefore, our possible detection after January 2012 might suggest that Ar is at a larger scale height than anticipated. In [8] we assumed a temperature of 120 K for the atmosphere at night. This corresponds to a scale height of ∼15 km for Ar. If Ar is at altitudes > 4×, then this would suggest a temperature > 480 K. Therefore, our possible detection of Ar just after dusk would suggest we are possibly seeing the relatively warm part of the population of Ar atoms which have yet to accommodate via bounces on the cold night surface of the Moon. Assuming the features in Fig. 1 are due to Ar, we examined the data in two different ways. First, we looked at how the Ar surface density changes for each time β approached 90◦ since January 2012. We found that the argon features appear in each June period, but are absent in each of the December periods. This finding is shown in Fig. 2. This may suggest that the argon density is variable on timescales of 6 months or less. The time scale appears to be in agreement with [10] who examined the evolution of argon after it is released from a single source. They showed the Ar number density reaches a steady state 70 days after Ar is released. Next, we used our tentative Ar detection to examine the Ar number density over different ranges of latitude. We binned the LAMP observations into exclusive 20 deFigure 3: Surface density of argon vs. latitude (black points). Latitude bins are 20◦ wide centered at the equator. This plot shows the greatest concentration of Ar is located near 10◦ S. Red dashed line shows the LACE time average at post-dusk. Green points are based on models from [10] at solar angle 11.25◦ below the horizon. gree latitude bins from 70◦ N to 70◦ S. We found that the peak emission is very near the equator, perhaps centered near 10◦ S. We show this in Fig. 3 and compare this to models based on [10]. The depletion of Ar toward the lunar poles might suggest that Ar is getting cold trapped, which is also in agreement with predictions by [10]. Our tentative detection of Ar using LAMP may be the first spectroscopic detection of Ar. We note that the spectral features are not always present in the data, but we have seen it at two separate observing periods. Each time the spectral features were detected, the estimated Ar surface density was similar to, although smaller than, the original LACE detection. We also see that the spectral features are most strongly seen near the lunar equator, or possibly slightly south of it. These findings, along with the work of [10], may suggest that Ar originates from a point source that does not continuously release Ar. In the periods between the release of argon, it can become cold trapped. References: [1] Gladstone, G. R., et al. (2012) Journal of Geophysical Research (Planets) 117:E00H04. [2] Gladstone, G.
