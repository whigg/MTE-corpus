Introduction: The Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission accurately determined the gravity field of the Moon [1]. Analyses of the GRAIL mission data found a value for the lunar gravity field coefficient S21 that exceeded its uncertainty [2,3,4]. A small nonzero S21 means that the principal axes of the moment of inertia matrix are not quite aligned with the reference frame. The misalignment is an order-of-magnitude larger than the frame-generating fits to Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) data indicate [5,6]. A non-spherical shape for the inner and outer core boundaries can explain the discrepancy. In conjunction with lunar models, the S21 value is used to calculate the associated core shape and interior gravity field.  A pole-to-equator flattening of both core boundaries is expected. LLR analysis detects core flattening and other geophysical parameters [6,7] by their affect on the time-varying orientation, the physical librations.  Like the S21 coefficient, finite values of C21 and S22 would imply that the principal axes were misaligned. GRAIL-determined values for both of these coefficientts are smaller and less certain than S21.  Principal Axes: The principal axes of the external gravity field coincide with those of the whole Moon. The Moon has a fluid outer core and the boundaries of that cavity have shape. The principal axes of the outer core may not be aligned with the principal axes of the solid Moon (crust + mantle + inner core). The torques on the solid Moon depend on the whole-Moon gravity field, but the dynamical response orienting the solid Moon depends on the moment of inertia matrix of the solid Moon with its associated principal axes. This distinction has not been considered in past analyses.  The GRAIL analyses, by Konopliv et al. [2] at JPL and Lemoine et al. [3,4] at GSFC, used numerically integrated physical librations, a file of 3-axis orientation vs. time, with initial conditions and many geophysical parameters derived from analysis of LLR data. The three analyses used the numerically integrated physical librations from DE421 [5]. The LLR determination of the principal axis directions for DE421 are thought to be uncertain by about 0.2" [5,6]. The more recent DE430 file [6] was used for analyses by Konopliv et al. [8]. It benefits from a GRAIL-derived gravity field and its axes are uncertain by about 0.1". However, both integrations set C21, S21, and S22 equal to zero, implicitly assuming that the principal axes of the outer core and the whole-Moon were aligned.  Geometrical and Dynamical Rotations: The unnormalized S21 values determined by Konopliv et al. [2,8] and Lemoine et al. [3,4] were about 1.3x10–9. The C21 and S22 values were an order-of-magnitude smaller than S21. By contrast, degree-2 combinations J2 – 2C22 = 1.58x10–4 and J2 + 2C22 = 2.48x10–4 are 5 orders-ofmagnitude larger than S21 and 6 orders-of-magnitude larger than the C21 and S22 values.  What rotation of the DE-file axes would align them with the principal axes of the GRAIL-derived, seconddegree gravity field? The X axis points near the mean Earth direction, the Z axis points near the mean rotation (polar) axis, and Y completes the triad. For very small right-handed rotations of the frame directions about the X, Y, and Z axes by angles θX, θY, and θZ,     θX =   S21/( J2 – 2C22 )     θY = –C21/( J2 + 2C22 )   (1)   θZ =   S22/( 2C22 ) .    The value S21 = 1.3x10–9 corresponds to  θX = 1.7".  Lunar orientation responds dynamically to torques including those from S21, C21, and S22. Does the dynamical behavior match the geometrical rotations? The first-order analytical technique for calculating perturbations from the gravity field follows Eckhardt [9]. We give the results as small constant rotations about the X, Y, and Z axes by angles δX, δY, and δZ.     δX ≈  0     δY ≈  (3/4) CS21/( J2 + 2C22 ) (2)   δZ ≈  –SS22/( 2C22 )    Coefficients CS21 and SS22 use the principal axis frame of the solid Moon. There are three different dynamical responses: 1) There is no significant rotation about the X axis to respond to a finite S21 value. The GRAILderived S21 value corresponds to the geometric θX separation of eq. (1). 2) A finite C21 value implies that the principal axes of the solid Moon and the whole Moon are separated, but the LLR-derived axes should have rotated around the Y axis to partly offset that separation. The X and Z principal axes of the solid body would not be aligned with the axes of the DE file. The CS21 with respect to the solid-body axes would be larg2267.pdf

  er than the GRAIL-derived C21. 3) For rotations about the Z axis, the X and Y axes of the LLR frame should be aligned in the longitude direction with the principal axes of the gravity field and whole Moon, rather than the principal axes of the solid Moon. Within the uncertainties, a zero spacecraft value for S22 is expected.  The dynamical prediction for S21 was tested by introducing an S21 value of 1.3×10–9 into a numerical integration of the lunar orbit and physical librations and then refitting the LLR data. The weighted rootmean-square (rms) residual improved 0.1%. Any constant rotation of the lunar frame was small compared to the geometrical rotation of 1.7". The small S21 coefficient has a minor effect on the rotation dynamics.  Core Oblateness: Torque from an oblate coremantle boundary (CMB) shape is proportional to the difference between the fluid outer core’s polar and mean equatorial moments, Cf–(Af+Bf)/2, provided that the fluid has uniform density and the inner boundary is spherical. This moment difference depends on the product f Cf of the fluid core moment of inertia Cf and the CMB flattening f, where f = [Cf–(Af+Bf)/2]/Cf and f Cf/C = [Cf–(Af+Bf)/2]/C. The LLR-determined DE430 flattening f = (2.46±1.4)×10–4 [6,7] is based on an LLR solution that used a fluid outer core Cf/C = 7×10–4, near the maximum value expected. Smaller cores should give larger values for CMB flattening.  Meyer and Wisdom [10] matched the LLR flattening of the CMB with a theoretical calculation. They assumed that the exterior non-spherical gravity field was formed near the surface and they extended that field downward to the CMB. The shape of the CMB was presumed to deform so that the potential on its surface was constant. We have repeated that calculation and obtained a similar result. However, if one extrapolates the LLR result to a smaller core by holding f Cf fixed, then a smaller core would cause a larger flattening and agreement with model calculation degrades. Disagreement implies that the interior field cannot be calculated accurately from the exterior field alone. There may be lateral density variations in the upper mantle. Zhao et al. [11] may have found heterogeneity, a lower S-wave velocity under the PKT. Also, other geophysical processes may influence core shape.  Deep Gravity: If core shape depends on local deep gravity, then the GRAIL exterior S21 value may arise from the interior S21 field from the core, and that depends on the mantle’s interior field. The connection depends on core size. For calculation we adopt model GPM3 [7], which is similar to the Weber et al. [12] model. The resulting interior S21 field is shown in Fig. 1. For a given model, all of the deep degree-2 field components have the same radial dependence at depths below the lateral density variations, but the coefficients have different values. The flattening and interior gravity field that are associated with J2 are larger than the S21 core shape and interior field, but precise values for both components are model dependent.  Summary: It is plausible that the lunar S21 value determined by GRAIL data analysis comes from the shape of the fluid outer core. The orientation of the solid Moon around its X axis, which is followed by lunar laser ranging, has low sensitivity to an outer core S21 shape. By contrast, the principal moments of the solid Moon should be well oriented about the X axis.  LLR continues to detect outer core flattening. Combining GRAIL and LLR results gives a glimpse of core shape and, possibly, deep gravity.
