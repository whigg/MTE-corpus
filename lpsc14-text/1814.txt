Introduction: Magmatic iron meteorites are fragments of the metal cores of differentiated protoplanetary bodies that formed after segregation and subsequent fractional crystallization of metallic melt [e.g., 1]. The different iron meteorite groups each represent metal from a distinct parent body, and are distinguished by different contents of moderately volatile elements. For instance, while within-group variations of Ge/Ni or Ga/Ni are relatively small, these ratios are strongly variable between different iron meteorite groups [1]. Precise determination of the time of core formation for each magmatic iron meteorite group is critical for determining the accretion rate for each parent body, for assessing whether accretion time played a role in establishing the different degrees of volatile depletion observed among the iron meteorite groups, and for evaluating whether melting and metal segregation occurred instantaneously or over a period of time. The extinct 182Hf-182W chronometer (t1/2 = 8.9 Myr) is ideally suited to constrain the timing of core formation in iron meteorite parent bodies [2]. However, because of cosmic ray-induced neutron capture effects on W isotopes, it has so far not been possible to resolve differences in the timing of core formation between different groups of magmatic irons. It has recently been shown that Pt isotopes provide a direct neutron fluence dosimeter for iron meteorites, such that it is now possible to precisely determine the preexposure 182W/184W (i.e., the 182W signature unbiased by galactic cosmic rays) for any given iron meteorite group [3,4]. Here we present combined Pt and W isotope data for 48 metal samples from the major iron meteorite groups (IIAB, IIIAB, IVA, IVB, IID), with the ultimate goal to determine the timescales of core formation and to resolve potential differences in the timing of metal segregation in the parent bodies of magmatic irons.  Analytical methods: After digestion of the metal samples and separation of Pt and W by ion exchange chromatography [3,5], the isotope measurements were performed on a ThermoScientific® Neptune Plus MCICPMS at the University of Münster (Pt & W) [3] and a ThermoFisher® Triton TIMS at UMd (W) [5].  Results: All iron meteorite groups exhibit welldefined ε182W vs. ε196Pt correlations (ε-unit = 0.01% deviation from terrestrial isotope composition), whose intercept values provide the pre-exposure ε182W for each group. Our results demonstrate the presence of resolved differences in pre-exposure ε182W values, with the pre-exposure ε182W of IVB irons being ~20 ppm higher than that of the IIAB irons (Fig. 1). The distinct pre-exposure ε182W correspond to resolved and very precise Hf-W ages spanning a total range of ~1 to ~3 Myr after CAI formation. Discussion: With the exception of the IID irons, the pre-exposure ε182W values exhibit inverse correlations with Ga/Ni (and Ge/Ni) ratios and S contents estimated for the parental melts of the magmatic irons (Fig. 1), suggesting that the degree of volatile element depletion exerted some control on the timescale of core formation. The S concentration of Fe-Ni metal strongly affects its melting temperature, which can vary between the Fe-FeS eutectic up to the melting temperature of pure Fe [e.g., 6]. For instance, estimated average melting temperatures range from ~1330 °C for the IIAB irons to ~1600 °C for the IVB irons at 1 atm, and from ~1300 °C (IIAB) to ~1820 °C (IVB) at a few GPa (calculated using S contents from [7,8]).

CAI initial is from [9]. Upon heating of an undifferentiated body, the first component to melt is FeS at a temperature of ~1000 °C, followed by silicates and finally pure Fe metal at ~1600 °C [6,10]. Because melting, therefore, was a multistage process occurring over a range of temperatures and, hence, over a period of time, the early segregated FeS melt potentially had less radiogenic ε182W than the later segregated pure Fe metal melt. The final W isotope composition of the metal cores, therefore, reflects a particular mix of early (having lower ε182W) and late (having higher ε182W) segregated metal frac1814.pdf

tions. Thus, for a given accretion time, the metal core of a FeS-rich body would be characterized by lower ε182W, compared to that of a FeS-poor body, because it contains a larger fraction of the early segregated FeS melt. The inverse ε182W vs. S correlation observed for the magmatic iron meteorite groups, therefore, could primarily reflect the different average melting temperatures during core formation.  0 1 2 3 40500100015002000∆tCAI (Myr)T (°C)IIABIIIABIVAIVBIIDε182Wpre-exposure−3.5 −3.4 −3.3 −3.2 −3.1Fe-FeS eutecticPure Fe metalr = 1000 km(B)0.3 Myr 0.5 Myr0.5 Myr0.7 Myr0.2 Myr Range of possible accretion timessuprachondritic Hf/W?0 1 2 3 40500100015002000(A)∆tCAI (Myr)T (°C)IIABIIIABIVAIVBIIDr = 20 kmε182Wpre-exposure−3.4 −3.3 −3.2 −3.1Fe-FeS eutecticPure Fe metal1.7 wt% Al0.87 wt% AlRange of possible accretion times0.4 Myr0.7 Myr0.2 Myr0.3 Myr0.5 Myr0.4 Myrsuprachondritic Hf/W?IVB (180Hf/184W=2)IVB (180Hf/184W=2) Fig. 2: T-t diagrams showing the Hf-W data in comparison to model results for post-accretional heating by 26Al decay of protoplanets with radii of (A) 20 km and (B) 1000 km. Curves show the temperature evolution at half the radius of bodies accreted at different times and having different Al contents. To quantify the relation between accretion age, time of core formation and melting temperature of the metal, we used a simple thermal model for postaccretional heating of planetesimals by 26Al decay [e.g., 11] (Fig. 2). The model results show that the observed ~1 Myr difference in core formation ages between the IIAB and IVA irons is consistent with the time required to raise the temperature inside the parent body from the melting temperature of the IIAB to that of the IVA irons (Fig. 2). Our model predicts that despite their different core formation ages, the IIAB, IIIAB and IVA iron meteorite parent bodies all accreted in a narrow time interval of ~0.2-0.7 Myr after formation of CAI (Fig. 2). The IID and IVB irons plot to the right of the heating curves for the IIAB, IIIAB and IVA irons (Fig. 2). This may indicate that accretion and metal segregation in the IID and IVB bodies occurred later or over a longer period. It is more likely, however, that the precursor material of the IVB and IID irons had higherthan-chondritic Hf/W. The IVB parental melt is depleted in W relative to other refractory siderophile elements [12,13], suggesting that the bulk Hf/W of the parent body is a factor of ~2 higher than chondritic. This would result in a Hf-W model age of ~2 Myr after CAI for the IVB irons, which would then plot on the same heating curve as the IIAB, IIIAB and IVA irons (Fig. 2). The IID irons have been proposed to sample a late stage segregation step in their parent body after removal of an Fe-FeS melt [8]. Assuming that the latter segregated at ΔtCAI ≈ 0.7 Myr (i.e., when the IIAB core formed), and that the second segregation occurred ~0.7 Myr later (i.e., when the IVA core formed), then the residual IID mantle had a slightly higher-thanchondritic Hf/W of ~3.8. Such a modest Hf/W fractionation is likely, given that the early segregated, Srich metal almost certainly contained some W. The metal segregation event that gave rise to the IID irons, therefore, may well have occurred at about the same time as core formation in the IVA iron meteorite parent body.  Conclusions: The Hf-W results indicate that differences in the time of core formation in iron meteorite parent bodies reflect variations in the average melting temperature of the metal, which is controlled by its S content. This implies that core formation was a protracted process, which occurred over ~1 Myr and involved at least two stages of melting and metal segregation. Regardless of the different core formation ages, all the iron meteorite parent bodies seem to have accreted at about the same time, between ~0.2-0.7 Myr after CAI formation. This suggests that the variable depletions of moderately volatile elements observed among iron meteorite parent bodies are not due to accretion at different times in an evolving solar nebula. Instead, they may reflect spatial heterogeneities within the solar protoplanetary disk. References: [1] Scott E.R.D. (1972) GCA 36, 1205-1236. [2] Kleine T. et al. (2009) GCA 73, 5150-5188.
