 ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF APPEARANCE OF A FALSE CIRCULAR POLARIZATION IN THE LIGHT OF SOLAR SYSTEM BODIES.  A. V. Morozhenko 1 , and A. S. Ovsak 2 , 1 Main Astronomical Observatory of the NAS of Ukraine, Zabolotnoho Street 27, Kyiv, 03680, mor@mao.kiev.ua, 2 ovsak@mao.kiev.ua   Introduction:  The purpose of this note is to put an attention of the researchers, who study the circular polarization V of the light of the Solar system bodies, on a possibility of emergence of a false circular polarization. The thing is that in the studies, aimed to measure the circular polarization (for instance [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [9], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]), the instrumental polarization was determined and taken into account, which  arises from the transformation of the unpolarized light (I0,0,0,0) to the elliptically polarized one (I,Q,U,V) by the optics of the telescope. At the same time, it was shown in [1] that, when the light with the polarization vector (I0,Q0,U0,0) falls on the mirror, an additional partial transformation of parameter U0 to               V' ≈ -U0 sin∆ ,  occurs, where ∆ is a phase shift, which in that experiment was found to be 26°52', 19°48' and 14°07' at the wavelengths of 361, 544 and 750 nm respectively. Therefore during the observations, for example, in the Cassegrain focus (two mirrors) a false circular polarization may appear V"(α) ≈ -2 U0(α) sin∆ = -2 Р(α) sin2ψ sin∆, phase dependence and sign of which are determined by the degree Р(α) and plane ψ of the linear polarization (at 0 < ψ < 90° a right-hand circular polarization appears and at 90° < ψ < 180° - left-handed). Thus, in accordance with the data of [3] and [10], in the light of comet Halley and the Galilean satellites of Jupiter a V"(α) ≈ -(0.1-0.2)% may arise when 25° ≤ α ≤ 40° and α = 0.5° respectively. As the parameter U was detected in the light of several asteroids (eg. Hebe [2], Perega [16] and Tautatys [8]), the reality of the appearance of a false circular polarization can be verified with observations of asteroids with Stocks parameters (I,Q,0,0) and (I,Q,U,0).
