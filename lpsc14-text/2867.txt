INFLUENCE OF VARIABLE fO2 AND TiO2 ON THE HIGH PRESSUREPHASE EQUILIBRIA OF LUNAR ULTRAMAFIC GLASSES Stephanie M.Brown1 and Timothy L. Grove1, 1 Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Science, Massachusetts Instituteof Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02139 (brownsm@mit.edu, tlgrove@mit.edu)We present the high-pressure, high-temperature (PT) phase relations for the Apollo 14 yellow ultramaficglass. Experiments were preformed from 0.8 to 3.5 GPaand 1380-1570◦C at two different fO2 conditions corresponding to values of ∆IW = +2 (graphite capsules) and∆IW = -2 (spec-pure iron metal capsules). We find thatthe pressure of multiple saturation with olivine and orthopyroxene moves to higher pressure and temperaturesas fO2 is reduced, consistent with [1]. This effect is nonlinear with respect to TiO2 content when compared tothe Apollo 17 orange and the Apollo 15 red glass, andmust reflect the influence of variable fO2 on melt structure. This abstract explores possible effects of changingmelt components in controlling the influence of variablefO2 on the P-T conditions of multiple saturation. We reexamine the database of experimentally determined lunarolivine-melt KFe−MgD , and observe that KFe−MgD variationcannot be explained by silica content. Rather, KFe−MgDvariation is due to the solution behavior of network modifying Fe,Mg melt components.Experimental Results: Figure 1 shows the results ofpiston cylinder experiments on the Apollo 14 yellowglass (4.53 wt% TiO2) in graphite (∆IW = +2 [2]) tomore reducing conditions (∆IW = -2 [1]) in spec-pureFe capsules. The conditions of the olivine and orthopyroxene multiple saturation point (MSP) on the liquidusare 2.4 GPa, 1530◦C in graphite and 3 GPa, 1580◦C iniron capsules. The systematic error on pressure is ±0.2GPa and ±10◦C on temperature. Hence, the minimumchange in MSP pressure (or ∆MSP) due to lower fO2 isat least 0.6 GPa (∼110 km).Previous experiments in both graphite and iron capsules on the Apollo red (13.5 wt% TiO2) and orange(8.78 wt% TiO2) glass suggested a linear relationshipbetween TiO2 content and ∆MSP [1]. Based on thoseresults, we had expected the MSP of the yellow glass iniron capsules to be near 2.7 GPa (see solid black line inFigure 2). Instead, the observed shift is identical to thatof the Apollo 17 orange glass [1] and may prove to beeven greater. Thus, our experiments on the yellow glass(4.53 wt% TiO2) imply a more complex relation betweenTiO2, fO2, and ∆MSP.0.8 1.1 1.4 1.7 2 2.3 2.6 2.9 3.2 3.5 137013901410143014501470149015101530155015701590200 300 400 500 600 700 Temperature °C Depth kmPressure GPa liquidolivineopxopx andolivineliquidolivineopx         and      olivinegraphite (IW+2)spec-pure iron(IW-2)Figure 1: Legend: circles = liquid, diamonds =liquid + olivine, squares = liquid + orthopyroxene,square/diamonds = liquid + olivine + orthopyroxene.The role of titaniummelt components: The observeddeepening of the MSP under low fO2 of the yellow, orange, and red lunar glass indicates that the silicate meltis becoming more olivine normative [1]. Further, theobserved decrease in the KFe−MgD = (FeO/MgO)olivine /(FeO/MgO)melt suggests that either the olivine is moreforsteritic or the silicate melt has higher (FeO/MgO) [1],expressed as a reduction in activity ratio of the Fe-Mgmelt components, ( γFeOγMgO )melt. Since olivine is a nearlypure Fe-Mg solid solution with well known thermodynamic properties, the culprit is melt.There must be a difference in the olivine forming silicate melt components under different fO2 and TiO2 conditions, resulting in low KFe−MgD and low (γFeOγMgO)melt values. This suggests that the olivine melt components arecomplexing less with Fe2+ under more reducing conditions than under more oxidizing conditions. Given thatTi4+ is likely being reduced to Ti3+ in the Fe capsules[1], an enticing solution is that Fe2+, at the expense ofMg, is more efficiently complexing with Ti3+ than it didwith Ti4+ in the melt, effectively increasing the amountof magnesium available for olivine. This also explainsthe deepening of the MSP; the silicate-forming melt be2867.pdf

2comes more olivine normative as the Ti/(Fe+Mg) ratio of(Fe,Mg)-Ti melt components increases, thereby increasing the (FeO+MgO)/SiO2 ratio of the remaining liquid[1].[1] suggested a melt component exchange reaction(Reaction 1) that allows exchange of Fe2+ with Ti3+ in anexample armalcolite melt component. In its limit of lowfO2, the oxide melt component becomes Ti4+Ti3+2 O5:(Fe,Mg)Ti4+2 O5 + 2xTi3+ ⇀↽(Fe,Mg)1−xTi4+2−xTi3+2xO5 + xTi4+ + x(Fe,Mg).(1)We can additionally write an exchange reaction betweenFe-Mg in the (Fe,Mg)-Ti melt component:MgTi2O5 + FeOmelt ⇀↽ FeTi2O5 + MgOmelt. (2)We suggest that this reaction (Reaction 2) proceedsto the right as the amount of titanium in the bulk composition increases, which successfully predicts the decreasein ( γFeOγMgO )melt, and KFe−MgD .Fe-Mg exchange at low fO2 and its connectionto ∆MSP: The curious result that the yellow glasses,with half the amount of titanium compared to the orangeglasses, exhibits the same change in ∆MSP as the orange glasses has motivated the thought that TiO2 is notthe first order control on high titanium liquid phase equilibria. Reaction 2 suggests that there is some equilibriumbetween Fe-Mg in titanium melt components, based onthe Fe-Mg composition of the bulk liquid.An important observation of the higher titaniumglasses is that Mg# (Mg# = molar MgO/(MgO + FeO))does not correlate with TiO2 content, causing Fe:Mg:Tivariability (Figure 2). The orange glasses (Mg# = 55.6)have significantly less iron than the yellow glasses (Mg#= 52). Thus, consistent with Reactions 1 and 2, theamount of Fe and Ti available may control melt speciation, and ultimately how much more olivine normativethe melt becomes. We can then calculate a Fe-Ti# = molar (FeO + TiO2)/(MgO + FeO + TiO2), and find that theyellow and the orange glass have identical values, consistent with their observed identical ∆MSP.Conclusions: We find that variations in fO2 and meltcomposition strongly influence depths of MSPs of ultramafic glasses. This effect was noted by [1] and we reinforce their conclusion that the fO2 of the lunar interiorwill exert significant controls on mare basalt melting processes.17 Orange14 Black expected14 Yellow expected15A Green fit of ∆MSP to wt% TiO2 from 15 red,17 orange,15A greenestimated ∆MSP fit of ∆MSP to Fe-Ti# from 15 red,17 orange,15A green, 14 yellowestimated ∆MSP 17 Orange, 14 Yellow15 Red15A Green 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16wt% TiO200.20.40.60.81∆MSP, GPa0.35 0.4 0.45 0.5 0.55 0.6 0.65Fe−Ti # = molar (Fe + Ti)/(Mg + Fe + Ti) Figure 2: Initial expected fit of ∆MSP to wt% TiO2 (topaxis) from experiments on the Apollo 15 red, Apollo 17orange, and Apollo 15 green A [3, 1].

A new fit including the new Apollo 14 yellow data against Fe-Ti#(bottom axis) is plotted as a dashed line. The Apollo 14yellow and 17 orange glass have different amounts of titanium, but have identical Fe-Ti# and ∆MSP. The newFe-Ti# fit suggests that the Apollo 14 black glass willexhibit a smaller ∆MSP than based off the TiO2 contentalone, though it may be hard to resolve that differenceexperimentally.References[1] M.
