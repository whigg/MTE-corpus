 INFLUENCE OF VARIABLE fO2 AND TiO2 ON THE HIGH PRESSURE PHASE EQUILIBRIA OF LUNAR ULTRAMAFIC GLASSES Stephanie M. Brown1 and Timothy L. Grove1, 1 Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02139 (brownsm@mit.edu, tlgrove@mit.edu) We present the high-pressure, high-temperature (PT) phase relations for the Apollo 14 yellow ultramafic glass. Experiments were preformed from 0.8 to 3.5 GPa and 1380-1570◦C at two different f O2 conditions corresponding to values of ∆IW = +2 (graphite capsules) and ∆IW = -2 (spec-pure iron metal capsules). We find that the pressure of multiple saturation with olivine and orthopyroxene moves to higher pressure and temperatures as f O2 is reduced, consistent with [1]. This effect is nonlinear with respect to TiO2 content when compared to the Apollo 17 orange and the Apollo 15 red glass, and must reflect the influence of variable f O2 on melt structure. This abstract explores possible effects of changing melt components in controlling the influence of variable f O2 on the P-T conditions of multiple saturation. We reexamine the database of experimentally determined lunar olivine-melt KFe−MgD , and observe that K Fe−Mg D variation cannot be explained by silica content. Rather, KFe−MgD variation is due to the solution behavior of network modifying Fe,Mg melt components. Experimental Results: Figure 1 shows the results of piston cylinder experiments on the Apollo 14 yellow glass (4.53 wt% TiO2) in graphite (∆IW = +2 [2]) to more reducing conditions (∆IW = -2 [1]) in spec-pure Fe capsules. The conditions of the olivine and orthopyroxene multiple saturation point (MSP) on the liquidus are 2.4 GPa, 1530◦C in graphite and 3 GPa, 1580◦C in iron capsules. The systematic error on pressure is ±0.2 GPa and ±10◦C on temperature. Hence, the minimum change in MSP pressure (or ∆MSP) due to lower f O2 is at least 0.6 GPa (∼110 km). Previous experiments in both graphite and iron capsules on the Apollo red (13.5 wt% TiO2) and orange (8.78 wt% TiO2) glass suggested a linear relationship between TiO2 content and ∆MSP [1]. Based on those results, we had expected the MSP of the yellow glass in iron capsules to be near 2.7 GPa (see solid black line in Figure 2). Instead, the observed shift is identical to that of the Apollo 17 orange glass [1] and may prove to be even greater. Thus, our experiments on the yellow glass (4.53 wt% TiO2) imply a more complex relation between TiO2, f O2, and ∆MSP. 0.8 1.1 1.4 1.7 2 2.3 2.6 2.9 3.2 3.5 1370 1390 1410 1430 1450 1470 1490 1510 1530 1550 1570 1590 200 300 400 500 600 700  T em pe ra tu re ° C Depth km Pressure GPa liquid olivine opx opx and olivine liquid olivine opx         and      olivine graphite (IW+2) spec-pure iron(IW-2) Figure 1: Legend: circles = liquid, diamonds = liquid + olivine, squares = liquid + orthopyroxene, square/diamonds = liquid + olivine + orthopyroxene. The role of titanium melt components: The observed deepening of the MSP under low f O2 of the yellow, orange, and red lunar glass indicates that the silicate melt is becoming more olivine normative [1]. Further, the observed decrease in the KFe−MgD = (FeO/MgO)olivine / (FeO/MgO)melt suggests that either the olivine is more forsteritic or the silicate melt has higher (FeO/MgO) [1], expressed as a reduction in activity ratio of the Fe-Mg melt components, ( γFeOγMgO ) melt. Since olivine is a nearly pure Fe-Mg solid solution with well known thermodynamic properties, the culprit is melt. There must be a difference in the olivine forming silicate melt components under different f O2 and TiO2 conditions, resulting in low KFe−MgD and low ( γFeO γMgO )melt values. This suggests that the olivine melt components are complexing less with Fe2+ under more reducing conditions than under more oxidizing conditions. Given that Ti4+ is likely being reduced to Ti3+ in the Fe capsules [1], an enticing solution is that Fe2+, at the expense of Mg, is more efficiently complexing with Ti3+ than it did with Ti4+ in the melt, effectively increasing the amount of magnesium available for olivine. This also explains the deepening of the MSP; the silicate-forming melt be  2comes more olivine normative as the Ti/(Fe+Mg) ratio of (Fe,Mg)-Ti melt components increases, thereby increasing the (FeO+MgO)/SiO2 ratio of the remaining liquid [1]. [1] suggested a melt component exchange reaction (Reaction 1) that allows exchange of Fe2+ with Ti3+ in an example armalcolite melt component. In its limit of low f O2, the oxide melt component becomes Ti4 +Ti3+2 O5: (Fe,Mg)Ti4 +2 O5 + 2xTi 3+ ⇀↽ (Fe,Mg)1−xTi 4+ 2−xTi 3+ 2xO5 + xTi 4+ + x(Fe,Mg). (1) We can additionally write an exchange reaction between Fe-Mg in the (Fe,Mg)-Ti melt component: MgTi2O5 + FeO melt ⇀↽ FeTi2O5 + MgO melt. (2) We suggest that this reaction (Reaction 2) proceeds to the right as the amount of titanium in the bulk composition increases, which successfully predicts the decrease in ( γFeOγMgO ) melt, and KFe−MgD . Fe-Mg exchange at low fO2 and its connection to ∆MSP: The curious result that the yellow glasses, with half the amount of titanium compared to the orange glasses, exhibits the same change in ∆MSP as the orange glasses has motivated the thought that TiO2 is not the first order control on high titanium liquid phase equilibria. Reaction 2 suggests that there is some equilibrium between Fe-Mg in titanium melt components, based on the Fe-Mg composition of the bulk liquid. An important observation of the higher titanium glasses is that Mg# (Mg# = molar MgO/(MgO + FeO)) does not correlate with TiO2 content, causing Fe:Mg:Ti variability (Figure 2). The orange glasses (Mg# = 55.6) have significantly less iron than the yellow glasses (Mg# = 52). Thus, consistent with Reactions 1 and 2, the amount of Fe and Ti available may control melt speciation, and ultimately how much more olivine normative the melt becomes. We can then calculate a Fe-Ti# = molar (FeO + TiO2)/(MgO + FeO + TiO2), and find that the yellow and the orange glass have identical values, consistent with their observed identical ∆MSP. Conclusions: We find that variations in f O2 and melt composition strongly influence depths of MSPs of ultramafic glasses. This effect was noted by [1] and we reinforce their conclusion that the f O2 of the lunar interior will exert significant controls on mare basalt melting processes. 17 Orange 14 Black expected 14 Yellow expected 15A Green fit of ∆MSP to wt% TiO 2 from 15 red,17 orange,15A green estimated ∆MSP fit of ∆MSP to Fe-Ti# from 15 red,17 orange,15A green, 14 yellow estimated ∆MSP 17 Orange, 14 Yellow 15 Red 15A Green 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 wt% TiO 20 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1∆ MS P, G Pa 0.35 0.4 0.45 0.5 0.55 0.6 0.65 Fe−Ti # = molar (Fe + Ti)/(Mg + Fe + Ti) Figure 2: Initial expected fit of ∆MSP to wt% TiO2 (top axis) from experiments on the Apollo 15 red, Apollo 17 orange, and Apollo 15 green A [3, 1]. The Apollo 14 yellow glass however, did not preform as expected with ∆MSP = 0.6 GPa instead of ∼ 0.3 GPa. A new fit including the new Apollo 14 yellow data against Fe-Ti# (bottom axis) is plotted as a dashed line. The Apollo 14 yellow and 17 orange glass have different amounts of titanium, but have identical Fe-Ti# and ∆MSP. The new Fe-Ti# fit suggests that the Apollo 14 black glass will exhibit a smaller ∆MSP than based off the TiO2 content alone, though it may be hard to resolve that difference experimentally.
