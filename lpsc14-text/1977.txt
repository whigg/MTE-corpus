Introduction:  Airless planetary bodies are directly exposed to space weathering. The main spectral effects of space weathering are darkening, suppression of silicate mineral absorption bands, and spectral slope increase towards longer wavelengths (reddening). Production of nanophase metallic iron (npFe0) during space weathering plays a major role in these spectral changes [1]. Space weathering simulations with olivine:  A laboratory procedure for controlled production of npFe0 in silicate mineral powders has been developed [2].  The  method  is  based  on  two-step  thermal  treatment of low-iron olivine in ambient air followed by reduction in a hydrogen atmosphere. Through this process, a series of olivine powder samples was produced with increasing amount of npFe0. The size of npFe0 for all of the samples fall in the 7-20 nm size range.  The amount of npFe0 was estimated from saturation magnetization measurements and quantitative spectral changes were evaluated. Results:   1. Linear trend is observed between the amount of npFe0 and 1 µm band center position (Fig. 1) 2. Logarithmic trend is observed between the amount of npFe0 and  darkening,  suppression  of  1  µm  olivine absorption band, and reddening (Fig. 2) 3.  A logarithmic trend between reddening and the space weathering exposure duration has been observed by [3] on asteroids. In combination with our results we conclude that similar trend is valid for darkening and suppression of 1 µm olivine absorption band and the amount of npFe0 increases linearly with the space weathering exposure duration. 4. The 1 µm band width at half depth generally decreases with increasing amount of npFe0, but no reliable fit was found. 5. Olivine sample with the additional population of larger npFe0 particles follows similar spectral trends as other samples, except for the reduced reddening trend (Figs. 2 and 3). This is interpreted that larger, ~40-50 nm sized, npFe0 particles contribute to the slope change less efficiently than smaller npFe0 fraction. Conclusions:  Compared to fresh olivine, our olivine samples with artificially introduced ~5-20 nm sized npFe0 particles exhibit all spectral characteristics of lunar-type space weathering. Through comparison of our results with space weathering observations [2] we conclude that the npFe0 amount in planetary regoliths exposed to space weathering increases linearly with time. Similar linear trend with space weathering duration is expected for 1 µm band center position, while a logarithmic trend with space weathering duration is expected for darkening, suppression of 1 µm olivine absorption band, and reddening. The 1 µm band width at half depth generally decreases with increasing amount of npFe0 and time, but no reliable fit was found.  References: [1] Hapke B. et al. (1975) Moon, 13, 339-353.

 Fig. 1. Linear trend is observed between the amount of npFe0 and 1 µm band center position.   Fig. 2. Logarithmic trend is observed between amount of npFe0 and darkening, suppression of 1 µm olivine absorption band, and reddening. The sample highlighted by yellow circle contains additional population of larger npFe0 particles and does not fully follow the reddening trend.   Fig. 3. Systematic change in olivine reflectance spectra as a function of the increasing npFe0 amount. The sample marked by a dashed line contains additional population of larger npFe0 particles and does not fully follow the reddening trend. The npFe0 amount is indicated in wt%. 1977.pdf
