THE INFLUENCE OF EVAPORATION FRONTS ON THE GLOBAL EVOLUTION OF SOLIDS AND GAS IN THEPROTOPLANETARY NEBULA. P. R. Estrada1 and J. N. Cuzzi2, 1 Carl Sagan Center, SETI Institute, Mountain View CA 94043,USA, (Paul.R.Estrada@nasa.gov), 2 NASA Ames Research Center, MS 245-3, Moffett Field, CA 94043, USA..Introduction: The earliest stages of planet formation in theprotoplanetary disk continues to be a topic of debate on manyfronts. Apart from the basic question of how grain growth fromdust to planetesimal occurs, observational contraints such asthe formation ages of primitive meteorites [1-2], and the duration of “dusty-gas” protoplanetary nebulae [3] which can spanmillions of years (during which time the nebula significantlyevolves) is painting an increasingly more complicated picturethan previously considered. These observations are leading usaway from the oversimplified view that planets grow withina static “minimum mass” nebula where the local temperatureuniquely determines the chemistry through some invariable“cosmic abundance” in favor of a nebula in which mass concentration and composition evolves both locally and globally.This more dynamic picture leads us to explore the presence of evaporation fronts (EFs): a location in the disk wherethe temperature is such that phase changes between solidsand vapor can occur. The treatment of EFs is required inorder to self-consistently model a globally evolving nebula because inwardly migrating material can lose some or all of their“volatiles” while passing through them, and subsequently thatvapor may diffuse outside the EF where it can recondense, leading to enhancements in both composition and fractional massof solids. Because multiple EFs are expected throughout thedisk, the transport of materials of different composition bothlocally and globally is possible. Here we model an early-stagedisk from 10−1000AU with an (water-ice) EF to demonstratehow compositional changes and transport can occur.Global Gas and Solids Evolution Model: The wide rangein dynamical times associated with a protoplanetary disk thatmay extend to ∼ 1000 AU, along with the cumbersome implementation of the collisional coagulation equation, have previously restricted global models for the evolution of solids toeither studying particle growth and redistribution alone [4-5],or studying compositional enhancements at EFs due to simplified assumptions about growth [6-7], or ones that treat growthmore carefully, but neglect radial drift [8-9]. We have developed a parallelized 1+1D radial nebula code that is capableof simultaneously treating all of these elements in a thermallyand dynamically evolving disk over its entire radial extent.Our model includes self-consistent growth and radial drift ofmaterial of all sizes, accounts for vertical diffusion and settlingof smaller grains, radial diffusion of dust and vapor phases ofmultiple species, and a self-consistent calculation of opacityand disk temperature which allows us to track the evaporationand condensation of various species as they are transportedthroughout the disk. A detailed description of our code willappear elsewhere. Here, we briefly discuss those elements thatdescribe the physics at EFs.Gas evolution under viscosity νT in our code is prescribedusing analytical expressions from [10] which depend on initialdisk mass and radius, and νT = αcH , where c is the gas soundspeed, and H this disk scale height, and α can be varied overFigure 1: Upper panel: Total fractional mass of dust (red curves) andvapor (green curves) at three different times. Lower panel: Plot of thefractional mass of migrators (r > r∗). The total fraction of solids andvolatiles is indicated by the black curve. See text. This simulationutilized 60 CPUs and 24 hours of dedicated wall time.an arbitrary range. The radial diffusion of the dust and vaporfractions of all compositional constituents is determined bysolving the advection-diffusion equation in log space using animplicit finite differencing scheme. The vapor fraction advectswith the gas, whereas the radial velocity of the dust is takento be the mass density weighted mean velocity of all particlesin the dust population which properly takes into account theradial drift of particles due to the local pressure gradient [11].At every timestep, we self-consistently calculate the protoplanetary disk midplane and photosphere temperatures assuming disk heating is due to a combination of internal viscousdissipation (at a rate proportional to ΣνT , where Σ is the gassurface density), and a possibly time-dependent external illumination by the central star that heats the upper layer of thedisk on both sides. The midplane temperature must be solvediteratively because the optical depth of the layer τ = κRΣ,where κR is the Rosseland mean opacity, depends on the particle size distribution, and the mass fraction of all compositionalconstituents, both which are evolving in time. Our method ofcalculating κR is described in [12].Dust coagulation is treated using the moments method described in [13], which is valid up to some fragmentation size r∗that depends on ambient nebular conditions, and assumed particle strengths. Beyond r∗, we follow the growth of particlesexplicitly, which we call “migrators”, using a statistical algorithm. These migrators are subject to collisional disruptionas they drift relatively large distances while they continue togrow from dust and potentially smaller migrators. Disruptedmigrators are reintegrated back into the dust population. Whena migrator passes through an EF, they are assumed to lose theirvolatile material to the local vapor inventory, and their massesand densities are adjusted accordingly.2642.pdf

EVOLUTION OF SOLIDS AND GAS, P. R. Estrada and J. N. CuzziFigure 2: Upper panel: Evolution of the mass surface density ofgas (black curves), and solids (red curves) for three different times.Lower panel: Evolution of the midplane opacity. See text.Simulation of an EF: We have simulated a protoplanetarydisk from 10− 1000 AU, with an initial disk mass of 0.2 M⊙(M⊙ is a solar mass), for α = 5× 10−3. This initially placesthe outermost part of the water-ice EF near ∼ 15 − 20 AU.The model includes several species in cosmic abundance, all ofwhich are solid outside the water-ice EF (which give an initialmean dust density of ρ0 ≃ 1.385 g cm−3).In Fig. 1 we plot the total fractional mass of dust (red) andvapor (green) in the upper panel, and migrators (magenta) inthe lower panel at 104, 105 and 106 years of evolution. The initial distribution is indicated by the black, dot-dashed line whichhas an abrupt cutoff at 100 AU. For this α, the fragmentationbarrier (r = r∗) is reached at small particles sizes, so migrators appear early and in significant number, which radially driftinward at different speeds. As this material encounters the EF(whose location can vary with time), its volatiles evaporateand diffuse outwards where they recondense. This leads to adrop in the fractional mass of migrators inside the EF. By 106years, the ratio of gas to dust is approaching unity near theEF (though the gas density has significantly decreased at thislocation and time, see Fig. 2, upper panel). We also note anabrupt cutoff in the population of migrators developing evenoutside the EF region which is not because of evaporation. Thelower mass end of the migrator population is effectively beingremoved because the higher bulk density of solids dramaticallyincreases the probability of destruction for sizes r & r∗. Thisleads to a large increase in the dust fraction which is reflectedin the large opacity as seen in Fig. 2 (lower panel).In Fig. 3 we show the mean dust and migrator particledensities, and particle radii after 106 years of evolution. Theprocess of evaporation, diffusion and recondensation of moreand more migrating material over time leads to a systematicenhancement in water-ice outside the EF while higher densitymaterial continues to drift inwards beyond the EF. After 106years, the EF region and its vicinity is essentially pure waterice. Furthermore, this facilitates, through diffusion of dustoutwards with the nebula gas, the enhancement of the entireouter disk in water ice.Figure 3: Plot of the mean dust and migrator particle densities (leftaxis, colored curves), and particle radii (right axis, black curves) after106 years of evolution (cf. solid curves in Fig. 1 and 2). See text.The three particle sizes plotted in black in Fig. 3 as afunction of semi-major axis are r∗ (dashed curve), the sizeof the largest migrator rL (dotted curve) and the migratorsize 〈rL〉 where the bulk of the total mass is located (solidcurve). 〈rL〉 ∼ r∗ over much of the disk because largerparticles are most likely destroyed, but some do reach up tosizes rL in small numbers. These also happen to be the fastestmigrators which can drift inwards and grow larger. By thetime these particles reach the highly enhanced EF region, theyare not easily fragmented (though smaller migrators are), andcan potentially grow to much larger sizes. This explains thesharp increase in rL (up to as high as ∼ 20 m) and 〈rL〉 near10 AU.Conclusions: We have found that the influence of an (waterice) EF can lead to (1) enhancements in fractional mass ofsolids by 1 − 2 orders of magnitude near the EF, and (2) thecomposition outside the EF becomes increasingly icier locallyand globally out to & 100 AU. We expect that in a full disksimulation in which there are multiple EFs, the radial transportof all constituents over large radial distances will occur. Ourresults may have implications for a number of important problems such as disk mass inferences from mm-cm wavelengthobservations, primary accretion of asteroids and TNOs, and anumber of puzzles from the meteorite record. Enrichment ofthe outer nebula in water may raise the possibility that someouter solar system objects are icier than “cosmic”.This work is supported by a grant from the Origins of SolarSystems (OSS) program.References [1] Wadhwa and Russell, 2000.
