SPECTRAL MIXTURE ANALYSIS AS A TOOL FOR CHARACTERIZING THE DISTRIBUTION OF VESTA’S OLIVINE-RICH MATERIAL. L. C. Cheek1 and J. M. Sunshine1, 1Department of Astronomy, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742 (Lcheek@astro.umd.edu).  Introduction:  Recent analyses of Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIR) data from the Dawn mission [1] revealed isolated areas on the asteroid 4 Vesta that contain sufficient quantities of olivine to be spectrally detected within a pyroxene-rich lithology [2]. The reported detections do not occur in within the large basins thought to have excavated deep crustal or mantle lithologies, which may have been expected if the material were a direct remnant of primary magma ocean crystallization [3,4]. Rather, current identifications of the olivine-rich lithology are in near-surface materials exposed by Bellicia and Arruntia craters in the northern hemisphere, possibly indicating the presence of differentiated plutons at shallow levels within the crust [4,5]. In this work, we explore in detail the geologic context of the olivine-rich lithology at Bellicia and Arruntia craters using both VIR [6] and the multispectral imaging Framing Camera (FC) [7] data. Our goal is not only to characterize the local spatial distribution of this spectrally distinct lithology, but also to identify any mineralogic signatures of the associated materials that may provide further clues as to its petrogenetic origin. To do so, we will integrate the higher spatial resolution FC data with the VIR spectra within the Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA; [8]) framework [9] to provide more complete spectral information for the Bellicia/Arruntia area at the scale of the FC images. Here, we report on an initial spatial and spectral analysis using FC data that provides excellent spatial resolution and coverage for the area and successfully distinguishes the VIR-identified olivine-rich lithology from more typical background materials.  Background:  Vesta has been well-studied by both remote sensing [e.g. 10,11] and laboratory analyses of the large HED meteorite suite (see [12]). These coordinated efforts describe Vesta as a differentiated asteroid consisting of lower crustal diogenites (orthopyroxenites with shorter wavelength pyroxene bands), upper crustal eucrites (cumulate or basaltic plagioclase-pyroxene rocks with longer wavelength pyroxene bands) and howardites, which are brecciated physical mixtures of the other two lithologies. Olivine typically occurs as a significant component only in some diogenites, and is not readily observed in HED spectra [13]. Dawn’s high spatial resolution data of Vesta itself revealed that the surface appears dominated by howardite, and small variations in the positions of the pyroxene absorptions suggest localized areas enhanced in either eucritic or diogenitic components [14]. Olivine was identified in the Bellicia-Arruntia region by VIR data due to 1) a shift of the ~1 µm band to longer wavelengths, 2) suppression of the reflectance peak between the two pyroxene bands, and 3) unchanged ~2 µm band position [2].  Data and Methods:  The current work investigates a mosaic of FC images for the northern hemisphere region containing Bellicia and Arruntia craters (Fig. 1). We use spectral mixture analysis (SMA) as a method for describing the spatial distribution of the spectrally olivine-bearing lithology in a given scene. SMA is a spectral image analysis technique commonly used to describe an unknown spectrum as a linear combination of a set of key spectral endmembers [8]. Here, we use a program that automatically identifies a set of possible endmembers (EMs) from the FC mosaic, taking into account both the magnitude of the resulting root mean square (RMS) error across the image, and the spatial extent of pixels that can be reasonably modeled by that EM [15]. A final set of EMs is selected by the user. The present work does not attempt to quantitatively constrain the abundance of materials, which would require a nonlinear model to account for intimate mixing.  Initial Results:  We have selected three spectral endmembers from the FC image using the method described above. Endmember spectra are shown in Fig. 2a, and their fractional abundances modeled throughout the scene (all stretched linearly from 0 to 1) are shown in Fig. 3. EM A (blue in Fig. 2a) is representative of typical background material and is consistent with a Figure 1. Framing Camera mosaic used in the analysis. Figure 2.

generally howarditic composition. This material is particularly enhanced within the proximal Arruntia ejecta. EM B (green in Fig. 2a) represents an olivine-rich lithology with a spectral band minimum that falls at longer wavelengths than is covered by FC. Spectra within the eastern wall of Bellicia and a number of locations within the Arruntia walls are modeled by relatively high proportions of the olivine-rich EM B, as well as much of the more distal Arruntia ejecta. Interestingly, the RMS image in Fig. 3d shows that much of the material modeled with relatively high (although not the highest) proportions of the olivine endmember have high error, suggesting that an additional endmember may be necessary to fully describe the spectral properties. The third EM, EM C is similar to the generic howarditic EM A, except for the presence of a notable absorption in the 0.55 µm bandpass. Although the strength of this feature appears exaggerated in the FC data, this is a real spectral signature that may be indicating the presence of Cr3+ in pyroxene [16]. An example of this feature in VIR data is shown by the orange spectrum in Fig. 2b. These materials are enhanced within the bright material in the southeastern wall of Bellicia, and appear to be associated with the degraded crater on its southern rim, although they also occur in more moderate proportions throughout background soils in the image.  Discussion:  This preliminary analysis demonstrates that SMA can be used to model enhanced proportions of an olivine-rich spectral endmember in the wall of Bellicia crater and in the more distal (shallowlyderived) Arruntia ejecta, which is consistent with a shallow crustal origin for these materials. The spectral distinction between Arruntia ejecta occurring close to the crater versus more distal materials is compelling, but the relatively high RMS error for much of the ejecta and surrounding material motivates more detailed study of this region in particular to search for additional endmembers. Nonetheless it appears that olivine is a shallow enhancement in the region.  The identification of a ~0.55 µm absorption in the region is also an important result. Coordinated petrologic and spectral analyses by [16] indicate that Cr-rich pyroxene in unbrecciated eucrites displaying a similar absorption are relatively primitive and thermally unaltered - the authors further suggested that the Cr3+ feature in spectral data may be used to identify petrologically important primitive materials from remote sensing data. An initial global search for these materials using FC data [17] did not identify a widespread Cr-rich component, suggesting that their detection in association with enhanced olivine abundances at Bellicia may indeed be suggestive of a unique, near-surface primitive lithology, possibly an indication of late stage serial magmatism.
