ESKERS IN IRELAND, ANALOGS FOR MARS LANDFORMS.  X.M. Pellicer1 and M. Bourke2, 1Geological Survey of Ireland, Beggars Bush, Haddington Road, Dublin 4, Ireland (Xavier.pellicer@gsi.ie), 2Department of Geography, Trinity College, Dublin 2, Ireland.   Introduction:  High resolution images of the Martian surface has allowed the identification of a number of ridge-like features inferred as putative esker ridges in Argyre Planitia [1, 2, 3], Dorsa Argentea [4], Isidis Planitia [5, 6], Rahway Vallis [7], Utopia Planitia [8], Chryse Planitia [9],Noachis Terra and north of Deuteronilus Mensae [10]. The name Esker is derived from the Irish word "eiscir" meaning ridge or elevation separating two plains or depressed surfaces. Eskers cover several hundred kilometres of the Irish landscape and are one of the dominant landforms in the Irish Midlands. (Fig. 1). Several well exposed stratigraphic sections and the body of existing knowledge due to extensive research carried out on these features [e.g. 11, 12, 13, 14] make the Irish eskers an excellent analog for the esker-like ridges identified in Mars.      The Irish Eskers: Irish eskers are 0.1 - 80 km long, 20 - 500 m wide and 4 - 50 m high. These were laid down by glacial meltwater in tunnels and crevasses in stationary or retreating ice sheets, and are long, narrow, sinuous ridges. They are commonly composed of sands and gravels with rounded boulders and cobbles. Clasts are usually much larger overall than in other glaciofluvial deposits. The gravels are usually bedded, the beds often slump towards the flank of the esker, indicating collapse as the confining ice walls. There are 4 types of eskers in Ireland [12]:  (i) Continuous subglacial tunnel fill represents deposition within tunnels underneath or within an ice body originally used as water escape conduits. When there is a blockage of the tunnel perhaps because of ice collapse, large boulders become trapped within the tunnel. Sediment carried by the water in the tunnel accumulates at the front of the blockage and a ridge starts forming, pro-grading upstream. Sediments can range from well-sorted to very poorly-sorted depending on the hydraulic conditions at the time of deposition. Classically, such deposits are, for the most part, very coarse and may in extreme cases contain boulders up to 5 metres in diameter.  (ii) Continuous fluvial ice-channel fill is deposited in channels cut into the ice on top of the glacier or down to the substrate and are subsequently infilled by sediment. Thus the sediment is either deposited on ice and subsequently lowered to the substrate by ice melt, or deposited directly on the substrate between ice walls. This type, can form components of eskers that are largely tunnel fill deposits.  They also occur on higher ground that emerged through the ice sheet as it is downwasted.  (iii) Long beads - subglacial tunnel fill are segmented ridges or beads representing sequential deposition near or at the ice margin as the ice sheet retreats. Long beads are defined by the ratio of their length to their width, usually in the range of 5:1 to 10:1. They are often distinct landforms and are of a uniform size along their length. They are usually offset and may exist as multiple parallel ridges.  (iv) Short beads are deposited within a lake. These have been interpreted as sequential deposition of icecontact subaqueous outwash fans below the water surface or up to the water surface level. Having reached surface level, these become equivalent to deltas.   Analogue Potential: Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) surveys carried out on the Irish eskers and their associated sediments (e.g. subaqueous fans, glaciodeltaic sediments) permitted the identification of paleocurrents  Fig 1: Spatial distribution of esker ridges in Ireland (black line).

based on cross-bedding dip and direction. These data assisted in developing models of deglaciation for the Irish ice domes [14]. The four categories of esker in Ireland described above have unique attributes that distinguish them from eachother and can be used to indicate formative environmental conditions. As Irish eskers have significant morphological similarities with those identified on Mars (Fig. 2) they provide an opportunity for an insightful morphological and morphometric analysis to determine potential formative environments on Mars.     Putative Martian eskers are 2-300 km long, 503000 m wide and 10-150 m high. The Irish eskers are similar in scale and present dimensions within these ranges.  Eskers in Ireland are composed of sand and gravel with cobbles and boulders [11, 12]. Mars esker-like ridges observed on high resolution imagery also show presence of large boulders [3]. Similar to Mars, eskers in Ireland are generally located in low relief areas and are often associated with glaciolacustrine deposits. Some Midland sites in Ireland are hypothesised to have formed in association with a glacial lake during deposition. The presence of large glacial lakes during ice withdrawal aided to the outstanding preservation of these features [14]. This permits the cataloguing of 'pristine' morphologies and morphometries. The shape and sedimentary composition coupled with the excellent preservation of esker ridge morphology is strongly conditioned by their relative position to the ice mass and the topographic setting [12]. Esker-like ridges identified on Mars are similarly located in  regions of low relief and depressions [1, 4, 5, 7, 8]. Thus, showing similar topographic conditions to those in Ireland. These depressions may have potentially held water bodies, which would have helped to the preservation of these ridges and are of interest to discovering Mars potential habitability environments.  There are several reports of eskers trending up-slope on Mars [e.g., 3, 6, 10], similar to those in Ireland [14].  A throughout investigation of the Irish eskers as Mars analogs using remote sensing methods and GPR will contribute to the understanding of ridge-like features identified on the surface of Mars.
