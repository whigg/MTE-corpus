Introduction:  Photometric parameters are related to chemical (composition),  physical properties of the surface materials (particle size, particle shape (from round to angular), particle internal heterogeneity) and their organization (compaction state and macroscopic roughness). These parameters are useful to characterize geological terrains and to have information on the geological context of the surface materials such as the history of their formation, transportation, deposit and modification. The present work focuses on the determination of the surface photometric parameters at Mars Exploration Rover (MER) Opportunity landing site at Meridiani Planum with interesting implications for rover trafficability issues. Methodology:  Taking into account the capability of CRISM (Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars) on-board MRO (Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter) to provide multi-angle images [1], we estimate the surface bidirectional reflectance after aerosols correction using the Multi-angle Approach for Retrieval of Surface Reflectance from CRISM Observations technique (MARS-ReCO) [2]. Fernando et al. [3] proposed an approach to estimate the photometric parameters of the surface materials in terms of structural information by using the Hapke's photometric model [4] in a Bayesian framework that considers: the single scattering albedo ω, macroscopic roughness θbar, particle phase function with a 2-term HenyeyGreenstein function that includes the asymmetric parameter b and the backscattering fraction c, and opposition effect with its width h and magnitude B0. The surface photometric maps are at 750 nm with a spatial resolution of about 200m/pixel. This methodology is applied at MER-Opportunity landing site where in situ and orbital observations are available providing complementary information on surface composition and texture from millimeter- to meter- scales. These information allow us to validate and to discuss in the geological interpretations. In this abstract, we show the single scattering albedo parameter ω map as an example, related to the composition and the particle size distribution. The parameters b, c, and θ-bar were estimated and are presented in [5].Geological context and results: The MEROpportunity landed in the Plains,  Hematite-bearing (Ph) unit composed of patches light-toned sedimentary materials (etched terrain, ET2) visible in some areas in high spatial resolution images, overlain by an unconsolidated veneer of crystalline hematite bearing (plains mantle, Pm) detected by the TES instrument on-board MGS [6,7]. Spatial variations of the ω values (Figure 1b) are observed as a function of the geological units visible in CRISM (cf. Figure 1a) and HiRISE observations: •  aeolian ripples, mainly composed of dark-toned materials, associated with the lowest ω values (ωCRISM ≃ 0.55 − 0.60, σ ≤ 0.10), •  bright-toned outcrops, observed in the aeolian ripple troughs, associated with regions with the highest ω values (ωCRISM ≃ 0.65, σ ≤ 0.10),•  dark-toned outcrops, observed in the Botany Bay areas in bordure of the Endeavour crater where hydrated bedrocks were detected by CRISM [8], associated with regions with the lowest ω values (ωCRISM ≃ 0.45, σ ≤ 0.10),•  mantle of dark-toned materials in the Endeavour crater floor, associated with the lowest ω values (ωCRISM ≃ 0.45, σ ≤ 0.10),•  bright-toned materials,  observed in the Endeavour crater floor, associated with higher ω than surrounding but lower than the bright-toned outcrops observed in area A (ωCRISM ≃ 0.60, σ ≤ 0.10). Interpretations: The ω parameter value is proportional to the absorption coefficient. The optical constants (real n, and imaginary k) were found for basalt (n=1.52, k=0.0011) [9], dust (n=1.50, k=0.001) [10], hematite (n=2.805, k=0.03478) [11] and sulfate (n=1.5, k=0.00001)  [12] at the studied wavelength (750 nm). We note that the hematite mineral has the highest k coefficient and the sulfate mineral the lowest k coefficient. Thus, hematite mineral will appear darker than sulfate mineral for same size particle. These are consistent with the CRISM ω  results where the lowest ω  values are observed in aeolian ripples of mainly hematitic concretions without sulfate-rich bright-toned outcrops and where the highest ω  values are observed in regions associated with sulfate-rich bright-toned outcrops. The ω parameter value is also inversely proportional to the particle size: for a given material, finer particles show higher ω values compared to their 1473.pdf

coarser counterparts. In situ images from Pancam and MI provide constraints on the particle size of each component: (i) basaltic materials, characterized by sand-sized particles (from 50 to 150 µm),  (ii) hematitic concretions, dominated by a particle size around 1-2 mm and (iii) sulfate rocks, composed of moderate rounded well-sorted sand grains (from 0.2 to 1 mm) forming mm-scale laminations, fine-grained and coarser cement crystals, cm-sized vugs, and 3- to 5mm sized hematitic spherules embedded within the outcrops and (iv) dust characterized by fine grains (<4 µm in diameter) that settled from the atmosphere (e.g., [13], [14], [15], [16]). The millimeter in size of the hematitic concretions accentuates the decrease of the ω values and the fine-grained size of the cement crystals in the outcrops,  the fine-grained size of basalt, and the fine-grained size of dust accentuates the increase of the ω values.Conclusion: The ω value difference between both etched terrains (bright- and dark-toned outcrops, cf. Figure 1a) can be explained by the presence of coarser particles in the dark-toned etched terrains suggesting a different geological history (formation, deposition and evolution). Other photometric parameter maps such as the phase function parameters, and the surface roughness will also be discussed [5]. References: [1] S. Murchie et  al., J. Geophys. Res., 112, 2007, [2] X.
