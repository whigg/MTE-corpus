Introduction: High-resolution near-infrared observations of carbon monoxide (CO) gas in absorption have been shown to be powerful tools for the precise derivation of C and O isotope ratios toward solar-type, low-mass protostars within ∼ 1 kiloparsec (kpc) of the Sun [1-3]. Results thus far have revealed signatures of CO self shielding - supportive evidence for this process on disk surfaces [2,3,6] - and significant heterogeneity in [12CO]/[13CO], with possible interplay between CO ice and gas reservoirs as a cause [3-5,6]. Precise ratios of [12C18O]/[12C17O] toward low-mass young stellar objets (YSOs) have also been used to argue for supernova enrichment in the early solar system [7], and our recent comparison between low-mass binary systems and embedded protostars suggest carbon isotopic homogeneity within a few hundred AU [6]. As part of our new observational survey of massive YSOs, we present initial results of CO isotopologue abundances toward the highly luminous (∼ 7×104LSun) protostar AFGL 2136 in the Juggler Nebula, ∼2 kpc from the Sun and a Galactocenteric radius (RGC) of 6.1 kiloparsecs (kpc). We compare these results to other CO reservoirs in this and similar YSOs. Unlike most low-mass objects, bright, massive protostars are observational tracers of regions with high-UV fluxes and several isotopic systems, and span a larger range in RGC. Our new COGas values provide robust comparisons to solid CO and CO2 reservoirs along the same lines of sight, shedding light on key protostellar chemical pathways [8,9]. Observations and Methods: Fundamental (v = 1 − 0) and first overtone (v = 2 − 0) spectra toward five massive protostars were obtained with the NIRSPEC instrument (R∼ 25, 000) on the Keck II Telescope (Mauna Kea, HI). Spectra were reduced using our customized IDL pipeline; portions of these for AFGL 2136 are shown in Figure 1. The (v = 1 − 0) 12C16O lines are saturated and show complex profiles, so (v = 2− 0) lines are used for analyzing 12C16O. Equivalent widths (Wν) were determined using a polynomial + Gaussian fit to each isotopologue line (examples in Figure 1). For 12C18O and 12C17O lines, column densities for each rovibrational line (NJ ) were calculated directly using the optically-thin relation, Wν = (πe 2/mec2)fJNJ [10], with fJ representing the absorption oscillator strength for the J th transition.

A preliminary curve of growth using a fixed temperature of 130 K (slightly higher than 12C18O following trends found in our earlier data), is shown in Figure 2 (bottom). Total column densities were derived from the rotational analysis (Figure 2 (top), which assumes a Boltzmann distribution for the gas [1-3, 14]). Results and discussion: An initial [12CO]/[13CO] of ∼ 76±8 for AFGL 2136 is plotted against RGC of ∼ 6.1 kpc (Figure 3). Unlike the dispersion found in our low-mass sources (RGC∼ 8kpc), AFGL 2136 follows the predicted Galactic trend for [12C/13C], consistent with the pattern found in solid [12CO2]/[13CO2] toward other massive protostars [8]. Further, the [12CO]/[13CO] of ∼ 76 ± 8 is lower than the solid [12CO2]/[13CO2] of 107±8 for this object [8], following the systematic trend suggested for a few other massive protostars[8]. We find a [12C16O]/[12C18O] of ∼ 1700 ± 180, suggesting that CO self shielding may be influencing the oxygen ratios, yet without a robust abundance of [12C17O] a mass-independent trend cannot be determined.

These results so far support the potential observational trend between CO ice and [12CO]/[13CO] gas as a possible explanation for the [12CO]/[13CO] dispersion seen in our low-mass sample. Continued analysis of our data will help further evaluate these potential trends. Conclusions: Preliminary results for [12CO]/[13CO] toward the massive YSO AFGL 2136 suggest that massive protostars may show less carbon isotopic dispersion in distinct molecular reservoirs than found in low-mass objects. Our findings support the possible interplay between CO ice and gas seen in our low-mass sample, as well as the possible real isotopic discrepancy between COGas and CO2(Ice) in massive objects. This ongoing survey of massive protostars should help constrain the evaluation of protostellar C and O reservoirs - links to key chemical pathways in these evolving systems.
