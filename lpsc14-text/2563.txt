Results thus far have revealed signatures ofCO self shielding - supportive evidence for this process on disk surfaces [2,3,6] - and significant heterogeneity in [12CO]/[13CO], with possible interplay between CO ice and gas reservoirs as a cause [3-5,6].Precise ratios of [12C18O]/[12C17O] toward low-massyoung stellar objets (YSOs) have also been used to argue for supernova enrichment in the early solar system[7], and our recent comparison between low-mass binary systems and embedded protostars suggest carbonisotopic homogeneity within a few hundred AU [6].As part of our new observational survey ofmassive YSOs, we present initial results of COisotopologue abundances toward the highly luminous(∼ 7×104LSun) protostar AFGL 2136 in the JugglerNebula, ∼2 kpc from the Sun and a Galactocentericradius (RGC) of 6.1 kiloparsecs (kpc). We comparethese results to other CO reservoirs in this and similarYSOs. Unlike most low-mass objects, bright, massiveprotostars are observational tracers of regions withhigh-UV fluxes and several isotopic systems, and spana larger range in RGC. Our new COGas values providerobust comparisons to solid CO and CO2 reservoirsalong the same lines of sight, shedding light on keyprotostellar chemical pathways [8,9].Observations and Methods: Fundamental (v =1 − 0) and first overtone (v = 2 − 0) spectra toward five massive protostars were obtained with theNIRSPEC instrument (R∼ 25, 000) on the Keck IITelescope (Mauna Kea, HI). Spectra were reduced using our customized IDL pipeline; portions of these forAFGL 2136 are shown in Figure 1. The (v = 1 − 0)12C16O lines are saturated and show complex profiles,so (v = 2− 0) lines are used for analyzing 12C16O.Equivalent widths (Wν) were determined using apolynomial + Gaussian fit to each isotopologue line(examples in Figure 1). For 12C18O and 12C17O lines,column densities for each rovibrational line (NJ ) werecalculated directly using the optically-thin relation,Wν = (pie2/mec2)fJNJ [10], with fJ representingthe absorption oscillator strength for the J th transition.A rotational analysis (Figure 2, top) of the more robust12C18O lines was used to constrain a temperature in806040204.7404.7354.7304.725outflowP(8)12C16OP(7)12C16O(p= 1 - 0)Keck-NIRSPECP(1)12C17OR(6)12C18OR(4)12C18OR(3)13C16OR(4)13C16ORGC ~ 6.1 kpcdSun ~ 2 kpcR(5)13C16OWavelength (µm)FluxJuggler NebulaMassive Protostar AFGL 21360.80.70.60.52.3702.3652.3602.355P(9)P(8)P(7)P(6)P(5)P(4)Wavelength (µm)Flux(p= 2 - 0)Keck-NIRSPEC12C16O overtoneMassive protostar AFGL 2136Figure 1: Portions of CO fundamental rovibrational bandstoward the massive protostar, AFGL 2136, obtained withKeck-NIRSPEC.

A preliminary curve of growth using a fixed temperature of130 K (slightly higher than 12C18O following trendsfound in our earlier data), is shown in Figure 2 (bottom). Total column densities were derived from therotational analysis (Figure 2 (top), which assumes aBoltzmann distribution for the gas [1-3, 14]).Results and discussion: An initial [12CO]/[13CO]of∼ 76±8 for AFGL 2136 is plotted against RGC of∼6.1 kpc (Figure 3). Unlike the dispersion found in ourlow-mass sources (RGC∼ 8kpc), AFGL 2136 followsthe predicted Galactic trend for [12C/13C], consistent with the pattern found in solid [12CO2]/[13CO2]toward other massive protostars [8]. Further, the[12CO]/[13CO] of ∼ 76 ± 8 is lower than the solid[12CO2]/[13CO2] of 107±8 for this object [8], following the systematic trend suggested for a few other massive protostars[8]. We find a [12C16O]/[12C18O] of∼ 1700 ± 180, suggesting that CO self shielding maybe influencing the oxygen ratios, yet without a robustabundance of [12C17O] a mass-independent trend cannot be determined.

These results so far support the potential observational trend between CO ice and [12CO]/[13CO]gas as a possible explanation for the [12CO]/[13CO]dispersion seen in our low-mass sample. Continuedanalysis of our data will help further evaluate these potential trends.Conclusions: Preliminary results for[12CO]/[13CO] toward the massive YSO AFGL2136 suggest that massive protostars may showless carbon isotopic dispersion in distinct molecularreservoirs than found in low-mass objects. Ourfindings support the possible interplay between COice and gas seen in our low-mass sample, as wellas the possible real isotopic discrepancy betweenCOGas and CO2(Ice) in massive objects. This ongoingsurvey of massive protostars should help constrain theevaluation of protostellar C and O reservoirs - links tokey chemical pathways in these evolving systems.References: [1]Brittain S.D. et al.
