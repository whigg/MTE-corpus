NEW LOCATIONS OF FE-MG-SPINEL-BEARING LITHOLOGIES ON THE MOON AS REVEALED BY CHANDRAYAAN-1 MOON MINERALOGY MAPPER (M3) OBSERVATIONS.  Mamta  Chauhan, Satadru Bhattacharya and  Prakash Chauhan,  Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad - 380 015, India (satadru78@yahoo.co.in).         Introduction:  One of the major contributions of Chandrayaan-1 mission is the discovery of spinelbearing lithologies on the Moon [1]. Spinel is found mostly in two geological settings – 1) along the basin rings/crater rims of large impact basins/craters and 2) in the central peaks of complex craters with or without mafic silicates and have so far been reported from both the near and the far side [1-10] of the Moon. Apart from pink-spinel anorthosites, spinel has also been found in association with noritic, dunitic and troctolitic lithologies. However, the petrogenesis of these spinel-bearing lithologies is not yet completely understood. It is therefore important to document the global distribution of these newly discovered rocks in order to understand the extent of these lithological entities and also to constrain the bulk composition of the lunar mantle and lower crust. Here we report the detection of new spinel-bearing exposures at three different locations on the Moon as shown in Figure 1 based on Chandrayaan-1 Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) data [11].       Figure 1.  Location of new spinel-bearing lithologies on the Moon.      Observations: At crater Letronne, pure Mg-spinelrich surface exposures have been detected at the  southern edge along the rim of the crater and at its central peak  (Figure 2). The reflectance spectra of the detected Mg-spinels are displayed in Figure 2b showing a characteristic 2000-nm absorption  feature that lack a 1000-nm mafic feature. The detected Mg-spinel exposures occur within the anorthositic terrain (blue colour, Figure 2). At Montes Teneriffe we have observed a prominent 2000-nm absorption without any detectable 1000-nm feature diagnostic of Mg-spinel and the same has also been found at Mons Pico alongside crystalline plagioclase. To the west of crater Plato, spinel-trocolite-rich exposure is found along the inner flank of a crater as shown in Figure 3c. Crater Moretus is a complex  crater  in  the South Pole Atkin region, lying south of crater Short. The central peak of this crater shows exposures of Fe-Mg spinels. These Fe-Mg-spinels occur along the flank of the central peak of the crater in close association with crystalline plagioclase and orthopyroxene-bearing lithologies. Discussions: The geological setting of most of the reported Fe-Mg-spinel is similar, being either associated with the feldspathic terrain at the margin of basins/crater rims or exposed on the central peaks. The semicircular relief feature and the central protruding ridge of crater Letronne represents the remnant highlands. The spinel exposures at crater Letronne are located at the southern edge of the crater rim and at the central peak. Previous study using Clementine  data revealed the presence of iron anomaly in its topographic highs, suggesting excavation of pre-existing mafics prior to impact induced flooding of the basin by basalts [12]. Mons Pico and Montes Teneriffe are isolated series of ridges lying in the northern part of Mare Imbrium basin near Sinus Iridium.  Their  geological setting also suggest them to be remnants of  highlands later affected by basaltic flooding. The crater Moretus is a complex crater with impact originated central peak and spinel-bearing exposures are located at its peak.  Association of Mg-spinel in anorthositic setting represent Pink spinel anorthosites and with an increase in the mafic content, the composition moves towards spinel-norite/spinel-troctolite, and thus belongs to Mg-suite of rocks, which are differentiated products formed by crust-mantle interactions and embedded in the deep crust in the form of layered intrusions [1,13,14,15]. The Mg-spinels exposures on the crustal highland rims and on the central peaks of the crater thus represent the sample of deeply-embedded layered plutons, excavated either by an earlier basin forming event or impacts. 1829.pdf

Conclusion: The study of the occurrences and  distribution of these newly discovered mafic components of upper mantle/lower crustal affinity has significant  petrological implications, which will help in better   understanding the lunar crustal stratigraphy and will provide better constraints on the bulk composition of the lunar mantle. Apart from the above mentioned locations, we have also reported the presence of FeMg-spinel at Sinus Iridium along its rims and terraces (Abstract in this LPSC-2014).  References: [1] Pieters C.
