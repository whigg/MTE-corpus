It has been mapping the infrared emission from the Moon using seven spectral channels that span a wavelength range from 7.55 to 400 Âµm at a spatial resolution of ~200 m, including the first radiometric measurements of surface temperatures at the lunar poles. Diviner's surface-temperature maps have revealed the existence of widespread surface and near-surface regions that extend beyond the boundaries of persistent shadow [2]. Large areas of the lunar polar regions are currently cold enough to cold-trap water ice as well as a range of both more volatile and less volatile species. Due to their low obliquity and rough topography these high latitude regions have been shown to never receive direct sunlight. In absence of other sources, the only effect that balances the surface thermal emission is then the heat flow rate from the warmer lunar interior [3]. To constrain models for the prevalence of volatile species and lunar heat flow, the lowest temperatures as measured by Diviner can be used. Channel 9,  with its range from 100 to 400 micron provides these lowest temperature measurements. For this channel a minimum observed temperature of less than 20 K in winter season nighttime brightness temperatures, observed in the north polar Hermite Crater, was reported in [4].  Ongoing efforts to produce a Diviner foundation data set with an improved calibration of the Diviner data and easier accessible moon temperature map products currently show more realistic minimum temperatures for the coldest areas on the moon as shown in Fig. 1.Methodology:  Several double-shadowed regions (shadowed from first-order scattering) have been defined at the lunar south pole for further study (Fig. 3). Regions 1, 3 and 5 have been considered for this work. First, newly calibrated radiances for these areas were calculated,  then binned in 1-day bins and finally converted to brightness temperatures. The statistics of the binning is indicated in Fig. 2, where the kernel density estimation plots of the samples per 1-day bin indicate the amount of data that went into the binning for the different regions.Results: Formerly reported low temperatures below 20 K can not be confirmed by these data, the minimum spike for region 3 in Fig.1 is believed to be a statistical outlier. The similarity of all three region's brightness temperatures over time supports this stateFig.1 Long time monitoring of three double-shadowed regions at the lunar south pole.  This data shows channel 9 brightness temperatures at the south pole, tightly contstrained by the clat/clon circle shown in Fig. 3, and resampled to a 1-day frequency. (Fig. 2 indicates how many data points end up in these 1-day bins.) Data up to the middle of 2010 has a lower confidence value due to different instrument settings, but still compares well to the later cycles. Differences in oscillating behavior are under investigation, differences in the environment of the regions are thought to contribute to this effect.Fig.2 Kernel density estimation plots of the distribution of samples that went into the 1-day bins for the creation of Fig. 1. Region 1 suffers from a higher number of low entries per day bin, which could contribute to the higher oscillations compared to Region 3 and 5.2893.pdf

ment. A new minimum temperature between 25 and 30 K can be deduced, which is a level that can be attained by thermal models. Short-scale oscillation effects can be seen that are reproducible in thermal models as well, though with a lower amplitude currently.We intend to report on comparisons with thermal models during the conference, including polar maps with newly calibrated data.References: [1] Paige,  D.A. et al.
