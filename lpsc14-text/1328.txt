It uses laser pulses to remove dust and to profile through weathering coatings of rocks up to 7 m away. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) obtains emission spectra of materials ablated from the samples in electronically excited states. Additionally when the plasma cools down, elements can recombine and molecular emission lines are observed. Recent experiments [3] have shown that, when occurring, these molecular emissions  can be much brighter than the associated atomic lines especially when halogens and REE are concerned. We observed these molecular emissions in some of the ChemCam spectra and report the first dectection of chlorine and fluorine with ChemCam. It is also the first time ever that fluorine has been detected on the surface of Mars. Experimental Data: Molecular emission of CaCl was studied in the laboratory using CaCl2. Broad, longlived emission bands were found, with vibrational maxima at 593.5 in the orange part of the CaCl spectrum and at 606.8, 618.8 and 631.4 nm in the red part of the spectrum. The connection with the CaCl molecule was confirmed by the fact that calcium-bearing calcite CaCO3 and chlorine-bearing sylvite KCl do not contain such bands in their breakdown spectra, while their mixture exhibits narrow bands peaking at the same wavelengths as those observed with CaCl2. Sensitivity measurements have been performed. A weak Cl I line peaking at 837.6 nm was detected in pure CaCl2, whose chlorine content is approximately 64%. This peak is not detected in the mixture of CaCO3 with 10% CaCl2. On the other hand, using molecular CaCl emission, Cl was detected not only in this sample, but also in the mixture of CaCO3 with 1% of CaCl2 corresponding to only 0.6 wt% chlorine. For fluorine, CaF2 has been analyzed. The bands at 532.1, 584.5, 603.1 and 623.6 nm are present and assigned to CaF molecular emissions. The band at 603.1 nm is the strongest while the other bands are less intense. The band peaking at 552.3 nm belongs to the green system of the CaO molecule, well known in LIBS and observed in high Ca observation of ChemCam. To prove it further, cryolite (Na3AlF6) with high fluorine content but no calcium, was studied but did not exhibit such bands in its emission spectra. The same was observed for the mineral calcite CaCO3, which is calcium-bearing but without fluorine. The latter spectrum contains only Ca I emission lines and CaO emission bands, peaking at approximately 550 and 623 nm, respectively. The mixture of cryolite and calcite, containing both calcium and fluorine, exhibited CaF bands in its emission spectrum. Molecular CaF and ionic F I detection sensitivity have been compared. To achieve this,  two minerals were used: fluorite with approximately 50% fluorine content and apophyllite with approximately 2%. The strongest F I emission lines at 685.6 and 690.2 nm appeared in the fluorite emission spectra. On the other hand, the mineral apophyllite, with 25 times lower fluorine content than fluorite, did not exhibit F I emission lines but CaF bands were clearly visible. The same is also true of charoite with approximately 0.4 wt% fluorine content. These CaCl and CaF bands are similar to those known in arc-induced plasma [4]. Observations:    Chlorine.  In light of the laboratory data, we have searched for the CaCl band at 593.7 nm and found two ChemCam spectra that match this feature. The feature can unambiguously be attributed to CaCl since no other emission lines are present between 593.0 nm and 594.0 nm. The two spectra are the ninth point of the Crest target acquired on Sol 125 and the ninth point of Measles Point target acquired on Sol 305. These two observations are characterized by a very high calcium concentration and show evidence for sulphur lines [5]. No other high calcium spectra with sulphur lines show this molecular feature. The presence of the Cl I emission line at 837.8 nm is perhaps visible on the Crest-9 spectrum. Finally, these two observations, in contrast to the other sulphur-rich samples show evidence for high sodium content, making NaCl a possible phase for the detected chlorine that recomibine in the plasma with the calcium to form the observed molecular line.  Fluorine. At least 20 ChemCam observations exhibit molecular emissions identical to those ascribed to CaF molecular emission have been observed. However, the magnitude of the feature at 603 nm is variable and among these 20 observations many do not exhibit the corresponding feature at 533.0 nm because either it is too weak to be visible or it is absent. However, the shape of the 603 nm band makes the identification of fluorine unambiguous. The strongest signature is found in the fifth point on Epworth soil that was observed on Sol72 [6]. Epworth-5 contains a relative large amount of fluorine since the main atomic lines of F I are also 1328.pdf

observed. This spectrum also exhibits phosphorous emission lines at 253.7, 255.4 and 255.5 nm which, on the single shot observation, are correlated with calcium and fluorine making fluor-apatite (Ca5(PO4)3F) the best candidate. However, there is too much fluorine in Epworth 5 for fluor-apatite only. Indeed fluor-apatite contains 3.8 wt% fluorine for 55.6 wt% CaO. The CaO content of Epworth-5 is of the order 14 wt%, 4 times lower. For this CaO content we would expect only  0.5 wt% fluorine if all the calcium were in the fluorapatite. When compared to a pure fluorite spectrum (Fig. 1), preliminary estimate of the fluorine content is about 10 wt%.   Figure 1. Comparison of Epworth-5 spectrum with a pure CaF2 laboratory spectrum obtained under Martian conditions   Consequently the fluorine must be contained in another phase and fluorite (CaF2) is a good candidate. The other observations can be divided into two sets, the first is dominated by relatively high calcium content like the observation points located in the Rocknest unit [7]. Some of the observations belonging to this set also exhibit P I emission lines making fluor-apatite the preferred phase. In many other cases phosphorous is not visible, but fluor-apatite remains the most plausible host phase though the CheMin soil analysis at Rocknest [8] did not indicate the presence of any apatite phases suggesting that the Epworth and Pearson (≤ 1 wt% F)  fluorine observations may be something other than apatite. The second set of spectra is dominated by Al rich and Ca poor points which are essentially represented by the conglomerates Goulburn and Link [9]. In these spectra the Ca is so low that the observed fluorine cannot be borne by a calcium rich phase and it is probably more likely included in an Al rich phase like topaz or muscovite. Both of these are good candidates since, in Link at least, the hydrogen signature is relatively prominent [9].  Results: We report the first detection of fluorine on the surface of Mars and the first dectection of chlorine with ChemCam. Volatiles and especially halogens (F, Cl) have been recently recognized as important species in the genesis and melting of planetary mantle.  On the basis of bulk compositions of SNC meteorites [10] suggested that the Martian mantle is relatively rich in chlorine and fluorine and poor in water.  The Martian meteorites show evidence for high fluorine concentrations in magmatic and secondary minerals. Magmatic inclusions within the SNC meteorites commonly contain magmatic amphibole and micas which can readily accept F up to a concentration of 3 wt% [11]. Apatite is also an ubiquitous late stage magmatic mineral in the SNC meteorites. [12] compared apatite within the SNC meteorites to apatite from terrestrial basalts. They suggested that Martian rocks are water poor compared with terrestrial basalts but contain significant halogen contents. [12], [13] and [14] have observed that there are two populations of apatite: fluorine-rich, waterpoor types found in the melt-inclusions and chlorinerich types found interstially. They concluded that the fluor-apatite formed in a closed system process within the melt inclusions while the chlor-apatite is created via open system fluid migration. In our spectra it must be emphasized that none of the fluorine bearing observations show the presence of chlorine. Further interpretation of these results requires us to assess if apatites are primary magmatic phases or if they have been affected by fluid circulation. If magmatic, the prevalence of fluorine indicates very low partial melting processes in agreement with [15]. The Al-rich fluorine bearing mineralogy encountered in the conglomerates indicate that they result from the alteration of granitic/rhyolitic melts [16]. Future experimental work will be conducted to better quantify the molecular signatures of fluorine and chlorine in order to better constrain their paragenesis. References: [1] Maurice S. et al.
