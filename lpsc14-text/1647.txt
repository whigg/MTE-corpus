Introduction: Life on Earth resulted from a complex interplay of physical processes involving diverse organic compounds. Amino acids are essential organic molecules necessary for evolution of life, but their origins on the early Earth remain unclear. Both aqueousalteration processes in the parent bodies of meteorites [1] and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis in the solar protoplanetary disk have been hypothesized [2] for amino acid formation. In addition, amino acid formation from H2, N2, H2O, CO, CO2, and NH3 gases under irradiation of UV light has also been hypothesized [3, 4].  Recently, it was reported that water and organic molecules can be delivered to the Earth through adsorption onto dust grains within the accretion disk [5, 6]. We hypothesize that adsorption of such molecules onto the surfaces of dust grains can be the precursors for synthesizing more complex molecules like amino acids. This hypothesis is examined using density-functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate surface-catalyzed amino acid formation, in particular the synthesis of the simplest amino acid, glycine. Computational Methods: Calculations were performed using the plane-wave code VASP [7, 8]. The exchange-correlation contribution to the total energy is modeled using the GGA functional of PBE [9]. The electronic interactions are described by Projected Augmented Wave. The cutoff energy for the plane wave expansion is set to 450 eV. The activation barriers are determined by using the Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) method [10]. Results and Discussion: In our previous study [6] it was reported that organic molecules containing carboxylic (-COOH) and amine (-NH2) functional groups could strongly adsorb on different surfaces of olivine, magnesite, spinel and water-ice. It was also shown that these adsorbed molecules could survive conditions that prevailed within the accretion disk. Building on these studies, we investigate the energetics and kinetics of formation of glycine from organic molecules containing -COOH and -NH2 functional groups respectively, catalyzed by olivine surface. We choose olivine to represent a nebular condensate material.   Fig 1. Case (1) in the upper panel and case (2) in the lower panel. The glycine molecule is marked by a circle. See text for details.  Two mechanisms for the formation of glycine are explored namely: (1) carboxylic acid and amine molecules are both individually 1647.pdf

adsorbed on the olivine surface and subsequently react; and (2) only one of these molecules adsorbs to the surface and the other molecule reacts with the adsorbed species. The final product (glycine) from the above two mechanisms is shown in Figure. The energy of formation of glycine is -3.46 eV/mol for case (1), and -1.07 eV/mol for case (2). Here, the formation energy is defined as the adsorption of energy of molecule on the surface. The negative values indicate that glycine synthesis is energetically favorable. Further, from an energetics point of view, case (1) scenario is more favorable; here, both COOH and -NH2 groups of glycine interact strongly with the surface. Specifically, the electronegative N and O atoms within the carboxylic acid and amine functional groups form ionic bonds with undercoordinated electropositive surface Mg atoms in olivine leading to strong binding of the glycine molecule to the olivine surface.  Next, we examine the activation barrier energy (Ea) for the formation of glycine; Ea, for case (1) is 0.35 eV and 3.11 eV for case (2). The much lower Ea in case (1) is due to the fact that the olivine surface greatly influences the reaction kinetics of glycine formation, whereas, for case (2), the reaction pathway is similar to the formation of a glycine molecule in gas-phase. This is further confirmed by calculating the activation barrier of amino-acid formation via reaction of gas-phase carboxylic acid and amine molecules, which is 3.22 eV. In other words, gas-phase synthesis of amino acid is extremely slow. In conclusion, our calculations suggest that formation of glycine, the simplest amino acid, via surface catalysis is energetically favored (exothermic). Further, the surface catalyzed glycine molecule is very strongly bonded to the surface of olivine, and from an energetics view point, will be stable at conditions corresponding to that which prevailed within the accretion disk [11]. In addition, the olivine surface significantly lowers the activation barrier for the formation of amino acids indicating that such surface-catalyzed synthesis is a viable mechanism for an endogenous source of the molecules that could have given rise to life on Earth.
