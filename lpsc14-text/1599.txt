EFFECT OF TITANIUM ABUNDANCE ON SILICA VS. IRON ENRICHMENT IN LUNAR BASALTS: MODELING & COMPARISON WITH NORTHWEST AFRICA 773.  T. J. Fagan1, 1Department of Earth Sciences, Waseda University, 1-6-1 Nishiwaseda, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan (fagan@waseda.jp).     Introduction:  Lunar basalts exhibit a wide range of Ti-concentrations [1-3].  High-Ti concentrations lead to early stability of Ti-rich oxides, whereas in low-Ti and very low Ti (VLT) liquids, Ti-oxides form at late stages of crystallization [1,4].  Consequently, fractional crystallization of a high-Ti basaltic liquid results in Ti-depletion as Fe# (molar Fe/[Fe+Mg]x100) increases; in contrast, TiO2 concentrations and Fe# both increase during crystallization of low-Ti and VLT basalts (e.g., [1]).   This study makes use of:  (1) pyroxene Fe# and Ti# (molar Ti/[Ti+Cr]x100) to show that many clasts of the Northwest Africa 773 (NWA 773) lunar breccia crystallized during progressive increasing Fe# and Ti#, as expected for a VLT parent; and (2) MELTS [5] models to evaluate the effects of TiO2 concentrations on FeOenrichment vs. SiO2-enrichment in lunar mare basalts.   Analytical Methods:  The main textural observations and mineral analyses of this study are from one polished thin section of NWA 773, a basaltic lunar breccia with several pairs or related meteorites [6-9].  Mineral analyses and imaging were collected using a JEOL JXA-8900 electron microprobe.  Fractional crystallization models were collected using MELTS [5] at 1 bar, at temperatures decreasing from the liquidus at 5°C intervals until approximately 20% of original liquid was remaining.  Oxygen fugacity was set at the FeFeO buffer—high for lunar conditions, but almost all Fe was speciated as FeO as expected for lunar basalts.  Initial liquid compositions for modeling are from:  Apollo 10024 [10] and 70215 [11] for high-Ti; NWA 032 [12] for low-Ti; NWA 773 "parent" [7] for VLT; Apollo 15405,12 [13] for KREEP basalt.    NWA 773, example of VLT differentiation: All meteorites of the NWA 773 clan have a relatively magnesian (pyroxene Fe# ~25-30) olivine cumulate (OC, [6-9]).  Pyroxenes from pyroxene gabbro clasts in the breccia show a correlated variation from Fe# and Ti# near the OC to much higher values.  Full ranges of Fe# and Ti# from pyroxene gabbro occur in a single zoned clast, in which Fe# and Ti# increase with proximity to late-stage K,Ba-feldspar and K-rich glass (Fig. 1), indicating that Fe# and Ti# increased during magmatic crystallization.  Symplectites composed of fayalite, silica and hedenbergitic pyroxene are interpreted as late-stage rocks.  Alkaline-phase-ferroan clasts are characterized by fayalite, K,Ba-feldspar and/or K-rich glass, ±hedenbergitic pyroxene, and may have formed from alkali-rich ferroan liquids that were immiscible pairs of liquids from which the symplectites formed.   The OC, pyroxene gabbro and symplectite + alkalinephase-ferroan clasts are interpreted as co-magmatic products of differentiation of a VLT parent.    Effect of TiO2 on SiO2- vs. FeO-enrichment: All of the MELTS models show increasing Fe# during fractional crystallization.  The high-Ti basalts show steady increases in SiO2 mirrored by decreasing TiO2, due to fractionation of Ti-rich oxides (Fig. 2a).  In contrast, the low-Ti and VLT basalts do not show significant SiO2 increases or TiO2 decreases until late stages of crystallization. The KREEP basalt always has higher SiO2-concentrations at comparable Fe# in comparison to the mare liquids.    Model results show long intervals of strong FeOenrichment in the low-Ti and VLT basalts (Fig. 2b), which are preceded by a switch from olivine to pyroxene crystallization.  In contrast, the high-Ti and KREEP basalts have either moderate FeO-enrichments or progressive FeO-depletions.  In all of the model liquids, MgO is steadily depleted during fractional crystallization.  Thus the increase in Fe# during crystallization of the high-Ti and KREEP liquids is due more to MgO-depletion rather than FeO-enrichment.   The distinction between strong FeO-enrichment in the low-Ti basalts vs. moderating to depleting FeO in the high-Ti and KREEP liquids is masked by closure when only AFM (A = alkalis Na2O + K2O, F = FeO, M = MgO) components are considered (see [14] for discussion of closure of compositional data).  Most of the mare liquids evolve toward the FeO-apex of an AFM diagram (Fig. 3).  High-Ti basalt 10024 has more K2O than the other mare liquids and progresses toward a more alkaline, but still ferroan composition.  The model KREEP basalt evolves toward the alkali-FeO join of the AFM diagram along a path similar to experiments on the same composition [15]; however, the [15] experiments show that silicate liquid immiscibility occurs at moderate Fe# in the KREEPy liquid (Fig. 3).     Based on the models, TiO2 in lunar basalts plays a role similar to that of oxygen fugacity in some terrestrial magmas.  In terrestrial systems, high f(O2) results in high Fe3+/Fe2+ and can stabilize early Fe-bearing oxide, limiting FeO-enrichment and enhancing SiO2enrichment in residual liquids [16].  In mare basalts, early Fe-oxide can be stabilized by high TiO2.   References: [1] Papike J.J. et al. (1976) Revs. Geophys. Space Phys. 14, 475-540.  [2] Neal C.R. and Taylor L.A.
