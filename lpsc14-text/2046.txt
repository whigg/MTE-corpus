Both predictionshave been supported by the observations of Dawn.However, the origin of the HEDs, which is closelylinked to the differentiation processes, is still a subjectof debate. The formation of the HEDs is controversially discussed and various differentiation scenarios havebeen proposed. One scenario suggests that diogenitesare solid residues from the partial melting of the silicates[1]. Another scenario favoured by geochemicalarguments suggests diogenites being cumulates formedby magma fractionation[2,3]. In the latter case thediogenites could have crystallised either in a globalmagma ocean[2] or in multiple, smaller magma chambers[3]. Here we present results of numerical calculations of the early thermo-chemical evolution of Vesta,taking into account the insights provided by Dawn andplacing constraints on the possible differentiation scenario and on the occurrence and depth of the Vestanmantle magma ocean.Model: We use a numerical heat conduction codethat considers in spherical symmetry accretion, compaction, melting, associated changes of the materialproperties, partitioning of 26Al, advective heat transport, differentiation by porous flow as well as convection and effective cooling in a magma ocean. For meltfractions below the rheologically critical melt fraction(RCMF) of ≈ 50% the heat transport by melt segregation is modelled assuming melt flow in porous mediaand by supplementing the energy balance equationwith additional advection terms[4]. Above the RCMFan effective thermal conductivity keff is computed fromthe convective heat flux in the soft turbulence regime[5]. The parameter keff mimics the vigorous convection and heat flux of the magma ocean with a lowviscosity. We consider instantaneous formation ofVesta (as an approximation of the runaway accretionscenario) and compare the evolution scenarios arisingfrom different formation times t0 (relative to the formation of the CAIs).Results: Our results show that partitioning of 26Aland its transport with the silicate melt is crucial for theformation of a global and deep magma ocean. Previousmodels that neglect the partitioning of 26Al into thesilicate melt[6,7,8] suggest the formation of an internalmagma ocean throughout the whole mantle beneath asolid crust.Figure 1: Temporal evolution of the radial distribution of themelt fraction in Vesta (upper panel) and melt fraction in thesub-surface magma ocean (lower panel) for the formation at0.5 Ma after the CAIs and a melt viscosity of 1 Pa s.We show that in contrast to this previous finding aglobal magma ocean does not form if partitioning of26Al is considered: Radioactive nuclides are enrichedin the melt and relocated towards the surface. In a shallow layer close to the surface temperature, the meltfraction increases rapidly due to the over-production ofthe radiogenic heat. For formation times t0<1.5 Ma, athin shallow convecting magma ocean with a thicknessof 1 to a few tens of km forms above which a basalticcrust forms (see Fig. 1). The lifetime of the shallowmagma ocean is O(104)-O(106) years and convection in2046.pdf

Figure 2: Evolution path of Vesta’s interior assuming partitioning of 26Al.this layer is accompanied by the extrusion of 26Al atthe surface. The interior differentiates from the outsideinward with a mantle that is depleted in 26Al and coreformation is completed within ~0.3 Ma. The lowermantle experiences a maximal melt fraction of 45%suggesting a harzburgitic to dunitic composition.The above findings of a shallow magma oceanstrongly depend on the migration velocity and here themost critical parameter is the silicate melt viscosity –the higher the viscosity, the lower is the migration velocity and the more likely the formation of a globalmagma ocean and vice versa. In the present model, wehave used a silicate melt viscosity of 1 Pas. However,for basaltic melts derived from chondritic precursors,viscosities of ≈1-100 Pa s have been proposed[9]. Further tests with the values of 10 and 100 Pas displaylower melt migration velocities, thicker sub-surfacemagma ocean (e.g. ≈10 km for 10 Pa s in comparisonto 1 km for 1 Pa s) and slower silicate separation. Thecooling of the magma ocean below the RCMF is prolonged to 1 Ma and the layer is entirely crystallizedafter 3 Ma. Higher temperatures are obtained in themantle and in the core, because of the somewhat prolonged radiogenic heating by the slow migrating 26Al.In the extreme case of 100 Pa s, the magma ocean evenextends to the depth of ≈100 km. The rest of the mantle reaches melt fractions close to the RCMF and theiron-rich core, the silicate mantle and the crust fromalmost simultaneously.Conclusions: Our results suggest that most previous thermo-chemical evolution models for Vesta tendto overestimate the temperature increase in the interiorand therefore the amount of partial melting[6,7,8,10].Those models either neglect efficient heat transport bythe partitioning of 26Al into the silicate melt and/orconvection in a magma ocean.Thus, our results contradict the existence of aglobal and deep magma ocean on Vesta but support theformation of non-cumulative eucrites by percolation ofearly partial melt whereas diogenites and cumulateeucrites form by rapid crystallization of a shallowmagma ocean. The latter is consistent to the rapid timescale for magma ocean crystallization of Al-free diogenites from the abundance of 26Mg[2]. Values of thesilicate melt viscosity between 10 to 100 Pas suggestthat the subsurface magma ocean can reach a thicknessup to 100 km. A sub-surface magma ocean with athickness of a few tens of kilometres would in fact beconsistent with the assumption of Vesta’s crust havingan average thickness of 35-85 km with an uppereucritic and a lower orthopyroxene-rich layer[11].Beneath the shallow magma ocean the mantle experiences partial melting of less than 45 %, resulting in aharzburgite mantle. Silicate partial melt is present inthe mantle of Vesta at depth for up to 150 Ma after theCAIs provided early formation of the body. Melt fractions in the core reach values up to 75 % but the core isnot entirely molten during its evolution. As a consequence, we assume that a compositional dynamo contributes to the formation of a magnetic field and mayexplain the remnant magnetisation found in some HEDmeteorites.Acknowledgement: This work was supported bythe Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) PriorityProgramme 1385 “The First 10 Million Years of theSolar System - a Planetary Materials Approach” andby the Helmholtz Association through the researchalliance “Planetary Evolution and Life”.References: [1] Stolper E.
