When wind velocity exceeds the threshold speed, sand particles are mobilized. However, due to Mars' thin atmosphere, the threshold friction speed for movement of fine sand from linear wind shear is several times greater than on Earth [e.g., 1]. Until recently, it was not clear as to whether fields of sand dunes on Mars were actively evolving in the present martian climate [2-4]. The High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) has now acquired multiple sets of images covering  aeolian features at resolutions up to 25 cm/pixel, and with consistent lighting conditions, at intervals of 1 or more martian years. Analysis of these repeat image sets has led to the recent detection of changes and migration of aeolian bedforms (dunes and ripples) in multiple locations, while some locations continue not to show detectable changes [5-9] While such imaging currently exists in only a limited number of locations, preliminary results hint at possible trends in the global distributions of active and inactive bedforms. Here we investigate possible emerging trends in the mobility of bedforms in relation to their general location, elevation, and albedo.  Spatial distribution:  Figure 1 shows the locations of bedforms analyzed for changes. Locations of transverse aeolian ridges (TARs) have not been included due to the lack of evidence for activity in current martian atmospheric conditions [e.g., 10]. Figure 2 shows the latitudinal distribution of currently active and inactive bedforms. The majority of observations in the northern hemisphere indicate movement. This is especially apparent in the high northern latitudes (polar erg) where 100% of the 11 definitive detections indicated movement. Observations in the southern hemisphere show a more even distribution of results with roughly half the locations exhibiting movement and half with no detectable changes. Elevation distribution: An estimated elevation of the dune field and immediate surrounding area was obtained from the label file for the associated HiRISE image pair (Fig. 3). The majority of the bedforms located at low elevations (-1 km and lower) are active while the majority of bedforms at high elevations (2 km and higher) appear to be inactive. At the highest   Figure 1: Mars Orbiter Lasr Altimeter (MOLA) map showing the locations of bedforms analyzed for changes. Black boxes indicate where movement has been detected. White boxes indicate where no movement has been detected (TARs are not included).  elevations in this data set (>4 km), no observations of bedforms showed evidence of movement. Variations in bedform albedo: Albedo was estimated for both active and inactive bedforms, and for TARs (Fig. 4). Using HiVIEW, mean DN values were determined over small areas of representative dune surfaces. Where possible, areas with the lowest surface slope were selected. The mean DN was translated into the radiance factor (I/F) by multiplying by the scaling factor and offset for the HiRISE image and was converted to an estimated Lambert Albedo through division by the cosine of the solar incidence angle (results were not corrected for local slopes or atmospheric effects). Although there is considerable overlap, preliminary results suggest that active bedforms generally have lower albedos, or darker and presumably fresh surfaces, while bedforms with no detectable movement and TARs have generally higher albedos, or brighter surfaces, likely due to dust deposition. Active bedforms show a peak in the distribution of albedo between ~0.10-0.14. Bedforms with no detectable movement show a larger scatter in albedo with two possible peaks between ~0.16-0.20 and ~ 0.22-0.26. The higher of these peaks primarily represents TARs, while the lower albedo peak includes mostly inactive ripples and dunes. Discussion: Locations of active bedforms indicate where sand sources are concentrated and where winds above threshold occur on the surface of Mars.

 Figure 2: The number of observations per 30 degrees of latitude showing movement (green) and no detectable movement (red). The small number of observations from 30° to 60° N is because of the rarity of dunes at these latitudes [11].   Figure 3: Number of observations per kilometer of elevation, (expressed as kilometers above the 6 mbar datum) showing movement (green) and no detectable movement (red).  trends provide potential insight into local and regional conditions most conducive to bedform mobilization on the martian surface. The larger percentage of mobile dunes at low elevations, compared to higher elevations, suggests that the slightly higher atmospheric pressure associated with lower elevations may enable bedforms to move more frequently in the denser atmosphere; threshold friction speed is inversely proportional to the square root of atmospheric density [1,8,12]. In the same way, the general difference in elevation of the northern lowlands and the southern highlands may contribute to the occurences of active bedforms in the northern hemisphere. Indeed, the locations of active bedforms in the northern hemisphere typically occur at lower elevations than the bedforms analyzed in the southern hemisphere (Fig. 1). More specifically, movement detected in the 60-90 degree range may be associated with strong katabatic winds from the high elevation polar cap [13-14] and possibly with the presence of seasonal volatiles [6-7,9,13] (Fig. 2). In contrast, bedforms at high southern latitudes may be stabilized by agents such as ground ice acting over a longer period of time in comparison to the north polar region [15]. The higher albedo surfaces associated with the TARs and bedforms with no detectable movement is likely bright dust that has been deposited and is believed to stabilize dunes [e.g., 1,9] (Fig. 4). Continued monitoring of dune fields on Mars by HiRISE will highlight persisting trends and provide further insight into the relative roles of location, elevation, local surrounding topography and stabilizing agents such as dust deposition, in the global distribution of current bedform activity on Mars.
