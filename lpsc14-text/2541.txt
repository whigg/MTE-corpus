Introduction:  The nature of planetary noble gas carrier (Q) in meteorites remains uncertain. It is known that it is likely carbonaceous [1], but with properties distinct from the bulk meteoritic macromolecular material. Earlier we have shown [2] that Q is less susceptible to thermal parent body metamorphism in reducing conditions than most of other meteoritic carbonaceous matter. If the latter is graphitized, as has happened in the enstatite chondrite parent bodies, the former remains unaffected. In the present study we have tried to reproduce the parent body thermal metamorphism in the laboratory conditions applied to HF/HCl residue from Orgueil in order to see the reaction of Q and other carbonaceous phases to the treatment.  Methods:  All together 3 high-pressure experiments have been done with variable T, P and time: 1) 300 oC, 8GPa, 8 h; 2) 500 oC, 1GPa, 48 h; 3) 700 oC, 1GPa, 24 h. In the first experiment a diamond anvil cell (at the Swiss Light Source) which can accommodate only a few g of the Orgueil residue was used.  Two other HP experiments have been performed, at UCL, employing a piston cylinder apparatus which can accommodate orders of magnitude more sample material. After recovery from the high-pressure devices the samples have been analysed at OU on Finesse machine [2, 3] for C, N and noble gas isotopes simultaneously together with the original untreated sample. We also used micro Raman spectroscopy in order to identify any structural changes in the bulk macromolecular organics of the sample as a result of the high-pressure experiments. Results:  Since in the experiment at 300 oC only ~7 g of the material has been recovered we were not able to perform a detailed stepped combustion; instead only 3 temperature steps have been used. Being not particularly precise for the above reason the data nevertheless indicated that 36 Ar and C release patterns are almost identical. Also we found that ~70% of 36 Ar and ~40% of 132 Xe have been lost. However the Raman spectra and in particular position, relative abundance and width of the D and G bands remained almost identical for the treated and the original samples. For two other experiments the amount of the recovered material was enough for high temperature resolution stepped combustion experiments. We use 100 o increment in the temperature range from 200 to 1400 oC.  For both experiments there is a clear shift of the noble gas release to higher temperature compared with the original sample, and the higher was the temperature of the HP experiment the higher the shift: ~100 o for treated at 500 oC and ~200 o - at 700 oC (Fig. 1a). However, the same temperature shift is observed for carbon release for the samples (Fig. 1b). The concentration of noble gases (except for 4 He) in the sample treated to 500 oC has not significantly changed while for the 700 oC experiment is by a factor of 2 lower than in the original one.  0 2 10 -6 4 10 -6 6 10 -6 8 10 -6 1 10 -5 200 400 600 800 1000 Original Treated at 700 oC 36 Ar, c c/ gTemperature, o Ca) 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 200 400 600 800 1000 Original Treated at 700 oC C y ie ld , % Temperature, oC b) Figure 1.

The material treated at HP also shows a significant difference in Raman spectra compared to that observed for the original one (Fig 2). In particular, the height of the D and G peaks became equal in the sample treated at 700 oC while in the original one the D peak is significantly lower than the G one. In addition the Raman signal intensity increased by an order of magnitude in the sample treated at 700 oC compared to the original one (Fig. 2).  200 300 400 500 600 700 500 1000 1500 2000 Original Raman shift, cm -1 In te ns it y1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 500 1000 1500 2000 700 oC, 1GPa, 24 hIn te ns it yRaman shift, cm -1 Figure 2.

Discussion:  The Raman data indicate that the HP experiment conducted at 700 oC definitely resulted in a certain modification of the organic matter present in the Orgueil HF/HCl residue. The significantly more   intense Raman signal detected in the treated sample suggests that the organic material in the sample became more coarse-grained compared to the original one. The increase of the relative abundance of D band (compared to G) usually points out to a higher degree of disorder of carbonaceous matter. Thus, at 700 oC, 1 GPa and during 24 h the organic material has not been graphitized at any significant degree. Instead, the organics became more amorphous after the HP treatment that is in agreement with the HP experiments applied to pure organic compounds [4]. Probably, graphitization requires a high temperature and/or longer time. The increase of combustion temperature is likely to be associated with the changing in the grain size of the treated material. Approximately half of noble gases have been lost during this HP experiment. However this has not resulted in any significant separation of the organic carbon and the noble gases (Fig. 3). Since the total concentration of C in the treated samples has not reduced but rather increased, the loss of noble gases cannot be explained by oxidation of Q during the HT experiments  because Q and other carbonaceous phases present in the sample are oxidized with molecular oxygen at the same temperature (see Fig. 1). The 36 Ar/C ratio in the treated sample is lower by more than a factor of 3 in the original, but the release profile shows almost the same pattern (Fig. 3). This suggests that combustion temperature of Q and insoluble organic material has changed similarly as the result of the HP experiment. For instance, this could happen if Q became coarser grained in the same extent as the other organics or Q is encaged within the organic matrix and can be combusted only along with the matrix.         0 1 10 -5 2 10 -5 3 10 -5 4 10 -5 5 10 -5 6 10 -5 7 10 -5 0 20 40 60 80 100 Original Treated at 700 oC 36 Ar/ C, cc /g 36 Ar, cumulative % Figure 3.

Conclusions:  Thus, we conclude that Q has lost a significant fraction of its original noble gases during the HP experiment conducted at 700 oC, 1 GPa during 24 h. This has accompanied by a changing in the Q combustion temperature by a similar way as for most of the other carbonaceous phases present in the sample analyzed. In the sense this is not what was expected to happened for the Q combustion T compared to that occurred during parent body metamorphism [2]. However the organic material of the HF/HCl residue was only modified to a certain extent during the HT treatment, but not graphitized as has happened to the organic matter presented in the enstatite chondrites parent bodies. Therefore, until graphitization is not achieved in the laboratory conditions, it is not possible to make a firm conclusion regarding the reaction of Q to the parent body metamorphism.  1.
