Introduction:  The nature of planetary noble gas carrier (Q) in meteorites remains uncertain. It is known that it is likely carbonaceous [1], but with properties distinct from the bulk meteoritic macromolecular material. Earlier we have shown [2] that Q is less susceptible to thermal parent body metamorphism in reducing conditions than most of other meteoritic carbonaceous matter. If the latter is graphitized, as has happened in the enstatite chondrite parent bodies, the former remains unaffected. In the present study we have tried to reproduce the parent body thermal metamorphism in the laboratory conditions applied to HF/HCl residue from Orgueil in order to see the reaction of Q and other carbonaceous phases to the treatment.  Methods:  All together 3 high-pressure experiments have been done with variable T, P and time: 1) 300oC, 8GPa, 8h; 2) 500oC, 1GPa, 48h; 3) 700oC, 1GPa, 24h. In the first experiment a diamond anvil cell (at the Swiss Light Source) which can accommodate only a few g of the Orgueil residue was used.  Two other HP experiments have been performed, at UCL, employing a piston cylinder apparatus which can accommodate orders of magnitude more sample material. After recovery from the high-pressure devices the samples have been analysed at OU on Finesse machine [2, 3] for C, N and noble gas isotopes simultaneously together with the original untreated sample. We also used micro Raman spectroscopy in order to identify any structural changes in the bulk macromolecular organics of the sample as a result of the high-pressure experiments. Results:  Since in the experiment at 300oC only ~7 g of the material has been recovered we were not able to perform a detailed stepped combustion; instead only 3 temperature steps have been used. Being not particularly precise for the above reason the data nevertheless indicated that 36Ar and C release patterns are almost identical. Also we found that ~70% of 36Ar and ~40% of 132Xe have been lost. However the Raman spectra and in particular position, relative abundance and width of the D and G bands remained almost identical for the treated and the original samples. For two other experiments the amount of the recovered material was enough for high temperature resolution stepped combustion experiments. We use 100o increment in the temperature range from 200 to 1400oC.  For both experiments there is a clear shift of the noble gas release to higher temperature compared with the original sample, and the higher was the temperature of the HP experiment the higher the shift: ~100o for treated at 500oC and ~200o - at 700oC (Fig. 1a). However, the same temperature shift is observed for carbon release for the samples (Fig. 1b). The concentration of noble gases (except for 4He) in the sample treated to 500oC has not significantly changed while for the 700oC experiment is by a factor of 2 lower than in the original one.  02 10-64 10-66 10-68 10-61 10-5200 400 600 800 1000OriginalTreated at 700oC36Ar, cc/gTemperature, oCa) 0102030405060200 400 600 800 1000OriginalTreated at 700oCC yield, %Temperature, oCb) Figure 1.

The material treated at HP also shows a significant difference in Raman spectra compared to that observed for the original one (Fig 2). In particular, the height of the D and G peaks became equal in the sample treated at 700oC while in the original one the D peak is significantly lower than the G one. In addition the Raman signal intensity increased by an order of magnitude in the sample treated at 700oC compared to the original one (Fig. 2).  200300400500600700500 1000 1500 2000OriginalRaman shift, cm-1Intensity100020003000400050006000500 1000 1500 2000700oC, 1GPa, 24hIntensityRaman shift, cm-1 Figure 2.

intense Raman signal detected in the treated sample suggests that the organic material in the sample became more coarse-grained compared to the original one. The increase of the relative abundance of D band (compared to G) usually points out to a higher degree of disorder of carbonaceous matter. Thus, at 700oC, 1 GPa and during 24h the organic material has not been graphitized at any significant degree. Instead, the organics became more amorphous after the HP treatment that is in agreement with the HP experiments applied to pure organic compounds [4]. Probably, graphitization requires a high temperature and/or longer time. The increase of combustion temperature is likely to be associated with the changing in the grain size of the treated material. Approximately half of noble gases have been lost during this HP experiment. However this has not resulted in any significant separation of the organic carbon and the noble gases (Fig. 3). Since the total concentration of C in the treated samples has not reduced but rather increased, the loss of noble gases cannot be explained by oxidation of Q during the HT experiments  because Q and other carbonaceous phases present in the sample are oxidized with molecular oxygen at the same temperature (see Fig. 1). The 36Ar/C ratio in the treated sample is lower by more than a factor of 3 in the original, but the release profile shows almost the same pattern (Fig. 3). This suggests that combustion temperature of Q and insoluble organic material has changed similarly as the result of the HP experiment. For instance, this could happen if Q became coarser grained in the same extent as the other organics or Q is encaged within the organic matrix and can be combusted only along with the matrix.         01 10-52 10-53 10-54 10-55 10-56 10-57 10-50 20 40 60 80 100OriginalTreated at 700oC36Ar/C, cc/g36Ar, cumulative % Figure 3. Variations of the 36Ar/C ratio during stepped combustion of the original and treated at HP Orgueil HF/HCl residues. Conclusions:  Thus, we conclude that Q has lost a significant fraction of its original noble gases during the HP experiment conducted at 700oC, 1 GPa during 24h. This has accompanied by a changing in the Q combustion temperature by a similar way as for most of the other carbonaceous phases present in the sample analyzed. In the sense this is not what was expected to happened for the Q combustion T compared to that occurred during parent body metamorphism [2]. However the organic material of the HF/HCl residue was only modified to a certain extent during the HT treatment, but not graphitized as has happened to the organic matter presented in the enstatite chondrites parent bodies. Therefore, until graphitization is not achieved in the laboratory conditions, it is not possible to make a firm conclusion regarding the reaction of Q to the parent body metamorphism.  1.
