Introduction:  The lunar polar environment, shared by the poles of Mercury, experiences regions of permanent shadow where temperatures are extremely low. This enables cold-trapping of volatiles, and more extensive regions where shallow subsurface temperatures allow retention of water ice.  Evidence for surface and shallow buried ice at the Mercury poles is overwhelming with radar, neutron and reflectance anomalies all clearly indicating the presence of substantial amounts of water ice [1,2,3].  The lunar evidence is more subtle, but direct sampling by LCROSS and remote radar, laser reflectance and neutron data all point toward the presence of modest amounts of water ice [4,5,6,7].  The distribution and character of these deposits are not well known, in part because of the difficulties in making the key observations. A joint project between the Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Hawaii is investigating the development of an orbital multi-wavelength lidar spectrometer to greatly improve the knowledge of the distribution and nature of volatiles at the lunar poles . The development, currently funded internally at both institutions, has three approaches:  (1) using laser emissions in the 3 micron region to capture the spectral signature of surface ice or adsorbed water; (2) exploiting UV and visible laser emissions to measure the fluorescence of organics produced from complex ice mixtures exposed to space radiation.  The presence of organics is strongly indicated on Mercury and fluorescence will be used to constrain the composition of the source volatiles. Observations near 3 microns:  Water in all its forms has very strong absorption bands near 3 microns making this region sensitive to small abundances of water. The startling discovery of a 3-um absorption across the equatorial lunar surface by three spacecraft [8,9,10] made this point dramatically.  The non-polar spectral features are interpreted to represent 10’s to 100’s of ppm water in lunar material, likely adsorbed on the surface and originating from several potential sources. Instrument Concept: The flight version of this lidar would be similar to LOLA in size and power, but somewhat more complex in that it would feature two or possibly three laser emission bands and a cooled detector.  LOLA features two lasers feeding a single transmit telescope via a polarizing beamsplitter cube, and a receiver telescope coupled via fiber optics to silicon avalanche photodiode detectors [11].  This compositional lidar concept has two or pos sibly three laser emission bands, one or two operating in the 2.65-3.1 um region, and another in the 3.1-3.5 um region.  The receiver telescope would be directly coupled to a small HgCdTe avalanche photodiode (APD) detector array.  The 2.65-3.1 micron laser emission would include both a short wavelength continuum point outside the water/hydroxyl bands and the minima of the major water bearing phases (hydroxyl, bound water and ice, (Figure 1).  The second laser emission provides access to the longer wavelength portion of the water spectrum, and can detect the presence of organics at 3.4 microns. Results from Messenger have provided strong circumstantial evidence for organics at the poles of Mercury [12]; similar deposits may occur on the Moon [13].  Several laser emission lines are being investigated for each band. The lunar reflected sunlight during daylight operation is minimized by the very short (< 100 nsec) integration times and the bandpass filter before the detector.  Signal to noise ratios of > 30 are anticipated for single pulses even for solar illuminated portions of the Moon.  Figure 1.  Spectra of water bearing species with ranges for the two laser channels depicted. From [9] After about a year of operation, these measurements would provide definitive maps of the distribution and surface abundance of water in the polar regions, and elsewhere on the lunar surface. Fluorescence Measurements: We are also investigating measurements of lunar time-resolved fluorescence by using 355 and 532 nm excitation along with a spectrometer in the receiver.

from excitation to emission approaching one for many organic compounds and certain rare earth elements [14]. The lifetime of organic fluorescence is short and will trail the reflectance pulse only by a few tens of nanoseconds but can be detected with an appropriate detector.  The implementation of this capability is similar to LOLA, but would feature doubling and tripling crystals to emit 532 and 355 nm, and using a spectrograph in the receiver followed by an time-gated array detector array.  Ancillary Science:  The passive 3 um measurements [1,2,3] also feature strong variations in the intensity of the hydroxyl/water band with lunar time of day, with significant implications for lunar science.  If the abundance of water is varying, this may imply that the water is mobile and migrating to cooler portions of the lunar surface.  However, the lifetime of the water molecule against ionization and sweeping is only about 20 hours [15,16,17,18], so mobile water would not be recycled and requires a constant flux of new water.  A portion of this constant flux would trap at the poles prior to sweeping, providing a substantial source for polar water. However, passive reflectance measurements in this spectral region are contaminated by thermal emission, so the observed spectral variation can be due solely to temperature variations, not to intrinsic abundance variations.  Active reflectance measurements will not be contaminated by thermal emission and so will definitively determine if water abundances on the lunar surface vary, providing a tight constraint on supply to the poles.  The fluorescence will also be capable of measuring long duration mineral fluorescence to aid resource mapping of rare earths,  and other fluorophores of interest.   References: [1] Slade, M.A., B. J.
