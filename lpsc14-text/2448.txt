Introduction: Chondrules are ubiquitous components of carbonaceous chondrites (CCs) [e.g. 1]. Different mechanisms have been proposed for chondrule formation [e.g. 2-9]. However, these mechanisms were suggested on the basis of cooling rates estimated for Type II (oxidized) chondrules, abundant only in ordinary chondrites, whereas CCs are dominated by Type I (reduced) chondrules. In order to provide new constraints on the heating mechanisms that prevailed throughout the protoplanetary disk in the early Solar System, we determined the cooling rates of a Type I chondrule in the Renazzo CR2 chondrite.  Since metal grains (Fe-Ni alloys) are abundant in association with chondrules [10], we used the method developed by [11] based on Cu and Ga zoning profiles measured by LA-ICP-MS in metal lumps attached to Type I chondrules. Volatile siderophile elements initially present in metal (e.g. Cu, Ga, and Ge) would be evaporated during a melting event then subsequently re-condensed at the exterior of metal grains [e.g. 1214], and diffused inwards. Thus, analysis of Cu and Ga diffusion profiles can supply constraints on the high temperature event that formed Type I chondrules and their solid-state thermal history. Methods:  To avoid a possible under-estimation of cooling rates due to the random sectioning of metal grains, a fragment of Renazzo was imaged by CT scanning using a v!tome!x 240L from GE Sensing & Inspection Technologies Phoenix X!Ray in order to measure Cu and Ga diffusion profiles passing through the center of metal grains. Thus, we used X-ray tomography to locate Type I chondrules surrounded by large metal grains (Fig. 1). Then, we cut a fragment close to the equatorial planes of selected metal grains on Type I chondrules for further analyses. Finally, we polished our section until an equatorial plane of a metal grain corresponded to the polished surface of our sample.  SEM-BSE imaging and EDS analysis were obtained using a Tescan VEGA II LSU electron microscope. Laser ablation ICP-MS analyses were performed at Florida State University using a New Wave UP193 FX excimer laser ablation system coupled to a Thermo Element XR ICP-MS. Four diffusion profiles were measured through the centers of two metal grains (Fig. 1), using a 15 µm spot size, 5 µm.s-1 speed, 50 Hz repetition rate, 100% power output (1.55 GW.cm-2). Standards used were North Chile (Filomena) IIA iron meteorite, Hoba IVB iron meteorite, and NIST SRM 1263a steel. For a given element, each diffusion profile is characterized by a diffusion length-scale determined numerically.

Results: We observed chemical zonations for Cu and Ga in all profiles measured, also displaying practically ideal U-shaped profiles (Fig. 2). Diffusion lengthscales vary between 35 and 120 µm for profiles 1-41 and 1-36, respectively. Edges of metal grains are enriched in Cu and Ga, with maximal contents measured at ∼140 and ∼12 ppm, respectively, while cores are depleted in these volatile siderophile elements relative to the edges (∼0.20 ppm Cu and ∼0.05 ppm Ga).  Since Cu diffuses more slowly than Ga at T>1500 K whereas it is the opposite at T<1500 K [15], we are able to provide an estimation of the temperature at which zoning profiles measured here were formed (Tp) (Fig. 3). For all zoning profiles, ranges and means of Tp and cooling rates associated are reported in Tab. 1. Cooling rates are calculated from Cu diffusion profiles as ∼4-65 K.h-1 for peak temperatures of 1530-1630 K, 2448.pdf

with an upper limit of ∼0.1-520 K.h-1 for a larger range of temperatures of 1273-1800 K (Fig 4).

Table 1: Diffusion length-scale, Tp, and cooling rates [8, Eq. (7)] calculated for each zoning profile measured in this work.  Discussion: The two metal grains analyzed for this Type I chondrule argue for a similar solid-state history. Cooling rates estimated here are similar to those calculated from six metal lumps in the Acfer 097 CR2 chondrites by [11], 0.5-50 K.h-1 for Tp ∼ 1473 K with a maximum possible range of 0.1-400 K.h-1 for Tp ∼ 1200-1800 K, and are close to those obtained from pyroxene exsolution in Type I chondrules from CCs [16, 17]. These results are consistent with cooling rates predicted by shock models proposed for chondrule formation (∼10-300 K.h-1, [e.g. 4]), and to a lesser extent by the X-wind model [e.g. 8] that seems only to be able to explain the lowest cooling rates (∼<100 K.h1).   Figure 4: Cooling rates vs. peak temperatures calculated from the four diffusion profiles of Cu measured in this work (see Fig. 1 for location). Diffusion length-scale are 35 µm for the 1-41 profile, 80 µm for 1-40, 120 µm for 1-36, and 55 µm for 1-34. The melting point of Fe-Ni alloys is shown as the 1800 K line. Empty triangles indicate the upper and lower limit of the maximal possible range of Tp and cooling rates, while filled diamonds correspond to mean values of Tp and cooling rates for each diffusion profiles.  Conclusion: Cooling rates calculated here appear to be consistent with the predictions supplied by shock models and at variance with the higher cooling rates implied by a lightning model [e.g. 9]. Despite the fact that our quantitative results seem to indicate a similar solid-state thermal history for Type I chondrules in CCs, further systematic studies of cooling rates from metal and silicates could better constrain the high temperature event at the origin of chondrule formation.
