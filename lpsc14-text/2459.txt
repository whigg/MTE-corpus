That biogenic molecules are found within extra-terrestrial solids [1] and that glycoaldehyde, a simple sugar, has been detected within molecular clouds [2] hints that carbon chemistry could be ubiquitous. Perhaps more relevant than their detection are the mechanisms for their formation, which could suggest the environmental conditions of their origins.  Sugars, for example, are known to form from condensation reactions of aldehydes [3]. The formose reaction is known to give a mixture of sugars from formaldehyde, and has been accounted for the prebiotic synthesis of biogenic molecules. The incubation period for the initial condensation of two formaldehyde molecules is long, and the mechanism for this is unknown. For this reason, studies involving the formose reaction utilize the more reactive sugar, glycoaldehyde, as a starting material. Formation of sugar and sugar products from glycoaldehyde is rapid, due to the facile enolization of acidic Î±-hydrogen that in the initial steps of aldol condensation.  We previously proposed a vibrational coupling mechanism of carbon monoxide molecules that could result in an apparent mass-independent fractionation of oxygen isotopes [4]. The model further accounts for the presence of carbon dioxide in molecular clouds, and carbon suboxide polymers side products. The CO2 that result from this gas-phase reaction condense to form ices that entrap simple molecules, allowing them to interact and react with each other. We further hypothesize that in a cold molecular cloud, microwave radiation act as an energy source for organic reactions to occur within CO2 ices [5]. The absence of a net dipole moment in CO2 allows it to be transparent, and only polar molecules are excited. This study will show that analyses of the nucleomagnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of the product mixture obtained from microwave heating of an ice mixture of formaldehyde and calcium hydroxide results in the formation of simple sugars.  Results and Discussions:  Microwave irradiation (1h) of a CO2 ice mixture of formaldehyde and calcium hydroxide resulted in the formation of a product mixture that consists not only of paraformaldehyde polymers, but also of a mixture that shows new aliphatic protons in the NMR spectra. The new signals are shifted upfield relative to the formaldehyde starting material, as well as from the formaldehyde polymer products. The protons appear to be adjacent to a hydroxy functional group, indicative of a polyhydroxy compound. To elucidate upon the structures of the condensation products, 2D NMR experiments of the mixture were performed.  Heteronuclear single quantum spectroscopy (HSQC) shows correlations between 1H and 13C and, although our prelimnary results need higher resolution, much information may be gleaned from figure 1. First, the phase-sensitive HSQC spectrum distinguishes between methylene (CH2) and methine (CH) in blue and red, respectively. This allows the discernment between the methylene groups of the paraformaldehyde polymers and the methine groups of the desired sugar products. While the signals between 3.8-4.4 ppm are unique to the sugar, the peaks at 4.5-4.9 ppm belong to both the sugar and polymer products. The peak at 5.2 ppm shows a correlation, in contrast to the peak at 5.3 ppm, indicating that the latter could be hydroxy (-OH) protons. Of interest are the signals at 4.1 and 4.2 ppm, which correlate to the same carbon, indicating that they are diastereotopic. This would be the case for chiral molecules, or if a cyclic structure is present, which is not atypical for many sugars.    Whereas it has been shown previously that sugar alcohols are present in meteorites [6], the facility of obtaining sugars from simple starting materials hints that carbohydrates may be formed in icy bodies in space by microwave irradiation. Although the concentration of the starting materials used in this experiment is high, it is plausible that within an icy body, polar molecules are able to absorb microwave energy, giving them enough energy to move within the ice lattice and encounter reactive species.  We show the formose reaction proceeded by using Ca(OH)2 as a catalyst, minimizing the need for glycoaldehyde-initiated formose reaction. Our results warrant further studies, such as additional 2D NMR experiments as well as comparison to known standards using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for sugar identification. We further demonstrate that condensation reactions can occur within CO2  ices, and that this mechanism could be exploited as a source for the molecular diversity observed for organic materials found within meteorites.
