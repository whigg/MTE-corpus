MODELING TOPOGRAPHIC CHANGES BY BALLISTIC SEDIMENTATION FROM ORIENTALEEJECTA. Ya-Huei Huang, David A. Minton, and James E. Richardson Purdue University Department of Earth, Atmospheric, & Planetary Sciences, 550 Stadium Mall Drive, West Lafayette, IN 47907 (huang474@purdue.edu)Motivation. The ejecta blanket produced from basinsized craters deposits at high speed and alters the preexisting topography in a process known as ballistic sedimentation and erosion. Ballistically deposited ejecta alsomixes with local country rock [1], and quantitative modeling of the sedimentation process will help better understand how crustal material is transported by basin-sizedimpacts. In general, the change of pre-existing terraincaused by the emplacement of ejecta blanket is one ofthe basin sculpture processes. Basin sculpture from Imbrium basin was noted by G. K. Gilbert in 1893 [2]. Imbrium sculpture includes the prominent parallel valleys,grooves and ridges radiated from the center of ImbriumBasin [3, 4]. Similar basin sculptures are also found inOrientale, Nectaris, Humorum, and Crisium basins [5].Ballistic sedimentation and erosion by massive basinejecta blankets may obliterate craters on a surface moreefficiently than seismic shaking. The ∼ 930 km diameter Orientale crater is an ideal basin for studying theeffects of ballistic sedimentation by basins, as it is oneof the last of the large lunar basin to form and thereforeits ejecta deposits were not heavily altered by subsequentcratering [6]. The deficiency of craters smaller than 2 kmwithin one crater rim distance from the center of Orientale Basin has been observed [7, 8]. Smooth intercraterplains units on the lunar highlands may be composed primarily of ballistically emplaced sediments from numerous large craters and basins [1]. Here we develop a modelfor the topographic changes to a terrain caused by the energetic emplacement of a continuous sheet of ejecta material near the rim of a large lunar impact basin. We willuse the observations of crater obliteration near the rim ofOrientale as a constraint on the model.Theoretical Method. The ejecta that emerges at thesurface of the impact site with a given impact velocitycan be modeled as a hydrodynamic fluid flow known asMaxwell Z-model [9, 10]. Figure 1 illustrates the concept of how a block of ejecta of a given size is relatedto the flow streamlines within the excavation flow of thecrater. This model describes ejecta as composed of material along a “streamtube” that originates near the pointof impact and can be foumulated to describe the mass,ejected velocity, and ejection angle of ejecta. After theejecta block collides with the surface, it excavates andtransports material radially away from the crater. We candetermine how much material is excavated and how farit is transported by using conservation of energy and momentum. Therefore, the two major unknown parametersinvolved in the ballistic erosion problem are the excavation depth, hr, and the total sliding distance of material(both pre-existing surface material and ejecta), l.To facilitate the implementation of a numerical code,we treat the ejecta blanket and the lunar surface as comTransient craterStreamlinesEjecta block1 pxhevminvmaxvminvmaxhrLunar blockθe+θsFigure 1: Schematic cross section view of an ejecta emplacement model.

The figure on the right is shown the ejecta blockwith its blanket height, he, and its corresponding lunarblock with hr. Also, the ejected angle of ejecta blockis θe, and the angle of the slope, θs, is defined within[−pi2 ,pi2 ], in which the negative/positive slope representsthe downslope/upperslope.posed of a gird of discrete finite elements. As shownin right part of Figure 1, the volume of each 1 × 1pixel ejecta block and lunar regolith block is dwdbhe anddwdbhr respectively. Firstly, the vertical momentum isused for the planar impact approximation [11] to estimate the excavation depth, including the stage of compression ( heUp ut) and rarefaction((ρ0p/ρ)heCRut). Sincethe time scale of excavation is short compared to the totaltime scale of cratering, the excavation depth can be approximated as twice as the excavation depth during compression stage. Based on Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions and the shock velocity-particle velocity relationin the target and the projectile, the excavation depth canbe found in terms of the impact velocity in the verticaldirection (ve sin θe) and the two parameters in Us − utspace: st and ct.hr =heve sin θe[ct + st(ve sin θe/2)](1)Secondly, the ejecta block (dm) is assumed to movetogether with the excavated lunar regolith block (dM −dm) horizontally. Based on the conservation of horizontal momentum, the total sliding distance of material canbe calculated out by the impulse-momentum theorem inEq. 2. The change of a momentum of the whole system isthe impulse that the total of all forces exert on the ejectaand lunar regolith block throughout emplacement. Thetotal forces is assumed to be the constant force consistingof resistive force (Fres), friction (Fk), and gravity (Fg).The resistive force arises from the lunar regolith blockand sliding surface as they resist the movement of ejectablock, including internal friction (σ tanφe) and cohesion(c). The friction (µkdM cos θs) would resist the relativemotion between the detached lunar regolith block and the2551.pdf

According to the Newton’s 2ndLaw, the differential impulsing time, dt, can be convertedinto the differential sliding distance, dl.12v2e cos2(θe + θs)dm =l∫0(Ftot)(hr + he)hedl (3)Therefore, l is obtained:l =12v2e cos2(θe + θs)ρehe(hr + he)/he [c+ κgρe(hr + he)](4)in which κ defines as (cos θs tanφe + µ cos θs +sin θs).Estimate of transport distance. The rock presentbelow Orientale Basin mixes with lunar maria and impact breccia. The strength and rock type of surrounding bedrock and regolith are important for determiningthe penetration depth. We therefore consider the effectson the ballistic erosion process using two different rocktypes: hard basalt and loose sandstone. For basalt, wechoose ct = 2.6 km/s and st = 1.62 [12]. Highresolution gravity data of the dual Gravity Recovery andInterior Laboratory (GRAIL) implies that the crust nearOrientale basin has high porosity of ∼ 20% [13]. Therefore we choose ct = 0.5 km/s and st = 3.2 for oursimulated porous impact breccia in Orientale Basin using sandstone with 20 % porosity [14].In Figure 2, only the basalt case is shown here.Within one rim distance, the ejecta can excavate thedepth varying from 500 m to 80 m and slide a distancefrom 50 km to 100 km. On the other hand, the excavation depth within one rim distance in 20% porositysandstone ranges from 1.2 km to 0.1 km, about twiceas deep as in the basalt case. This is expected due to thelower density of porous sandstone. The sliding distancein the sandstone case ranges from about 40 km to 80 km.The maximum excavation depth (1.2 km) could potentially erase the craters of ∼6 km diameter, and cratersof ∼300 m diameter for 80 m excavation depth [15].Within one to three rim distance, the sliding distance increases rapidly in both cases from ∼100 km to 250 kmas the ejecta thickness decreases. This is expected asthe thinner ejecta with larger ejected velocity would bedeposit with more specific momentum than the thickerejecta. However, the thicker ejecta excavates materialdeeper than the thinner ejecta, even though the thinnerejecta has a higher ejected velocity. 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 0  100  200  300  400  50032 1 0Sliding distance (km)Penetration depth (m)Landing distance from rim (RCR)BasaltFigure 2: The black line shows the sliding distance withexcavation depth in the basalt case.
