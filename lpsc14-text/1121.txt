Introduction: Groups of small-sized mounds (~100–750m, see large white oval, Figure 1) occur to the north of the Argyre impact basin, Mars. The shape, size, summit characteristics and clustering of the mounds, as well as a suite of geomorphological and geological features in the surrounding terrain, would be expected where open-system (hydraulic) pingos (HPs) are observed on Earth [1–7]. HPs are perennial (water) ice-cored mounds that form and grow by means of artesian pressure in areas of thin or discontinuous permafrost and periglacial activity [1–7]. Some preliminary work has discussed the possibility of HPs on Mars but, heretofore, strong candidatesites on the Red Planet have been few in number [8–9]. By contrast, we have identified numerous locations within and around the Argyre impact-basin where mounds similar in kind, distribution and geomorphological/geological context to those observed in Figure 1 are found.

Pingo-like mounds in and around the Argyre impact-basin: North of the Argyre impact-basin, Mars (317.7140 E, 38.4310 S), small-sized mounds are clustered downslope of numerous linear (possibly grabenlike) cavities (see arrows in Fig. 1). Mound morphology ranges from circular or sub-circular to elongate. Numerous mounds show summit depressions, shaped irregularly; in some instances depression margins are highlighted by patchy bright material (Figs. 2a–b). One of the mounds (2b) displays a debris-fan at its base and a possible erosional-trough cut into its eastern flank (Fig. 2b). The pristine and unmodified morphology of the scar and fan suggest a relatively youthful age.

Linear cavities are observed upslope of the mounds; they could be indicative of faulting and of basement structural-control of the local if not regional landscape; some structures could be deeply-seated due to the Argyre impact event and post-impact adjustment. The linear cavities form in and are bridled by lighttoned, smooth-textured terrain that subdues the underlying topography. In the literature, this type of terrain often is described as a latitude dependent and possibly ice-rich or cemented mantle (LDM) [10–12]. In turn, the linear cavities and the LDM are deformed by smallsized polygons (~5–20m in diameter); the latter could be the work of thermal-contraction cracking [13–14]. The unaltered or intact geometry of the polygons suggests that they postdate the formation of the linear cavities. Sinuous braided-channels that dissect the cavity floors and the polygonal-patterned ground point to subsequent hydrological activity. Arcuate ridges occur upslope of the HP-like mounds and downslope of the linear cavities. These ridges could be terminal moraines, staking a line of furthest advance for glaciers that otherwise have ablated by sublimation or thaw [15]. Depending upon ambient conditions at the time of their formation, surface or near-surface melt-water might have been associated with the glacial system of which the ridges were a part. a) b) 100 m 100 m a) b) 1121.pdf

Hydraulic pingos on Earth: Hydraulic pingos are perennial ice-cored mounds that occur in permafrost environments on Earth [1–5]. Mound morphology is varied, i.e. circular to elongate; long-axes extend from metres to hundreds of metres [1–7]. Often, the HPs occur in groups or clusters, principally on valley floors and sides or in glacial outwash-plains [1–7], see Fig. 3.        Figure 3: HPs on outwash plain, Iterlagssûp Kûgssua, Disko, central west Greenland [16].  Sometimes, the HPs occur on polygonised terrain formed by thermal-contraction cracking and underlain by ice or sand wedges at the polygon margins [1–7]. The HPs are the work of artesian pressure delivering sub- or intra-permafrost water to the location where the mounds originate and evolve. Here, under freezing temperatures, an ice core forms and uplifts the sediments overlying it, creating a permafrost mound [1–7]. When an HP degrades, as the result of its ice core dissipating by thaw, a summit depression or cavity may form [1–7], see Fig. 4.    Figure 4: An HP in Søndre Strømfjord, west Greenland. Note the crater-like depression at the pingo summit and a run-off channel initiated by a spring [17].  Three principal geological-pathways generally are invoked to explain the formation of HPs on Earth: (1) the presence of geological faults and structural discontinuities that are thought to deliver juvenile water to or near-to the surface where the HPs occur [1-7,17]. (2) a (potential) hydraulic gradient that moves sub- or intra-permafrost melt-water downslope in areas of topographical relief and towards a point(s) of emergence where the permafrost is thin or weak [2]. (3) a sub-category or variant of (2): permafrost thaw in the accumulation area of glaciers engenders melt-water infiltration [4] or thaw at the base of wet-based glaciers [18]. In either case, the meltwater migrates downslope, through the subpermafrost that lies beyond the glacier’s margin and, once again, emerges to form HPs where the permafrost is relatively thin or weak. Discussion: Absent of exploring Mars by foot and using a pick or a shovel to dig up the near-surface regolith, validating or invalidating periglacial interpretations of Martian landforms is difficult. With this in mind, we present a Martian-mound formationhypothesis that is robust, resting on three disparate but related footings: 1. key morphological similarities, e.g. shape, size and summit characteristics, between pingolike Martian mounds and HPs on Earth,; 2. clustered distribution and slope-side location of the Martian mounds, consistent with the distribution and location of HPs in terrestrial permafrost-environments; and, 3. spatially-associated (albeit putative) periglacial and proglacial landscape features - e.g. small-sized polygons and arcuate (moraine-like) ridges - that are commonplace in cold-climate landscapes on Earth where HPs occur. The observation of HP-like mounds on Mars, specifically, in and around the Argyre impact-basin, is the first time in the literature that these landforms have been putatively identified on a regional scale. Moreover, the possible-markers of structurally-delivered water at some of the mound sites suggests that geohydrological activity in and around the study region could be more recent and substantial than has been thought hitherto.
