Reduced volatile species affect the composition of early atmospheres and the potential for planets to support life. At high pressures, they affect melting processes and physical properties of planetary mantles. During accretion and differentiation, planetary interiors experience highly reducing conditions- Earth's magma ocean is estimated to have had an fO2 of IW-2 to -4 at the end of core segregation [1]. The terrestrial mantle was subsequently oxidized,  but the mantles of other terrestrial planets and the Moon are still comparatively reduced [e.g. 2].  On planets whose mantles still have a low fO2, reduced C-O-H volatiles have been transferred from the interior to the atmosphere by eruptive degassing throughout geologic time, impacting, for example, the stability of liquid water and the climate on the surface of Mars [3].  CO2 and H2O are the main magmatic volatiles at oxidizing conditions [4], but C-O-H volatiles in reduced magmas are poorly understood. CO2 solubility in silicate melts decreases along with fO2 [5-9], suggesting that under very reducing conditions, any C dissolved in a basalt must be present in a reduced form. A variety of C-O-H species have been detected experimentally in natural, C-saturated basaltic melts below the CCO buffer. These include CH4 [10], other C-H molecules such as alkynes [9], Si-C [7], and most recently, the iron carbonyls Fe(CO)5 and possibly Fe(CO)62+ [8, 11]. None of the experimental studies on natural melt compositions have produced the same results in terms of C-O-H volatile speciation, perhaps due to different H2O concentrations, melt compositions, or fO2/P/T variations. Aims. The present work aims to clarify the speciation and solubility of C-O-H volatiles in martian and terrestrial basaltic melts over 3 orders of magnitude of H2O concentrations (~0.01-1 wt%) and 6 orders of magnitude of fO2 (~IW-4 to IW +2). Our results reconcile some discrepancies between previous studies and provide a framework for understanding the behavior of reduced volatile species at a variety of conditions applicable to different terrestrial planets and the Moon. Experiments: Graphite-saturated experiments were carried out on two synthetic basalts at 1.2 GPa and 1400 ˚C in a piston cylinder apparatus. A martian basalt based on the picritic, Adirondack class Humphrey basalt from Gusev Crater [12], and a synthetic Galapagos MORB [13] were used. Starting compositions were mixed with Fe ± Pt in order to form basaltic melt + FePt alloy or Fe-carbide, which acted as fO2 sensors [11]. In some cases, Si metal was added to further reduce the fO2. Samples were contained in double Pt-C capsules and subjected to experimental conditions for 6 hours in a 1/2'' CaF2 assembly. Most experiments were nominally anhydrous, with H2O-content modulated by drying capsules for up to 48 hours at 400-500 ˚C in air prior to welding. Experiments that did not undergo drying resulted in melts containing ~0.5 wt% H2O in quenched glass, while the driest experiments contained as little as ~100 ppm.  Electron microprobe analyses of polished, recovered charges yielded major element phase compositions and allowed calculation of the fO2 and fCO during the experiments.  Total C and H concentrations were measured by SIMS using the same methods as [11]. Volatile speciation was  determined by FTIR and Raman spectroscopy. CO2 and H2O concentrations were quantified from FTIR spectra using the BeerLambert law. Experiments by [11], similar in design and also using a Humphrey basalt starting material, were re-analyzed with Raman spectroscopy and are included in the results below. Results:  Quenched samples contained basaltic glass coexisting with FePt alloy or Fe-carbide. fO2 ranged from IW-4 to IW+2.3, corresponding to log fCO of 1.6-4.8. A variety of C-O-H species were detected in both martian and terrestrial basalts, with no apparent difference between the two compositions. Volatile speciation. Stability fields of different species as a function of fO2 and H2O-content are depicted in Fig. 1. All glasses contained H2O dissolved as OH-. In experiments with at least ~0.5 wt% H2O, H2 was also present (yellow in Fig. 1). Methane was only seen in a few melts that were both below IW and had closer to 1 wt% H2O (purple in Fig. 1). CO2 was dissolved as the carbonate ion CO32-, but was only present at fO2 above IW-1.5 (blue in Fig. 1).  CO-bearing species. An FTIR peak at 2205 cm-1 was observed in samples with IW-1.5≤fO2≤IW+2, and is  related to C=O bonds, possibly in Fe(CO)62+ [11, 14]. A more reduced subset of these experiments also exhibited a peak at 2110-2120 cm-1 in Raman spectra, observed by [8] and attributed to Fe(CO)5 (green in Fig. 1).

N-bearing species. In the more reduced samples, two peaks at 1615 cm-1 and 3370 cm-1 were present in FTIR, and in some cases in Raman spectra as well (red in Fig. 1). The 1615 cm-1 peak is likely associated with C=O vibrations [15], and the 3370 cm-1 peak is associated with N-H stretching [16-17]. The peaks always appear together which suggests that they originate from the same species, potentially an amide [11]. Nitrogen was not added to our experiments, but would have been present in air trapped in the capsules.  Volatile solubility. From IW+2.3 to IW-2, CO2 and total C solubilities decreased from >4000 ppm to zero and from ~8000 ppm to 2-3 ppm, respectively. In both cases H2O-content had little effect on the amount of C or CO2. The amount of C present as reduced carbon, or 'non-carbonate C' is the total C minus carbon present as CO2 [11]. As fO2 decreases, the percentage of noncarbonate C grows until below IW-1.5, all C is dissolved as non-carbonate C (Fig. 2).  Implications:  Early Earth. Below IW-2, very little C is soluble in basaltic melts and only as non-carbonate C. A post-differentiation terrestrial magma ocean was easily saturated in carbon, potentially stabilizing graphite, diamond, C-bearing iron metal, or a metal carbide. The majority of the carbon in this case could be contained in a C-rich phase, have dissolved in metallic iron segregated to the core, or reside as gas in the atmosphere. If the species with FTIR peaks at 3370 and 1615 cm-1 is indeed both N- and C-bearing, C solubility in the magma would also have been limited by N availability. Degassing would contribute C, O, H, and N to the early atmosphere. A water-rich magma ocean would also degas H2 and minor amounts of CH4.  Figure 2.

OH-, CO-complexes and CO32- are the main volatiles in lunar basalts, except for below IW-1.5 when the species with peaks at 1615 and 3370 cm-1 (possibly N-bearing) becomes stable. In agreement with [17], CO-bearing species (possibly Fe-carbonyls) are important for lunar volcanism and contain 50-80% of the total C in the melt. Total dissolved C is <200 ppm and dependent on fO2. Mars. OH-, CO32-, and potentially CO-complexes are the main C-O-H species, with 20-70% of the total C in the carbonyl-like species. When there is ~1 wt% H2O, H2 is also present and in some cases the Nbearing species as well. Of all the magmas discussed, martian basalts will contain the most C due to their higher fO2 and higher carbonate concentrations.   References: [1] Frost D. J. et al. (2008) Philos. Trans. R. Soc.
