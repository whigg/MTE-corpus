These features are thought to result from basal sublimation of the transparent CO2 ice followed by ejection of regolith-type material, which then covers the ice [1,2]. 	  We have used CRISM reflectance data, THEMIS visible images and THEMIS derived temperature retrievals along with a thermal numerical model to constrain the physical and compositional characteristics of the seasonal cap for several areas exhibiting dark spots at both high spatial and temporal resolution. Our main objectives are: 1. To study the temporal and spatial evolution of the dark material layer covering the CO2 ice, combining albedo, temperature and CO2 ice absorption band depth at high spatial resolution. 2. To constrain the thickness of the dark material layer using numerical modeling. 3. To link this venting process to the surface properties observed at high latitudes. Regions of Interest: The south polar region has been extensively observed during spring by the CRISM and THEMIS instruments for several years. We have selected here five regions of interest (ROIs) because of the large number of observations and high temporal resolution from both THEMIS and CRISM instruments during spring of MY28: . Manhattan Island (-86N,100E) . Ithica (-85N,179E) . Starfish (-84N,241E) . Inca City (-81N,295E) . Dolomedes (-87N,174E) From these five ROIs, which all exhibit a cryptic behavior, three are located inside the main "cryptic" region as defined by [3] (Manhattan Island, Dolomedes and Ithica) and two are located outside (Inca City and Starfish). While images were not acquired on the same day, THEMIS and CRISM data can be correlated over similar Ls ranges. Results:  Observations show that the dark spots are associated with both weaker CO2 ice signature and higher surface temperature than that of CO2 ice, consistent with the presence of a "thick" layer of dark material on top of the ice, in agreement with [1] and [4]. The ejection(s) of dark material occurs in early spring (between Ls 175 and Ls 210). The CO2 ice signature exhibits a important decrease at that period. The surface temperature, however, remains around the condensation temperature (T~145K) prior to Ls 200. Modeling results show that the solar insolation during that period is too low to rise the temperature significantly. Modeling also suggests that some CO2 recondensation on top of the dark material can occur at that period, as the dark material layer acts as a cold trap. After Ls 200, THEMIS temperature data exhibit heterogeneities where the warmest spots correspond to concentrations of dark material (Fig 1). The temperature of these regions increases slowly with time with the darkest areas showing a greater increase, in agreement with modeling results (Fig 2-3). The CO2 ice signature, however, tends to increase with time after ~Ls 200-210 (until beginning of defrosting (Fig 2). We interpret this increase to be due to a combination of material movement at different scales and possible CO2 gas recondensation, in agreement with [4] and [5].  Fig 1. THEMIS visible image of the Starfish area at Ls 234 (top) and corresponding THEMIS temperature map (bottom). The dark areas correspond to high concentration of dark spots and the "warm" areas on the temperature map. This result is consistent with the presence of material on top of the CO2 ice.  The thickness of the dark material covering the CO2 ice has been retrieved by comparing the THEMIS temperatures with modeling results (for the same Ls and local time, assuming an homogeneous cover and a flat terrain). This material thickness is estimated to range from a few hundreds of microns to a few mm in the warmest spots (with possible high heterogeneity at small scale).  Fig 2. Temporal evolution of the CO2 ice index (top), the reflectance factor at 1.33 µm (center) and the surface temperature (bottom) over a dark spot for the different regions (data taken over a single pixel). Red crosses: Manhattan Island; orange diamonds: Starfish; green triangles: Ithica; light blue squares: Dolomedes; dark blue stars: Inca City. These retrievals show no appreciable increase of the dark material thickness between Ls 210 and Ls 245-250, although small changes in thickness are permitted by the data. The nature of the venting process and the amount of material that is moved every year leads to the conclusion that it could have an impact on the surface properties in the polar regions. The transport and redeposition of this fine material could progressively lead to the formation of a thin layer of fine material on top of coarser material, thus decreasing the thermal inertia with regards to areas where this venting process does not occur. In particular, this process may contribute to mobilize the relatively small volumes of regolith material needed to obscure the high-thermal inertia/bedrock surfaces (typically a few hundreds of microns), contributing to the lack of in-place bedrock poleward of 50° latitude [6].  Fig 3. Evolution of the surface temperature for a dark material layer of thickness e covering a CO2 ice slab. Blue: e=200 µm, green: e=500 µm, red: e=1 mm. The dark material layer is deposited on top of the CO2 ice at Ls 173. Its thermal inertia is set at 100 SI. Thermal inertia of the CO2 ice is set at 1000 SI. We consider here a terrain at a latitude of -86.3°. The temperature within the ice is set at the surface condensation temperature (T~145K) at the beginning of the simulation. Other simulations with warmer CO2 ice did not show any significant change on the surface temperature, but might have an impact on the possible recondensation of CO2 ice on top of the dark material layer at the beginning of spring. CO2 ice always remains available in these simulations.  References: [1] Kieffer et al. (2006) Nature, 442, 793-796. [2] Kieffer (2007) J. Geophys. Res., 112, 8005-+. [3] Kieffer et al. (2000) J.
