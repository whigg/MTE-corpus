Introduction:  Along the MSL rover Curiosity traverse (from Yellowknife Bay up to Darwin outcrop area) the Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons (DAN) instrument conducted 140 local active mode measurements of the thermal and epithermal neutrons counts in the top ~60 cm of the Martian subsurface with horizontal sensing "footprint" of about 3 m [1, 2]. Based on the mode of measurements it was found that the thermal and epithermal neutron counts measured along the rover traverse show distinct variability from one rover location to another [1, 2]. Such variability in neutron counts maybe caused by both inhomogeneities of the hydrogen content within the subsurface soil layer [3,4] and/or the presence in the Martian soil of such elements as Cl and Fe, which have a higher thermal neutron absorption cross-section than other elements [5]. To understand the effects of local surface morphology at the DAN testing spots, we examine the correlation between a variability in the DAN active mode measurements, local diversity of surface micro-morphology, and regolith texture.  Diversity of the local surface micro-morphology along the rover traverse: As shown in the detailed geological mapping of the Landing area of the Curiosity rover [6], its traverse from the Yellowknife Bay (YKB) to the Darwin outcrop area (DOA) crossed mainly the Smooth Hummocky unit and in places - the Rugged unit spots. Whereas the Smooth Hummocky unit is characterized by low surface roughness and uniform tone, the Rugged unit is typically represented by outcrops with rougher surface texture. Near the beginning of the traverse (first ~800 m) the rover climbed on ~30 m along the NE slope, while the next ~1500 m the rover drove on a surface with elevation modulations from 1 to 3 m at the horizontal scale 100200 m. As it well seen based on Navcam and Mastcam images, the modern dominant micro-morphology of the landing site area is characteristic of surface shaped by strong aeolian deflation processes. Blowout shallow depressions and wind erosion remnants (in forms of mounds and ridges) are widespread along the rover traverse. As result, in most cases the surface texture of the regolith in the traverse area represents a desert pavement - a surface of tightly packed gravels and pebbles that armor lower more fine material below. The gravel size composing the desert pavement varies spatially from fine gravel (<1 cm) to coarse one (1-3 cm). Conglomerate outcrops are also exposed within both the Smooth Hummocky unit and the Rugged unit spots and aeolian accumulation features (aeolian drifts, small dunes and ripples) are relatively rare occurring mainly on local leeward slopes of mounds and ridges. The summits of the mounds and ridges along the rover traverse are characterized by the presence of coarse clastics as a result due to winnowing of the fine material.          Variability of the DAN water equivalent H (WEH in wt. %) along the rover traverse: Variations of the neutrons counts measured by the DAN active mode observations were subjected to a model-dependent deconvolution using both homogeneous and two-layers models [7] of the Martian subsurface with different distributions of water and neutron absorbing elements. It was found that WEH distribution in subsurface layer along the rover traverse from YKB to DOA are fit by a two-layers model, where the top layer (with varied thickness) has less WEH ("dry") than the bottom layer ("wet"). Estimated amounts of WEH within both layers as function of the rover odometry are shown in Fig. 1. The thickness of the top layer along the rover traverse varies in the range 10-30 cm with average thickness ~20 cm. It is distinct that spatial distribution of WEH within the layer (1-2.5 wt. %) are chiefly homogeneous along the traverse, whereas the range of WEH values within the bottom layer are much wider (1-5.8 wt. %) and the spatial distribution of the water amount in the layer is substantially inhomogeneous at the distance from first tens meters to 100 m. As shown in Fig.1b, the rover traverse can be divided into distinct DAN testing subsurface layer types based on the model results. The parts of the traverse with little difference of WEH values between the top and bottom layers are alternated with the parts where the difference remarkably higher.

cm of the Martian subsurface varies in the range 1-4.7 mass % and also is characterized by a notable spatial variability along the rover traverse (Figure 2). Analysis of the surface micro-morphology within DAN testing spots shows that the highest values  Figure 1.

Nevertheless, in separate cases relatively high values of WEH are related to coarser, rocky soil, and outcrops appearance. Examples of different regolith surface textures within the DAN testing spots and appropriate average bulk WEH amount values are shown on figure 3.    Figure 3. Different regolith surface textures within the DAN testing spots and appropriate to the spots average values of WEH amount (shown by red arrows).       Summary: Analysis of the DAN active mode measurements along the Curiosity traverse from the YKB to DOA show that two-layer model of the water distribution in the subsurface layer corresponds well to both outcrops spots and deflated surfaces with variable top layer thickness, that is composed of finely granulated and coarse, rocky soil.  This suggests that the boundary between the top and bottom layer may not represent a lithological difference (while in some cases this is not excluded) but rather it is related with a level of surface regolith desiccation at the modern climatic conditions in the Gale crater area. In places where the surface regolith has been exposed for a longer period of time, the contrast in WEH between the top and bottom layers is essentially lower than in the cases of more recent surface regolith exposure by an aeolian erosion.
