RESOLVING THE GREAT DRYING OF MARS: PALEO-CLIMATE VERSUS TIME FROM RIVER DEPOSITS IN AEOLIS DORSA.  E. S. Kite1,2,3, A. Lucas4, J.C. Armstrong5, O. Aharonson6, and M.P. Lamb1. 1Caltech. 2Princeton (ekite@princeton.edu). 3University of Chicago. 4Université Paris-Diderot. 5 Weber State University. 6Weizmann Institute.  Motivation: Atmospheric precipitation (rain or snow/ice melt) was the water source for many of the rivers and streams of Early Mars [1-3],  but environmental scenarios for runoff production vary widely [49]. Lack of convergence in our understanding of what allowed rain or snowmelt on Early Mars is not the result of any lack of model sophistication; rather, what is currently in short supply are paleo-environmental proxies (ideally, time series) to constrain the models.  Background: River deposits record climate events on Earth through changes in fluvial sediment volumes, channel dimensions, and channel-deposit architecture [10-12]. We are recovering an analogous fluvial record on Mars by measuring paleohydraulic proxies versus stratigraphic elevation in the >105 km2 Aeolis Dorsa basin, noted for exceptional preservation of river and stream deposits [13-16]. The river deposits are eroding out of mappable rock units, (Figure 1) and thus provide time-resolved climate constraints (river valleys provide time-integrated constraints).  Approach: Paleodischarge is constrained by channel width and meander wavelength [13]; minimum runoff duration is found by dividing river-deposit volume by sediment flux (e.g. [17]); intermittency during a wet event is constrained by dividing the duration of runoff by the duration of sediment accumulation [16]; and the number of wet events is greater than or equal to the number of regionally correlatable fluvial packages. Our goal is to condense 3D paleohydraulic information in Aeolis Dorsa onto a single dimension - that of stratigraphy. However, basinwide postdepositional deformation [14] and large-scale unconformities complicate the use of elevation as a proxy for relative time across the basin. Therefore, we (1) identify large-scale unconformities, and thus place rocks in relative time order (Fig. 1); (2) krige between mapped contacts to define structure contours; (3) document all paleohydraulic proxies [18], tagging each measurement with its stratigraphic distance from adjacent contacts; and (4) isolate statistically distinct paleohydraulic facies and compare these to independently-defined rock units. Basin-scale stratigraphic framework. We document at least four unconformity-bounded packages in Aeolis Dorsa, including two packages containing river and stream deposits. River dimensions suggest wet-dry cycles at both long and short timescales, superimposed on an overall drying-upwards trend. Meander deposits record generally NNW-converging meander migration, suggesting NNW-converging paleoflow. We propose that the large-scale transitions between erosion and deposition recorded in Aeolis Dorsa were forced by climate and/or mean-obliquity changes that would have had a global effect on surface liquid water availability and therefore habitability (e.g. [5,6]). This correlates stratigraphy, runoff, habitability, and orbital change. Retrieval of climate change proxy data: example of HiRISE-scale results. As an example of paleohydraulic evidence for a climate transition, a survey of 158 channel banks spanning 2 HiRISE DTMs and 250m of stratigraphy straddlig the F1/F2 contact (Figure 1) shows that channel width decreases from a mean of 29m (n=23) for stratigraphic levels below the interpolated F1/F2 contact to a mean of 16m (n=10) more than 50m above the contact, a significant decline (p=0.003). Assuming constant drainage density and drainage area, this channel width reduction corresponds to a threefold reduction in peak runoff production during the ≳(1-20) Myr  duration of deposition (obtained from the frequency of craters Fig. 1.

inter-bedded with the river deposits; [16]). Based on theory, slow deposition rate, and the observation of small-scale cut-and-fill cycles, this is unlikely to have been a steady decline (models suggest that peak runoff corresponded to orbital optima and/or volcanic/impact transients). Atmospheric pressure during the time of the rivers did not stably exceed 0.9±0.1 bar [19]; these relatively low pressures are consistent with transient melting of ice or snow [19]. We can map the stratigraphic levels of statisticallysignificant paleochannel width change back onto the outcrop topography (colored swaths in Fig. 3; note that these do not parallel topographic contours). We hypothesize that the trend of statistically-significant paleochannel width reduction with stratigraphic elevation found at this site is reproducible in correlatable rocks across Aeolis Dorsa. At the conference we will present the results of our test of this hypothesis, alongside extensions of our paleohydraulic measurements to higher (and lower) levels in the stratigraphic framework; these levels appear to record additional swings in climate (Fig. 1).
