According to some studies, it was formed more than 4 Gyr ago [1], thus containing information about the early physicochemical processes on Mars. We mainly focus here in the origin of Fe-Mg-Ca-rich carbonates [2] which formed 3.9 Gyr ago [3]. Certain mineralogical features associated with them suggested the possibility of being formed by early biologic activity on early Mars [4]. It has been proved that abiotic processes can also explain their formation [5]. In any case, the scenario in which the carbonates formed is still valuable to understand the early stages of Mars, suggesting the presence of water in the form of a CO2 enriched aqueous fluid [1].   Figure 1. A carbonate-rich region of ALH 84001,82 seen in reflected light (left), using cathodoluminiscence (center) and SEM (right).    Technical procedure: We have studied ALH 84001,82 section provided by the NASA´s Johnson Space Center. In a previous work we  characterized the mineralogy of that section performing a nondestructive energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) [6]. Now we have built a cathodoluminiscence map of the section, which allow us to see, in bright red, the Mg-rich and Fe-poor carbonates, associated or not with the globules (Fig. 1). With this map we selected the carbonates from a region of interest that we have not studied before. With a FEI Quanta 650 FEG (Field Emission Gun) SEM working in low vacuum BSED (Back Scattered Electron Detector) mode, we magnify some of these areas to choose the points to study by microRaman spectroscopy. We selected 7 points from a growth region shown in Fig. 2. We also made a SEM elemental mapping and several EDX spectra (with an Inca 250 SSD XMax20 with Peltier cooling) to have more relevant data about the region, and properly characterize the micro-Raman spectra. Those spectra were recorded in backscattering geometry at room temperature, using the 514,5 nm line of an Argon-ion laser with a Jobin-Yvon T-64000 Raman spectrometer attached to an Olympus microscope, and equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled CCD detector. It has high lateral spatial resolution of about ~ 1μm. Finally we used the CrystalSleuth software [7] to remove the background from our spectra and compare them to the ones from the RRUFF catalogue [8]. Results and discussion: We are interested in studying the precise mineralogy of the carbonates that can be found in ALH 84001. Previous studies already obtained Raman spectra from the carbonate globules in this meteorite [9], but their intrinsic mineralogy is difficult to know and understand, as there are just a few regions on Earth where we can find similar carbonates [10], and none are identical. One of the differences between the terrestrial carbonates and the ones from Mars could come from the suggested fact that Martian globules where formed after several events, and their associated physico-chemical processes, while the ones from Earth where formed in a single event [11], but this is still a matter of discussion. The EDX mapping indicates that the inner palegrey rombohedral-shaped areas of the globule (see Fig. 2, bottom) are enriched in Ca and Mn, and depleted in Mg as compared with their inside and surrounding regions. In fact, the spectra obtained from A (Fig. 3), C, D and G (spectra not shown here), which are the less 1844.pdf

noisy regions, apparently fit in some intermediate point between the selected spectra of dolomite (Ca-Mg carbonate), siderite (Fe carbonate) and rhodocrosite (Mn carbonate), together with a combination of hematite (Fe2O3) and magnetite (Fe3O4). The proportion of Mg, Fe and Mn is variable on the three carbonates, but no combination fits exactly the carbonate peaks than can be seen in our spectra. The compositional diversity of the minerals we found on this carbonates can provide some constraints about the aqueous processes that formed them, suggesting that the fluid underwent significant isotopic changes during carbonate precipitation [12].    Figure 2. SEM images of the region of interest. Two clear grey 'circles' (bottom) can be seen inside this carbonate globule (top). The seven points (A to G) from where we obtained Raman spectra are marked (bottom). We also did an EDX analisis of each of this points, except G.   Conclusions: Our micro-Raman analysis indicates that the mineralogy of the carbonate globules does not correspond exactly with the typical Ca-Mg-Fe-Mn-rich carbonates found on Earth, suggesting a different type of carbonate formed under very different and highly variable aqueous dissolutions probably due to changing environmental circumstances.    Figure 3. Example of Raman spectrum corresponding to point A (black), and compared to some normalized and shifted sample spectra of magnesite, ankerite, rhodocrosite, dolomite, and siderite from the RRUFF catalogue. The main carbonate peaks (green lines) fit pretty well for siderite, dolomite and rhodocrosite, but not so well for ankerite and magnesite. The other peaks can be fitted by combining these spectra with the ones from hematite and magnetite.
