ACCESSING PDS DATA IN PIPELINE PROCESSING AND WEB SITES THROUGH PDS GEOSCIENCES ORBITAL DATA EXPLORER’S WEB-BASED API (REST) INTERFACE. K. J. Bennett, J. Wang, D. Scholes, Washington University in St. Louis, 1 Brookings Drive, Campus Box 1169, St. Louis, Missouri, 63130, {bennett, wang, sholes}@wunder.wustl.edu.   Introduction:  The Orbital Data Explorer (ODE) is a web-based search tool (http://ode.rsl.wustl.edu) developed at NASA’s Planetary Data System’s (PDS) Geosciences Node (http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/).  Through ODE, users can search, browse, and download a wide range of PDS Mars, Moon, Mercury, and Venus data ([1,2,3,4]). In the fall of 2012, the Geosciences node introduced a simple web-based API that allows non-PDS web and processing tools to search for PDS products, obtain meta-data about those products, and download the products stored in ODE’s meta-data database. The first version is now used by several teams in periodic processing and web sites. ODE Overview:  ODE provides a cross-mission, cross-instrument searchable web tools for finding and downloading single or multiple PDS compliant archive data products for Mars, Mercury, Venus, and the Earth’s Moon. The basic structure of ODE is shown in Figure 1. It consists of a back-end processor named Bunter, a metadata database, a front-end web interface, and, as of 2012, a web-based REST (Representational State Transfer) interface.

This metadata is stored in the ODE metadata database. This database is the core of both the ODE web site and ODE REST interface. Through this database, ODE also stores direct links to the PDS product files allowing direct access to those product files as needed.  Granular Data:  In addition to PDS products, ODE also offers a set of “granular data” tools for extracting 1026.pdf

granular-level data from selected PDS products. These tools allow users to select granular-level observation data from a range of PDS products that cover selected areas and that meet specific criteria.  Currently, ODE supports granular-level search tools for  MGS MOLA PEDR (Precision Experiment Data Record), LRO LOLA RDR (Reduced Data Record) and Diviner RDR.  These data sets consist of orbit-track oriented products where specific measurements were taken along orbit tracks in time-sequence chunks. To facilitate granular-level searches, the individual granular-level data records are extracted from the products and stored in granular databases. Each granular database has global coverage of the data products. The MOLA searchable database includes approximately 595 million individual PEDR measurements. There are approximately 6 billion and 30 billion records for LOLA and Diviner data respectively. REST Interface Overview:  The ODE Representational State Transfer (REST) interface is a simple web-based interface allowing external users and tools to access the ODE metadata and products. REST query.  The current ODE REST interface only supports read-only GET functions. The query format basically breaks down into several components including target, query type, output format, and query parameters. A simple query will return a variety of data such as a list of products, product metadata, product footprints, product browse images, or even the products themselves. Results are typically in XML or JSON format except in cases where the return is an image.  Product file requests return one or more web-addresses for directly downloading the file(s). Example.  A simple example of using the REST interface to find how many HiRISE Version 1.1 RDR products exist within a latitudes 0 to 10 and longitudes 0 to 10: http://oderest.rsl.wustl.edu/live?target=mars&query=products&results=c&iid=HIRISE&pt=RDRV11&maxlat=10.0&minlat=0.0&westernlon=0.0&easternlon=10.0     Returns (formatted for readability): <ODERsults> <Status>Success</Status> <QuerySummary> <Date>2013-12-18T09:07:08.197</Date> <target>MARS</target> <query>PRODUCT</query> <results>C</results> <iid>HIRISE</iid> <pt>RDRV11</pt> <westernlon>0</westernlon> <easternlon>10</easternlon> <minlat>0</minlat> <maxlat>10</maxlat> </QuerySummary> <Count>353</Count> </ODEResults> REST Product Queries:  The ODE REST interface allows external tools to query ODE for a wide range of data including product metadata. Product metadata, which varies depending on the data set, includes observation times, creation times, map resolutions/scales, observation angles, solar longitudes, solar distances, spacecraft clock times, version numbers, activity ids, producer information, and links to instrument web sites. Queries can be limited by instrument hosts, instruments, product types, data set ids, location, features, observation times, and creation times. Location limits can be based on the “intersecting”, “contains”, or “contained by” geographic relationships between products intersecting a surface lat/lon bounding box or footprint. Using a series of queries can produce a very sophisticated result that find spatial and temporal relationships between various products. REST Granluar Queries:  In addition to the PDS product queries, the current ODE REST interface also supports LOLA RDR granular-level queries. The results are the same as the current ODE web-based LOLA RDR granular query including CommaSeparated Value (CSV) text files, shapefiles, and binned images. REST Access: The REST interface is accessable at http://oderest.rsl.wustl.edu/live/. Interested users should contact the author for more information at bennett@wustl.edu. Future Developments:  The Geosciences node is working on Version 2.0 of the ODE REST interface.  This version will include additional product query limits (example: emission, incidence, and phase angles) as well as expanding the granular queries to include MOLA PEDR and Diviner RDR queries similar to the current web-based tools.  In addition, the granular-level queries will be accessable through a standard Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Web-Feature Service (WFS) interface. Contact Information:  The Geosciences Node welcomes questions and comments from the user community. Please send email to geosci@wunder.wustl.edu.
