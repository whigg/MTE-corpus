Unfortunately the return of thespace craft on September 8, 2004 resulted in a crashlanding, shattering the samples into small fragmentsand exposing them to desert soil and other debris. Onlysmall fragments of the original collectors are availablewith each of them having a different degree of surfacecontamination. Thorough surface cleaning is necessaryto allow for subsequent analysis of solar wind materialembedded within. Initial cleaning is carried out atJohnson Space Center mainly removing larger sizedparticulates and a thin film organic contamination acquired during collection in space [3]. Additional cleaning steps consisting of acid and organic solvent application are done for most samples to remove smallerparticulates and the most notorious contaminants. Toaid in the development of appropriate cleaning procedures and classify a sample as clean for subsequentanalysis the sample is thoroughly inspected by conventional laboratory total reflection X-ray fluorescence(TXRF) spectrometry [4,5]. The ability of TXRF todistinguish between surface deposits and material inthe bulk is well known and documented [4,6]. This isdone by carefully changing the incident beam angleand penetrating into the bulk material. In an effort toextend the use of TXRF for Genesis mission samplesfrom a surface control tool to a more versatile method,its ability to distinguish qualitatively between elementspresent at the surface and within the bulk was tested.For this, a cleaned Genesis sample and an implantstandard were subjected to conventional laboratoryTXRF analysis and to synchrotron grazing incidenceX-ray fluorescence (GI-XRF). The latter one is a closely related, but much more sensitive X-ray fluorescencemethod than TXRF and has been already successfullyapplied for analysis of fluences in selected Genesissamples, mainly first row transition metals [7,8].Experimental: Analyses of Genesis sample 60234and a Fe implant of 5x1014 atoms/cm2, both silicon onsapphire, was performed with a) S2PicoFox TXRFspectrometer (Bruker AXS, Germany) and b) at theGeoSoilsEnviro Consortium for Advanced RadiationSources (GSECARS) 13-ID-C undulator beamline ingrazing incidence X-ray fluorescence set-up. Experimental conditions for the S2PicoFox were: excitationenergy 17.4 keV (Mo- Anode) and counting time 3600seconds (1hour). A special polycarbonate adapter toaccommodate the sample was used as described in [5].The 13-ID-C beamline of the GSECARS at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratoryis equipped with a cryogenic Si (111) double crystalmonochromator, a Vortex® Si-drift detector and a reflectivity detector. The samples were mounted in a Heflow chamber with a Kapton® window [7,8].Results and Conclusion: Figure 1 shows theTXRF surface spectrum of sample 60234 after cleaning with hydrochloric acid. The most prominent peaksare Ca and Fe, but also Ba, Cr and Pb were detected.Previous data obtained with GI-XRF suggested that Feis present in the Si layer of the bulk and relativelyclose to the surface, thus the Fe peak might originatefrom this.Figure 1: TXRF surface spectrum of Genesis sample 60234 (silicon on sapphire) taken in total reflection mode.Figure 2 shows an angle scan of the same sampleacquired with GI-XRF. The black line represents beamreflectivity, which is at its highest at small angles before the beam penetrates below the surface. Silicon(blue) and aluminum (red) are the collector materialsand its signals increase substantially with beam penetration into the bulk. Note the oscillating wave patternfor Si (blue line), which arises from the interaction ofincident and reflected beam within the material and isused to determine the presence and concentration of anelement in this layer. Barium (magenta) is present as asurface contaminant where it displays its highest fluorescence yield and follows a comparable pattern asreflectivity. Fe (green) and Ni (aqua) are within the Silayer of the sample and part of solar wind. Both elements trace the fluorescence yield pattern of Si.To test the feasibility of using TXRF to determinequalitatively whether an element is present at the surface or within the bulk, sample 60234 was subjected toan angle scan with the S2PicoFox.

data obtained from this scan. Whereas the resolution isfar below that of GI-XRF, Ba (magenta) is still clearlyrecognizable as a surface contaminant with highestfluorescence yield there. Fe (green) is most likely present within the bulk as its fluorescence yield increaseswith increasing angle. The sensitivity of the method isnot sufficient to identify Ni, and Ca is difficult to characterize due to decreased fluorescence yields for lighter elements. However, the data indicate the potential ofconventional laboratory TXRF to discriminate betweensurface contaminants and material present in the bulk.Figure 2: GI-XRF angle scan of Genesis sample 60234. Theblack line shows beam reflectivity, blue and red lines represent collector materials, green, magenta and aqua are elements either at thesurface (Ba) or in the bulk (Fe, Ni). The critical angle is at 0.17degree. Please note individual fluorescence yields have been scaledfor presentation purpose in all graphs.Figure 3: TXRF angle scan of Genesis sample 60234. The blackand red lines represent collector materials, blue (Ca), green (Fe) andmagenta (Ba) show elements found. Ba is present at the surface, Fewithin the bulk and for Ca the sensitivity of the method is notsufficient to determine its location. The critical angle is at 0.1degree.To investigate this ability further an implant samplecontaining 5x1014atoms/cm2 Fe implanted at 395±130Ǻ in epitaxially grown silicon (1000Å) on a sapphire substrate was measured by both TXRF and GIXRF. Figure 4 shows the data obtained by conventional TXRF and figure 5 the GI-XRF results. Fe clearlytraces the Si fluorescence yield for both methods andthus is present within the Si layer. Calcium was foundto be a surface contaminant by TXRF in total reflectionmode (spectrum not shown), which is confirmed byGI-XRF data. Again, TXRF is not sensitive enough tolocate Ca clearly.The results indicate that it should be possible toemploy conventional TXRF to qualitatively distinguishbetween surface contaminants and bulk material forselected elements, when employing both angle scanand surface analysis at the critical angle. This abilitywill be very useful as it aids in selection of the mostpromising samples for GI-XRF quantification of solarwind by eliminating heavily surface contaminatedsamples.Figure 4: TXRF angle scan of 5x1014atoms/cm2 Fe (magenta)implanted at 395±130Å in epitaxially grown silicon (red, 1000Å) ona sapphire (black) substrate. Ca (blue) was detected as surface contaminant by surface analysis. The critical angle is at 0.1 degree.Figure 5: GI-XRF angle scan of 5x1014atoms/cm2 Fe (magenta)implanted at 395±130Å in epitaxially grown silicon (red, 1000Å) ona sapphire (black) substrate. Ca (blue) is clearly detected as surfacecontaminant having highest fluorescence yields there. The criticalangle is at 0.17 degree.References:[1] Burnett D.S. et al.
