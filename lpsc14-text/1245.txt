Introduction: In recent years  several detections of hydrated and mafic minerals have been made in the northern plains, revising our understanding of its history and stratigraphy. Large craters reveal hydrated minerals, inferred to be Noachian basement [1], and mafic mineral detections consistent with overlying Hesperian lava flows [2]. Recently new hydrated mineral detections have been made in the knobby terrains within Acidalia Planitia: Fe/Mg phyllosilicates occur on the knobby features exclusively, and hydrated silica and a hydrated "doublet" material are found in the plain unit that embays the knobs [3]. The occurrences of these hydrated mineral detections indicate a distinct geological history compared to the previous detections related to large impact craters and have further implications for understanding the stratigraphy of the northern plains. Study area and mineral detections:  The knobby terrains of Acidalia Planitia lie within the northern lowlands. This region has diverse morphological features, including km-sized knobs, subkilometer pitted cones, polygonal troughs. In the knobby terrains of Acidalia, hydrated features have been detected using data acquired from Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter [3]. Fe/Mg phyllosilicates with 1.4, 1.9, 2.3 μm absorptions and hydrated silica with 1.4, 1.9 and a wide 2.2 μm absorption are mapped in three CRISM images in the region. There are also strong olivine signal detected that coexists with the phyllosilicates, and one occurrence of a "doublet" material with 2.21 and 2.28 μm doublet absorption similar to sulfate or acid leaching product of a smectite [4]. Geomorphic setting: The CRISM detections are made in three images that cover the knobby terrains of Acidalia. The geomorphic setting of the hydrated mineral detections is indicative of the environment they formed in and thus provides clues to the relative timing of geological processes. Fe/Mg phyllosilicates are detected in discontinuous patches on the slope of the knobs (Fig. 1C-D, see Fig. 1A-B for context), with no detections on the surrounding units. Two hypotheses for knob formation are examined: formation as tuyas or as eroded remnants of the southern highlands. Because some of the bigger mesas form in chains with small conical features it has been recently suggested that they form in a way analogous to terrestrial tuyas in a volcanic setting with glacial interaction [5]. Alternatively, prior geologic mapping has indicated these knobs may be eroded remnants of the dichotomy boundary [6]. Detection of Fe/Mg phyllosilicates is patchily distributed, rather than pervasive. No obvious tracking of signature or its lack with presence/absence of mantling material or geomorphic features. One might expect the first scenario to lead to more pervasive alteration than is observed. So the Fe/Mg phyllosilicates observed here are perhaps more consistent with eroded highlands hypothesis, where detections are patchy, though it is not known why this is the case for the southern highlands.  Another unit embays the knobs and has eroded to form a steep-sided platform above the surrounding plains. Within the unit a hydrated silica phase is detected in a dozen of small areas. Silica is highly mobile and can form in diverse aqueous environments [6]. For five scenarios, the types of silica and geomorphic predictions about the mineral detection are listed in Table 1. From the volcanic scenario with least amount of water required (volcanic ash/ glass deposit) to the case it could be directly precipitated from a standing body Figure1.

In our study area, the patchiness of the silica detections suggests the formation as part of a volcanic unit is unlikely.  Also, the detections are never concentrated in topographical lows but rather occur on inflections of slopes (Fig. 1 E-G, see Fig. 1 A-B for context), which implies that the silica is not directly precipitated from a standing body of water. So the intermediate water environmental scenarios are preferred: vapor weathering, thin film leaching, or silicate weathering by transient water. The detection of the "doublet" material in the same unit may indicate an acidic environment.  Implications for geological history: The hydrated minerals detected within the knobby terrains of Acidalia Planitia have provided further constraints on the different geological processes affecting the northern plains. A schematic geological history of the knobby terrains is inferred from the mineralogy and geomorphology (Fig. 2). Early (Noachian) crust was first altered into patchily distributed phyllosilicates and eroded away to form knobs. Due to mass wasting, impacts, outflow channels and aeolian processes, the Noachian crust is fractured and eroded into discrete but spatially aggregated knobs. The spatial proximity of olivine-rich dikes and knobs to the phyllosilicate-bearing knobs indicates they might have undergone similar erosional processes. Then, resurfacing processes including mass wasting and volcanic activity create sediment and lavas that fill in the northern plains. The comprehensive platform unit that surrounds the knobs sometimes exhibits hydrated silica and hydrated "doublet" material that indicate localized aqueous activity, formed in processes like thin film leaching or vapor weathering in acidic environment. Sediments undergo collapse and create scarps that define the platform [8]. The lower unit with pitted cones and polygonal troughs lacks any hydrated mineral detection here and in prior analysis [9], indicating a secular decrease in aqueous activity.
