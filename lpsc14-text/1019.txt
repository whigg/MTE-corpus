In addition, recently available imagery from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has allowed the identification of a number of previously unidentified pyroclastic deposits [2]. In this contribution we describe a volcanic dome and associated lunar pyroclastic deposits (LPD's) located in northern MareVaporum, at 16.42° N and 3.23° E, following an examination of LRO and Clementine and Selene multispectral data. This forms part of an ongoing study of the area by the current authors.  Morphometric properties: The dome (Fig. 1) is relatively symmetrical, with a circular to sub-circular outline and measures approximately 5.2 kms in diameter (east-west), with a summit height of 620 ± 10 meters above the surrounding mare surface. The average slope angle is 13.4° ± 0.1°. The northern flank of the dome abuts the southern rim of a partially submerged 7 km diameter pre-mare, impact crater. This crater exhibits subsidence to the east where the rim is only visible as a feint 'ghost ring.' The height of the western rim of this crater is approximately 200 m above the mare surface, giving an indication of the vertical displacement affecting the eastern rim.  Fig. 1: LRO Quickmap image of suspected volcanic dome and partially submerged crater (North is up).  The dome can be divided into three zones in elevation, the lower comprising a relatively smooth textured debris apron of even albedo. An intermediate zone exhibits a discontinuous surface layer of low albedo overlying a subsurface of a higher albedo. This may reflect mass wastage of the darker surface material on steeper slopes to reveal either a fresh, low maturity soil beneath or soils of differing composition. A summit zone exhibits a roughly square shaped depression measuring approximately 400 m x 400 m, and slightly offset to the east of the actual summit itself (Fig. 2). Located centrally within this depression is a circular crater like structure approximately 160 m diameter and 50 m deep.

Examination of the LPDs: An examination of the Clementine imagery of the dome (Fig. 3) reveals the presence of extremely localised dark LPD's covering the dome summit and flanks and spilling down from    the northern flank over the inner southern wall of the ruined crater.       The LPD appears restricted in extent to the dome itself, with diffuse deposits on the mare to the east and on the floor of the ruined crater possibly being the result of mass wastage. No definitive source vents for the LPD are visible, but the square structure described above may be a candidate, along with number of small dark aureole craters located on the dome flanks and summit. The LPD visible on the southern crater wall represents a remnant of a formerly more extensive deposit. To the west of the visible LPD the crater wall is crossed by swarms of boulder trails originating from the upper crater rim and leading downwards onto the crater floor where large numbers of boulders are visible (Fig. 4). The trails have disrupted the lower albedo LPD to reveal higher albedo material beneath. Trails can also be seen on the prominent LPD itself, indicating that they post-date the formation of the LPD. Indications of mass wastage is also present on the northern flank suggesting slumping of low albedo material down towards the ruined crater.      Viewed in planform (Fig. 1) the debris apron surrounding the dome can be seen to be widest to the west and narrower to the east. LRO GLD-100 data indicates that the upper margin of this apron is some 100m lower in the east than the west. This suggests some degree of subsidence of the dome to the east which may be related to the subsidence evident in the eastern section of the ruined crater. A tongue shaped area of elevated terrain adjacent to the ruined craters north western wall may represent a further volcanic structure. It measures some 2.5 km wide at its base adjoining the crater wall, and extends out onto the mare surface for a further 2.5 km. This feature has an elevation reaching some 60 m above the mare surface. No evidence of LPDs can be seen in the Clementine data associated with this structure, and no vent or flow related features are visible in the LRO imagery to indicate a volcanic extrusive origin.  Spectral data: The Selene-1 (Kaguya) color ratio image (Fig. 3) and Clementine UVVIS multispectral data indicate a higher titanium concentration for the dome and LPD which shows up bluer than the surrounding red mare.  The LPD has a R415/R750 ratio of 0.6422 and a 750 nm albedo of 0. 092, while the nearby mare unit and the undisturbed crater unit have lower R415/R750 ratios of ~0.60 and a 750 nm albedo of about 0.11. Previous work has noted that the Taurus-Littrow, Sinus Aestuum, Vaporum, and Rima Bode LPDs are all "blue" in Clementine colour ratios, suggesting a significant component of high-titanium materials (likely in the form of ilmenite-rich black beads), while deposits at Sulpicius Gallus have intermediate UVVIS ratio values, perhaps due to fewer opaque minerals [3].  The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter's (LRO) Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment (spatial resolution of 950 m/pixel) produces thermal emissivity data, and provide compositional information from 3 wavelengths centered around 8 microns that are used to characterize the Christiansen Feature (CF), which is directly sensitive to silicate mineralogy and the bulk SiO2 content [4].  Silicic minerals exhibit shorter wavelength positions at 8 μm channel. In the present case CF values of 8 μm are towards longer wavelength (CF ~ 8.3 μm) indicate a less silicic composition for the dome and LPD. Fig. 4: LROC Observation M168183822R showing LPD on inner southern crater wall with western extentdisrupted by multiple boulder trails to reveal high albedo subsurface.         Conclusion: The combination of a steep sided edifice suggesting a more acidic effusive event, together with an LPD more indicative of a basic magma composition is unusual and requires further research. Also the highly localised nature of the LPD as compared to other more widespread examples requires explanation.         It is possible that if these LPD's were initially more widespread, embayment of the dome by younger mare lavas may have isolated the deposits on the dome giving the impression of a limited distribution.
