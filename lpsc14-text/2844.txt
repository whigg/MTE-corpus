The search for evidence of past life on Mars requires the identification of regions of past habitable conditions as well as biomarkers that can withstand the harsh present Martian surface conditions [5]. Present characterization of the Martian surface is primarily conducted by remote spectroscopic sensing whose design and mandate is not the search for life (e.g.,  Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO); Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM);, Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) (Pancam); Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) (Mastcam,ChemCam in passive mode)). However, many of these instruments have potential for detecting biomolecules, and an understanding of the limitations of these techniques for biomarker detection and the effects of Martian surface conditions on biomarker degradation is integral to determining whether these assets are capable of detecting evidence of life.       Spring and evaporite deposits are considered two of the most promising environments for past habitability on Mars, and preservation of biosignatures [5,6,7]. Manitoba, Canada hosts the East German Creek (EGC) hypersaline spring complex, and the post impact evaporite gypsum beds of the Lake St. Martin (LSM) impact structure. The EGC complex has microbial mats, sediments, algae and biofabrics, while endolithic communities are ubiquitous in the LSM gypsum beds. These communities are spectrally detectable based largely on the presence of a chlorophyll absorption band at 670 nm [8]; however, the robustness of this feature under Martian surface conditions or if it is detectable with rover resolution spectra was unclear [9].      Experimental Procedure: EGC samples were acquired in 2010 and 2011 from the main spring mound and locations along the main channel and outwash plain. The 2010 samples were irradiated for 44 days in an anhydrous atmosphere of 100mb CO2, while the 2011 samples were subject to 30 days in an anhydrous 13mb CO2 atmosphere. Spectra was collected at day 0 and at the end of the run.      Both crushed and whole samples collected from the LSM impact structure evaporite deposit were exposed to UV irradiance and a, an anhydrous 100mb CO2 atmosphere for 40 days with spectra collectd at day 0, 40 and regular intervals in between.      Irradiation was by means of 25W DO802 deuterium lamp (Heraeus Noblelight, Germany). Total irradiance was calculated and using the daily Mars UV influence model [10]; the irradiance experienced by our samples over the 44 day period corresponds to ~300 Mars years at surface and up to 60,000 Mars years below 2mm of gypsum (see [11] for details).       Reflectance spectra over the 350-2500 nm range were acquired at the University of Winnipeg HOSERLab with an Analytical Spectral Devices FieldSpec Pro HR® spectrophotometer. The spectral resolution of the instrument varies between 2 and 7 nm and spectral sampling is done at 1.4 nm intervals. The data are internally resampled by the instrument to 1 nm intervals. Spectra were acquired at i=30° and e=0° with illumination provided by an inhouse 100 watt quartz-tungsten-halogen light source. A total of between 200 and 1000 spectra were averaged to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Reflectance spectra were measured relative to a calibrated Labsphere (New Hampshire, USA) Spectralon® disk. The ASD spectrometer has three detectors that collectively cover the full 350-2500 nm range. There may be offsets in the data where the detector changeovers occur (1000 and 1830 nm), and which were removed by correcting the shortest (350-1000 nm) and longest (18302500 nm) intervals to the middle interval (1000-1830 nm), which is thermoelectrically cooled and temperature controlled. Band depths in the 670 nm region (chlorophyll absorption band) were calculated using equation 32 of [12] with the continuum placed at 640 and 710 nm for all calculations      To simulate Pancam observations of these materials on the Martian surface, the high resolution laboratory spectra  were multiplied by the solar spectrum, weighting the resulting radiance spectra by the Pancam spectral bands, and divided the radiance value at each band by the solar spectrum weighted by that band. This method provides 11-wavelength spectra that can be used for direct comparison with Pancam relative reflectance values [13]. The same procedure was performed for the Mastcam "science filter" and Bayer   filter spectral bands in order to address the implications of our results for observations by the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover.      In addition to the spectra presented here, X-ray diffraction data was also collected at the HOSERLab facility for additional sample characterization.       Discussion: Following up to 44 days of exposure to Mars like conditions, and preservation of the 670 nm chlorophyll feature and chlorophyll red-edge was observed (Figure 1). A decrease in band depth of the 670nm band ranging from ~16-80% resulted, with correlations seen in the degree of preservation and the spatial proximity of samples to the spring mound and mineral crusts. This preservation is proposed to be due to primarily to the UV-shielding effects of minerals, such as gypsum which dominates the LSM impact crater evaporite deposit and is precipitated at the EGC spring system along with halite and calcite.  Increased preservation of the chlorophyll spectral signature correlates with the presence of gypsum. However, unambiguous detection requires the exposure of the community because the endolithic niche of the organisms allows too little light to penetrate to their depth to lead to a measurable chlorophyll spectrum, thus masking the 670 nm feature.      The spectra were deconvolved to MER Pancam and MSL Mastcam science filter bandpasses to investigate the detectability of the 670 nm feature and to compare to common mineral features. The red-edge and 670 nm feature associated with chlorophyll can be distinguished from the spectra of minerals with features below ~1000 nm, such as hematite and jarosite (Figure 1). However, distinguishing goethite from samples with the chlorophyll feature is more problematic, and quantitative interpretation using band depth data makes little distinction between iron oxyhydroxides and the 670 nm chlorophyll feature. Thus characterization of the mineralogical context of the sample is imperative, as is the use of multiple spectral parameters.      Conclusions: The chlorophyll spectral feature is observable in both Pancam and Mastcam spectra. The spatial distribution and mineral associations of the chlorophyll spectral signature at EGC has provided insights for orbital and rover-based investigations of potential spring deposits on Mars. We find that the chlorophyll spectral signature is more prevalent in samples taken closest to the main spring mound and outwash stream. If there is an opportunity in future rover exploration missions to analyze a spring deposit with reflectance spectroscopy, we suggest that spring vent peripheries and evaporite-rich lake deposits may have the highest potential for a positive identification of the chlorophyll a spectral signature.
