Introduction: The lunar regolith contains a record of the types of material impacting the Earth-Moon system through time. It was recently shown that Apollo 16 ancient regolith breccias contain relic fragments of the impactors hitting the Moon >3.4 Ga, which were characterized as primitive chondritic material [1]. These relics provide a direct measure of the types of material delivered to the Earth-Moon system following the formation of Imbrium basin. A younger set of breccias and soils found at Apollo 16 contain relics with greater compositional diversity than their more ancient counterparts, suggesting a variety of projectiles hit the lunar surface in the post-basin-forming epoch [1]. Further examination of relic materials preserved in lunar regolith breccias will help to elucidate the temporally changing bombardment of the inner solar system and, in particular, the post-cataclysm impact flux (Fig. 1).   Fig. 1. Schematic diagram of Earth-Moon bombardment models with potential pulses of increased impact activity at ~ 2, 0.8, and 0.5 Ga (after [2]).  Several pulses of increased impact activity may have occurred in the post basin-forming epoch (Fig. 1).  An increase in impact activity at ~0.5 Ga (Fig. 1) was apparently prompted by the disruption of the Lchondrite parent body at ~0.47 Ga (e.g., [3]), which produced a large number of shocked L-chondrites with that age [3] and several terrestrial impact craters shortly thereafter (e.g., [4, 5]). Another pulse may have occurred at ~0.8 Ga (Fig. 1), based on the impact ages observed in several ordinary chondrites [6-8] and the inferred age of Copernicus crater (e.g., [9]). There are hints of an additional impact pulse (Fig. 1) at ~2 Ga [10] based on the ages of the Vredefort (~2 Ga [11]) and Sudbury (~1.85 Ga [12]) terrestrial impact structures and LL chondrite meteorite impact ages (e.g., [13]). More recently, this potential impact pulse has been reinforced by a 1.9 Ga impact-reset age from zircon and phosphate in Apollo 15 melt breccia 15405 [14] and by ~1.8 Ga model ages of 2 lunar crater floors as determined by superposed crater size-frequency distributions [15]. Although at least two large terrestrial impact structures formed ~2 Ga, the collisional history of the Proterozoic Earth is poorly constrained among terrestrial samples (e.g., [2]). Therefore, we turn our attention to the lunar regolith breccias, which serve as time capsules for the bombardment history of the Earth-Moon system. In particular, we focus on samples with closure ages similar to the implied impact pulse at ~2 Ga. Sample Closure Ages: The trapped 40Ar/36Ar ratio (ArTr) in a regolith breccia can be used to determine the time of sample closure to further solar wind (and projectile) input through burial (e.g., [16-19]). The relationship between ArTr and time was recently recalibrated [20, after 19], producing the formula: t=1.2103ln(ArTr)+0.7148, where t is the model closure age (Ga). Using this new calibration, we have calculated the closure ages of 56 lunar regolith breccias from the Apollo, Luna, and meteorite collections [21] (Fig. 2).    Fig. 2. Stacked histogram of regolith breccia closure ages calculated in this study; Apollo 16 ages were calculated by [20]. Bin size is 0.25 Ga.  Collectively, the data indicate that regolith breccias can provide a fairly complete record of surface processes over the past 4 Ga. From that collection of samples [21], we selected 9 with closure ages ranging from ~2.4 to ~1.5 Ga.  1907.pdf

Analytical Methods: Thin sections of selected samples were examined using an optical microscope and the NASA JSC JEOL-5910LV Field Emission- Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM), which collected qualitative element and back-scatter electron maps to identify potentially exotic lithic and mineral fragments (see [22] for details of FE-SEM element mapping technique). Fragments of interest were then analyzed using the NASA JSC Cameca SX100 electron microprobe to determine mineral compositions.  Identified Relics: Three samples (10021,35; 10060,33; and 15287,7) with closure ages 1.79 to 1.76 Ga were each found to contain at least one particle with non-lunar chemistry; analyses of the remaining 6 samples are ongoing.  10021,35 (t~1.79 Ga). One ~30 µm long isolated enstatite grain (En82-83Fs16-17Wo1) has a non-lunar Fe/Mn ratio of 20 to 23 (Fig. 3) and Mg# of 83 to 85. This is similar to the composition of pyroxene in several H chondrites (e.g., Seoni, Conquista, and Uberaba [23-25]), suggesting an origin from a similar source. 10060,33 (t~1.76 Ga). A ~130×135 µm lithic clast consists of forsteritic olivine (typically Fo85-89) and plagioclase (An79). Olivine has a non-lunar Fe/Mn ratio (~45 to 65; Fig. 3) and compositional similarities to several CO chondrites (i.e., ALHA77307, Isna, and Lance, [26]). Additionally, the plagioclase is compositionally similar to that of plagioclase-bearing chondrules in Kainsaz, a CO chondrite [27]. Based on compositional affinities to some CO chondrites, the lithic clast may be from a similar source.   Fig. 3. Mn and Fe data from 10021 and 10060 relics compared to lunar (grey field) compositions. Modified from [1].  15287,7 (t~1.76 Ga). A moderately elongate spherule (~155×190 µm) is composed of metallic grains with ~75 to 78 wt% Fe and 22 to 23 wt% Ni; minor amounts of Co (~1 wt%) and P (0.1 to 0.5 wt%) are also present. The mesostasis has higher concentrations of P (7.7-8.3 wt%), S (1.1 to 1.4 wt%), and Ni (26.4 to 27.2 wt%). The Co/Ni ratio of the metallic grains is 0.05, which is chondritic (e.g., [28]). Although a link to a specific type of meteoritic material has not yet been made, the significant Ni content suggests that the spherule has a non-lunar provenance.  Relic Diversity. The relics identified here provide information about the post basin-forming projectile record, which is more diverse than during the final stages of the basin-forming epoch [1]. Relics found in 10021 and 10060 suggest that the Earth-Moon system was impacted by bodies with compositional similarities to H and CO chondrites, respectively, prior to sample closure ~1.79 to 1.76 Ga. Similarly, 3 relics found in 60255 [1], which closed ~1.7 Ga [20], indicate the presence of carbonaceous chondrite projectiles, with at least one relic suggesting a CI chondrite source [1]. Together, these samples indicate that the Earth-Moon system experienced bombardment from multiple projectile types circa 2 Ga. Thus far, we have not encountered any evidence of a dominant impactor population that might be consistent with the breakup of a planetesimal and the resultant pulse of cratering like that seen at ~0.5 Ga. Identifying and classifying additional relics from lunar regolith breccias with similar closure ages will help to constrain and better characterize the impactor population during the ~2 Ga interval of time.
