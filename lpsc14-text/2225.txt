GRAVITATIONAL SIGNATURES OF LUNAR FLOOR FRACTURED CRATERS Thorey cle´ment, Chloe´Michaut and Mark Wieczorek , Universite´ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite´, Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris,F-75013 Paris, France, thorey@ipgp.frIntroduction: About 200 Floor Fractured Craters(FFCs) have been identified by [1] on the Moon. Thesecraters are characterized by distinctive shallow floorsand numerous floor fractures that suggest an endogenous process of modification. Intrusion of magma beneath the crater floor and viscous relaxation of the cratertopography after the impact are two proposed scenariosto explain these deformations.Our recent theoretical model for the dynamics ofcrater-centered intrusions [2] and morphological andgeological studies [3] showed that intrusion of magmabeneath the crater floor is the most reliable scenario toproduce the morphological features observed at FFCs.Magmatic intrusions should be emplaced at their levelof neutral buoyancy. Upon cooling and solidification,however, their densities will be larger than the surrounding crustal material and hence leave a positive signature in the gravity field. Guided by the predictions ofour theoretical model [2], we investigate here the potential gravitational signatures of crater-centered intrusionson the Moon. We compare them with the gravity fieldrecorded by the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) [4] at the sites of FFCs in order to obtaininsights into magma transport and physical properties.Theoretical considerations: The Bouguer anomalyassociated with a magmatic intrusion beneath a craterdepends upon the intrusion characteristics. Recently,we showed that the morphology of crater-centered intrusions depends upon the overlying layer properties,in particular the thickness of the overlying elastic layer[2]. For an overlying layer with no elastic strength or anelastic layer sufficiently thin compared to the crater size,the intrusion is predicted to be flat and close to cylindrical; the crater floor shows a plate-like topography (Figure 1, top left). On the contrary, when the intrusion isemplaced beneath a thick elastic layer relatively to thecrater size, the intrusions is bell-shaped and the craterfloor appears convex (Figure 1: top right). Accordingly,the classification based on six categories proposed by[1] can be simplified into two main FFC types whenconsidering their gravitational signals: flat floor (class3, 5 and 6) and convex floor (class 2 and 4) FFCs.The bottom panel of Figure 1 shows the syntheticBouguer anomaly expected in both cases for a 100 kmdiameter crater. For these models, a large, 2 km thick,crater-centered intrusion is emplaced with density contrast of 500 kg m−3. These are the maximum expectedvalues for these parameters, and gives rise to the maximum expected gravity anomaly. The two intrusionshapes result in two different types of anomaly. For aflat-top cylindrical intrusion, i.e. a flat floor FFC, theanomaly is about 44 mGal; it is uniform over the entire crater floor and sharply decreases at the crater rim.In contrast, for a bell-shaped intrusion, i.e. a convexfloor FFC, the expected anomaly is smaller in amplitude by 8 mGal and the shape of the gravity anomaly isalso bell-shaped. The gravity anomaly for convex floorFFCs should therefore be harder to detect.Radial axis (km)Radial axis (km)Gravity anomaly (mGal)Radial axis (km)Radial axis (km)Gravity anomaly (mGal)Convex floor10km5 kmMoatMoatFlatFloorWarner FFC Vitello FFCFlat top intrusion Bell shaped intrusion−2 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 20510152025−2 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 20510152025Dimensionless axis Dimensionless axisDimensionlesstopographyDimensionlesstopographyMoatMoat Flat floor Convex floorFigure 1: (Top left) 1D profile showing the initial (dashedline) and final (solid line) modeled floor topography for an intrusion that is emplaced at a shallow depth below the craterfloor.

We made use of the primary missionspherical harmonic degree 660 field of [5], and usingthe crustal model of [6], we removed the gravitationalcontribution of surface topography, long wavelength lateral variations in crustal density, and lateral variationsin crustal thickness. The remaining signal representsshort wavelength variations in density of the upper crust.2225.pdf

Theblack dashed line represents the crater rim. A positive gravityanomaly with a mean value of 41 mGals is found in the centralposition of the crater.To minimize shortwavelength noise, the spherical harmonic coefficients were cosine tapered between degrees350 and 450 (as an example, see Figure 2 for the floorfractured crater Taruntius).We used the dataset obtained by [3] as a reference catalog for FFCs. Large impact basins on the nearsideof the Moon are filled with thick basaltic lava flowsthat might have masked the signal from possible magmatic intrusions of the same density. For this reason,we discarded all the floor fractured craters that lie withinthe lunar maria. Furthermore, filtering the gravity mapproduced important artifacts around the large masconbasins; therefore, we also removed craters adjacent tothe mascon basins. In the end, we worked with a population of 68 floor fractured craters with diameters between20 and 100 km. For comparison, we also picked 5 different populations of 68 craters from the farside highlands,that showed no evidence for post impact deformations,with the same size-frequency distribution as the floorfractured craters.For each crater, we defined the gravity anomaly as themean value of the measured gravity anomaly within thecrater’s topographic rim and we looked at the correlation between this anomaly and the crater topography.Results and discussion: Histograms of the gravityanomaly for the FFCs and normal highland craters areshown in Figure 3. The mean anomaly of the FFCs ispositive and is equal to 5.3 mGals, whereas the mean ofthe normal craters is slightly negative and equal to -2.0mGals. Within the FFCs population, 61% show a flatfloor with a mean anomaly of 6.2 mGal. In contrast,31% show a convex floor with a mean anomaly of 3.9mGal (Figure 3: right)As a group, floor fractured craters have positive gravity anomalies that are consistent with our model ofcrustal intrusions. The average difference betweenFFCs and normal highland craters is 7 mGal which, fora density contrast of 500 km m−3, corresponds to anaverage intrusion thickness of 400 m. Nevertheless, thesimilarity in the distribution of normal and floor fractured craters suggest that the natural variations in gravity signals of impact craters might overwhelm the signalgenerated by subcrustal intrusions for some FFCs. Ananalysis of the morphology of crater gravity signals maybe capable of distinguishing the signal of magmatic intrusions from other processes.−30 −20 −10 0 10 20 30 40 50 600102030405060Gravity anomaly (mGal) Frequency (%)  Flat Floor FFCsMean = 6.2 mGalConvex FFCsMean = 3.9 mGal−40 −30 −20 −10 0 10 20 30 40010203040506070 Gravity anomaly (mGal) Frequency (%)  CratersMean=-2.0 mGalFFCsMean=5.3 mGalFigure 3: (Left) distribution of the average gravity anomalyabove the crater floor for the whole population of FFCs and anaverage of 5 similarly sized normal crater populations in thehighlands.
