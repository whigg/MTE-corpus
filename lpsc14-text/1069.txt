40AR/39AR AGES OF LUNAR IMPACT GLASSES: COMPOSITIONAL-, SIZE-, AND SHAPEDEPENDENCIES    N. E. B. Zellner1 and J. W. Delano2,  1Department of Physics, Albion College, Albion, MI 49224 USA (nzellner@albion.edu), 2New York Center for Astrobiology, Department of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences, University at Albany (SUNY), Albany, NY 12222 USA  Introduction: Lunar impact glasses, which are quenched melts produced during past cratering events on the Moon, have the potential to provide compositional information about both the local and regional geology of the Moon and also about the impact flux over time. Using results from the current and past studies, we demonstrate why it is important for 40Ar/39Ar investigations of lunar impact glasses to report size, shape, and chemical composition of each specimen of inclusion-free impact glass. We also suggest that thorough documentation of all lunar glasses (i.e., sizes, shapes, chemical composition) is needed in all future studies. Samples: Shape, size, major-element compostions, and/or 40Ar/39Ar age data from hundreds of lunar impact glasses [1-6] from the Apollo 12, 14, 16, and 17 landing sites were assessed to determine if any of these parameters might affect how well the lunar impact glass could retain argon. Gombosi et al. [7] studied 40Ar/39Ar systematics in three large (~1.6 mm diameter) glass spherules having chemical compositions similar to that of Apollo 16 regolith and suggested that significant loss of radiogenic 40Ar could occur in those glasses during diurnal temperature-cycling in the upper ~20 cm of the lunar regolith. Gombosi et al. [7] further proposed that melt structure, which is closely related to chemical composition, and diffusivity of radiogenic 40Ar could be described using the fraction of non-bridging oxygens, XNBO [8,9]. Using the criterion that shape, size, and composition together [1,2,4] can best characterize any impact glass, ~100 lunar impact glasses from all data sets were selected for study. Results: The ability of glass to retain radiogenic 40Ar during extended residence of the glass in the shallow regolith has been implicitly assumed by all previous investigators [1-6]. However, diurnal heating of the regolith may be important [7].  For a given temperature, the Ar diffusivity of a glass would be inversely proportional to its XNBO value:  )(2)(2FCNCFCNCNBOXXXXX   where XNC = mole fraction of oxide with cations having network-modifying and charge-balancing roles (e.g., FeO, MnO, MgO, CaO, Na2O, and K2O); and XFC = mole fraction of oxide (other than Si) with cations having network-forming roles (e.g., TiO2 and Al2O3). CrO was included as an additional minor component in the XNC term.  Since diffusive loss of radiogenic 40Ar in glass would also be related to the size of the glass sphere/shard, the current investigation revisited 40Ar/39Ar results on clean (i.e., xenocryst- and xenolith-free) lunar impact glasses where sizes, shapes, and chemical compositions were known. Figure 1 shows the distribution of 40Ar/39Ar ages as a function of chemical composition (XNBO), shape, and size of glass. Discussion: In this study, we find that glasses with the lowest values of XNBO (e.g., <0.21; felsic compositions) would be most susceptible to diffusive loss of radiogenic 40Ar. This can be seen in Figure 1, where the majority of glasses, regardless of size or shape, show apparent ages <1000 My. In contrast, larger glass fragments (>200 m with XNBO>0.21) have a distinctly older distribution of 40Ar/39Ar ages (Figure 1), some of which are likely to record the true age of the original melting event, depending on the size of the glass and its specific XNBO value. Therefore, the likelihood of 40Ar/39Ar ages of lunar impact glasses (independent of shape) recording the actual age of the impact melting event, instead of a minimum value (i.e., apparent age) caused by diffusive-loss of radiogenic 40Ar [7], increases with (i) size of the glass sample and (ii) the fraction of non-bridging oxygens (i.e., chemical composition; XNBO).  Additionally, while it has been shown that the impact-produced glass spheres from four Apollo landing sites show a pronounced enhancement of 40Ar/39Ar ages <1000 My [e.g., 3,5,6], we suggest that this is instead a product of diffusive loss of 1069.pdf

 radiogenic 40Ar and/or limited lifespans (~100 My half-life) prior to being broken into angular shards. Figure 2 shows the age-distribution of 87 lunar impact glass spheres (and dumbbells) ranging in size from ~125 m to ~575 m from the Apollo 12, 14, 16, and 17 landing sites. Glass spheres in this size range are dominated by 40Ar/39Ar ages  1000 My. This distribution is also broadly comparable to that observed among the small (<175 m) glass shards (Figure 2a in [11]). The age-frequency distribution of impact glass spheres appears to conform to a half-life of ~100 My. Since the age-distribution of impact glass spheres appears to be not controlled by either size of the glass sphere or its chemical composition (i.e., XNBO value), but can be approximated by a 100 My half-life, we speculate that impact-produced glass spheres become broken into shards over time during gardening of the lunar regolith. Conclusion: Shape, size, major-element compostions, and 40Ar/39Ar age are important parameters to consider together if a true assessment of the lunar impact flux is to be obtained. Since lunar impact glasses with ANT highlands compositions have low XNBO values, they are not likely to record 40Ar/39Ar ages either during, or prior to, the terminal lunar cataclysm (≥ 3900 Ma). In contrast, impact glasses with high XNBO values have greater potential for recording ancient impact events due to their lower Ar-diffusivities.  The veracity of 40Ar/39Ar ages (i.e., real vs. apparent ages) of lunar impact glasses is likely to be related to size, shape, and composition. In particular, shards may be the preferred sample shape, since the original lunar impact glass spheres would have short life-spans against shattering and would be intrinsically biased toward young 40Ar/39Ar ages.
