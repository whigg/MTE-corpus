 SYNTHESIS OF HYBRID DUAL-POLARIMETRIC RADAR SIGNATURES WITH APPLICATION TO LUNAR SURFACE.  Dharmendra Pandey, Sriram Saran, Anup Das, Manab Chakraborty, Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad 380015, India (dkp@sac.isro.gov.in)   Introduction: The Mini-SAR and Mini-RF instruments (jointly called as the Mini-RF radars) flown on the Chandrayaan-1 and Lunar Reconnaisance Orbiter (LRO) respectively are a class of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) with an innovative hybrid dual polarimetric architecture [1, 2], a form of compact polarimetry [3]. Both these radars offer the same suite of polarimetric information (expressed through four Stokes parameters and their child products) from lunar orbit as Earth-based radar astronomy[4]. Classical child parameters such as the degree of depolarization, the circular polarization ratio, and the the degree of linear polarization may be determined from the Stokes parameters. The values of these parameters provide objective indications of geophysical properties of the surface [5, 6, 7]. A compact polarimetric SAR system like the Mini-RF transmits a designed polarization and receives two polarizations. It can only obtain two scattering matrix elements and  the information loss makes interpretation of compact polarimetric imagery difficult [8]. In this paper we attempt to utilize polarization signature plots synthesized from the Mini-RF data for visualization of the scattering characteristics of lunar surface. Scientific Context: Apart from the Stokes child paremeters, polarimetric analysis of the data received from the Mini-RF radars involves signal decomposition, in which two or more suitably selected parameters are used jointly to classify fundamental characteristics of the observed field [4]. Although the radars transmit a fully polarized EM field, the resulting backscatter includes fully polarized and randomly polarized constituents [2, 4]. The randomly polarized part arises primarily from volumetric materials that give rise to multiple internal reflections which obliterate the polarization of the illumination. The polarized portion of the backscatter falls into two classes, single (odd) bounce and double (even) bounce [4].  Currently there are three methods of decomposing the hybrid polarimetric data which are the m-delta [1], m-chi [4] and m-alpha [9] where m, delta (δ), chi and alpha referes to the degree of polarization, relative phase between received H and V, degree of circularity and the scattering mechanism parameter (0<alpha<90°) respectively. In the m-alpha method, [9] has related the elements of the Stokes vector to the elements of T3, the 3 × 3 scattering coherency matrix and not to the coherence of the wave ellipse (m) or its propagation phase (δ). In this way, [9] was able to relate Stokes parameters to the scattering coefficients of the medium and not to the properties of the propagating wave.   Method:  As an alternative to the above discussed methods, considering that the receiving signal power is a function of the orientation angles (ϕs )and elliptical angles (χs) of the transmitting and receiving waves, a two-dimensional curve called polarimetric signature plot can provide a straight visualization of the target polarimetric characteristic [8]. The advantage of this method is that utilizing polarization synthesis technique, one can compute the receiving signal power from scattering matrix (Sinclair matrix, Muller matrix or Stokes Matrix) under any transmitting and receiving polarizations [10]. Also, polarization synthesis provides more polarimetric characteristics for the analysis and interpretation of the polarimetric imagery. The receiving signal power is a function of the orientation angle and elliptical angle of the receiving wave as Pr (ϕs , χs), and then the polarimetric signature plot was generated. The polarization synthesis equation can be denoted as [8]     This equation implies the receiving power depends on the matching degree of the receiving antenna and the backscattering wave [8]. Jr indicates the Stokes vector of the antenna polarization state, and it is independent of the target scattering. It is the function of (ϕs, χs). The Mini-RF radars transmit a wave on circular polarization (the so-called CL mode), while receive the backward wave on two orthogonal polarizations with phase coherence. These Mini-RF data can be used to generate images for each element of the Stokes vector [4]. These four polarization images are a primary data product of Mini-RF, and are mapped to the lunar coordinate grid with a resolution of 15 m/pixel [2]. We have collected samples from the Mini-RF data of Mare Orientale region on the moon in 3 classes - surface (single/odd bounce), double bounce (dihedrals/diplanes and volume (randomly polarized) scatterers. The surface scattering samples were collected from regions that include Bragg scattering, as well as specular reflection from a quasiplanar surface. The double bounce scattering samples were collected from the regions where combinations of the floor and far wall  (from the radar's perspective) of some craters are dominant.         Results: The samples for the 3 classes were averaged and used for generating polarization signatures as shown in Figure 1.     In case of dihedral (double bounce) and volume (dipole/random) scattering classes, the obtained signatures were a close match to the ideal response where as the surface scattering signature indicates a mixed contribution from surface (polarized) and volume (depolarized) scatterers. The results are also observed to be in close agreement with the m-chi decomposition images generated for the same regions. Also, more homogenous samples could have produced ideal responses for each of the classes.  Conclusion: Since the Mini-RF radar data is available in the  from of Stokes parameters, the 2×2 complex matrix cannot be generated for futher analysis in the form of reconstruction of pseudo-fully polarimetric information. Hence, the compact polarimetric synthesis discussed in this method could be used to provide additional information along with the exisiting methods of target decomposition. We are further analyzing the polarimetric scattering characteristics of lunar as well as terrestrial surface features.  References:.  [1] Raney, R. K. (2007) IEEE Trans. Geosci.
