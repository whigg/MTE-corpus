Introduction:  We present the results of spectral observations,  processing and analysis of Uranus and Neptune  spectra  obtaining  during  period  of  2001-  2012 years. Observations were carried out at the peak Terskol observatory (Northern Caucasus, Russia) using the coude eshelle high-resolution spectrograph and 2-meter mirror  telescope  Zeiss-2000  [1].  Data  were  obtained with spectral resolution R=45000 within 3700 - 9000 Angstroms range. Using noted equipment it was possible to detect Raman light scattering by hydrogen molecules H2 in the atmosphere spectra of major planets. Raman scattering makes  contribution  to  spectra  because  of  prevailing content  H2 (85%).  During  a  molecular  scattering process the photon may lose energy according to certain molecular transitions. a) b) Fig.1   Raman scattering spectra of Uranus (a) and Neptune (b) in the field of H&K CaII lines. Results:  We did the calculation of spectral  geometric albedo Ag taking into account of Raman scattering. Calculation of the geometric albedo for the Uranus disk was performed according to the formula: Researches  of  long-  and  short-periodic  variations for  Ag and  intensities  of  some chosen  spectral  lines were done.

Successive time variations of geometric albedo (Ag) levels of Uranus and Neptune during some years  are presented. These variations characterize bright changes of planet cloud surface  in  consequence  of  rotation  of  planets,  the appearance  and  movement  of  new  clouds  in atmosphere and other factors.
