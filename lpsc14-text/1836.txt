Observations were carried out at the peak Terskol observatory (Northern Caucasus, Russia) using thecoude eshelle high-resolution spectrograph and 2-metermirror  telescope  Zeiss-2000  [1].  Data  were  obtainedwith spectral resolution R=45000 within 3700 - 9000Angstroms range. Using noted equipment it was possible to detect Raman light scattering by hydrogen molecules H2 in theatmosphere spectra of major planets. Raman scatteringmakes  contribution  to  spectra  because  of  prevailingcontent  H2 (85%).  During  a  molecular  scatteringprocess the photon may lose energy according to certain molecular transitions.a)b)Fig.1   Raman scattering spectra of Uranus (a) andNeptune (b) in the field of H&K CaII lines.Results:  We did the calculation of spectral  geometric albedo Ag taking into account of Raman scattering. Calculation of the geometric albedo for the Uranusdisk was performed according to the formula:Researches  of  long-  and  short-periodic  variationsfor  Ag and  intensities  of  some chosen  spectral  lineswere done.Fig.2 Geometric albedo spectrum of Uranus disc: 1 authors (2011), 2 - Karkoschka E. (1993) [2].A  comparative  analysis  of  Uranus  and Neptunespectra for different years was done. Successive timevariations of geometric albedo (Ag) levels of Uranusand Neptune during some years  are presented. Thesevariations characterize bright changes of planet cloudsurface  in  consequence  of  rotation  of  planets,  theappearance  and  movement  of  new  clouds  inatmosphere and other factors.Reference:[1]  http://www.terskol.com/telescopes/maestro.htm[2] Karkoschka E.
