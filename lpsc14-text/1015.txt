In addition to isotopic studies, a few quantitative traceelement measurements have been carried out on bulk SiC fractions [e.g., 1] and individual presolar SiC grains [e.g., 2 – 5]. Amari et al. [2] compared the observed trace element abundance patterns in presolar SiC grains to results of condensation calculations for circumstellar environments to associate grains with different C-rich stellar environments [6]. Measurements of rare earth element isotopes like Eu and Nd [7 – 9] in mainstream SiC grains have been compared to astronomical observations of carbon-enriched metal poor stars and s-process predictions of AGB stars, indicating the importance of determining REE abundances in presolar grains.  In contrast with the previously mentioned studies of presolar SiC grains, there are few published studies attempting to quantify the abundance and distribution of trace elements in presolar graphite grains. This is primarily due to the fact that isotopic studies of graphites and elemental ratios measured in subgrains during TEM studies of ultra-microtomed slices of graphites, have indicated that presolar graphite grains have much lower trace element abundances compared to presolar SiC grains [e.g., 10 – 14]. Low-density (LD) graphite grains are made of turbostratic layers of poorly crystallized graphite and are good accommodators of trace elements in their structure; in addition, each grain is known to contain abundant TiC subgrains (~ 2400 ppm of the graphite; [13]) that have their own unique trace element compositions. Thus, LD graphite grains are better candidates for trace-element measurements compared to high-density (HD) grains that have wellcrystallized onion-like structures. Isotopic and TEM measurements have indicated that trace elements, like Mg, Al, Si, and Ca, appear to have been incorporated into the parent grain during primary graphite crystallization [12, 15]. Other trace elements like Ti, Zr, Ru, Mo, Fe, and Ni are found concentrated within early crystallizing subgrains [13, 14] that were later incorporated into the parent graphite grain.  Knowledge of the condensation behavior of trace elements in presolar grains can provide a wealth of information on the physical and chemical conditions in the cooling outflows of the stars around which these grains condensed. In this study, thirteen individual LD graphite grains from the OR1d (g cm-3) density fraction of Orgueil were measured for the trace elements, Mg, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Fe, Ni, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, and Nb, using SIMS. We present here some of the preliminary data from these measurements. Experimental details: Thirteen LD Orgueil (OR1d: g cm-3) graphite grains (diameters = 511 m) were picked with a micromanipulator and transferred to a clean gold-foil mount to reduce contamination from surrounding macromolecular carbon. We used the University of Hawai‘i’s Cameca ims 1280 ion microprobe to measure ions of 12C+, 24Mg+, 28Si+, 44Ca+, 47Ti+, 51V+, 56Fe+ (Stage1) and 12C+, 45Sc+, 56Fe+, 60Ni+, 62Ni+, 85Rb+, 86Sr+, 89Y+, 90Zr+, 93Nb+ (Stage 2) by magnetic peak jumping. A 3060 pA O- primary beam focused to ~ 1 µm was rastered over 12×12 µm2 regions surrounding the graphite grains and scanning ion images were collected. We flooded the sample chamber with O2 to enhance the ion yield of the measurements. After collecting trace element data, a Cs+ primary beam was used to measure C, N, and Si isotopic ratios of the grains. Scanning ion images of the isotopic data were collected in a combination of both multi-collection and peak-jumping mode. Isotopic ratios were calculated from regions of interest using L’image software. Due to the lack of a good graphite standard with known concentrations of the measured trace elements, we present ion counts normalized to 12C counts in this abstract. We did measure a graphite standard, USGS24, for all elements presented here. An attempt to obtain known concentrations of these elements for USGS24 through ICP-MS measurements will be made in the near future. Synthetic SiC grains were used as standards for the C, N, and Si isotopic measurements. Results: Six out of the 13 grains measured have large 28Si and/or 15N excesses (Figures 1 and 2) indicating an origin in type II supernovae. These grains are numbered in Figures 1 & 2. Grains 1, 9, 4, and 13 have both 15N and 28Si excesses. Grain 12 is only enriched in 28Si (not 15N) and grain 6 has 15N and 29Si excesses. All errors are 1.  The 24Mg/12C ratio in the grains ranged from 0.028, 28Si/12C from 0.28, 44Ca/12C from 0.0030.1, 47Ti/12C from 0.0020.5, 51V/12C from 0.00020.6, and 56Fe/12C from 0.0313.

The 24Mg/12C and 56Fe/12C ratios in the grains were affected by this contamination and are upper limits. 12C/13C100 101 102 10314N/15N10110210312413916  30Si‐800 ‐600 ‐400 ‐200 0 200 400 600 80029Si‐800‐600‐400‐200020040060080012413916 A large fraction of Orgueil LD graphites are known to condense in supernova (SN) ejecta, as indicated by 15N, 18O, 28Si excesses and high derived values of 26Al/27Al, 41Ca/40Ca, and 44Ca/40Ca ratios measured in the grains [12]. In Figure 3, we plot 47Ti versus 44Ca concentrations in the grains. There is a rough correlation between these concentrations indicating that 44Ca excesses in the grains are due to the decay of the shortlived radionuclide, 44Ti, synthesized in core-collapse SNe. The lack of correlation in 3 of the 6 SN grains is likely due to the poor spatial resolution of our measurements wherein we are unable to resolve the signal from the sub-micron TiC subgrains from which the 44Ca excesses originate. Figure 4 shows a better correlation between the Ti and V contents in the grains. Titanium and V are often found correlated in (Ti,V)C subgrains in graphite grains [13]. The remaining trace element data along with a discussion will be presented at the meeting. 44Ca/12C5e‐2 1e‐147Ti/12C1e‐12e‐13e‐14e‐15e‐112413916 51V/12C1e‐1 2e‐1 3e‐1 4e‐1 5e‐147Ti/12C1e‐12e‐13e‐14e‐15e‐112413916 References:  [1] Zinner E. et al.
