Hokkaido Univ.   Introduction:  A plume of vapor and water ice particles rich in sodium salts erupting from the south polar region of Enceladus suggests the presence of a liquid water reservoir in the interior [1–3]. Thus, Enceladus’ plumes provide unique opportunities for understanding the physical and chemical conditions of its interior ocean.  The recent discovery of silica nanoparticles derived from the plumes by the Cassini spacecraft [4, 5] indicates the presence of silica in Enceladus’ ocean [5]. In terrestrial geothermal fields, the formation of silica nanoparticles occurs when hydrothermal fluids with high concentrations of dissolved silica are cooled [6, 7]. Accordingly, the discovery of silica nanoparticles implies in turn the presence of a thermal gradient in the interior of the moon [5]. However, silica formation is controlled not only by temperature, but also by rock composition and fluid pH [6, 7]. Thus, the interpretation of the observations critically depends on our understanding of the nature of water–rock interactions in Enceladus, which are poorly constrained. Many laboratory experiments have been performed under the conditions of terrestrial hydrothermal vent fields, but there are few experiments focusing on Enceladus, where interactions between fluids containing primordial volatiles and minerals from the solar system may have occurred [8, 9]. Here we conduct laboratory experiments and chemical equilibrium calculations simulating hydrothermal reactions in Enceladus. Based on these results, we constrain the temperature and rock compositions for the water–rock interactions that can sustain the formation of silica nanoparticles. Methods:  We performed hydrothermal experiments using a flexible gold tube reaction cell, which is pressurized at 400 bar and heated at 120–300°C with a steel alloy autoclave [10]. As starting materials, we used an aqueous solution of NH3 and NaHCO3. These components were chosen because NH3 and CO2 are abundant in the gas component of Enceladus’ plumes [3]. As Cassini has found sodium salts to be abundant in the plume’s ice grains [1], Na+ should also be abundant in Enceladus’ ocean [1, 8] with an alkaline pH (pH 8.5–9). To investigate the effect of rock composition on the water–rock interactions, we used two types of starting minerals: (a) powdered San Carlos olivine (olivine experiment); (b) a mixture of powdered orthopyroxene (opx) (synthetic orthoenstatite: 70 wt.%) and San Carlos olivine (30 wt.%) (opx experiment). The opx experiment (Mg/Si = ~1.2) simulates alteration of a relatively Si-rich, undifferentiated rocky core, such as a parent body of carbonaceous chondrites, whereas the olivine experiment (Mg/Si = ~1.8) simulates alteration of ultramafic rocks formed by largescale silicate melting, similar to Earth’s upper mantle. The initial water/rock ratio was fixed at ~4 in the experiments. The experiments were performed for 3–10 months. Results:  We observed considerable variability in the dissolved total silica concentrations (∑SiO2 = SiO2(aq) + HSiO3– + NaHSiO3(aq)) in the experiments (Fig. 1A). To understand the factors that determine the observed trends, mineralogical analyses of the hydrothermally altered solid samples were performed. The major alteration products of the olivine experiments were serpentine, along with brucite, magnetite, and carbonate. In contrast, the alteration products of the opx experiments were dominated by serpentine and saponite, along with talc, magnetite, and carbonate, which are typical of carbonaceous chondrites. In geothermal fields on Earth, the ∑SiO2 value of fluids is thought to be strongly influenced by reactions of these alteration minerals [11]. Figure 1B shows the calculated equilibrium concentrations of ∑SiO2 for the reaction between serpentine and talc (serpentine–talc buffer) and between serpentine and brucite (serpentine–brucite buffer). This figure indicates that the calculated ∑SiO2 for the two buffer systems are in good agreement with the measured ∑SiO2 in the opx and olivine experiments, respectively. These results strongly suggest that ∑SiO2 of fluids in Enceladus’ interior is also controlled by the buffer systems of the alteration minerals in geological timescales. Discussion: We discuss the temperature and rock compositions of water–rock interactions in Enceladus that can sustain the formation of silica nanoparticles. We consider a simple scenario where high-temperature fluids in chemical equilibrium with the deep rocky core enter a low-temperature ocean. In Enceladus, penetration of fluids would have occurred to a depth of 1714.pdf

>100 km below the ocean–rock interface [12]. In this scenario, colloidal silica nanoparticles would form upon cooling in the ocean when the ΣSiO2 value of hydrothermal fluids exceeds the solubility of amorphous silica in the ocean. Our study assumes that silica nanoparticles are generated in an ocean at 0°C. Figure 1B shows that ΣSiO2 for the serpentine–talc buffer exceeds the solubility of silica at 0°C when the fluid temperature becomes sufficiently high. In contrast, ΣSiO2 for the serpentine–brucite buffer is much lower than the solubility of silica for fluid temperatures of ≤350°C. These results suggest that to sustain high ∑SiO2 sufficient to form silica nanoparticles, hydrous silicates in Enceladus would have been dominated by serpentine and saponite/talc, which are similar phases to those found in carbonaceous chondrites. Figure 2 shows the required minimum temperatures of hydrothermal reactions for the serpentine–talc buffer as a function of fluid pH, in order to produce silica nanoparticles in Enceladus. To form silica nanoparticles, the fluid temperature in Enceladus needs to exceed ~100°C. Therefore, our results suggest that hydrothermal activity at ≥100°C is required to account for the formation of silica nanoparticles in Enceladus. The timing of the occurrence of hydrothermal activity in Enceladus’ history cannot be definitively determined. However, the existence of nanoparticles over geological timescales in the ocean is implausible [5]. Accordingly, the formation of silica nanoparticles is most likely sustained by geologically recent or ongoing hydrothermal activity. Thermal evolution models suggest that Enceladus’ core would have reached high temperatures due to both short- and long-lived radiogenic heating over geological timescales [13], if it formed within 5 Myrs of formation of the solar system. Alternatively, hydrothermal activity may have been triggered by a recent incidental heating event. This might have happened if large parts of the core had been cold and contained pristine minerals, and if a recent heating event [14] increased the interior temperature, triggering a positive feedback between ice melting, serpentinization, and large tidal dissipation.
