Introduction:  Type 1AB chondrules have a mantle of pyroxene and contain interior olivine and pyroxene phenocrysts.  We have initiated a study to determine if  fractionations in silicon and magnesium isotopes in type 1AB chondrules show evidence that the pyroxene formed from olivine in a reaction similar to:      Mg2SiO4 + SiO + H2O → Mg2Si2O6 + H2              (1)  where SiO gas is shown here to be oxidized by water to form SiO2 in the melt of a molten or partially molten chondrule.  A similar model is used by [1] to explain oxygen isotope data obtained from CR and CV chondrules.  This reaction involves the condensation of silicon-oxide from the gas phase.  The isotopic fractionation due to condensation of silicon can be modeled using the  equation:  KiniEq iKinEq cond ss αα αα α+− =)1(                     (2)  where si, = pi/pi,Eq, pi is the partial pressure of gaseous species i and pi,Eq is the equilibrium partial pressure of species i [2].   The fractionation factor αkin embodies the isotope fractionation associated with condensation inclusive of collision frequency and zero point energy effects [3].    Samples and Methods:  Silicon isotopes in pyroxene rims and interior olivine phenocrysts were measured in-situ using UV laser ablation and the ThermoFinnigan Neptune MC-ICPMS at UCLA.  EMPA analyses (UCLA, JEOL) were used to confirm the mineralogy of the phases following the isotopic measurements. Analyses that contained mesostasis or a mixture of phases were discarded for this study.  Silicon isotope ratios were measured in one type 1AB chondrule from the CV chondrite Allende [4] and two type 1AB chondrules in the CR chondrite Elephant Moraine (EET) 87747.  In addition, magnesium isotope ratios were also measured in the two chondrules from EET 87747.      Results: Silicon isotopes were previously measured in Allende Section 458 Chondrule 1 [4].  The fractionation between olivine and pyroxene (δ29Sipx < δ 29Siol) is ~0.3‰ on average.  Using αEq between pyroxene and SiO gas (1.001) [5] and αkin (0.97) [4], this isotope fractionation corresponds to sSiO=1.04 and to an undercooling of -1.9 K if reservoir effects are ignored (Figure 1).    Figure 1. Probability density plot for δ29Si measured in olivine and pyroxene in Allende Section 458 Chondrule 1 relative to NBS 28.  Olivine data (n=5) are  in green and pyroxene data (n=5) are in red.  Chondrule 3 from EET 87747 has δ29Sipx less than δ 29Siol by 0.17‰ on average.  This corresponds to sSiO=1.025 and an undercooling of -1.2 K if reservoir effects are ignored (Figure 2).     Figure 2.

Figure 3 shows the probability density plot for chondrule 2 in EET 87747.  Electron beam petrography suggests that chondrule 2 exhibits greater weathering, perhaps explaining the comparatively large range in δ 29Si in both minerals.   Figure 3. Probability density plot for δ29Si measured in olivine and pyroxene in EET 87747 Chondrule 2.  Olivine data (n=6) are in green and pyroxene data (n =11) are in red.  Magnesium isotope ratios were also measured for EET 87747 Chondrules 2 and 3 (Figure 4).  The spread in 25Mg/24Mg is much less than 29Si/28Si in all cases.    Figure 4. Probability density plot for δ25Mg measured in olivine and pyroxene in EET 87747 Chondrule 2.  Color scheme and range same as in Figures 1 through 3.  Discussion: For two of three samples, the δ29Si probability density plots show  overlapping, distinguishable δ29Si values for pyroxene and olivine; it appears that the values for olivine and pyroxene are distinct.  At equilibrium, pyroxene would be isotopically lighter than olivine by ~0.01‰ at 1700 K [6].  This implies that the difference in 29Si/28Si between pyroxene and olivine in Figures 1 and 2 is not an equilibrium fractionation between these phases.  This in turn suggests  that SiO may well have condensed into the melt of a molten or partially molten chondrule to form pyroxene with a partial pressure of SiO slightly greater than the equilibrium partial pressure of SiO.  This same trend is not observed in the δ29Si data for EET 87747 chondrule 2. The proposed reaction requires silicon to condense into the melt and react with olivine.  Large negative δ 29Si in pyroxene relative to both δ29Si in olivine and relative to the magnesium isotope data suggests that we are seeing the isotopic consequences of reaction (1).  The implied undercooling of between 1 and 2 K  implies that this process took place in near equilibrium conditions.  We  will look for this effect in more chondrules of type 1AB.
