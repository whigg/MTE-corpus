STRUCTURE AND EVOLUTION OF EXTERNALLY PHOTOEVAPORATED PROTOPLANETARY DISKS. A. Kalyaan1, S. J. Desch1, N. Monga1 1School of Earth and Space Exploration, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287. (akalyaan@asu.edu).Background: Protoplanetary disks (PPDs) are large(∼ 102 AU) rotating systems of gas and dust, formedduring the early stages of star formation. They arethe sites of planet formation. Models of planet formation rely on knowledge of the surface density,Σ(r), the mass per area in the disk as a functionof distance r from the star. Models of how thesurface density evolves usually model it as a powerlaw: Σ(r) = Σ0(r/r0)−p, where p = −d lnΣ/d ln r(which technically can vary with r). Likewise thetemperature of the disk is often modeled as a powerlaw with radius: T (r) = T0(r/r0)−q with q ≈ 0.5[1]. It is assumed that most of the disk is markedby an inward radial velocity of gas, i.e., Vr < 0, andbehaves as an accretion disk. Yet, disk models commonly recognize that gas can move outward, too. Ithas been shown that disks with p+ q > 2 (perhapsonly locally) are marked by outward transport [2].Models of Σ(r) over time account for viscous dissipation in the disk, accretion onto the star. Onlyrecently external photoevaporation—loss of massfrom the outer disk by UV heating from a nearbymassive star—has been recognized to significantlyinfluence the evolution of Σ(r) and the radial velocity of gas Vr through a PPD [3-5]. Desch (2007)[4] has predicted that external photoevaporationwould lead to a very steep steady-state profile withp > 2, and therefore outward transport Vr > 0,throughout much of the outer portions of the disk(beyond a few AU). Here we present numericalcalculations to test this hypothesis and wediscuss implications for planet formation.Models of Externally Photoevaporated PPDsExternal photoevaporation of PPDs occurs whentheir outer surface layers absorb far-ultraviolet radiation from a nearby massive star, heating to temperatures of a few ×102 K, sufficient to escape thecentral star’s gravity. It is a well observed phenomenon in star-forming regions such as the OrionNebula [6,7], and it is well understood that photoevaporation truncates the disk at an outermostradius rd, typically ∼ 50 AU, from which most ofthe loss occurs [3]. But the role of photoevaporation in changing the structure Σ(r) of disks has onlyrecently been considered.[4] was motivated to study the evolution of Σ(r)in the face of external photoevaporation because ofhis finding that updating the Minimum Mass SolarNebula model of [8] accounting for the starting positions of the planets in the Nice model [9] led himto infer a steep outer disk profile Σ(r) = Σ0(r/r0)−pwith p > 2.2. [4] showed that such a steep profilewas potentially a steady-state solution to the equations of disk evolution, provided the PPD was beingexternally photoevaporated, implying that our Sunformed in a high-mass star-forming region. Numerical simulations of disk evolution were conducted by[5] to test this analytic solution. They numericallycalculated the evolution of an externally photoevaporated disk using the equations of disk evolution[10] and assuming a viscosity ν = αC2/ΩK, whereC is the sound speed, ΩK is the Keplerian orbitalfrequency, and α is a fixed parameter [11]. Theyfound that disks could be characterized by p ≈ 1.8,much steeper than previous models, but did notcompletely substantiate the findings of [4]. We hypothesize that their results may be attributable toassumptions about how viscosity in the disk varieswith r. In particular, [5] assumed a uniform αthroughout the disk, whereas we hypothesize that ifα increases with r that steeper profiles may result.Our Numerical ModelWe numerically calculatethe evolution of an externally photoevaporated diskusing the same equations of disk evolution [11]. Appropriate boundary conditions allow accretion ontothe central star and loss of gas from the outer edgeat mass loss rates that are functions of the strengthof the radiation field, as determined by [3]. Thestrength of the radiation field is G0 times the interstellar radiation field strength. G0 = 1 denotes nonearby massive star, while G0 = 300 correspondsto a B0 star at a distance of 2.5 pc. In contrast to[5], we do not assume uniforma α, instead calculating how α would vary if it disk viscosity were attributable to the magnetorotational instability (MRI).We calculate α by first calculating the ionizationchemistry in the PPD, balancing ionizations by Galactic cosmic rays [12] and central star X-rays [13]against recombinations in the gas phse and on grainsurfaces, assuming a monodispersion of neutral grains1µm in radius. Further details of this simple ionization chemistry are described by [14]. The ion density is calculated as a function of r and of height,assuming a Gaussian, isothermal density profile.2202.pdf

Assuming a magnetic field locally at equipartitionstrength everywhere, we then calculate the parameters β and Am, and then α as described in [15]. Wefind that in general the vertically, mass-weightedaverage α is uniform and ∼ 10−5 for r < 3 AU,then rising as a power of r to a value ∼ 10−1 nearthe disk edge at rd ≈ 50 AU.We have run the disk evolution code and presenttwo results here, both assuming G0 = 300: onewith uniform α = 10−2, and one with the α wecalculate above. In Figure 1 we show for the secondcase Σ(r) at 1 Myr time intervals over 10 Myr. Asteep profile in the outer disk develops because ofthe photoevaporation of the outer edge of the disk.In Figure 2 we show the average slope p across theinterval 5 to 30 AU, over the course of 10 Myr, forthe two cases. The non-uniform α case yields asteeper profile.Conclusions: We draw the following conclusions.External photoevaporation of PPDs can yield steepprofiles in their outer regions, with p > 2, leadingto outward transport. As predicted by [4], thesesteep surface density profiles exist in near steadystate, as evidenced by Figure 2 after 2 Myr. Weconfirm the hypothesis that a variable α, with αFigure 1: Σ(r) at various time intervals in disk withG0 = 300 and spatially varying α.increasing with r in the disk, does indeed lead to asteeper profile. We attribute this to the fact thatthe 5-30 AU region is resupplied by gas more slowlyat its inner edge but is depleted at its outer edgeat the same rate. We plan further simulations totest whether steady-state profiles with p = 2.2, aspredicted by [4], are possible.References: [1] EI Chiang & P Goldreich 1997 ApJ490, 368.
