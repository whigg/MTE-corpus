Generally, radar echostrength (both same-sense-circular, SC, and oppositesense-circular, OC) and CPR (circular polarization ratio,SC/OC) of the haloes are ∼2-6 dB lower than their surrounding terrain in 70 cm radar images. As radar wavelength decreases, dark haloes become less prominent(12.6 cm) and finally disappear (3.8 cm) [1]. RDHCswere thought to be induced by fine-grained ejecta andsubsequently erased due to meteoroid bombardments,and previous investigations found that craters older thanEarly Imbrian no longer have distinctive dark-haloed features [1, 2]. Since radar echo from the lunar surface depends on the near-surface properties of the Moon, the formation mechanisms of RDHCs, and their behaviors withwavelength and variation with time, can provide important clues for impact cratering mechanism and postimpact surface modification process.In previous studies, there is no systematical investigation about the spatial distributions of the RDHCs[1, 2]. In addition, though the origin of dark halo wasattributed to the presence of fine-grained ejecta withoutrocks at wavelength scales, there is no direct evidence tosupport this hypothesis. In an attempt to solve the aboveproblems, multi-band lunar radar images (12.6 and 70cm Earth-based radar, Miniature Radio Frequency, MiniRF, and Lunar Radar Sounder, LRS) in combination withthe auxiliary multi-source datasets (cratering, elevation,rock abundance and ilmenite content map) were used inthis study to discuss the spatial distribution characteristics and formation mechanisms of RDHCs.Spatial Distribution Characteristics: An exhaustive search of RDHCs in the 12.6 cm Earth-based radarimages was implemented for the first time. Fig. 1a showsthe spatial distributions of 12.6 cm RHDCs (87), 70 cmRDHCs (275) [2], and ODHCs (optical dark halo craters,191) [3, 4]. The number of the 12.6 cm RDHCs overmaria is much larger than that over highlands regions,with a ratio of ∼3:1. When normalized to the areas overwhich RDHCs were counted, the relative ratio increasessignificantly to ∼10:1. In contrast, the spatial distribution of the 70 cm RDHCs is relatively uniform. ODHCsare concentrated along the margins between maria andhighlands.Given to the differences in penetration depth and sensitive scale of the scatterer, direct comparison of radarimages at 12.6 and 70 cm can give information on nearsurface properties of the Moon at different depths andscales. The discernible maria/highlands dichotomy in thedistribution of the 12.6 cm RDHCs indicates that highlands RDHCs were prone to disappear than those overmaria. This is because that the older highlands experienced more meteoroid bombardments than maria andthat the 12.6 cm radar returns are dominated by shallower subsurface properties compared to 70 cm echoes.As a result, shallower fine-grained materials of 12.6 cmhighlands dark haloes were easier to be erased duringsubsequent bombardments. Figs. 1b and 1c show theRDHC number as a function of relative cratering rate [5]along longitude and latitude (in a 5◦ bin). There is aweak signal that RDHC number increases with crateringrate, suggesting that the formation of RDHC is an exogenetic process and might only slightly correlate withthe target properties. The clusters of ODHCs may indicate that the cryptomare regions subsequently overlaidby basin/crater bright ejecta [3], which are dominated byboth exogenetic and endogenetic processes.Formation Mechanisms: Considering potential parameters (low rock abundance and high ilmenite content)in the impact cratering process that could result in lowreturn radar echo, most of the previous studies ascribedthe dark-haloed feature to fine-grained ejecta [1]. For example, Hermann crater (0.9◦S, 57.3◦W; 8 km) has radardark haloes in both the 12.6 and 70 cm CPR images(Figs. 1d and 1e). The radius of the most distal dark halois about four times the crater radius, and the averagedCPR in the dark-haloed region is ∼3 dB lower than thatof its background terrain. As seen from rock distributionmap derived from Diviner radiometer data (Fig. 1f) [6],the rock abundance of dark halo is only about half as thatof the background. A significantly high ilmenite contentaround the crater is not observed in the TiO2 map as expected (Fig. 1g). Therefore, ilmenite content is not themajor factor for the dark halo craters in radar images.The scattering mechanism of OC echo depends onradar incidence angle. Surface scattering dominates atsmaller incidence angle (<35◦), whereas volume scattering by rocks dominates at larger incidence angle (>35◦).If RDHCs indeed result from low abundance of rocks,dark haloes should be more obvious at larger incidence1797.pdf

angle. To validate this, craters Hainzel A (40.5◦S,33.5◦W; 55 km) and Bullialdus (20.7◦S, 22.2◦W; 60 km)with similar sizes and ages (Eratosthenian [7]) but different incidence angles (∼48◦ and ∼27◦) were compared.For Hainzel A, the OC strength of the dark halo is∼4 dBlower than its surrounding terrain, which is more obviousthan the situation of Bullialdus with a contrast of only∼2dB. Since Bullialdus's distal ejecta and the surroundingmare region have similar topography, its dark halo in theOC image is too weak to be detected. This phenomenonindicates indirectly that the low rock abundance is mostprobably the major factor for RDHC.Two ODHCs, Schickard R (44.1◦S, 53.6◦W; 5 km)and Alphonsus R (14.4◦S, 1.9◦W; 3 km) [8], were foundto have radar dark haloes in Mini-RF images. This result shows that the volcanic geologic contexts can also bethe scenarios for RDHC's formation in addition to finegrained ejecta. However, though RDHC can have bothimpact and volcanic origins, the mechanism of the lowradar return might be ascribed to the same radar scattering parameter, i.e., the low rock abundance.LRS RDHC: In LRS surface image with a wavelength of 60 m [9], most of the large craters have darkhaloes. Because lunar surface is depleted in blocksat tens of meters scale [6], radar return of LRS depends largely on wavelength-scale roughness and dielectric constant rather than rocks. Taken Archimedes crater(29.7◦N, 4.0◦W; 83 km) as an example, there is a narrow halo (∼10 dB lower than background) just on itsrim, which spatially correlates well with surface roughness calculated from Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter topography datasets (Fig. 1i). Dielectric constant can onlymake a difference of∼0.4 dB in surface echo in this case,so apparently it is not the key factor for the dark halo.Therefore, LRS RDHC is more likely induced by surfaceroughness.Conclusions: In this study, we examined the spatialdistribution characteristics of the RDHCs in multi-bandlunar radar images. RDHC has a more exogenetic origincompared to ODHC that is largely controlled by an endogenetic mechanism. Multiple evidences suggest thatfine-grained material is the agent for radar dark halo, andthat ODHC with a clearly volcanic origin can be a RDHCas well. LRS RDHC was surveyed for the first time andits low radar echo is most probably caused by surfaceroughness. More detailed investigation on RDHC is stillongoing and may help us to better understand the cratering mechanism and subsequent modifications of lunarsurface.References: [1] Ghent R. R. et al.
