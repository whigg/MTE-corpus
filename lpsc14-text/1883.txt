COLLISIONAL EROSION AND BULK SILICATE EARTH REFRACTORY LITHOPHILE ELEMENT BUDGETS.  R. M. G. Armytage and A. D. Brandon, University of Houston, Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, 312 Science and Research 1, Houston, TX, 77204, USA. (rarmytage@uh.edu)   Introduction: A standard assumption of compositional models of bulk silicate Earth (BSE) is that the refractory lithophile elements (RLE) are present in chondritic relative proportions [e.g. 1-2]. High precision measurements of 142Nd/144Nd challenge this assumption. There is an offset of approximately 20ppm in 142Nd/144Nd between average chondrites and the Earth’s modern convecting mantle [3], where 142Nd is the daughter isotope of 146Sm with T1/2 of 103 Myr (λ146=6.730×10-3 Myr-1) [4], or 68 Myr (λ146=1.019×102 Myr-1)  [5]. The three most plausible interpretations of the data are (i) nucleosynthetic variation of initial 146Sm/144Sm or 142Nd/144Nd in the solar nebula [e.g. 67]; (ii) early differentiation of BSE with a chondritic Sm/Nd while 146Sm was still live, with only the depleted reservoir sampled as yet [3]; (iii) BSE has a superchondritic Sm/Nd ratio [8-11].  The current precision and sample size of chondritic data cannot currently determine the validity of (i). The existence of a BSE early enriched reservoir (required by (ii)) that complements the modern accessible mantle’s 142Nd/144Nd is hard to test for directly. The preferential removal of early-formed planetesimal crusts via collisional erosion, increasing the Sm/Nd of the growing planet, is a mechanism that has been proposed to generate a superchondritic BSE [12]. The feasibility of this, and hence (iii), can be assessed, using the Moon to constrain the composition of the proto-Earth.  For a number of elements such as Ti [13], W [14], Cr [15] and Si [16], the isotopic composition of the Earth and Moon are identical and unique among solar system bodies. The simplest interpretation is that the Moon formed from mantle material of the proto-Earth, rather than the impactor as required in the standard smoothed particle hydrodynamic (SPH) models [e.g. 17]. Newer models of the Giant Impact [18-19] generate scenarios that are consistent with the isotopic constraints, allowing for the use of lunar data to constrain the composition of the proto-Earth.  In this study we build on previously presented work [20], and incorporate new lunar basalt 142Nd data [21] to assess the viability of collisional erosion in generating a superchondritic BSE Sm/Nd ratio and the implications for the RLE budgets of the BSE.  Method: The simple multi-stage coupled ε143Ndµ142Nd source model used in this study has been adapted from earlier work [e.g. 22, 23 R, V, me]. The new lunar Nd isotope basalt data from [21] fall, along with the previous data [24-25], on a straight line when corrected for neutron fluence and crystallization age. In coupled ε143Nd-µ142Nd space, such a straight line can be interpreted as an isochron, and its intersection with a multi-stage Nd isotope evolution model can constrain bulk 147Sm/144Nd ratio of the Moon and hence BSE. The slope and intercept of the isochron are used to find the unique 147Sm/144Nd for a given time of fractionation, t1. The range in possible 147Sm/144Nd ratios can be further constrained assuming that the bulk composition of the Moon is identical to the BSE, restricting µ142Nd to 0±3. The derived maximum and minimum Sm/Nd ratios can be used to constrain the collisional erosion parameters Fpc (mass fraction of proto-crust), fcr (mass fraction of proto-crust eroded), and mass fraction of melt residue eroded, fres, based on the simple mass balance of [12]. A range of possible BSE RLE budgets from collisional erosion can be calculated.   4467Ma4567Ma4497Ma4527Maμ142Nd−5051015147Sm/144Nd t10.20 0.21 0.22 0.23 0.24 0.25 Fig. 1 µ142Nd vs 147Sm/144Nd of the source (thick black line). This is calculated using t1/2 =103 Myr for 146Sm. The black diamonds mark the ages of fractionation (t1) at 10 Ma intervals. The thinner black lines are the maximum and minimum 147Sm/144Nd based on 95% confidence intervals from the linear regression through the lunar basalt data. The blue curves are lines of equal t1. The lilac band is the BSE µ142Nd=0 at the current precision possible, which is ±3ppm  Results and Discussion:  Figure 1 shows the range in 147Sm/144Ndt1 versus µ142Nd contoured for t1.  With the assumption of bulk silicate Earth µ142Nd=0±3ppm, for λ146=1.019×10-2 Myr-1, 147Sm/144Ndt1=0.20880.2198, corresponding to t1= 0-40MyrONC (ONC = onset of nebular condensation). For the longer half-life (λ146=6.730×10-3 Myr-1), 147Sm/144Ndt1=0.2088-0.2205, and t1=0-64MyrONC. Therefore, this collisional erosion process has to have occurred during the early accretional history of the Earth, and if it did happen in the Giant Impact as proposed previously [20], the Moon must have a young formation age (i.e. <64MyrONC). 1883.pdf

Percentage of proto-crust eroded is calculated from fcr/Fpc for a given Fpc. Black line is the minimum Sm/Nd (i.e. 147Sm/144Nd at t1 = 4567Ma), blue line is maximum Sm/Nd for 146Sm t1/2 = 68 Myr, purple line is maximum Sm/Nd for 146Sm t1/2 = 103 Myr. The lilac band is a range in planetary crust mass fractions from Earth (0.4%) to Moon (5%).  These limits on the Sm/Nd ratio resulting from an early fractionation event can be applied to constrain the collisional erosion parameters. Figure 2 plots the percentage of proto-crust that must be eroded as the function of the initial mass fraction of proto-crust formed (Fpc). The two main conclusions are that a minimum of 50% of the proto-crust (at likely Fpc’s) must be eroded based on the Nd isotopic constraints, and that Fpc must be greater than at least the crust mass fraction of the Earth (0.004), for the modeled collisional erosion scenario to be viable.

The blue line corresponds to the minimum Sm/Nd ratio (t1=4567Ma) and the black line is the maximum Sm/Nd (t1=4503 Ma). The solid circles represent different Fpc fractions. The purple traces are lines of equal Fpc. The minimum possible fraction of proto-crust (Fpc) is 0.0073, labeled in blue. The star is the CI chondrite ratio from [2]  Figure 3 shows the RLE ratios Lu/Hf and U/Th for a range of Fpc’s based on the maximum and minimum Sm/Nd discussed above. The U/Th ratio is always within 10% of the chondritic ratio, whereas the Lu/Hf can deviate from chondritic by up to 50%. This variation is due to the difference in bulk partition coefficients for Lu and Hf (DLu=0.12, DHf=0.35 [26]) in contrast to the similar behavior during mantle melting of U and Th (DU=0.0011, DTh=0.001 [26]). Both of these ratios in this modeled collisional erosion scenario are well below those proposed for DMM (depleted MORB mantle) by [26] of Lu/Hf =	  0.369 and U/Th = 0.405.  Any modification of the RLE budget of the BSE will have implications for heat and 4He fluxes from the mantle due to radiogenic decay from U and Th. This provides another potential avenue of constraints that can be applied to refine this collisional erosional model based on 142Nd systematics. The effect of collisional erosion on more volatile lithophile elements such as K, which also affects the heat budget of the Earth and noble gas budgets, also needs to be considered.
