2014 OPPOSITION OF MARS: EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND PUBLIC OUTREACH.  E. F. M. Albin, Department of Space Sciences, Fernbank Science Center, 156 Heaton Park Drive, Atlanta, GA (USA) / ed.albin@fernbank.edu  Introduction:  Mars reaches opposition and is well placed for public viewing on April 8, 2014 at 20:57 UT. The opposition timeline and educational opportunities are considered, with emphasis on programs presented at Fernbank Science Center in Atlanta, GA. Educational programs include a planetarium presentation, observations of Mars through telescopes, and activities associated with the ongoing Curiosity Rover (MSL) / anticipated Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft.   HST images showing examples of Mars at opposition.  2014 Opposition Details:  Mars is especially well placed in the evening sky for viewing between the months of March and May 2014. During this period, the planet can be found in retrograde motion within the constellation pattern of Virgo.   Path of Mars across sky, showing retrograde motion.  When at opposition in 2014, Mars will have an apparent diameter of 15.1 arc-seconds and will be visible in the evening sky for a little over a year until lost in the glare of the Sun in late April 2015. At closest approach, the planet will be a bit more than 57 million miles (92 million kilometers) from the Earth.    Zeiss Planetarium used for simulation of Mars in the night sky.  Fernbank Planetarium & Observatory:  Fernbank Science Center will offer public viewing of Mars through the observatory’s 36-inch (0.9 meter) reflecting telescope on Thursday and Friday evenings. The observatory is open immediately after the evening planetarium program. We anticipate showing a fulldome planetarium presentation about Mars, including how to find the planet in the current evening sky.   Fernbank Science Center’s observatory. 2932.pdf
