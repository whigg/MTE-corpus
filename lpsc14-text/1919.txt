Introduction:  Calcium-aluminium-rich inclusions (CAIs) are amongst the oldest components found in chondritic meteorites [e.g. 1-3]. Some CAIs have a mineralogy and texture that is close to that predicted from condensation of a gas of solar composition [4]; other CAIs record episodes of melting and recrystallization. Understanding the mineralogy and petrology of a given CAI is essential in interpreting, for example, isotopic data obtained from that inclusion, in order to understand the timing of processing in the early solar system. In this work, we present mineralogical and petrological data for an unusual coarse-grained CAI, “B4”, from the NWA 6991 CV3 chondrite. This inclusion appears to be a Compact Type A (CTA), but unlike the vast majority of other CTAs, it contains abundant pyroxene and minor anorthite. The inclusion also shows significantly less secondary alteration than CAIs from other well-studied CV3 chondrites. B4 has previously been analyzed at ASU for both Pb-Pb mineral isochron dating by MC-ICPMS [5] and Al-Mg dating by LAMC-ICPMS [6]; new high-precision Al-Mg SIMS data obtained at UWM are presented in a companion abstract [7].   Method: Bulk compositional data, high-resolution back-scattered electron images, and full-element X-ray maps were obtained using the FEI NOVA NanoSEM 600 scanning electron microscope (SEM) at the Smithsonian Institution, operated at 15kV with a sample current of 2-3 nA and a Thermo-Noran energy dispersive X-ray analytical system. Quantitative chemical data for major elements was obtained using the JEOL JXA 8900 electron microprobe at the Smithsonian Institution, operating at 15kV and 20nA.  Results and Discussion:  NWA 6991 is classified as a CV3ox chondrite that has a low shock grade and has undergone little terrestrial weathering [8]. B4 is irregularly shaped, and ~1 cm in the longest dimension. Two slices of the inclusion were studied in this work. B4 is a coarse-grained, Compact Type A CAI, and contains abundant melilite, in addition to spinel, pyroxene, minor anorthite, and small quantities of secondary alteration products (Figure 1). Point counting gives the following modal abundances: melilite 74%; spinel 10%; pyroxene 15%, anorthite 1%. The bulk composition of the inclusion is given in Table 1, and on an Al2O3-Ca2SiO4-Mg2SiO4 diagram B4 plots at the extremity of the Type A field (Figure 2).    Figure 1.

Mineral compositions: Melilite is primarily gehlenitic, although there are some regions of åkermanitic melilite adjacent to pyroxene grains. The overall range is ~Åk4-61. The melilite grains are coarse, up to ~1 mm in diameter. Some melilite grains are highly fractured, and contain veinlets of secondary calcite. Melilite poikilitically contains abundant spinel grains.  Spinel is generally stoichiometric MgAl2O4, although minor Fe (<0.5 wt. %), Cr (<0.2 wt. %) and Ti (up to 1.2 wt. %) are present. Spinel grains range in size from <2 – 60 µm, and are often demonstrate a clean, euhedral habit. Spinel occurs poikilitically enclosed within both melilite and pyroxene, and also occurs as ‘chains’ that transect melilite grains. Pyroxene is abundant throughout the inclusion, and often contains fine-grained spinel. Pyroxene in B4 is Ti-rich, containing 5-15% TiO2. Most of the Ti occurs as Ti3+ (Ti3+/4+ = 55-92%).  All plagioclase grains are stoichiometric anorthite, and the low Na2O content indicates no secondary alteration to nepheline. The anorthite occurs as small grains adjacent to pyroxene or within melilite. The largest grains are ~150 µm in diameter, and have an irregular shape.  Small grains of perovskite, <15 µm in diameter, were found in melilite grains throughout the inclusion. No accurate chemical data was obtained from these grains. Secondary alteration is only a minor component of B4, and consists primarily of calcite that occurs as vein-filling material. No sodalite or nepheline have been identified. The lack of secondary alteration in B4 contrasts with many other well-characterized CAIs from other extensively-studied CV3 chondrites (e.g. Allende, Efremovka), and suggests that isotopic systems measured in B4 should be relatively undisturbed. The Wark-Lovering rim surrounding the inclusion consists of layered melilite, spinel and Mg-pyroxene, with a discontinuous outermost layer of forsterite. Some calcium appears to have leached from the rim, and been deposited in the surrounding matrix. The bulk composition of NWA 6991 B4 CAI suggests that this is a Compact Type A, but the abundance of pyroxene and presence of anorthite suggest it is on the way to becoming a Type B CAI. Rare, similar, CAIs have been observed in other CV3 chondrites (e.g. Vigarano 1623-11 and NWA 3118 #1N-b; [9]). The ancient absolute Pb-Pb age (4567.94 ± 0.31 Ma; [5]) and canonical initial 26Al/27Al ratio [6, 7]) obtained for B4 reinforce the suggestion of [9] that remelting of CAIs occurred early in solar system history.
