Observations of Vesta's surface composition by the Dawn spacecraft [1] during its one-year mission in orbit [2] revealed the presence of OH in surface materials [3] and elemental hydrogen [4] in association with dark materials [5-7]. The infall of OH-rich carbonaceous chondrite meteorites was the main hypothesis supported by those observations [5]. A refined investigation is needed to characterize how OH and H are associated with the surface constituents, and to determine whether only OH or also H2O is present. Thus, we developed a more detailed analysis of the Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIR) data [8]. Variations in the shapes of the OH-related spectral features confirm OH, and possibly indicate H2O in Vesta's regolith. The global distribution of hydroxyl indicates the possible effects of surface temperature, lateral transport of H2O to the northern regions, illumination, and/or formation of OH by implantation of protons from the solar wind.  Origin and role of water in the evolution of planet. Knowledge of the water's origin and the waterrelated processes on/in planetary bodies are crucial for understanding the chemical evolution of minerals in crustal materials, particularly when temperatures are high enough to enabling the contact of fluids with minerals. Vesta is one object in the asteroid belt where study can help constrain the origin and character of OH/H2O absorption bands observed at the surface of telluric objects in the inner solar system. For the Moon, a basaltic, airless surface and an analog for Vesta, three main source are usually considered [9]. 1) An endogenic origin resulting from accretion of water-rich material that eventually formed the bulk composition and became exposed at the surface [10]. 2) An external source: Infall of water-rich meteorites and comets onto the surface, independent from the initial accretion [11]. 3) Surficial formation of OH and H2O resulting from interaction of solar wind protons with oxygen atoms in regolith minerals damaged by micrometeorite impacts [12-14].   Main origin of OH on Vesta: Near infrared reflectance spectra of Vesta show a broad and asymmetric absorption between 2.7 and 3.4 µm due to hydroxyl [3,5,15]. OH-rich and dark materials have similar distributions across the surface of Vesta, suggesting a common origin, which is best explained by infall of carbonaceous chondrite meteorites [5]. In parallel, laboratory analyses of HED meteorites (Howardites, Eucrites and Diogenites, likely from Vesta) contain carbonaceous chondrite materials [6, 7, 16], and results from modeling the flux of impactors reinforced that hypothesis [17].  The complex character of the OH/H2O absorption band on Vesta.. The broad and asymmetric OH/H2O spectral feature observed in VIR spectra of Vesta has a complex shape that varies across the surface (Figure 1), which suggests several absorption processes related to hydroxyl (OH), and perhaps molecular water (H2O).  Molecular H2O has a fundamental vibration mode in the 3.0-3.1-µm region. OH alone can create absorptions in the range 2.8-3.1 µm and beyond. In VIR Vesta spectra, neither of these bands is observed alone. When the broad band of OH/H2O absorption is observed, the band minimum shorter than 2.9 µm, characteristic of OH, is always observed. Relative variations at longer wavelengths could be due to additional OH alone or OH in molecular H2O.   Figure 1: VIR near-infrared spectra of Vesta of Mamilia crater wall and an area west of Oppia crater show variations in the shape of the OH/H2O absorption. Green: 2.8-µm band depth calculation. Red: Integrated 3-µm band calculation. These spectra were calibrated using telescopic measurement [18].   Spectral analysis of VIR data: We limit our interpretation here to relative spectral variations, and we performed analysis of the spectral shape of the OH/H2O features between 2.6 and 3.5 µm in VIR data. We processes two different parts of the OH/H2O absorption feature independently by developing two spectral parameters: 1) The band depth at 2.8 µm is calculated against a straight-line continuum between 2.6 and 2.9 µm. 2) The partial integrated band depth between 2.9 and 3.5 µm, calculated against a straightline continuum between 2.6 and 3.5 µm. This approach differs from the previous analyses [3, 5], where the entire OH/H2O absorption feature was analyzed using only one spectral parameter.  Figure 2: VIR spectra of hydrated materials of Vesta shown in Figure 1 divided by the average spectrum of Vesta, illustrating the variation in band shape and the possible presence of molecular H2O near Oppia.  Results: Character and distribution of OH/H2O across Vesta: The global map of the 2.8-µm and 3-µm absorptions (Figure 3) is consistent with the distribution of the hydroxyl spectral feature already published [3,5]. However, the shapes of the two parts of the OH/H2O absorption vary across Vesta. For example, the 2.8-µm band is systematically more pronounced than the 3-µm band in a diffuse region at the North-East of Marcia (Calpurnia and Minucia), and the maximum of the absorption occurs on Aricia Tholus. The 3-µm band is systematically more pronounced than the 2.8-µm band in a diffuse region around Oppia. The 2.8-µm band depth is also relatively stronger at high latitudes compared to the 3-µm integrated band.   Interpretation of the origin of the OH/H2O absorption features:  2.8-µm absorption band depth: The stronger 2.8µm band at high latitudes in the northern hemisphere may have multiple causes. 1) The apparent band depth may increase due to higher relative contribution of multiple scattering under high incidence angles. 2) Lower surface temperatures may sharpen and deepen individual absorptions in the 2.8 µm region. 3) A stronger 2.8-µm band on colder regions at higher latitudes may result from lateral transport by adsorption and desorption mechanisms of H2O (not OH) combined with ballistic trajectories, similar to the lunar case [19, 20]. The latitudinal dependence is observed on the northern hemisphere of Vesta only, during the winter, and could be a seasonal effect, consistent with lateral migration of H2O. 4) For the Moon, the stronger spectral absorption of OH at higher latitudes in both hemispheres [21-24] is consistent with solar wind proton implantation [21, 24]. On Vesta, the 2.8-µm absorption band is also correlated with dark materials, which is consistent with infall of carbonaceous chondrite meteorites [5-7]. The combined correlations with latitude and with dark materials may indicate a dual origin for the 2-8-µm band. 3-µm integrated band: The 3-µm band shows no dependence on latitude and is correlated only with dark material, consistent with the hypothesis of infalling carbon-rich and OH-rich material.  Perspectives for more robust interpretation of the OH/H2O absorption bands: The distribution of the 2.8-µm band on Vesta indicates possible multiple processes forming OH, and possibly H2O. The presence of H2O would be confirmed if the lateral migration of molecules towards the poles is verified. The spectral parameters we used have to be tested first for possible sensitivity to surface temperature and multiple scattering. The final objective is to calculate absolute abundances, once the response function of the instrument is validated.  References: [1] Russell et al., 2007, EPM 101.
