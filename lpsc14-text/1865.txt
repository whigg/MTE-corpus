Introduction:  Recently several achondritic meteorites have been found that do not belong to any major achondrite groups such as HED meteorites and ureilites. These ungrouped achondrites have distinct mineral and oxygen isotope compositions [1] and are important to know the parent bodies which have not been found until now and give us information about the igneous history in the early solar system.  Northwest Africa 7325 (NWA 7325) is one of such achondrites found in western Sahara in February 2012 [2]. This meteorite does not belong to any groups of achondrites ever defined and has come to light as the first meteorite sample which might be from the planet Mercury [2]. We are not able to conclude its Mercurian origin until the sample return from Mercury, but studying ungrouped achondrite in general surely provides us the essential knowledge about variation of igneous activity in comparison with other achondrite meteorites. In this study, we have examined NWA 7325 from the viewpoint of petrology and mineralogy combined with the U-Pb chronology.  Methods: We first observed a thin section of NWA 7325 by using optical microscope and scanning electron microscope (FEG-SEM: Hitachi S-4500) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA: JEOL JXA8900L) was used to obtain elemental maps and perform quantitative analysis. We also employed a micro-Raman spectrometer (JASCO NRS-1000) to identify mineral species. In addition, we studied U-Pb chronology of this meteorite. The obtained dataset still needs to be carefully compiled, and so the detailed result will be presented at the meeting. Results:  The observation by optical microscope shows that NWA 7325 is mainly composed of millimeter-sized grains of plagioclase, clinopyroxene, and olivine (Fig. 1a). Plagioclase shows a mottled texture consisting of tiny microlite domains (~10 µm), but preserves overall crystal orientation of the initial large plagioclase grains (Fig. 1b). We used micro-Raman spectrometer to check the presence of any high pressure phases, but all the analyzed domains gave Raman spectra identical to normal plagioclase. By using FEG-SEM, we observed plagioclase composed of very fine-grained domains and especially the grain boundaries of three major mineral grains. In some areas within plagioclase, we found striped textures in back-scattered electron (BSE) images (Fig. 2a). EDS analysis suggested that diopside and Fe sulfide coexisted with plagioclase in ~10 µm scale (Fig. 2b). At the boundary of plagioclase and olivine, pyroxene showing a flow texture was observed (Fig. 3). At the boundary between diopside and plagioclase, small grains of each phase are present probably by recrystallization (Fig. 4). In the same way, there existed plagioclase at the grain boundary between olivine and pyroxene. In contrast, olivine was not found at the border of plagioclase. We obtained elemental maps of Al, Ca, Cr, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, P, S, and Si to better understand the mineral distribution within the thin section as well as quantitative analysis with respect to each mineral. It revealed that pyroxene and olivine are very Mg-Carich as reported in [2]. Pyroxene is close to the endmember diopside composition with ~0.95 wt% Cr2O3. Olivine is Fo97 and it also enriched in Cr (Cr2O3: ~0.36 wt%). Plagioclase is high in An content (An~90). Thus, NWA 7325 is a very Fe-poor and Ca-rich meteorite. Discussion and Conclusion:  NWA 7325 is a very unique achondrite regarding that it is Fe-poor (Mgrich) and Ca-rich [2]. There is no achondrite known so far composed of diopside, anorthite and forsterite. Its obvious igneous texture with accumulation of homogeneous mineral grains suggests crystallization from Mg-Ca-rich but anomalously Fe-poor silicate magma at depth on its parent body. We compared the bulk composition of NWA 7325 [2] with experimental partial melt compositions of various chondrites [3-5], but none of them matches with NWA 7325. It is difficult to produce the silicate magma that crystallizes Ca-Mgrich but Fe-poor meteorites such as NWA 7325 by simple partial melting of known chondrite group. Enstatite chondrite with addition of CAI-like component may be a candidate. We found evidence of in-situ partial melting in NWA 7325 as was suggested by very fine-grained plagioclase domains with partial coexistence of pyroxene. Furthermore, there are other mineral phases at the mineral grain boundaries which are thought to be products of partial melting. These indicate that NWA 7325 experienced in situ melting of plagioclase and grain boundaries of other mineral phases. Because there is no evidence of transport of these partial melts, subsequent recrystallization immediately took place. A similar fine-grained plagioclase is known in Dhofar 378 shergottite that is also interpreted as melting of plagioclase [6]. Because both olivine and diopside show wavy extinction under optical microscope, it is obvious that this meteorite experienced shock metamorphism, and which might be responsible for this melting and subsequent rapid recrystallization event.The preliminary UPb data in this study show that the crystallization age is >4560 Ma, and similar old age was reported in [7]. Thus, this shock and recrystallization event likely oc  curred right after the initial solidification of this meteorite.  References: [1] Clayton R. and Mayeda T. (1996) Geochim. Cosmochim.
