THE GADOLINIUM AND DYSPROSIUM ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION OF A SUPERNOVA INJECTION INFERRED FROM ALLENDE CAIs. G.A. Brennecka1*, L.E. Borg1, M. Wadhwa2. 1Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (*brennecka2@llnl.gov); 2School of Earth and Space Exploration, Arizona State University.  Introduction: Slight differences between the nonradiogenic isotope compositions of the first solids in the Solar System (calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions, or CAIs) and terrestrial rocks are pervasive. It has been shown that for heavier elements (38 < Z > 62), these isotopic differences are likely caused by the input of supernova material that was not incorporated into the CAI-forming region [1]. These distinct nucleosynthetic differences between CAIs and terrestrial rocks provide the opportunity to determine the isotopic character of the last significant supernova to input material into the Solar System. Like previous elements studied for this purpose, gadolinium (Gd, Z=64) and dysprosium (Dy, Z=66) have multiple stable isotopes with variable inputs from p-, s-, and r-process nucleosynthesis. In addition to the information gained about nucleosynthetic signatures, Gd isotopic compositions can be used to monitor thermal neutron fluence [e.g., 2-4] experienced by CAIs. Specifically, because the isotopes 155Gd and 157Gd have extraordinarily large thermal neutron capture crosssections, the interaction of CAIs with low-energy neutrons would cause systematic depletion in 155Gd and 157Gd paired with correlated excesses in 156Gd and 158Gd. In this study, we present Gd and Dy isotope compositions of four Allende CAIs for which we have previously reported Sr, Mo, Ba, Nd, Sm, and U isotopic compositions [1,5]. Additionally, the Mg isotopic compositions of the same samples are reported at this meeting [6]. Samples and Methods: Aliquots from four previously dissolved CAIs of the Allende meteorite [1,5] were obtained for Gd and Dy isotope measurements. The rare earth elements (REEs) were separated from the CAI matrix using AG50W-X8 cation exchange resin. Purification of Gd and Dy was accomplished using multiple passes through methalactic acid column chemistry.  Isotopic measurement: The Gd and Dy isotopic compositions of the samples and standards were measured on a Thermo Triton thermal ionization mass spectrometer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). Internal normalization was used to correct for instrumental mass bias for both isotope systems. The values of the internal normalization ratios used are: 156Gd/160Gd = 0.9361 [2] and 164Dy/162Dy = 1.107. The 164Dy/162Dy value used for normalization was based on the average of multiple long-duration runs completed on terrestrial standards during this study. Results: Our results are presented in Figs. 1 and 2. Like the other heavy elements we have measured so far in these CAIs, the Gd and Dy isotopic compositions are indistinguishable from one sample to another, yet distinct from terrestrial standards. The average of the CAIs is given in red in Figs. 1 and 2. The uncertainties shown for the terrestrial standards (gray bars) represent the 2SD of the long-term reproducibility of that standard during this study. The uncertainties shown for CAIs represent the 2SD based on the data for all CAIs measured. Gadolinium Isotopes: The Gd isotopic compositions of CAIs measured here provide no evidence for significant interaction with thermal neutrons. This confirms our previously reported Sm isotopic data [1] and permits a straightforward interpretation of the other heavy isotopic measurements in the context of nucleosynthetic signatures. Note that no data is reported for 152Gd, 154Gd, and 155Gd due to the lower abundance of these isotopes and higher measurement uncertainty.  Relative to terrestrial standards, CAIs measured here have an average excess of 0.40±0.18 epsilon units (ε) in 158Gd/160Gd. This data is well fit by a model of rprocess deficit in the CAI-forming region, as shown with the dashed grey line in Fig. 1. Compared with terrestrial rocks, Gd isotopic signatures in CAIs contain a relative r-process deficit of ~30 ppm. This calculation indicates that when compared with terrestrial samples, CAIs have a slightly different amount of nucleosynthetic material derived from the r-process, as discussed in [1].

Dysprosium isotopes: Relative to terrestrial standards, CAIs measured here demonstrate an average excess of 2.1±0.6 ε in 160Dy/162Dy. The 161Dy/162Dy and 163Dy/162Dy ratios of CAIs are indistinguishable from that of terrestrial standards. No data is reported for 156Dy and 158Dy due to the low abundance of these isotopes and the associated high measurement uncertainties. The Dy isotopic data also fit well with a model of r-process deficit in the CAI forming region, as shown with the dashed grey line in Fig. 2. Compared with terrestrial rocks, Dy isotopic signatures in CAIs contain a relative r-process deficit of ~30 ppm.  Fig. 2 - Dy isotopic compositions of Allende CAIs, where the y-axis (εDy) shows the deviation from the terrestrial standards in parts per 104. The "best-fit" for an r-process deficit is given as the dashed line. The nucleosynthetic processes and the percentage that each represents is given below each isotope (from [7]).  Discussion and Conclusions: The Gd and Dy isotope compositions of the four Allende CAIs analyzed here are identical within the analytical uncertainty, implying that these "normal" (i.e., non-FUN) CAIs formed in a region with a homogenous isotopic composition. This is in agreement with previous isotopic data for other heavy elements (e.g., Sr, Mo, Ba, Nd, and Sm), which demonstrate that normal CAIs were formed from a homogenous reservoir that was isotopically distinct from the "average" Solar System represented by terrestrial isotopic compositions. As postulated by Brennecka et al. [1], the difference in the isotopic character between CAIs and the terrestrial planets is explained by the addition of a small amount of isotopically distinct supernova material to the bulk Solar System that was not mixed into the CAI-forming region. When viewed as a relative difference in the amount of r-process material for each element, the isotopic difference between CAIs and the average Solar System is systematic, with the magnitude of the r-process anomaly dependent on the mass of the element (Fig. 3).  Fig. 3 -The relative difference between the r-process isotopes of a variety of elements in CAIs and the "average" Solar System. This data provides the isotopic fingerprint of a supernova injection during the earliest epoch of the Solar System. Original figure reproduced from Brennecka et al. [1] with additional data added from this study (Gd and Dy) and Akram et al. [8] (Zr and Hf). These non-radiogenic isotopic differences between CAIs and the terrestrial planets provide a direct isotopic fingerprint of the supernova material injected into the very early Solar System. As the anomalies are given relative to terrestrial standards, the isotopic character of the supernova material is the reciprocal signature of that given in Fig. 3. Therefore, the supernova material would be characterized by relative r-process deficits below mass 140 and relative r-process excesses above mass 140. This is consistent with a type-II, Hevent supernova [9]. The marked change from r-process excesses to rprocess deficits around mass 140 in CAIs is physical evidence of the previously theorized decoupling of the r-process of nucleosynthesis (e.g., [10-12]). A second decoupling, possibly around mass 180-200, has also been theorized [13-14], and may be manifest in differences between the r-process isotope abundances of heavy REEs and those of W in CAIs [15].
