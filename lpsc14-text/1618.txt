Inst., Houston, TX 77058, 3 Geochemical Research Center, The University of Tokyo,  Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan.  Introduction: Cosmic-Ray Exposure (CRE) ages for about 20 ureilites are all younger than 50 Ma [1] (Figure 1), and generally comparable to those of chondrites, but much younger than the radiometric ages [2,3]. As for most meteorites, significant cosmicray exposure took place long after parent body accretion ended. Published, low activities of cosmogenic radionuclides for many ureilites suggest unusually small meteoroids (30 cm or less in radius, [4]). In an effort to improve the statistics of the CRE age distribution, test the generality of the conclusion concerning small meteoroids, and examine pairing relations, we present here the noble gas concentrations and the 26 Al and 36 Cl activities of samples from 13 Antarctic ureilites. Experimental Methods: Radionuclides: Samples with masses of ~50 mg were ground and then dissolved in concentrated HF and dilute HNO3 after the addition of ~5-10 mg of Be, Al, and Cl, and Ca carriers. The samples were heated in Parr Bombs for 45 days at ~115 C. Al, Be, Cl and Ca were chemically separated from the resulting solutions and purified for accelerator mass spectrometry at Purdue University as BeO, Al2O3, AgCl, or CaF2.  Elemental analyses: Aliquots of the ground material (~10 mg) were dissolved for the elemental analysis by ICP-OES at Rutgers University. About half the analyses are complete at this time. Noble gases: Fifteen sets of ureilite samples (~3050 mg) were analyzed at the University of Tokyo using a noble gas mass spectrometer (modified-VG5400/MSIII). After preheating the samples at 150C overnight to remove adsorbed atmospheric contamination, noble gases were extracted by heating at 1800C for 30 minutes. Noble gas data were corrected for blanks, mass discrimination factors and sensitivity. Results & discussion: Results are shown in Table 1. They agree well for GRA98032 and to within 20% for GRA 95205. The data confirm the pairing of the three ALH 82xxx meteorites and allow the pairing of EET87517 and EET 87720, but the latter two differ petrographically. No other pairings seem likely. EET83309-38 and GRO95575-17 contain more than 10 -5 cm 3 STP/g of 36 Ar and have 20 Ne/ 22 Ne ratios >1, signaling the presence of large concentrations of trapped gas. The non-cosmogenic 20 Ne/ 36 Ar ratios range from 0.005 to 0.011, well below the solar ratio (>10). A detailed discussion of the trapped component may be found in [5]. A "Bern" plot (Figure 1) suggests He losses from EET87720, EET 87517, GRA95205, and GRO95575. The differences in He concentration for GRA 95205,32 and ,33 indicate that losses vary on a centimeter scale. The remaining eight ureilites have relatively high (>1.13) 22 Ne/ 21 Ne ratios and for six the ratio is >1.17.  The generally high absolute 22 Ne/ 21 Ne ratios imply that most of our samples were irradiated by galactic cosmic rays (GCR) under 'light' shielding conditions, i.e., as small bodies (<30 cm in radius) or close to the surfaces of larger ones. Modeled values of the GCR cosmogenic 22 Ne/ 21 Ne ratio ([6]) are lower than most of the observed values. These differences may imply irradiation by solar cosmic rays (SCR), which can raise 22 Ne/ 21 Ne ratios [7], or may relate to various uncertainties.  The average of the 15 measured 36 Cl activities is 4.00.2 dpm/kg (1- mean), a value close to the one expected at saturation from GCR galactic-cosmic-ray irradiation of small to medium size meteoroids. Terrestrial decay may have offset increases in surface production due to solar-cosmic-ray (SCR) irradiation. The case for SCR irradiation is strongest for GRO95575, which has the highest 36 Cl activity, 6.2 dpm/kg.  The average of 15 measured 26 Al activities, 38.8±2.6 dpm/kg (1- mean), agrees well with previous work (see [4]).  Figure 2 shows the 21 Ne CRE ages based on a constant 21 Ne production rate, P21 [10 -8 cm 3 STP/(g Ma)] =0.412 in order to facilitate comparison with [1].  They range from 1.8 to 33.2 Ma and are consistent with earlier observations [1,8]. Judging from the modeling results of [6], a better average value of P21 for 26 Al ~ 40 dpm/kg would be lower by about 30% and the CRE ages higher by 30%. This conclusion is reflected in the higher 21 Ne26 Al CRE ages (T21-26 [Ma] = 21 Ne [10 -8 cm 3 STP/g]/ 26 Al [dpm/kg]  13.1) of Table 1. Generally high proportions of trapped Ar in most samples lead to large relative uncertainties in the concentrations of cosmogenic 38 Arcos and the CRE ages derived from them. Even so, the CRE ages based on 38 Arcos are mostly consistent with the 21 Ne CRE ages.   Conclusions: Cosmogenic noble gas concentrations and radionuclide activities were measured for 15 samples of 13 distinct ureilites. The results for 8 of them are consistent with small preatmospheric size, 30 cm. If calculated with a constant 21 Ne production rate of 0.41  10 -8 cm 3 STP/(g Ma), the cosmic-ray exposure ages tend to fall into between 6 and 30 Ma, but light shielding conditions suggest a lower average production rate and CRE ages about 30% higher. Overall, the distribution appears - coincidentally perhaps - most similar to that of the LL-chondrites [1]. Measurements of 10 Be and 41 Ca should be helpful in learning about the terrestrial ages of and SCR effects in the samples.   References: [1] Herzog G. F. and Caffee M. W.
