Introduction:  Lunar ilmenite (FeTiO3) (and related Fe-Ti-oxides) occurs in concentrations of up to 25% in lunar mare basalts volumetrically [1]. Ilmenite has been investigated over past decades for capability to be reduced to obtain oxygen to support life and for propulsion [2], as well as yield metal byproducts for construction [3]. In addition, lunar 3He content is strongly correlated with ilmenite grain abundance [4], underscoring the importance of ilmenite detection and mapping for understanding the geological evolution of the Moon as well as for auxiliary benefits such as solarwind implanted resources. However, to date, there has been no comprehensive understanding of ilmenite spectral reflectance properties [5]. Previous work has related spectral properties, such as 402/564 nm and 564/948 nm ratios first identified by [6], or recently, 415/750 nm ratio [7,8]) to TiO2 abundance [1,9]. However, these correlations are strictly empirical and not directly related to ilmenite abundance, and are also at least partially related to other properties of soils (such as nanophase or microcrystalline weathering properties [5]).  More mature lunar soils in particular contain impact-melted ilmenite incorporated into agglutinitic glass, such that there is no crystalline ilmenite structure yet the soil would still display a TiO2 signature [10]. Further, ilmenite is commonly subjected to a range of cation substitutions, including Fe-Mg as a dominant compositional variation in addition to Si, Zr, Cr, Al, and Mn [11]. Further laboratory investigation is required across a range of compositions, textures, and particle sizes to address, qualitatively and quantitatively, the effects of ilmenite and related Fe-Ti oxides on bulk mixture spectra [5]. Methods & Data: Terrestrial ilmenite has been shown to be a good spectral analogue of lunar ilmenite [12]. Twenty-two ilmenite samples (from a variety of localities including St. Urbain, Quebec, North Carolina, Italy, Madasgascar, Norway, and synthetically produced) were collected, crushed, and sieved to a variety of grain sizes ranging from <45 μm to 500-1000 μm. Biconical-bidirectional reflectance spectra were acquired from 350-2500 nm at a spectral resolution of 27 nm (and resampled to 1 nm) with an ASD FieldSpec Pro HR spectrometer at the Planetary Spectrophotometer Facility at the University of Winnipeg. Compositional data and ferrous/ferric ratios were acquired at Franklin and Marshall College by XRF and wet chemistry [13].    % ILM 103 ILM 114 ILM 116 SiO2 0.09 1.53 0.9 TiO2 64.2 58.45 49.39 Al2O3 0.28 5.09 1.74 Fe2O3 1.32 2.76 14.48 FeO 31.6 27.46 29.31 MnO 1.19 0.76 0.07 MgO 0.43 1.95 2.64 CaO 0.07 0.5 0.22 Na2O 0.39 0.45 0.38 Fig. 1: Bidirectional reflectance spectra and composition (by mass %) of three compositionally-similar ilmenite species across two grain sizes.    Grain-size Variations: Fig. 1 displays the influence of grain-size variation on reflectance spectra  for a suite of relativly pure naturally-occouring ilmenites ILM103, ILM114, and ILM116 (respecitive localites  of Saluda Co., SC, USA, McCall, ID, USA, and Sorel, QC, Canada). The coarser grain size shows a shift in peak position (across all samples) from 948 nm to 925 nm. A coarser grain size is also consistently brighter for all the samples.  Compositional Variations: Fig. 2 displays the influence of compositional variation on reflectance spectra for a suite of naturally-occurring ilmenites ILM102, ILM113,  & ILM120 (rspecitive localities  of St. Urbain, QC, Canada, Anderson Co., SC, USA, and Antisirabe District, Madagascar). The substantial presence of Fe2O3 suggests the presence of hematite and other iron oxide impurities.  The 564/948 nm ratio [6] is stable across compositions relative to the more dramatic change occurring at 948/1400 nm. The confounding effects of impurities and grain-size variations require further investigation to determine if tolerances for spectral discrimination of impurities can be reconciled across grain sizes. Future work: Presently, six primarily ilmenitebased samples were selected to demonstrate the impacts of grain-size variations and compositional variations on spectral reflectance.Next steps will include the characterization of impurities by employing x-ray diffractometry in concert with elemental data to characterize spectral differences throughout the entire suite of samples (n = 22).
