Mixing of Nebular Components in the Earliest Solar System and "The Road Not Taken(1)".  Jeremy S.  Delaney,  Dept  of  Chemistry  &  Chemical  Biology,  Rutgers  University,  610  Taylor  Rd,  Piscataway,NJ08854, (jsd@rci.rutgers.edu)Introduction:  Mixing of oxygen reservoirs toexplain  variations  of  oxygen  isotope  signaturesamong different meteorite classes has been long recognized(2).  The majority of   samples measured aresolid planetary, or meteoritic components. Gas andliquid samples are rare. The known range of valuesin all solar system materials including atmospheres(3)is  ∆17O > +150 to  ∆17O  ≈-50 is  large (Figure 1a)whereas most planetary and  meteoritic samples plotclose to the  terrestrial fractionation line (TFL), ∆17O= 0+/-2, in the Clayton-Mayeda diagram (Fig 1). If the solar nebula was radially stratified with respect  to  volatile  components,  ices  dominated  thecold outermost solar system (>5-10AU). The ices ofthe  solar  system  are  the  major  oxygen  reservoirother  than  the  Sun  and  the  rocky portions  of  theplanets. Perhaps 10-20 M⊕ of ices exist today in theKuiper Belt-Oort cloud region. Abundant H2O in theearly nebula presumably migrated outward from theprotosun, nucleating ice crystals as it moved. The effect  of  water  on minerals  that  acted as nucleationsites for the crystallizing ices is explored.Stoichiometric  constraints on oxygen isotoperatios  in  nebular processes. Representative  reactions for incorporation of O2   into solid silicates toform the dominant olivine in chondrites (4) (c.f. Eq.1)or  for  hydration  of  chondritic  assemblages  (Eq.2)may be mass balanced with ∆17O values:2MgSiO3+2Fe + H2O = [Mg2SiO4+Fe2SiO4]+H2 ....13Mg2SiO4 + 2H2O      =  2Mg3SiO5(OH)4 +SiO2  .....2If the solar photosphere oxygen is representative of the earliest condensed silicates (∆17O ≅ -50),the water must have  ∆17O ~ +200, (comparable tovalues for  outer solar system - cometary ices (5)), toproduce values of ∆17O ≈ 0 ±2, that are close to themajority  of  solids  measured  (Figure  1a).  For  silicates that had evolved up the  CCAM line to ∆17O ≈-25 the water required  for reaction has ∆17O ~ +150.Hydrothermal modification (in 1-10 years) occurs in chondrites(6), but  these processes are usuallyconsidered to occur after  chondrule formation(7)  andhence after the establishment of oxygen isotope signatures.  If  hydrothermal  exchange  of  oxygen  between the  earliest forming solids in the solar systemcan occur,  i.e. prior to the major chondrite formingevents,  then the paradox of heavily hydrated yet   Figure  1 (a)  Expanded  Clayton-Mayeda  (C-M)  diagram  formost nebular materials.

The initial crystallization of anhydrous silicatesby  evaporative and condensation processes(8)  closeto the protosun, formed refractory oxides and silicates such as olivine that would likely have oxygenisotope signatures comparable with the photosphericvalues.  The  array  of  oxidized  minerals,  up  theCCAM mixing line, containing fossil chronometers,requires that nebular interaction with a heavy oxygen reservoir was occurring from the earliest times.The formation of ices with heavy oxygen requiresthe low temperatures found in the outer solar system, beyond the frost line(9).  The active circulationof solids across the frostline provides the trigger forthe  isotopic  exchange  that  defines  the majority ofmaterials in the solar system.

the frost line provides the reactant assemblages forisotope exchange. Warming of these aggregates byincluded 26Al, 53Mn, or if they returned to inner solarsystem provides the heat needed for exhange to occur. Alternately ice crystals near the inner part of theinside the frost 'line' could melt onto mineral grainsand subsequent alteration reactions.Implications of mixing model for nebular oxygen: To  establish  the  range  of  oxygen  signatures  observed in  meteorites  the two reservoirs  of  oxygenmust interact very early in the evolution of the nebula as anhydrous phases dating to that time alreadycontain  the  oxyvgen  isotope  signatures.  Systemwide material exchange between the innermost andthe outer solar nebula must occur.  If reaction controlled isotope mixing controls the observed oxygensignatures  of  meteoritic  materials,  then  there  areseveral implications. (1) The depletion of 'volatile'elements  (alkalis,  halogens,  etc.)  probably  reflectsthe  activity  of  acqueous  solution  rather  than  thepresence of an unrecognized volatile component often invoked. The commonly observed depletion of Kwithout associated evaporative mass fractionation(10)can be ascribed to  solubility controlled exchangesrather than evaporation. (2) Evaporite-mineral concentrations (Halite,  sylvite,  gypsum-anhydrite,  calcite, etc.) should exist on or in asteroids and comets.(3) Experimental studies of analogue systems to meteorites that do not include an initial hydrous component  may  inflate  temperatures  of  reaction.  (4)Subsolidus reaction (metamorphism) in  the nebulaprior to the onset of melting is important. Metamorphism in early nebular  systems may resemble  theterrestrial crustal analogue, being dominated by prograde, dehydration reactions that later become thermally retrograde.  The rehydration associated withterrestrial retrograde metamorphism is generally absent.  (5)  The dissociation of H2O during progradereactions has fundamental implications for oxygenfugacity during early nebular evolution. Increasingoxidation state in primitive systems should correlatewith the increase of  ∆17O in meteorites as is oftenobserved.  (6)  'Mudball'  parent  bodies  represent  afundamental class of earliest solar system objects(11).(7) CI-chondrites, the most 'solar' meteorites, represent the least metamorphosed samples in the solarsystem.  This  is  consistent  with  their  metamorphicstate and their compositional signatures. Their ∆17O(slightly > 0) may represent the natural 'base line'(CI-FL Fig 1a) for a revised scale of  nebular oxygen evolution representing as it does the mixture ofcomponents that have seen the typical stoichiometric reactions of nebular interaction on the trans-nebular  scale.  The  heavily 'altered'  character  of  theseobjects reflects the paucity of high temperature innersolar system processing except for recirculation ofwater in comets during their solar orbits.Conclusions:   While  classical  models  of  nebularcomponents(4) have  focussed  on  the  broad  cosmochemical  classification  of  the  elements  intosiderophile,  lithophile,  chalcophile,  and  atmophileelements(11)  a more focussed examination of the roleof icy components(1) provides a potential solution tothe long standing problem of the oxygen isotope diversity. That diversity is seen in the oxygen threeisotope  signatures  defined  at  the  earliest  nebulartimes.  Stoichiometric  hydration  reactions  of  themost  abundant  silicates  (eg.  enstatite  and  olivine)provide  realistic  analogues  to  observed  phases  incarbonaceous  chondrites  and  their  oxygen  isotopesignatures.  Hydration phenomena may also explainthe dominance of meteorites with ∆17O ≅ 0+/-2 in thesolar system sample suite. Scatter of ∆17O near 0 reflects small variation in reaction conditions. H2O H2 buffering may control control the observed oxidation  states  of  nebular  materials  as  well  as  observed depletion of alkali elements in many planetsand small bodies. The general increase in  fO2 withincreasing ∆17O may be a reflection of this hydrogenbuffer.Hydration reactions must occur very early(perhaps contemporaneous with CAI formation) todefine  the discrete  oxygen regimes  in  which eachmeteorite group subsequently evolved and should beexpected in all regions of the solar nebula ouside theevaporative zone close to the protosun. The establishment of a nebular thermal gradient outward fromthe evolving star, together with nebula-scale circulation, would be reflected in this process. The abundance  of  hydrated  phases  in  CI  chondrites  maytherefore be a primary feature rather than the product of later alteration. (Subsequent reprocessing ofCI's,  related  to  the  recrystallization  of  those  hydrated phases, is clearly required to account for theyoung ages of these objects).References : (1) Frost, R., 1920.
