PETROLOGIC SUBTYPE OF TYPE 3 CK CHONDRITE, DAR Al GANI 431 (DaG-431). A. M. Bruck1 and T. L. Dunn2, 1Department of Chemistry, Illinois State University, Normal, IL 61761. (ambruc2@ilstu.edu),  2Department of Geology, Colby College, Waterville, ME 04901.       Introduction:  The carbonaceous chondrite class is subdivided into eight groups of meteorites, each with similar petrologic, chemical, and isotopic chracteristics [1].  Two groups, the CK and CV chondrites,  share many similarities.   Both are rich in refactory lithophile elements and formed under similar oxidizing conditions, as evidenced by abundances of magnetite and Ni-rich sulfide minerals [2].  Despite these similarities, each group of meteorites was thought to represent a single parent asteroid until [3] suggested that both groups are derived from a single, thermally-stratified asteroid. If this is the case, the CV and CK chondrites should represent a continuous metamorphic sequence from petrologic type 3 to type 6 [4].      The thermal history of a meteorite can be qualified by the degree of metamorphism the respective parent body has experienced. The extent of metamorphism (petrologic type) is established using geochemical indicators (e.g. compositional homogeneity and oxide abundances) and textural variations [5, 6]. Petrologic type 3 is classified as the least metamorphosed and type 6 the most [4]. The CK chondrites are the only group of carbonaceous chondrites that exhibit the full range of thermal metamorphism (from petrologic type 3 to type 6) [2].       The effects of metamorphism are most pronounced in petrologic type 3 (unequilibrated) material. As a result, the unequilibrated ordinary chondrites can be further divided into petrologic subtypes (3.0-3.9). However, the petrologic subtypes of the type 3 CK chondrites have not been established. Understanding the degree of metamorphism these samples have experienced is particularly useful for determining if the CKs are derived from the same asteroid as the CV chondrites. Previous work [7, 8,] has begun to establish a petrologic sequence for the type 3 CK chondrites using geochemical parameters established for the unequlibrated ordinary chondrites. In this study, similar techniques that are used to determine the petrologic subtype of ordinary chondrites will be used to determine petrologic subtype of  CK3 chondrite Dar al Gani 431 (DaG-431).  Methods/Instrumentation: A 30 µm thick, one inch round, polished thin section of CK chondrite DaG-431 was prepared by High Mesa Petrographics. Images of the thin section obtained using a petrographic microscope in the Department of GeographyGeology at Illinois State University were used to identify areas of interest for SEM and electron microprobe analysis.  This thin section was then carbon coated at Washington University in St. Louis in preparation for SEM/EDS analysis.  Elemental x-ray maps of DaG431 was obtained using the  FEI Quanta 450 Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope with an Oxford Inca 250 Energy-Dispersive X-Ray Spectrometer in the Department of Biological Sciences at Illinois State University. Olivine, magnetite, and sulfides were analyzed using a JEOL JXA-8200 electron microprobe equipped with 5 wavelength-dispersive spectrometers, and a JEOL (e2v / Gresham) silicon-drift energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) at Washington University in St. Louis.  The results  of the quantitative  analysis were then compared to results previously found by [7, 8, 9].   Geochemical Trends: Using geochemical indicators of metamorphism in the ordinary chondirtes, [7, 8] has established a petrologic sequence for four type 3 CK chondrites. The first such indicator is Cr2O3 content in Type II chondrule olivine. In ordinary chondrites, Cr2O3 decreases as FeO increases during progressive metamorphism [10, 11].  Therefore, samples with lower Cr2O3 represent higher petrologic type. Of the four type 3 CK chondrites previously analyzed by [7,8,], Hart contains the highest average abundance of Cr2O3 and Dhofar 015 the lowest. Samples NWA 1559 and NWA 5956 fall between Hart and Dhofar 015, respectively. So, the metamorphic sequence established usig this indicator is Hart  NWA 1559  NWA 5956  Dhofar 015 [7, 8].        The percent mean deviation (PMD) of Fa in olivine also supported thermal metamorphic established using type II chondrules.  PMD is a measure of the mean deviation of Fa in individual measurements from the mean of all measurements [6].  Generally, Fa in olivine decreases during metamorphism as samples becomes more equilibrated. In the samples analyzed, PMD  decreases from Hart  NWA 1559  NWA 5956  Dhofar 015 [7, 8].       [9] has shown that nickel in Type II olivine can also be used an indicator of petrologic type in the CK chondrites. Though this is not a parameter used in the ordinary chondrites (due to low nickel abudances), both magnetite and olivine in CK chondrites are rich in nickel, and NiO has been shown to diffuse from magnetite into olivine during metamorphism [12].  NiO in Type II chondrule olivine increases from Hart to NWA 1559 to Dhofar 015 [9]. NWA 5956, however, contains a low abundance of NiO and does not fit into this general trend. Since NiO-rich olivine is essential to the CK chondrite class, [9] suggested that NWA 5956 has been incorrectly classified as a CK chondrite. 1608.pdf

      Petrologic subtype of DaG-431: When DaG-431 is compared to the other type 3 CK chondrite samples from [7, 8] its degree of metamorphism can be generalized from its Cr2O3 content, PMD, and NiO content.  DaG-431 has the lowest PMD of all type 3 CK chondrites analyzed for far, since PMD Fa was not measured in Dhofar 015 (Table 1). This suggests that DaG-431 is more equilibrated than Hart and NWA 1559. We cannot determined its degree of equilibration relative to Dhofar 015, since the PMD of Dhofar 015 has not been determined.            Table 1. Shows the PMD of Fa in chondrules and the averages of Type 2 FeO and Cr2O3 in wt%  [7, 8].  Thermal metamorphism increases from left to right across the rows.       DaG-431’s average Cr2O3 content in Type II olivine falls between NWA 1559 and Dhofar 015 (Fig. 1). Figure 2 indicates that this also the case for NiO in Type II chondrule olivine. This suggests that DaG-431 falls into the established metamorphic sequence between NWA 1559 and Dhofar 015.           Figure 1. FeO vs. Cr2O3 content in examined CK chondrites Type 2 (FeO-rich) chondrules[7,8,].  Highest FeO and lowest Cr2O3 content represents the highest degree of metamorphorism [10, 11].  Metamorphism increases with Hart  NWA 1559  DaG – 431  Dhofar 01.                Figure 2: FeO vs. NiO content in examined CK chondrites Type 2 (FeO-rich) chondrules [9].    Conclusions: DaG-431 is a higher petrologic subtype than Hart, NWA 1559, and a lower subtype than Dhofar 015. The metamorphic sequence so far (from lowest to highest) is Hart, NWA 1559, DaG-431, and Dhofar 015. Although exact subtype of DaG-431 cannot yet be determined, it can be estimated.  If all type 3 CK chondrites are type 3.5 or higher, as suggested by [3], then Hart is likely a subtype 3.5 or 3.6. Because olivine in Dhofar 015 is almost at equlibrium compositions, it is likely a type 3.9 [13]. This would suggest that Dhofar 015 is a type 3.6 or 3.7; however, more data is required before the exact petrologic subtypes of these and other type 3 CK chondrites can be determined.
