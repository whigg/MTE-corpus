Introduction:  Amorphous silicates in CP-IDPs (chondritic porous interplanetary dust particles) are dominated by glass with embedded metal and sulfides (GEMS), which amount to as much as half of the mass of some IDPs [1]. This is typically ~200 nm in diameter and consists of SiO2-rich silicate glass including small (typically 10-50 nm in size) and rounded grains of Fe-Ni metals and sulfides. Several formation processes for GEMS have been proposed so far, but they are still being debated. They can be grouped into two categories: (1) condensation products from the residual Si-rich gas after condensation of crystalline Mg silicates, such as forsterite, from the original gas in the primordial solar system [1,2] (2) amorphization products of crystalline silicates in the interstellar medium by sputter-deposition of cosmic ray irradiation, similar to space weathering [3]. Matsuno et al. [4] succeeded to synthesize ~50 nm sized amorphous silicate grains with metallic iron by a condensation experiment in the systems of Si-Mg-Fe-O. They also showed that if different metal materials are used, such as Ni, Mo, Zn and Sn instead of Fe, their grain textures were changed probably due to the difference of the surface energy between silicates and metals, which is sensitive to the chemical composition. In order to understand the effect of minor elements in silicate to the texture, we performed condensation experiments in more realistic systems than that of the previous studies. Experiments:  The system of Si-Mg-Fe-Al-Ca-O with the mean composition of GEMS (hereafter, GEMS-7) and the system of Si-Mg-Fe-Al-Na-Ca-Ni-O with the solar abundance (SA-8) are used as the starting materials. Mixtures of Si, SiO2, MgO, Fe, Al2O3, Na2SiO3, CaO and Ni commercial powders (typically ~4 µm) are injected into an induction thermal plasma (ITP) furnace. ITP can provide ultra-high temperature (the maximum is ~104 K) to evaporate the starting materials immediately, and then, the obtained gas was quenched under an Ar-He atmosphere at atmospheric pressure. The O/Si ratio was changed from 1.3 to 2.8 by changing the Si/SiO2 ratio to control the oxygen fugacity in the experimental systems. We also used meteorite powders as two different starting materials. One is an ordinary chondrites (NWA4719, L6) clashed to fine powder (OC), and the other is a mixture of the meteorite powder and Si powder with the Si abundance larger than that of the meteorite by 1.5 times in atomic ratio (OC+Si) because the mean composition of GEMS is enriched in Si [1,2]. We obtained 100-500 mg of condensates from a filter equipped in the ITP chamber in each experimental run. The run products were analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM/TEM) equipped with a tomography system and an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The run products were also embedded in KBr or polyethylene and the mass absorption coefficient of mid-far infrared (IR) region were measured.  Results and discussion: For GEMS-7 with  O/Si≤2.7, nano-sized amorphous silicate grains (typically ~50 nm in size) with embedded metallic iron (typically ~20 nm in size) formed (Fig. 1a).

Some amorphous grains have multiple metallic kamacite (metallic iron) inclusions, which is similar to GEMS texture. The amorphous silicate has a region composed of mostly pure SiO2 due to a liquid immiscible gap (Fig. 1c). For GEMS-7 with O/Si=2.8, magnetite appeared in amorphous silicate grains. For SA-8 with O/Si≤2.7, kamacite, taenite and olivine are identified in amorphous silicate grains. No liquid immiscible gaps are seen in this sample because the SiO2 content of the amorphous silicate is not so high to produce immiscibility gap. For OC, we obtained nano-sized grain composed of kamacite, taenite and magnetite in amorphous silicate grains. In the experiment using OC+Si, almost all the run products mainly composed of amorphous silicates were collected from the filter. We also obtained condensate from the chamber wall. They are nano-sized amorphous silicate grains embedded with kamacite and some iron sulfide grains are present on the surface of the amorphous grains (Fig. 1d-f). This texture is almost the same as that in GEMS [1], indicating that this experiment succeeded in reproducing GEMS texture. The difference of the mineral assemblages from the different collection sites shows that the run product on the chamber wall condensed under more reducing condition than the filter.  The IR spectra of all the run products show broad absorption bands at about 9.8 and 18.5 µm (Fig. 2) due to Si-O stretching and O-Si-O vending modes, respectively. In the spectra of GEMS-7 with O/Si=2.3 and OC+Si (chamber), small shoulders appear at 8.95 and 20.8 µm.   Figure 2:  IR absorption spectra of run products. G:  amorphous SiO2 caused by the immiscible gap. ol: olivine. They correspond to a SiO2-rich portion of the immiscible gap because amorphous SiO2 have peaks around here [5].A small peak at 11.2 µm in SA-8 with O/Si=2.7 corresponds to olivine. These spectral features are very similar to those of GEMS [6], which have broad peak at 9.3-10.4 µm. In particular, they also have small shoulder at 9.0 µm. This indicates that GEMS also have immiscible gap in the amorphous silicate. The gap can occur at above or near its melting point. Some experiments report that liquids of the system of MgO-SiO2 can exist at about >1550 K [7]. Therefore, GEMS should experienced high temperature followed by rapid cooling. If GEMS are evaporation residues, they should not be enriched in Si because the residue becomes Mg-rich by incongruent evaporation  [8]. This suggests that GEMS are condensates from high temperature gas. Non-equilibrium grain formation theories [9,10] can describe condensate size from the cooling time and the gas density. The estimated grain size in the ITP experiment was consistent with that of the experimental products. We consider scaling of the cooling times between the present experiments and a lower pressure system such as the solar nebula by the theories. When dimensionless parameter for condensation, Λ, is the same value, the condensate size should be the same. Using the Λ in the ITP system, the cooling timescale, τT, is ~105 sec when the total pressure, Pt, is 100 Pa. This timescale corresponds to the cooling rate of ~50 K/h when it gets lower from 1500 K to 1000 K.  The present results show that GEMS can form as the condensate from high temperature gas in the primitive solar nebula as proposed by [1,2]. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that GEMS have been originally condensed around evolved stars, moved to interstellar medium and finally incorporated in the primitive solar system because the IR features of interstellar dust are also similar to that of the run products [11].
