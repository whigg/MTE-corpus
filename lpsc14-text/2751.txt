 METAL-SILICATE PARTITIONING OF SI AND S UNDER HIGHLY REDUCING CONDITIONS:  IMPLICATIONS FOR THE EVOLUTION OF MERCURY.  V. J. Hillgren1 and Y.

Recent gravity models suggests that in addition to an anomalously large core there may be a dense FeS layer, termed the anticrust, at the base of the mantle [4,5]. These unique characteristics of Mercury can all potentially be tied to core formation in an extremely reducing environment where Si as well as S may be incorporated into the core. In highly reduced systems almost all the FeO is reduced to Fe and partitions into the core, and S is more soluble in silicate melts [e.g., 6]. In addition, the miscibility gap in the Fe-S-Si system could provide an origin for the FeS "anticrust" [4,5,7]. In order to understand how reducing condtions may have shaped the differentiation and subsequent evolution of Mercury, we have begun a study of the mutual partitioning of Si and S between metal and silicate under reducing condiditons at pressures relvant to core formation in Mercury. Experimental Procedures: Four sets of starting materials were prepared. The first set was based on a reduced Bencubbinite-like composition where all the Fe was added as metal or FeS and a portion of the Si was also added in reduced form. This composition had low bulk S (total FeS of 0.48 wt. %). Two other materials were made by adding approximately 1.5 and 3 wt. % FeS to this basic composition. The Bencubbinitelike composition was chosen because they have been suggested as possible precursor materials for Mercury based on their high metal to silicate ratio [for example, 9]. Two sets of materials consisted of an oxide mixes in roughly chondritic proportions mixed with a metallic component composed of Fe-metal with 20 wt. % Si and either 5, 10 or 15 wt. % S. The difference between these two sets is that one had an elevated CaO content. Finally, for the fourth material, the composition of the silicate was based on the surface composition of Mercury as revealed by MESSENGER [1]. The metal for this material also contained approximately 20 wt. % Si and 5 wt. % S. Runs were conducted at 2 GPa in the piston cylinder apparutus at temperatures of 1400°C, 1600°C and 1800°C. The experiments were conducted in MgO capsules.  Run durations ranged from 60 to 120 minutes.  Samples were recovered and polished. Samples were then examined with the JEOL 6500F Field Emission SEM outfitted with an Oxford X-Max 80 mm2 Si Drift Detector combined with the Aztec software package. Results: All samples contained both metallic liquids and solid and liquid silicate phases. Many also contained a range of sulfides normally in association with enstatite (Figure 1). In most runs, these sulfides were dominantly MgS, but in runs with high Ca in the silicate liquid the sulfides were enriched in Ca.  Recent work at 1 bar and 1500°C has shown that there is a clear fO2 dependence on the metal/silicate partition coefficient of S [8]. In figure 2, the data from that work is plotted along with some of the data from this work. At this point, there is not enough data to determine whether the differences between this work and the 1 bar data are the result of P, T or composition of the silicate [10] or a combination of all three. However, it is clear that as conditions get more reduced, less S partitions into the metal, such that under extremely reducing conditions there would be negligible S in the core. Although the goal of this study was not to study the crystallization sequence in a S-rich silicate magma ocean, the phase assemblages observed in the different composition systems at different temperatures suggest that during the cooling of such a magma ocean that the S would be retained in the liquid and that Mg- and Casulfides would precipitate late in the sequence. This implies that if there is an FeS anticrust, it must be formed from exsolution of FeS during core solidification because any sulfides precipitating from the magma ocean do so late and are low density so are expected to reside in the upper mantle and crust. These results may also suggest that despite appearing to be a very S-rich planet because of the high S concentration observed on the surface, Mercury could have a very low bulk Sconcentration. This is particularly true if Mercury's core formed under very reducing conditions and all the S partitioned into the mantle and was concentrated upwards into a thin layer in the crust. In this case there would only be a very thin or no anticrust which interior models allow [5] and the core would likely require another light element in addition to Si in order to explain it's partially molten state.
