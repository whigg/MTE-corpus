MARTIAN SPHERULE SIZE DISTRIBUTION BETWEEN EAGLE AND ENDURANCE CRATERS FROM OPPORTUNITY ROVER MI IMAGES.  D. Jones1, W. M. Calvin1, P. DeSouza2, and B.L.

At the time of the meeting, Opportunity will have been active on Mars for over 10 years, and more than 500 martian sols; traversing over 38 km of  Meridiani Planum from Eagle to Endeavour crater.  The presence of hematite had been identified from orbit [2]; however, the occurrence of hematite spherules, dubbed ‘blueberries’ by the MER team, was unexpected [3].  Observations support the interpretation that the spherules likely formed as concretions in a more or less homogeneous diffusion setting with no strong directional groundwater flow, but other explanations are possible [3,4,5].  Previous work regarding these spherules has focused primarily on the initial half of Opportunity’s traverse; working both to characterize their nature and origin as well as their size, distribution and chemistry [5,6].  MI image stacks have now been collected on approximately 485 sols on the way to Endeavour crater and an effort was made to examine each of these sols and measure the diameter of spherules when present.  Typically a single image was chosen from each sol for measurement based on a selection criteria including: image/stack quantity, image resolution, number of spherules present, and the number of exposed vs. semiburied spherules. Perpendicular diameter measurements were made on up to six spherules from each image, amounting to just over 750 individual spherules between sols 10 and 3502 as shown in Table 1.  Measurements were initially made in pixels, and were then converted to millimeters using a conversion factor of 31 micrometers per pixel [1].  Data obtained over Opportunity’s traverse was segregated into 13 separate campaigns based on location; typically, whether close to a significant crater or simply on the plains.  The size and number of spherules in each MI location were variable.  Target viewing angles also differed in each location. Images in the plains are typically vertically oriented and viewed the surface sediment and eroded-out or partially exposed spherules.  At craters, the MI was occasionally able to view exposed horizontal beds and view the spherules within their sedimentary host rock.  Three broad distinctions have been previously made to describe the spherules seen at Meridiani.  These include ‘blueberries’, the normal uncoated spherules and ‘batter-berries’ which are spherules coated with a sulfate-rich outcrop material [4]. ‘Newberries’ are observed near Endeavour crater at a target known as “Kirkwood” and appear to have a different internal structure and composition [7].  Table 1: Summary of data collected ever each campaign.  Data from the alpha particle X-ray spectrometer (APXS) shows that the chemical composition of these new spherules is not hematite dominant and they may have different origins as well [7]. These ‘new-berries’ appear to be similar in composition to spherules observed by the Spirit Rover (MER-A), at sites such as King George (sol 1035). Diameter measurements included in this study are primarily of the common ‘blueberry’ type, however some measurements of the new type have also been included for a broader look at the overall Meridiani spherule size distribution.

Figures 2 and 3 show the derived size distributions. When possible, measurements focused on including the largest and smallest spherules seen in each image, with the intention of obtaining the widest range of the size distribution. The diameters of measured spherules ranged from 0.6 mm to 7.2 mm in size and an estimate of the mean diameter was determined to be 2.13 mm, as shown in Table 2.  Figure 2 shows the range of sizes in each campaign location and Figure 3 summarizes sizes for the entire traverse from Eagle to Endeavor.  The overall distribution is reasonably well-fit by a lognormal curve; however the distribution may also be bimodal.  Since only the largest and smallest spherules in each image were measured, the distribution curve represents the range of sizes rather than the true statistical variation of the size range.     Figure 2: Box plots showing the distribution of spherule measurements from each campaign. Extremes in each location are noted by *.    Figure 3: Spherule size distribution from 1436 individual diameter measurements, shown with a lognormal fit.    Our results are generally consistent with those of Calvin et al. [5], who measured spherules from early in the mission, but a wider range of sizes in each MI image.  They noted a general decrease in spherule size south from Endurance crater toward Victoria crater. Another goal of this study was to try and determine whether proximity to a crater corresponds to any change in the size distribution or relative abundance of spherules or if other trends occur in the longer traverse distances. However after examining the data in separate campaigns there does not appear to be significant size variation near craters in the spherules seen on the surface or in outcrop. A slight increase in spherule size may occur near large craters; however the evidence is ambiguous. Further research could be done on the spherules observed by Spirit, not only to further constrain the size and distribution of martian spherules, but also understand the nature of spherules on Mars.  Very small spherules,  interpreted as impact spherules have been reported at the MSL landing site [8].  Table 2: Descriptive statistics of spherule diameter measurements in millimeters.
