Applin1 1University of Winnipeg, Department of Geography, 515 Portage Avenue, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada R3B 2E9   Introduction:  While some water-bearing minerals are expected to dehydrate under current Mars surface conditions the sensitivity of spectral hydration features was first observed by [1].  Since then, studies have identified the stability of water-bearing minerals to be particularly sensitive to humidity, temperature and pressure, producing changes in iron oxidation state, structure and loss of structural water [2, 3].  A number of  distinct hydrated minerals have been identified on Mars, including sulfates, phyllosilicates, zeolites, and silica [4-6] suggesting that Mars once hosted liquid water on or near the surface. It has been shown that near-surface minerals can undergo alteration when exposed to the Martian surface [7] however, the stability of many water-bearing minerals remains unknown.  This study exposed nine minerals to simulated Mars surface conditions.  The main objective of this study was to determine how a variety of hydrated zeolites, sulfates and silica-rich minerals react to exposure to Mars surface conditions in order to determine their detectability and hence provide insights into the climatic and geologic history of the planet.  The tasks undertaken to achieve this goal were to: (a) assess spectral and structural changes associated with exposure to Mars surface conditions (including effects of UV irradiation), (b) relate these spectral changes to compositional or structural changes, and (c) determine which changes are reversible by re-exposing the minerals to ambient conditions.  This study used the same techniques as [8], which simulate a broad set of Martian surface conditions and did not require the removal of samples from the environment chamber for analysis. Deviations from these earlier studies included a different selection of minerals, longer duration UV light regime, integration of XRD with reflectance spectroscopy for all samples, longer duration exposure (>2 years), and investigation of the potential for rehydration of the minerals after exposure to Mars-like surface conditions. Experimental Procedure:  To determine the stability of recently identified minerals on Mars a total of nine minerals were subjected to 763 days of simulated daytime Mars surface condition and two periods of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Throughout this period diffuse reflectance spectra were acquired 33 times.  Prior to exposure, the samples were ground by hand using an alumina mortar and pestle and dry sieved to obtain <45 µm fractions. Fine grain sizes were used to best mimic the nature of the uppermost surface of Mars [9].  In addition, they were characterized by X-ray diffraction and wet chemistry, as described in [10, 11]. Exposure of the samples to Mars surface conditions was conducted using the University of Winnipeg's mini Mars Environment (mini-ME) chamber [12].  Within the mini-ME chamber the samples were be subjected to an array of Mars surface conditions including: atmospheric composition (approximated using commercial grade CO2), atmospheric pressure, temperature and UV-irradiation [2].  The atmospheric composition and pressure remained constant throughout the experiment with a continuous dry flow of CO2 and pressure of 5±3 Torr (660 Pa CO2).  A water circulation system in thermal contact with the sample disk restricted their maximum temperature to ~20°C, the maximum current surface temperature on Mars [2].  Note that the temperature of the sample surface did have the capacity to rise above ambient temperatures upon the application of UV irradiation.  UV irradiation was delivered using an air-cooled 25 W deuterium lamp placed directly above the chamber illuminating the samples for two periods throughout the experiment.  The incident UV irradiation over one day of laboratory exposure was approximately equal to 10 years of UV exposure on Mars [2].  The chamber was sealed using a 10 mm thick sapphire window which provided a < 1% absorbance across the 0.2-6 µm range.  Reflectance spectra were acquired using an Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD) FieldSpec Pro HR® spectrometer over the range of 0.35-2.5 µm, changes of interest included band depth, band position and band width.  Results:  Spectral-compositional-structural systematic changes to the samples during the experimental run focused on looking for changes in intensity, shape, and position of water and iron associated bands. The following discussion addresses the stability of the hydrated minerals under Mars conditions and is divided by mineral type with an emphasis on the loss of volatile content of the minerals (H2O versus OH).  Changes related to Fe3+ absorption bands were also expected as they are affected by both OH and H2O sites in addition to the crystal structure which can change as the mineral dehydrates.   Sodium sulfate decahydrate (mirabilite) was included in the experimental run however the sample lost all structural H2O during sample preparations as it is highly unstable in laboratory conditions (21° C and 35% RH) and immediately altered to anhydrous sodium sulfate (thenardite).  As a result no changes were 2083.pdf

observed in the spectra; however, this still proves to be conclusive as the conditions on the surface of Mars are not favorable to the stability of mirabilite.  Below 60% RH, thenardite is the expected stable phase. The zeolites (chabazite and heulandite) experienced some loss of H2O in the 1.4 and 1.9 µm region.  The Fe2+/Fe3+ charge transfer absorption band at 0.70 µm was lost after the first period of UV exposure in both minerals but was regained during rehydration.  Preliminary results suggest that the zeolites are stable at Mars surface conditions as the H2O and OH associated bands were relatively unaffected both during the experimental run and re-exposure to ambient conditions which is expected as these zeolites hold onto their water tightly.   The sulfates were more dramatically affected by the exposure to Mars surface conditions.  Rapid decrease or loss of 1.4 µm H2O feature was observed for coquimbite, rhomboclase and fibroferrite. The 0.4-0.9 µm range Fe3+ bands underwent a reduction in intensity in all spectra during the experimental run with the exception of the 0.53 µm band in rhomboclase.  Little change was observed at longer wavelengths.  Upon reexposure to ambient conditions the 1.4 and 1.9 µm bands deepen in all spectra as the samples rehydrated. The 0.9 µm Fe3+ band migrated to shorter wavelengths and became visibly narrower in hydronium jarosite, fibroferrite and copiapite.  Minor change in hydronium jarosite with the exception of the 0.9 band after reexposure to ambient conditions was consistent with changes observed by [2] for K-jarosite.  This again provides evidence that jarosite minerals are particularly stable on the martian surface. Silica sinter (opal-A) experienced a quick shift of the 1.42 µm band to shorter wavelengths and 1.9 and 2.25 µm depth decrease was observed throughout the run.  During re-exposure the 1.4 µm band changes in shape (loss of short wave end shoulder) and 2.25 µm band changes shape. Discussion: During re-exposure to ambient conditions all minerals exhibited a decrease in spectral slope blue shift and and increased reflectance, this is consistent with the minerals appearing as larger aggregates or crusts. A decrease in H2O associated absorption bands in the 1.4 and 1.9 µm region was observed during the experimental run for the zeolite minerals.  A loss of the Fe2+/Fe3+ charge transfer absorption band at 0.70 µm was observed but was re-established after re-exposure to ambient conditions. General trends to the sulfate spectra include rapid loss of  1.4 µm H2O associated bands.  Some change in 1.9 water band was observed as well as a decrease in intensity in  0.4 - 0.9 µm range Fe3+ bands.  This is consistent with expected phase changes for some Febearing sulfates.  When the samples were rehydrated many of them showed a deepening of 1.4 and 1.9 µm bands past the original position suggesting that H2O may be becoming more ordered. Hydronium jarosite, fibroferrite and copiapite all observed 0.9 µm Fe3+ band migrated to shorter wavelengths and became visibly narrower.  Minor changes in hydromium jarosite throughout all parts of the experimental run were consistent with previous results for K-jarosite which was found to be particularly stable at Mars surface conditions [2]. Silica sinter (opal-A) showed some dehydration as well and changes in depth and shape in the 1.4 and 2.25 µm region.  This is indicative of the silica taking on water from the atmosphere and becoming hydrogen bonded.  Changes in all samples have yet to be compared to XRD results which will aid in identifying more conclusive results. References:  [1] Bishop J.L. and Pieters C.M. (1997) JGR, 100, 5369-5379.
