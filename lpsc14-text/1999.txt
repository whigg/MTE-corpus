(Romain.Tartese@open.ac.uk)   Introduction: It is now well established that significant amounts of indigenous H-bearing species (H, OH and H2O, henceforth referred to as "water") are present in lunar volcanic glasses, in olivine-hosted melt inclusions within volcanic glasses [1-4], in nominally anhydrous minerals from the lunar highlands [5], and in the mineral apatite from nearly all lunar lithologies [6-13].  The isotopic composition of this water provides clues to its origin. Greenwood et al. [9] were the first to report H isotopic compositions for apatites in lunar samples, and interpreted the elevated D/H ratios, measured in most of the samples, as resulting from delivery of cometary water to the Moon. Subsequently, Tartèse and Anand [14] proposed that indigenous lunar water could have been characterized initially by CI chondrite-like D/H ratios, with elevated D/H ratios measured in apatites from mare basalts resulting from fractionation of H from D during magmatic degassing of H2. Recent studies have indeed measured chondritic D/H ratios in volcanic glasses and their melt inclusions [1,4], and thus H2 degassing is now considered as a likely mechanism to explain some elevated D/H ratios measured in water-rich lunar samples [1,13-15]. Finally, recent analyses carried out in apatites from the Mgsuite norite 78235, representing an old sample of the lunar highlands, yielded D/H ratios comparable to terrestrial values (D ranging from ~ 0 to -200 ‰ [7]). To gain further insights into the origin(s) and evolution of lunar water, we are investigating the apatite water content and its H isotope composition in the relatively rare lunar rock types represented by KREEP basalts and high-Al basalts, which have not been previously studied extensively for their H2O and D/H systematics. Analytical techniques: H2O content and H isotopic composition were measured in apatites using the Cameca NanoSIMS 50L at the Open University, following established porotocls  [e.g., 6,13]. H2O contents were calibrated using the measured 1H/18O ratio and calibrations derived using reference apatites [16], which were also used to correct D/H ratios for instrumental mass fractionation. H2O contents and D/H ratios, given in the  notation, are reported in Fig. 1 with their 2 uncertainties (all data have been corrected for spallogenic production of H and D using published cosmic-ray exposure ages; final uncertainties include instrumental counting statistics, reproducibility of standard measurements, and uncertainties on CRE ages and spallogenic production of H and D).  Results: KREEP basalts. Apatites in sample 72275 are characterized by large H2O variations between ~ 50 and 850 ppm, with homogeneous D values (weighted average = -113 ± 62 ‰, 2) (Fig. 1).  H2O contents in apatites in the olivine gabbro lithology of NWA 773 range from ~ 500 to 2800 ppm and D values between -273 ± 139 ‰ and 184 ± 140 ‰ (Fig. 1). These values are consistent with ion probe measurements of apatites in the paired meteorite NWA 2977 (H2O ~ 1000-2500 ppm, average D = -110 ± 30 ‰; [10,17]). In sample 15386, apatite H2O contents range from ~ 100 to 800 ppm, with D values displaying very large variations between 89 ± 99 ‰ and 778 ± 123 ‰ (Fig. 1).  Fig. 1: D (‰) vs. H2O (ppm)  in apatites from KREEP and high-Al mare basalts (*14053 data from [9]), compared with typical high- and low-Ti mare basalts [13] and norite 78235 [7]. D average value for terrestrial mantle (-60 ± 20 ‰) is from [18] and for bulk CI-chondrites is from [19].  High-Al basalts. Apollo 14 high-Al basalts are divided into 4 compositionally distinct groups [20]. Greenwood et al. [9] analysed apatites in group C sample 14053 and reported relatively homogeneous H2O contents (~ 600-900 ppm) and D values (weighted average = -188 ± 13 ‰, 2) (Fig. 1). In this 1999.pdf

study, we have analysed apatites from Group B and Group D high-Al basalts. In group B basalt 14321,1238, apatites contain very low H2O contents < 80 ppm, with D values ranging between 144 ± 336 ‰ and 462 ± 328 ‰ (weighted average = 268 ± 190 ‰, 2) (Fig. 1). In group D basalt 14072, apatite H2O contents range from ~ 70 to 320 ppm, with D values ranging between 10 ± 410 ‰ and 434 ± 308 ‰ (weighted average = 192 ± 120 ‰, 2) (Fig. 1). Discussion: Water in high-Al basalt apatites. Based on these preliminary data on water contents in apatites from high-Al basalts, the following observations can be made: 1) Apatites in groups B (14321,1238) and D (14072) basalts are fairly dry and are characterized by D values around 200-250 ‰; 2) Apatites in group C basalt 14053 contain moderate H2O contents associated with low D signatures. However, on account of the peculiar history of this sample that was notably affected by solar wind implantation and later metamorphism [21], additional data on other group C basalts are mandatory. Degassing of H2. Apatite grains in KREEP basalt 15386, and in some grains in NWA 773, display a trend of increasing D with decreasing H2O (Fig. 1). This trend can be a result of diffusive loss  of OH from apatites or degassing of H2 from the magma during apatite crystallization. To test the possibility of diffusion-induced H2O-D variations, NanoSIMS images of 1H and 19F distributions were acquired on an apatite grain in contact with late-stage quenched melt (glass), and containing a melt inclusion. H2O is enriched in the melt inclusion and in the glass compared to the apatite, consistent with the incompatible nature of H2O in apatite [22]. Profiles of 1H and 19F variations show that the transitions between the apatite and the glass and the melt inclusion are very sharp (~ 1-2 μm), precluding significant diffusive exchange and re-equilibration between these different phases. On the other hand, one of the apatite grains analyzed in 15386 was enclosed within a pyroxene crystal, suggesting it crystallized relatively early. Interestingly, this grain is characterized by low D (90 ± 100 ‰) and a higher H2O content (~ 800 ppm), which is precisely what one would expect if the observed H2O-D relationship in 15386 resulted from crystallization during magmatic degassing of H2 [13-15]. H2O content in the mantle source regions: a KREEP basalt perspective. Tartèse et al. [13] estimated ~ 50-500 ppm H2O for the typical low-Ti basalt source regions, taking into account the loss of Hbearing species during magma degassing. Such estimates for water contents are strikingly similar to those for mantle sources of pyroclastic products (~ 50-400 ppm H2O; [2]), as well as those of terrestrial (~ 60-400 ppm H2O [23-24]) and martian basalts (~ 100-300 ppm H2O [16]). KREEP basalts are enriched in P (P2O5 ~ 0.5-0.7 wt.% [25]) compared to typical mare basalts [26] and high-Al basalts (~ 0.1-0.2 wt.% P2O5 [27]). It is thus likely that phosphate saturation occurred earlier in the crystallisaiton history of KREEP basalts, after around 85-90 % crystallization [28], compared to > 95 % crystallization for typical mare basalts [29]. Taking this into account, back-calculations yield estimates of ~ 10-400 ppm H2O for the KREEP basalt mantle source regions, largely overlapping with other estimates mentioned above. H isotopic composition of lunar water. Whichever process was responsible for producing large H2O variations, as seen in KREEP basalt 72275, it was not accompanied by  H2 degassing, as associated D values are relatively constant over a range of H2O contents, yielding a weighted D value of -113 ± 62 ‰ (n = 12; MSWD = 1.3). Such terrestrial-like H isotopic compositions are consistent with a common origin for terrestrial and lunar indigenous water [1,4,13-14].
