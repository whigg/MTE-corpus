Chandra observed the comet in three separate preperihelion pointings observations of the comet on Oct. 31.302, Nov. 3.083, and Nov. 6.438 UT. [Note that scheduled post-perihelion observations in Dec 2013 – Jan 2014 were cancelled after the comet disrupted near perihelion on 28 Nov 2013.]    Observations:  Detections were obtained in both the ACIS-S spectro-photometric (0.3-2.0 keV) and HRC-I imaging (0.1-10 keV) cameras in 8700- and 3800-sec duration exposures, respectively. The HRC-I measurements represent the first ever detections of a comet in the broad 0.1 – 10 keV HRC-I bandpass, likely dominated by solar wind charge exchange (SWCX) OVI emission from abundant O+6 solar wind ions at 0.05 – 0.10 keV. The ~5' width of the detected x-ray emission seen in the ACIS-S imagery on Nov. 3 and Nov. 6 corresponds to an emitting region about 260,000 km in diameter, typical for bright x-ray comets [1-3], and consistent with the OH coma radius of > 500,000 km detected by SWIFT on Nov. 7 [4]. The observed x-ray morphology on these “normal” solar wind days is consistent with the usual “kidney-bean” or projected paraboloid emission pattern seen for the brighter comets by Chandra.   Total count rates of 0.24, 0.36, and 0.30 counts per sec were found for C/2012 S1 by the ACIS-S when the comet was at rh = 1.0, 0.94, and 0.87 AU from the Sun, and at Δ = 1.25, 1.17, and 1.08 AU from the Earth/Chandra.  During this time, C/2012 S1 exhibited a neutral gas-emission rate, Qgas, of 1 to 3 x 1028 molecules/s [5-6] and a moderately low dust-to-gas ratio of about 0.7. Assuming a 1/Δ luminosity dependence, the comet's 0.3- to 1.0-keV x-ray luminosity was 3.1, 3.5, and 3.9 x 1015 ergs/s and its L_x/L_opt ratio was ~10-4, typical of the brightest Chandra-detected comets [1-3].  The low resolution ACIS-S pulse height spectra show evidence for the typical cometary x-ray OVII emission 2065.pdf

complex at 0.50 – 0.70 keV [2,3,7], and the normal ACIS-S instrumental background peak at 0.20 – 0.30 keV. Unexpectedly, though, an apparent peak at 0.05 – 0.10 keV that varies consistently with the HRC-I imaging photometry was also found.  The relative ratio of OVII/ OVI emission in the ACISS vs. HRC-I cameras flipped between 31 Oct and 0306 Nov, due to a change in the ion (O7+/O6+) abundance ratio in the solar wind impacting the comet on those days. This in turn likely reflects a change in the source (O7+/O6+) ratio of the solar wind emitted 3 to 7 days prior from the solar corona, a change between a wind dominated by material from a coronal mass ejection or a coronal hole [8] on Oct. 31 and a mostly normal low equatorial solar wind on 03-06 Nov.  Implications: We had employed the HRC-I camera’s larger sensitivity at low x-ray energies in an attempt to detect potentially ubiquitous OVI emission [9], and we appear to have been successful. Detection of OVI emission in the ACIS-S spectra was unexpected, but, if real, has important implications for the possibility of finding OVI emission in archival Chandra comet observations. Without major changes in the solar wind content and the comet’s concomitant x-ray response, though, it is unlikely we would have made a concrete detection of the OVI emission.   Another important finding comes from ISON’s relatively high x-ray luminosity Lx. ISON’s Gas of ~1 to 3 x 1028 mol/sec is the lowest measured yet for an x-ray bright, collisionally thin to SWCX coma, and pushes the lower limits of the  required coma density in current charge exchange models [7]. On the other hand, as ISON was a notably dust poor comet with a very large, extended gas coma [10], the high x-ray luminosity is in line with the hypothesis suggested in [9] that coma dust density anti-correlates with cometary x-ray production.
