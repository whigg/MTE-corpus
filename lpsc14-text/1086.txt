Introduction:  The size-frequency distribution of asteroids [1] shows that the average time between the impacts on the Earth varies from ~15 years for 10meter-diameter asteroids to ~10,000 years for 100meter-sized bodies. These objects pose a real threat to people and their flux on the Earth may be even higher due to a non-equilibrium in the near-Earth asteroid population [2]. The 20-meter sized Chelyabinsk asteroid hit the Earth on 15 February 2013 [2, 3]. Apophis, an asteroid about 300 meters in size [4], threatens to collide with the Earth in the future. Extreme events cause high damage, however, high-probability lowdamage impacts may have a more important contribution to the average damage produced over a long time scale. It is difficult to detect small bodies in due time and assessing the risk is not unreasonable. Understanding risk as the probability of a particular asteroidal impact multiplied by the losses produced by the impact, we try to choose the most dangerous events in the range of asteroid diameters from 10 to 300 m.  The main impact effects in the considered size range are shock waves, seismic waves, thermal radiation and tsunami [5]. We have made numerical simulations of the impacts of stony asteroids over land and calculated shock-induced pressures and velocities as a function of a distance from the impact epicenter. We also estimated seismic and radiation effects and evaluated the probability of tsunami-generating impacts.  Numerical method:  The impacts can produce craters, or surface bursts, or high-altitude aerial bursts [6]. Numerical simulations are applied to all the impact stages: the flight through the atmosphere, formation of a crater, and interaction of ejecta with the air. We used the model, equations, and numerical scheme [7-9]. The motion through the atmosphere simulated in the system of coordinates connected with the body. At the second computational step the interaction of the body or its remnants with the Earth's granite surface were simulated in the Earth frame of reference. For air we used the tables of equation of state and radiation absorption coefficients from [10, 11]. For stony granitic impactors and targets we used ANEOS tables of equation of state [12] obtained with input data [13] and H chondrite absorption coefficients [14]. The numerical simulations were made for the vertical impacts of spherical asteroids with a density of 2.65 g/cm 3 and entry velocities into the atmosphere of 18 km/s.  Effects of shock pressures:  All the impacts produce shock waves which propagate along the Earth surface. Computed shock pressures are shown in Fig. 1.   Fig. 1. Relative pressure behind the shock front P/P0 as a function of a distance from the impact epicenter for the impacts of asteroids with diameters from 20 to 300 m.  The damage depends on blast overpressures P=PP0, where P is the pressure behind the shock and P0 is the normal pressure at the Earth's surface. Brick walls with a thickness of 24-36 cm break up when P>20 kPa and concrete walls of the same thickness are destroyed at P>35 kPa [15].  We define damage efficiency ξ as the ratio of an area on the Earth's surface where the critical overpressure ΔPc is reached to the mass of the projectile. The damage efficiency peaks at the projectile diameter of 50 m for all ΔPc. For ΔPc=35 kPa ξmax=2 m 2/kg and for ΔPc=20 kPa ξmax=4.6 m 2/kg. For ΔPc=12 kPa, when the wind velocity behind the shock is 30 m/s and trees are broken and can be uprooted, ξmax=7.9 m 2/kg. For a 15km-diameter impactor which creates winds about 30 m/s over the entire Earth [16] ξ=0.12 m 2/kg.  Here we define the risk as the product of impact probability on land (0.3 of the total impact probability [1]) times the damaged area. The physical meaning of this quantity is the average area of damage per a unit of time. As shown in Fig. 2 the maximum threat comes from asteroids about 50 m in size which entirely vaporize at altitudes 5-10 km and produce aerial bursts similar to the Tunguska event [17].  50 100 150 200 250 300 Impactor diameter, m 00.1 0.2 0.3 Ris k, k m2 /y ea r35 kPa 20 12 35 J/cm2 90 Fig. 1. Risks associated with the impacts of asteroids of various sizes for three criteria of damaged area by shock pressures: 35, 20 and 12 kPa, and by thermal radiation with 35 and 90 J/cm 2 radiant exposure.  Thermal radiation:  We have estimated radiation effects assuming that the fireball radiates as a point explosion at an altitude where the asteroid releases most of its energy and that the thermal partition is equal to 0.2 if the asteroid entirely vaporize in the atmosphere and to 0.1 for crater-forming impacts (these values are about two times smaller than for nuclear explosions [15]). We also assumed a very clear atmosphere with an attenuation coefficient of 0.05 km -1 . The thermally damaged areas are determined as areas with radiant exposures above 35 J/cm 2 (ignition of deciduous leaves) and 90 J/cm 2 (ignition of pine needles) [15]. The calculated risks are shown in Fig. 2. The risk from thermal radiation also peaks at the projectile diameters of 40-50 m. Seismic waves:  We have estimated seismic magnitudes produced by the impacts using a method [18] for the aerial busts, and a formula from [19] when the asteroid fragments strike the surface. The estimated magnitudes vary from 4.7 for the impact of the 40-mdiameter asteroid to 6.7 for the asteroid diameter of 300 m. Following [20], we calculated the distances of strong seismic intensity (moderate damage to poorly designed buildings) and found that they are smaller than the distances of damage by shock pressures.  Tsunami:  Tsunami generated by the impacts of asteroids or comets are widely recognized as a potential hazard [21]. Our results of impact simulations show that the 100-m-diameter asteroid entering the atmosphere vertically is entirely vaporized at an altitude of about 2 km. The asteroids of this size do not produce craters and tsunamis. Among 200-m-sized asteroids only about 75% can produce craters and tsunami because the rest fall at oblique angles and vaporize in the atmosphere [6]. The average time between the impacts of 200-m-sized tsunami-generated asteroids on the ocean is about 100000 years (the probability is equal to the total probability [1] times 75% and times 0.7 - the relative area of the ocean) . The average time between 300-m-sized impacts on the ocean is about 350000 years. The common natural tsunamis happen much more frequently. Our estimated times are in contradiction with a prediction of [21] that a tsunami-generating impact occur about once every 6000 years. Reducing accordingly the estimates of risk [21] we can obtain that, on average, about 10 people will be affected annually by the impact-tsunami. Assuming that the average population density is 50 people per km 2 and that within the area of shock pressure 12 kPa and radiant exposure 35 J/cm 2 20% of people are killed as a result of blast and heat effects, we obtain that the average death-rate from the most effective impacts on land is 3 people per year, about three times lower than the effect from impact tsunamis.  Conclusions:  Among vertical impacts asteroids about 50 m in size turn to be most efficient and dangerous from the view point of damage caused by the shock wave and thermal radiation. Larger (200-300 m) impacts are less effective, and the main effect of the larger impacts is possibly tsunami, not pressure and radiation..
