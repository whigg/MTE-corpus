Introduction: It is well known that the radiance measured by the moon mineralogy mapper (M3) [1] has been severely distorted by the sensor temperature [2]. A correction based on an area observered under six different sensor temperature conditions has been presented in [2]. Simultaneously, we discovered systematic deviations between normalised reflectance values of the same area derived from images acquired at different phase angles [3]. Due to the high correlation between the phase angle and the sensor temperature, these effects are closely related. In this work, we present a phase angle based correction approach. Unlike the correction in [2], it relaxes the requirement of all images showing the same surface area. The only requirement is that one pixelsynchroneous image at a reference phase angle is available with other images at arbitrary phase angles. Notably, the phase angle and the sensor temperature may be exchanged because they are highly correlated. We give a phase angle based description due to the development history of our framework. Normalization: At first, we present the correction model, followed by a description of the fitness function that is minimised. Finally, the optimisation details are explained. Model: Since the sensor is based on semiconductors, we assume a multiplicative (gain) and an additive (offset) component: E(α) = g(Δα) Eobs + c(Δα). The real and observed radiances are denoted by E and Eobs, respectively. The functions g(Δα) and c(Δα) represent a temperature/phase angle dependent gain compensation and a temperature/phase angle dependent dark current compensation. Both components are assument to be linear in the phase angle change  Δα=α–α0, i.e. g(Δα) = g1Δα + g0 and c(Δα) = c1Δα + c0. The real and the reference phase angle are denoted by α and α0, respectively. We set α0 = 30° according to the standard geometry of spectral data [4]. Each wavelength is corrected by a different set of coefficients, respectively. Fitness function:  The fitness function consists of three components F = FCR + μ1FI + μ2Fref with two weighting factors μ1 and μ2. The first component FCR measures  the deviation of the continuumremoved (CR) reflectance acquired at any phase angle α from the CR reflectance acquired at α0 and thus emphasises the absorption features:                                                        The squared error is computed for all npix pixels and all nchan senson channels. Consequently, the radiance is photometrically normalised using fnorm and then the CR spectrum is computed by fCR. Since the ideal value of α0 is rarely matched, we allow for a deviation of ±2° and thus refer to the reference phase angle as αref. The second component of the fitness function constrains the solution to identity for small deviations of the phase angle, i.e. if the phase angle is close to the reference phase angle, we expect the radiance to be as similar as possible to the observed radiance:                                         . Since the first components do not cover the absolute reflectance due to the CR spectra, and the second component does not take into account the reference measFigure 1: Selected regions. From all regions with images at phase angles 30°±2° we selected 25 regions all over the lunar surface. The regions marked in green are used for the optimisation. The regions marked in red were discarded due to lack of informatien, e.g. single image observations or narrow phase angle ranges. 2562.pdf

urements, we defined the third component                                            . Optimization strategy: To normalise the spectral data, we apply the full Hapke model [5], i.e. we divide the radiance by the solar irradiance and fit the singlescattering albedo w of the Hapke model. The remaining parameters are taken from [6]. Thus, the fitness function is highly nonlinear and w depends on the correction. Furthermore, the standard continuum removal approach,  i.e. division by the convex hull [7], introduces another nonlinearity. To linearise the fitness function we propose an interative optimisation. At first, the Hapke model is fit to the current corrected reflectance. Then, the coefficients are updated. This sequential normalisation and coefficient update is repeated until either the fitness function or the coefficients do not change any more. Additionally, we define a different CR approach. Instead of dividing by the convex hull, we subtract a second order polynomial that fitted to the reflectance data. Similar to the division by the convex hull, this approach eliminates the absolute reflectance and emphasises the absorption bands. Consequently, the fitness function is linear in the channel coefficients and the unique set of new coefficients at each iteration can be determined using linear least squares techniques. Dataset:  From our global M3 mosaic we selected 25 regions with images at phase angles of 30°±2° as shown in Fig. 1. The regions marked in red were discarded since the phase angle range was too narrow. To avoid the influence of the surface topography, we selected pixels with surface slopes less than 2°. Results: The channelwise root-mean-squared difference (RMSE) between the CR-spectra of each pixel and its corresponding reference CR spectrum is shown in Fig. 2. Notably, we computed the RMSE using continuum removal based on the convex hull. Thus, the parabolic fit linearisation reduces the RMSE successfully. According to Fig. 3, the band depth of the ferrous absorption trough near 1000 nm significantly depends on the correction. Consequently, a geological interpretation of the spectra should be avoided without proper correction for sensor temperature/phase angle. Conclusion:  We have presented a method to compensate the spectral distortion with respect to the CR spectrum. The presented method efficiently linearises the highly nonlinear optimisation problem and produces plausible results. It does not require all data to overlap at the same region and relies on the existence of data acquired at a reference phase angle/detectore temperature. Finally, we have shown the strong influence of the distortion due to sensor temperature/phase angle on the derived absorption band depth. References: [1] Pieters et al.
