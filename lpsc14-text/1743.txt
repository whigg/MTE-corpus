Introduction. Nature of the phase Q is one of the unsolved problems of cosmochemistry. This phase contains the main fraction of trapped (primordial planetary) heavy noble gases (Ar, Kr and Xe) in meteorites and likely consists of carbonaceous material [1]. In order to solve the problem of Q origin investigations of different fractions of the meteoritic materials, including chondrules, is being carried out (e.g., [2]). Usually noble gases and nitrogen are analysed in chondrules using a laser extraction technique that allows investigating individual chondrules and their rims (e.g., [2, 3]). However this method does not allow to investigate the kinetics release of these gases. In the present study we analysed concentrations and isotopic compositions of C, N and Ar along with concentrations of cosmogenic 21Ne released during stepped combustion of the small chondrules fraction  separated from the Saratov meteorite. Experimental. The small chondrules (≤0.28 mm) have been separated by means of hand picking after a gentle crushing of the bulk Saratov sample. We tried to pick up chondrules mostly with spherical shape which is an indicator of a rapid crystallisation from the precursor material. The chondrules were basically black in color. Two fractions of the chondrules have been used for the analyses: initial (designated as Chond A) and after treatment with HNO3 (Chond B). The HNO3 treatment has been conducted at 80 oC (6h), as a result of which the initial chondrules lost 20% by weight and their color became gray. Concentrations and isotopic compositions of С, N and Ar as well as concentration of cosmogenic 21Ne in the samples Chond A (7.18mg), Chond B (2.60mg) and in the Saratov bulk (12.18mg) were analysed on the Finesse machine [4] by stepped combustion in the temperature range from 300 to 1400oС with 1000 increment. The results of the analyses are shown in the Table and Figure 1. The data are blank corrected. Results and discussion. The noble gas concentrations in the samples analysed are similar to those published by other investigator, except for the nitrogen concentration which is significantly higher than was determined in [6] (see Table). HNO3 treatment changed the element concentrations of the gases analysed differently (Table). In particular nitrogen concentration increased by a factor of 2 due to contamination by nitric acid. For that reason the nitrogen release kinetics is not considered for the Chond B. Concentration of cosmogenic 21Ne in Chond B remained almost the same as in its parent material while concentration of 40Ar and carbon increased by 10-25% and 36Ar - decreased almost by a factor of 2.2 (Table). The increase of the 40Ar concentration is probably a result of dissolving of the phases depleted with potassium that follows from the almost identical release kinetics of 40Ar from Chond А and Chond B (Fig. 1а). The significant decreasing of 36Ar in Chond B compared to Chond A is accompanied by a substantial difference in its release kinetics (Fig. 1в). As can be seen, if before the HNO3 treatment about 60% of 36Ar is released below 900oС then after the treatment - only about 16%. The significant increase of yield of 36A from Chond B above 900oС occurs along with increasing of 40Ar yield (Fig. 1а, в). This probably is due to releasing of 36Ar and 40Ar at Т≥900oС mostly from silicate minerals of the chondrules. The 36Ar amounts released from Chond А and Chond B at T> 900oС are similar within 25% (2.63e-8 cm3/g and 2.02e-8 cm3/g correspondingly). Therefore, the decreasing of the total 36Ar in Chond B by a factor of 2.2 is probably due to oxidation of the argon carriers located within the chondrule rims. These phases could be organics and/or sulphides. The fraction of trapped 36Ar in the rims of the initial chondrules is 58%. It is worth noting that the release kinetics of carbon from Chond А and particularly from Chond B is significantly different from that for 36Ar (Fig. 1с, b). This suggests that most of carbon in the chondrules is not related to 36Ar. More than 85% of nitrogen and carbon are released from both chondrules samples below 900oС. This nitrogen seems to be associated with the organic matter located in the chondrule rims, while carbon - with both the organics and nanocrystalline graphite [8]. Only the cumulative release of cosmogenic 21Ne (Fig. 1d) corresponds to the process of a single modal release. After HNO3 treatment the 21Ne release temperature is significantly reduced. Since 40Ar does not show similar decrease in the release temperature (Fig 1a), it is likely that the HNO3 treatment resulted in some transformation of the 21Ne carrier(s). In the following discussion we assume that the cosmogenic Ne in the chondrules has been entirely formed within silicate minerals. This allows to estimate the maximum amount of cosmogenic 15N which is released at  Т≥900oС. For that we used the production rate ratio of 15N to 21Ne to be equal to 4.5 [9]. The corrected for cosmogenic 15N the δ15N value for the nitrogen released from Chond A at Т≥900oС is -110‰. This value is comparable with the upper limit for δ15N in Q determined in [10] and significantly less than -15‰ estimated for Q in [11]. In the case of chondrules the estimated δ15N=-110‰ can be associated with phase Q and/or nanodiamonds. The N/C ratio in the gas released at Т≥900oС from Chond A is 0.012, which corresponds to nanodiamonds [12], while the 36Ar/C ratio is significantly higher than is observed for the HL component (2.6e-7at/at verses 5.4e-9at/at [13]). From the obtained results, it is not possible to determine which fraction of the nitrogen is associated with nanodiamonds and which - with Q. Conclusions. Release kinetics of the trapped 36Ar from the small chondrules of the Saratov meteorite during stepped combustion is different from those for C and N. Most of C and N, located in the chondrule  rims, seem to be not associated with Q. More than a half (58%) of the trapped 36Ar is located in the chondrule rims and comes probably from Q. The rest of the trapped 36Ar as well as the nitrogen with δ15N=110‰ obviously are released from silicates and can be related to Q and/or nanodiamonds. References: [1] Lewis R.S. et al.
