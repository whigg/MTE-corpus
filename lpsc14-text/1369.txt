It has abundant gravel (small pebbles of various shapes, sizes and color) with occasional float rocks and conglomerates, which appears to comprise the bedrock in this region [2]. Textural and compositional analyses using ChemCam Remote Micro Imager (RMI) and Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) have been performed on 20 massive (non layered) float rocks in the hummocky plain initially at Bradbury rise (sol13-45) [3] then later (from sol 336 to 360) the so called post-Shaler unit.  Methodology: ChemCam offers the first opportunity to assess mineralogical diversity at grain-size scales (∼100µm) and, from this, lithological diversity. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) allows to classify spectra i.e. to assess the lateral heterogeneity between different points within a raster on a given rock target as well as chemical variation with depth within a shot sequence at a single location point. ICA allows then comparing different rock targets as well as different points in a given target [4]. Quantification of key element ratio (Al/Si and (Fe+Mg)/Si) from the spectral characteristics of the target is done by univariate analysis which derives quantitative estimates of composition from the peak height of well-chosen LIBS lines and a training dataset to build calibration curves [5,6]. This data set includes four of the ChemCam Calibration Targets (CCCTs) on board Curiosity, which are glass targets (3 mafic and 1 felsic) [7].  Rock morphology and texture: The float rocks are heterogeneous, grade in color from dark grey to light tones with many faceted rocks due to wind erosion. From morphology, color, grain size, and patina at least 5 different groups of rocks have been identified (Fig.1) : (1) porphyritic class with light-toned, bladed and polygonal crystals 1-15mm in length which look like euhedral feldspar phenocryst embedded in a darker, fine-grained, grey matrix (Fig.1a); (2) dark coarse- grained class with well visible (mm size) dark and light toned grains (Fig.1b): (3) dark aphanitic fine-grained (barely visible grains less than 300 µm (Fig.1c); (4) dark obsidian-like material with shiny texture, conchoidal fracture and no visible grains at any scale (Fig.1d); (5) whitish light-toned rocks either with pumice like texture (rocks are mottled, pitted with light tan patina blades showing void and pendants Fig.1e) or with rough granular texture (Fig.1f). Ventifact (class 1,2,3 and 4) is common characteristic in dark toned basaltic fragments. Class 5 corresponding to felsic lithology has smoother morphology.  Figure 1: Rocks texture from mast Cam and RMI: a porphyritic; b) coarse-grained mafic (Mara); c) fine-grained mafic (Coronation); d) dark obsidian  (Pisolet); e) white pumice (Stark); f) light-toned rocks (Angmaat). Chemical composition and mineralogical inference: Within the 163 LIBS points on the 20 targets described above, we excluded H-bearing spectra encountered in 7 targets from class 2 and 3 thus classified as altered basalts. Quantification of the remaining LIBS average spectra from each of the 13 anhydrous rocks target have been plotted in Al/Si vs. (Fe+Mg)/Si (mole%) diagram (Fig.2) where felsic minerals (quartz, plagioclase solid solution) plot on the Y-axis whilst mafic one (HCP, LCP, olivine, oxides) plot on the X-axis. Basaltic coarse-grained targets of class 2 define 2 mixing line (green dashed line) between felsic and mafic minerals grains: Mara trend  and post-Shaler trend including  Black-Trout, Tête Jaune, La Reine, Ashuamipi. Basaltic aphanitic mineral mixture of class3 (Coronation,Mallard-Lake and Bull_Arm) plot in the middle of the basaltic mixing line. Dark obsidian rocks of class 4 (Gunflint, Pisolet) plot in the field (red circle) of the 3 mafic glassy targets CCCTs. Finally class 5 (Stark, Angmaat and Chakonipau) define a very distinctive felsic field (blue ellipse) close to the Y-axis including the Macusanite CCCTs a rhyolitic glass from Peru [8].      1369.pdf

Figure.2 Al/Si vs. (Fe + Mg)/Si diagram from Unvariate data processing. Note the 2 different mixing lines (andesine-LCP and oligoclase-HCP) for class 2 coarse-grained basalts ICA Sodium vs. Potassium diagram (Fig.3) shows two regions: (i) the Na-rich side includes Bradbury data and post-Shaler dark basaltic float rocks from class 2 and 3, which show a relative high Na content with respect to K but with a large variability; (ii) the K-rich side is represented by the Rocknest rocks [9]. The post-Shaler glassy targets whether basaltic (class 4) or felsic (class 5) plot in this K-rich domain.    Figure 3: Sodium vs. potassium showing two domains: Narich post-Shaler and Bradbury float rock of class 2 and 3; the K-rich domain including mafic and felsic rocks from post_Shaler unit (class 4 and 5). Red symbols represent postShaler rocks: green symbols represent Bradbury rocks; blue diamond is the macusanite Cal target. Mixing line between mafic and felsic alkali-rich end-member are shown for different rock targets.  Discussion and Conclusions  Porphyritic (class 1) have not been analyzed before sol 360 (the threshold for MSL-LPSC abstract) but sol 365 (Robin Hood). Dark coarse-grained (class 2) are defined by andesine needle, pigeonite phenocrysts within a fine-grained matrix in Bradbury rise [3] and oligoclase + Ti-augite in post-Shaler unit. Fine-grained dark rock such as Coronation (class 3) has a grain size sufficiently small that the sum of individual spectra within a single observation point is a close approximation to the bulk composition. With respect to Al/Si and Mg/Fe ratio those rocks are closed to the evolved (low Mg/Fe) alkali-rich rocks Jake Matijevic45 [3,10]. The mafic obsidian (class 4) analyzed in post-Shaler unit, are described for the first time at Gale. These glasses are enriched in incompatible elements (K, Ti, Ba, Rb) compared to class 1,2 and 3. Finally the felsic compositions of class 5 initially described at Bradbury rise (Stark pumice) [3] is confirmed in Post Shaler unit (Angmmat and Chakonipau white rock targets). Those rocks contain Si, Al, Na and K as major element, high Ba content [5]. They have similar Al/Si ratio compared to the Macusanite rhyolitic glass. Whitish rocks from class 5 would be the first felsic alkali-rich volcanic rocks analyzed in situ so far on Mars.  The abundance of feldspar-rich composition is thus the most striking magmatic features encountered so far at Gale crater. Coarse-grained soils that characterized the hummocky plains are dominated by felsic-rich mineralogy [11] that contrast with fine-grained soils at Rocknest area similar to the average mafic soil component on Mars [12]. Then major and trace element (i.e., Ba and Rb, [5]) clearly point to the existence of feldspars with a significant K-rich orthoclase component as a principal mineral in magmatic rocks studied by ChemCam in hummocky plain. Such feldspars were described recently for the first time in two SNC meteorites, the Noachian breccia NWA 7034 and 7533 [13, 14]. Finally felsic rocks with rhyolitic composition are analyzed for the first time in post-Shaler unit. These results provide further evidence for the possibility of significant to high degree of differentiation of a primary mantle-derived magma before emplacement at the surface to reach saturation in alkali feldspar. Overall, the ChemCam in situ data from Gale provide unprecedented insights into the diversity of igneous rocks at the surface of Mars. From these initial MSL data it appears likely that alkaline feldspar-bearing rocks are present as ejecta and alluvial fan detritus in the Gale landing site, potentially representative of material from the region surrounding Gale [3]. The extent of the source region of these rocks will have to be determined from orbit and eventual connection with Medusae Fossae Formation materials to be tested [15] as well as large regions of feldspar dominated lithology in the rim [16] and the floor [17] of large craters from the southern highland.
