These lakes couldhave implications for GCMs on Titan and provide topographic constraints. The colloquially named "blandlands" of Titan may only be bland because of spatialsampling at which they were previously viewed. Weshow several lake candidates of various morphologies inVIMS with some RADAR coverage. The presence oflakes in both temperate zones on Titan support a globalliquid transport and imply possibly global populationsof smaller, unresolved liquid bodies. We use a singlescattering approximation model to correct the 2, 2.7, 2.8,and 5 micron methane windows to test each lacustrinecandidate for surface albedo and atmospheric illumination via specular reflection.IntroductionThe largest moon of Saturn is home to many bodies ofstanding surface liquids and an active liquid exchangecycle between the atmosphere and ground. These lakesand precipitation systems govern a portion of Titan'sglobal circulation model around their relative latitudes.Although the majority of the lakes on Titan are locatedat and around its north pole, lakes have been identifiedin the southern temperate latitudes [1]. Cloud systemscover this moon and occasionally rain, leaving temporaryalbedo changes as proof [2, 3]. The equatorial region isdominated by deserts filled with longitudinal dunes andhills [4].The presence of lakes and dry lakebeds at most latitudes would be supportive of liquid migration, either byevaporation and precipitation or infiltration and percolation, a local presence of rain or percolation for steadystate lakes, or major long term climate changes. Aharonson et al. [5] suggests the migration of liquids over Milankovitch timescales from the south to the north. Cornet et al. [6] suggests percolation as a lake filling mechanism with the possibility of an underground reservoir.We present several lake candidates to suggest a migrationof liquid from the south to the north through the latitudesrather than bulk movement from pole to pole.1.27  m2  mµ2.8  m  µ1.57  m    µ2.7  m  µ5  mµ    µ  o  o180  E   o180  Eo60  N  o180  E  o140  E   o140  E  o140  E  o140  Eo60  N  o180  Eo30  N  o140  Eo60  N  o180  Eo30  N60  No60  No60  No140  E  oo30  No30  No30  N o30  N180  EFigure 1: The images here show some of Titan's methaneIR windows from T69 of the North Dilmun area.

The features pointed to by eacharrow are dark relative to their respective surroundingsand yield surface albedo values of 0.016 and 0.018 respectively, for a 5 micron correction. The bright whitefeatures, like those just south of the 60◦ latitude line, areclouds alluding to the possibility of localized rainfall.Lake CandidatesWe surveyed the northern temperate latitudes of Titan insearch of plausible lacustrine candidates (e.g., Figure 1).Candidates were chosen based on having plausible lacustrine morphology, including distinct, lobate or semilobate boundaries along with low relative surface brightness, low absolute (where applicable) or relative surfacealbedos, and having presence in the majority of wave2572.pdf

2lengths where Titan's surface is distinguishable. Manyof the candidates are very small or narrow as viewedby VIMS, so morphological arguments are not strongenough to be their own discussion point. We would simply put forth that these regions of interest could plausibly be lacustrine in nature. Most lake candidates are alsovery small in the resolution leading to a mixing of surficial substrates within a single pixel causing the albedo tobe somewhat difficult to measure.Window CorrectionWe use largely the same method as in Vixie et al. [1] butapplied to more wavelength windows and locking morevariables. We now consider the 2, 2.7, 2.8, and 5 micron wavelength windows for correction and empiricallysolve for the surface albedo in each case. We mask regions we assume to have the same albedo and bin theminto 2◦ bins separated by regions we label as bright, similar to the equatorial bright region from Barnes et al.[7], lake, which comprises all dark regions of previously identified lakes and seas, and dune, representingthe equatorial dark brown dune fields [7]. The opacity,τ , is now fixed between our best fit value and the appropriate value from Barnes et al. [8]. The atmosphericsingle-scattering albedo, ω˜, is fixed at a best fit value lessthan 1. In each of these cases, the best fit is not wellquantified as the IF is a function of at least incidence,emission, and phase but can only be plotted in three dimensions.ConclusionThe "bland" northern temperate latitudes on Titan mayplausibly host several lakes or hold evidence of pastlakes. A lacustrine presence in the southern mid-latitudes[1] across to the northern temperate regions may be indicative of a large scale liquid migration across Titan or,more simply, be evidence of precipitation and/or percolation locally in each area. The locations of the lakecandidates suggest no longitudinal dependence on liquid, however. The low spatial sampling along much ofthe temperate latitudes inhibits a more in depth study ofthe regions of interest there, but the current data givesenough to identify potential targets for future flybys.The first case of large scale migration would allowfor the majority of the liquid to move between the southand north poles but not all at once. Lakebeds at various temperate latitudes imply liquid may stop over alongthe way, either by precipitation and subsequent evaporation or by infiltration and percolation. Having lakes atmultiple latitudes do not necessarily imply a migrationof liquid occurred, but is supportive of such a hypothesis. The second case holds no requirement of migrationbut instead has restrictions on local topography. Any region we find to have liquid within a feature implies atopographic low to keep the liquid there. Previously, wehave seen liquid darkening a surface which is not necessarily a low and evaporating shortly thereafter [2, 3, 9].However, if a liquid feature proves to be consistent overmultiple flybys, we can constrain, even if very locally,the topography of that area.AcknowledgmentsThe work done here was made possible by NASA and theVIMS team.
