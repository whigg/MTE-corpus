These lakes could have implications for GCMs on Titan and provide topographic constraints. The colloquially named "blandlands" of Titan may only be bland because of spatial sampling at which they were previously viewed. We show several lake candidates of various morphologies in VIMS with some RADAR coverage. The presence of lakes in both temperate zones on Titan support a global liquid transport and imply possibly global populations of smaller, unresolved liquid bodies. We use a singlescattering approximation model to correct the 2, 2.7, 2.8, and 5 micron methane windows to test each lacustrine candidate for surface albedo and atmospheric illumination via specular reflection. Introduction The largest moon of Saturn is home to many bodies of standing surface liquids and an active liquid exchange cycle between the atmosphere and ground. These lakes and precipitation systems govern a portion of Titan's global circulation model around their relative latitudes. Although the majority of the lakes on Titan are located at and around its north pole, lakes have been identified in the southern temperate latitudes [1]. Cloud systems cover this moon and occasionally rain, leaving temporary albedo changes as proof [2, 3]. The equatorial region is dominated by deserts filled with longitudinal dunes and hills [4]. The presence of lakes and dry lakebeds at most latitudes would be supportive of liquid migration, either by evaporation and precipitation or infiltration and percolation, a local presence of rain or percolation for steady state lakes, or major long term climate changes. Aharonson et al. [5] suggests the migration of liquids over Milankovitch timescales from the south to the north. Cornet et al. [6] suggests percolation as a lake filling mechanism with the possibility of an underground reservoir. We present several lake candidates to suggest a migration of liquid from the south to the north through the latitudes rather than bulk movement from pole to pole. 1.27  m 2  mµ 2.8  m  µ 1.57  m    µ 2.7  m  µ 5  mµ    µ  o  o180  E   o180  E o60  N  o180  E  o140  E   o140  E  o140  E  o140  E o60  N  o180  E o30  N  o140  E o60  N  o180  E o30  N 60  No60  No 60  No 140  E  o o30  No30  N o30  N o30  N 180  E Figure 1: The images here show some of Titan's methane IR windows from T69 of the North Dilmun area. The northern black arrow here points to a dark region of interest we have labeled as a lake candidate. The southernmost black arrow points to a feature which bears possible lacustrine morphology. The features pointed to by each arrow are dark relative to their respective surroundings and yield surface albedo values of 0.016 and 0.018 respectively, for a 5 micron correction. The bright white features, like those just south of the 60◦ latitude line, are clouds alluding to the possibility of localized rainfall. Lake Candidates We surveyed the northern temperate latitudes of Titan in search of plausible lacustrine candidates (e.g., Figure 1). Candidates were chosen based on having plausible lacustrine morphology, including distinct, lobate or semilobate boundaries along with low relative surface brightness, low absolute (where applicable) or relative surface albedos, and having presence in the majority of wave  2lengths where Titan's surface is distinguishable. Many of the candidates are very small or narrow as viewed by VIMS, so morphological arguments are not strong enough to be their own discussion point. We would simply put forth that these regions of interest could plausibly be lacustrine in nature. Most lake candidates are also very small in the resolution leading to a mixing of surficial substrates within a single pixel causing the albedo to be somewhat difficult to measure. Window Correction We use largely the same method as in Vixie et al. [1] but applied to more wavelength windows and locking more variables. We now consider the 2, 2.7, 2.8, and 5 micron wavelength windows for correction and empirically solve for the surface albedo in each case. We mask regions we assume to have the same albedo and bin them into 2◦ bins separated by regions we label as bright, similar to the equatorial bright region from Barnes et al. [7], lake, which comprises all dark regions of previously identified lakes and seas, and dune, representing the equatorial dark brown dune fields [7]. The opacity, τ , is now fixed between our best fit value and the appropriate value from Barnes et al. [8]. The atmospheric single-scattering albedo, ω̃, is fixed at a best fit value less than 1. In each of these cases, the best fit is not well quantified as the IF is a function of at least incidence, emission, and phase but can only be plotted in three dimensions. Conclusion The "bland" northern temperate latitudes on Titan may plausibly host several lakes or hold evidence of past lakes. A lacustrine presence in the southern mid-latitudes [1] across to the northern temperate regions may be indicative of a large scale liquid migration across Titan or, more simply, be evidence of precipitation and/or percolation locally in each area. The locations of the lake candidates suggest no longitudinal dependence on liquid, however. The low spatial sampling along much of the temperate latitudes inhibits a more in depth study of the regions of interest there, but the current data gives enough to identify potential targets for future flybys. The first case of large scale migration would allow for the majority of the liquid to move between the south and north poles but not all at once. Lakebeds at various temperate latitudes imply liquid may stop over along the way, either by precipitation and subsequent evaporation or by infiltration and percolation. Having lakes at multiple latitudes do not necessarily imply a migration of liquid occurred, but is supportive of such a hypothesis. The second case holds no requirement of migration but instead has restrictions on local topography. Any region we find to have liquid within a feature implies a topographic low to keep the liquid there. Previously, we have seen liquid darkening a surface which is not necessarily a low and evaporating shortly thereafter [2, 3, 9]. However, if a liquid feature proves to be consistent over multiple flybys, we can constrain, even if very locally, the topography of that area.
