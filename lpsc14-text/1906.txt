PHASE EQUILIBRIUM EXPERIMENTS ON ANALOGUE LAVAS FROM THE NORTHERN VOLCANIC PLAINS OF MERCURY: IMPLICATIONS FOR THE MINERALOGY OF THE MERCURIAN MANTLE.  K. E. Vander Kaaden, F. M. McCubbin, and A. S. Bell. Institute of Meteoritics, 1 University of New Mexico, MSC03-2050, Albuquerque, NM 87131, (kvander@unm.edu).   Introduction: With the recent estimates of Mercury's surface composition from the X-ray spectrometer and Gamma ray spectrometer onboard the Mercury Surface, Space Environment, Geochemistry and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft, we now have our first opportunity to directly investigate the compositions of lavas from the planet Mercury and indirectly investigate the chemical make-up of Mercury's interior [1-3]. Recent compositional information from Mercury's surface indicate high amounts of S (up to 4 wt%) and relatively low amounts of FeO (up to 4 wt%) [1-3], consistent with magmatism occurring under highly reducing conditions [i.e. 7.3 to 2.6 log10 units below the ironwustite buffer] [4-6]. One particular region of interest on Mercury for igneous petrologists is the Northern Volcanic Plains (NVP).  The Northern Volcanic Plains are smooth plains of suspected volcanic origin that cover more than 6% of the surface area of Mercury [7]. Spanning a 4.7 x 106 km2 region of Mercury, this homogeneous unit in both XRS [3] and color data [8] is less cratered than its surroundings and believed to be the product of flood volcanism [7]. On Earth, flood volcanism is generally produced by partial melting of mantle material that is erupted onto the surface of our planet. The lack of an impact basin near the Northern Volcanic Plains region favors a volcanic origin of these lavas. Since the Northern Volcanic Plains region is similar to flood basalts and komatiites on Earth, shown by the Mg/Si, Al/Si, and Ca/Si ratios [3], the Northern Volcanic Plains lavas are the most likely example of primary lavas that can be compositionally assessed from orbit and therefore represent the best candidate for experimental study. The goal of our present study is to define the phase equilibria associated with the NVP lava and discuss possible melting scenarios that could produce these lavas.   Methods:  Experimental. All experiments were conducted in the Institute of Meteoritics (IOM) at the University of New Mexico (UNM). One atmosphere experiments were performed using a vertical-tube DelTech quenching furnace. Experiments in the pressure range of 0.5-1 GPa were run using a Depths of the Earth Quickpress™ non-end loaded piston cylinder (PC). A Walker style multi-anvil device (MA) was used for pressures from 3-5 GPa. The starting material for the Northern Volcanic Plains composition (Table 1) was a sulfur and alkali-free mix of powdered reagents. This mix was designed using XRS data from the MESSENGER mission [1, 3]. Sulfur, potassium, and sodium were left out of the mix for simplicity. We have also used a higher FeO content than reported in order to assess the maximum FeO contents one should expect in the NVP minerals. For 1-bar experiments, the starting material was placed on a rhenium wire loop hung from a platinum wire. Each experiment was heated to a superliquidus temperature, held for 1 hour, then dropped to a crystallization temperature and held for two hours before being drop-quenched into water. For all other experiments, the starting material was packed into Mo0 capsules. Salt-pyrex cells were used for PC experiments, whereas ceramacast octahedron acted as the pressure medium in MA experiments. The samples were pressurized and rapidly heated at 200-300 °C per minute to the crystallization temperature. The experiments were held at the elevated P-T conditions for ~2 hours. The samples were quenched by shutting off the power to the furnace. The average rate of cooling was approximately 270 °C/s.  Analytical. Electron probe microanalyses were conducted on all experimental run products with the JEOL JXA 8200 housed at the IOM at UNM. These analyses employed an accelerating voltage of 15 kV and beam current of 20 nA. A broad beam (10-20 µm) was used for glass analyses, whereas a focused beam (1-10 µm) was used for individual mineral phases. Micro-FTIR on select experiments was conducted to ensure that H2O abundances in the experiments were low (~1.4 to ~310 ppm).  Table 1. S and Alkali-Free Composition of NVP.

This dataset extends into the core-mantle boundary region of Mercury as proposed by [9]. Orthopyroxene (enstatite) is the liquidus phase for this melt at 1-bar. From 0.5 GPa until ~3.2 GPa orthopyroxene and silica are the liquidus phases. Above this pressure, pyropicgarnet replaces OPX in the phase assemblage. Notably, 1906.pdf

the phase assemblage did not change when a superliquidus step was included.  Discussion: Given the results of the phase equilibria study, we expect the NVP composition likely underwent fractional crystallization, otherwise it indicates a shallow mantle source region dominated by enstatite and silica or a deep mantle source region dominated by pyropic garnet and silica, both of which seem implausible. Olivine has not been found in any of the phase equilibria experiments conducted to date.   Figure1. Experimentally determined phase equilibria of the Northern Volcanic Plains composition. Orthopyroxene and silica are the liquidus phases up to ~3.2 GPa. At pressures greater than ~3.2 GPa pyropic garnet and silica are the liquidus phases. In order to discuss the mantle of Mercury using these experimental results, it may be helpful to look at possible terrestrial analogues for the NVP region. Figure 2 includes terrestrial flood basalts and the volume of magma they have produced in comparison to the NVP. The terrestrial analogs produced high volumes of tholeiitic melt, usually by high degrees of partial melting from shallow depths (2-4 GPa). The NVP, in comparison, produced high volumes of calc-alkaline-like melts presumably by high degrees of partial melting within the mantle of Mercury (up to 4 GPa). If this NVP composition is a primary melt, it would require very shallow depths of melting (0.5 GPa or less), and if it is a highly fractionated melt, than the original melt volume would be even greater.  We have developed two melting scenarios for the NVP composition. Either shallow melting coupled with minor degrees of fractional crystallization occurred, leaving orthopyroxene in the mantle and a Si-rich source region; or, high degrees of fractional crystallization left olivine and orthopyroxene as residual phases in the mantle. Although both models assume large degrees of partial melting, the latter would require a substantial amount of olivine and/or pyroxene remain at the base of the NVP flow or within the mercurian crust, which could have produced a gravitational anomaly in the NVP region. Alternatively, the NVP composition we have investigated may be inappropriate for understanding the mineralogy of the mercurian interior. Recent results from [10] indicate up to 5 wt% Na in the NVP region. Therefore, it may be possible to get olivine on the liquidus at lower pressures. If the NVP was produced by high degrees of partial melting, this large amount of Na would require a Na-bearing mineral in the source region (ex. plagioclase, jadeite, nepheline). Based on these newly reported numbers and CIPW norm calculations, if there is more than 6% Na2O in the NVP lavas, we would expect an olivine-dominate mantle source for the NVP, similar to what we see in Earth's mantle. Therefore, the NVP source region would consist mainly of plagioclase, olivine, and orthopyroxene and produce Si-understaturated melts.   Figure 2. Comparison of melt volumes produced by the NVP region on Mercury and terrestrial flood basalts.   On the other hand, if there is actually less than 6% Na2O in the NVP lavas, we would expect the amount of orthopyroxene in the source to increase inversely with the amount of Na, with higher Na favoring olivine in the source and lower Na favoring elevated SiO2 in the source. In order to attempt to reconcile these discrepancies, we are currently conducting phase equilibrium experiments on a more realistic NVP composition which includes less FeO and has S, K2O, and Na2O included. This new NVP composition will allow us to explore the effect of these four components on the mineralogy for the NVP lavas and possibly the NVP source region within the mercurian interior.
