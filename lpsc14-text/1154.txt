Introduction:  Erosion by flowing lava was suggested to be an important process for the formation of some lava channels on the Earth as well as on Mars [1, 2]. Such erosion would have involved some combination of thermal erosion (i.e., melting of the substrate) and mechanical erosion (i.e., physical removal of the substrate without melting). Regardless of the mechanism, erosion by lava is more likely to play a role for high-temperature, low-viscosity lavas, which are likely to flow turbulently. Athabasca Valles is a young 300km-long outflow channel system located in northcentral Elysium Planitia, Mars. From there, the lava empties into the plains, flowing out to 1400 km from its source. Jaeger et al. [3, 4] investigated the emplacement of the thin flow that drapes the Athabasca channel system. This flow issued simultaneously from a series of vents located along a nearby fissure. Hydraulic modeling of the flow has focused on the upper section of the system - proximal Athabasca - within 50-75 km from the vents [5], because the flow splits into multiple channels at larger distances from the source. The flow was likely emplaced over a period of only a few to several weeks. Estimated average thicknesses of the frozen lava in the range 20-30 m lead to total flow volumes of 5000-7500 km3 for the entire 1400-km-long flow, and a value of 20 m is favored, based on the fact that the lava is thinner within the Athabasca Valles system and along its margins. However, depths of 80-100 m were reached at peak flow in the center of the channel. The channel width is 30-50 km, and the average slope is 0.063 ± 0.007% (0.04º). The composition of the Athabasca lava is assumed to be similar to the composition of the mafic lavas analyzed by Spirit at Gusev Crater. Hydrovolcanic (rootless) cones are found near channel margins, which formed as a result of interactions between hot lava and ice in the substrate [3, 6]. Here we adapt and apply the Williams et al. [7] model of thermal erosion by lava to proximal Athabasca. Our goal is to determine erosion rates and depths across the entire section length and compare results with observations. Method:  The rigorous analytical-numerical model developed by Williams et al. [7] to investigate thermal erosion by turbulent lava calculates erosion rates and depths with time, as a function of distance from the source. The flow is one-dimensional (in the x direction) with thermal erosion in the z direction. Lava erupts as a turbulent flow with a thermally mixed interior, convective heat transfer occurs to the top and the base of the flow, and thermal erosion occurs at the base of the flow. The model accounts for the effects of lava rheology changes due to assimilation of eroded substrate and crystallization of mafic minerals in the flowing lava; the lava temperature decreases as the flow moves downstream; flow thickness increases as velocity decreases (thickness is used as proxy for flow rate that is conserved). Key input parameters of the model include: 1) a lava and substrate composition similar to that measured at Gusev Crater, with a liquid viscosity of 2.8 Pa s and a temperature of 1523 K, which well suit a turbulent emplacement regime; 2) the thickness of the lava, taken in the range 20-68 m, the latter value matching previously estimated upper end volume rates [4]; 3) a substrate slope of 0.04 degrees. The thickness of the lava is replaced by the hydraulic radius, which closely approximates flow depth for very wide, shallow channels [8]. Together with all the important temperature- and composition-dependent thermal physical lava properties, the model outputs decreasing flow velocities and increasing flow thicknesses, which are multiplied by channel width to provide 3-D flow rates. From these, we derive an estimate of the duration of the flow by using the available range of flow volumes [4]. To account for the presence of water ice within the substrate, the model calculates the energy required to disaggregate the ground (i.e., to heat it up to the vaporization temperature) and vaporize the water, for an assumed volume fraction of water in the substrate. The important assumption is that the ice is melted first, followed by the rock. Results:  Table 1 shows key parameters as a function of flow rates and thickness for an eruption temperature of 1523 K and a 39-km-wide channel. rh u µ75 Re75 Q ta tb m m/s Pa s # km3/s days days        20 3.4 16.8 2.2x104 2.6x10-3 21.9 32.9 25 3.9 15.2 3.6x104 3.8x10-3 15.1 22.7 35 4.9 13.7 7.0x104 6.7x10-3 8.6 12.9 45 5.8 12.9 1.1x105 1.0x10-2 5.7 8.5 55 6.6 12.5 1.6x105 1.4x10-2 4.1 6.1 68 7.6 12.2 2.4x105 2.0x10-2 2.9 4.3 Table 1: rh is hydraulic radius, u is flow velocity, µ75 is bulk viscosity 75 km from source, Re75 is Reyn1154.pdf

olds number 75 km from source, Q is effusion rate, ta is flow duration if total volume = 5000 km3, assuming a steady eruption rate, and tb is flow duration if total volume = 7500 km3. Flow rates vary by a factor of ̃8 for thicknesses in the range 20-68 m. Even 20-m-thick flows are characterized by Reynolds numbers suggestive of a fully turbulent flow regime. This is due to the very low bulk viscosities that never exceed ̃17 Pa s. Expectedly, flow velocities increase with increasing flow thickness, and fall within previously estimated values [4] if thicknesses are larger than 35 m. For flow thicknesses of 20 and 25 m, the duration of the eruption varies between ~15 and ~33 days, in agreement with results from Jaeger et al. [4]. The estimate of eruption duration is necessarily approximate since effusion rate is expected to vary with time. The values examined here are plausible average values for the main effusive event. Erosion rates are always higher at the source and increase with the duration of the flow. They also increase with increasing flow depths, ranging between 10 and 15 cm/day for flow thicknesses of 20 and 68 m, respectively. The rate of erosion of the substrate increases further as a result of the interaction between lava and ice contained in the substrate. Fig 1 shows erosion depths caused by 20 and 45 m thick flows, for total lava volumes of 5000 and 7500 km3. Erosion depths are plotted against distance from the source. Interestingly, a 25% H2O-75% rock substrate contributes to making erosion depths 1/3 larger than in the noice scenario, for the same value of flow thickness. Nevertheless, erosion depths are never larger than 4.5 m, because the short duration of the flow prevents thermal erosion from playing a key role, as expected [4].  Figure 1: Erosion depth in meters (y-axis) plotted against distance from lava source in kilometers. 20 m and 45 m are flow thicknesses; L.V. = lower volumes = 5000 km3; H.V. = higher volumes = 7500 km3. H.V.I. = higher volume + 25% substrate H2O. Even on a turbulent flow, a progressively thicker crust is expected to form on the flow as the flow cools. The modeled thickness of the crust at 75 km from the vent reaches ~31 cm for a 20-m-thick flow and ̃15-17 cm for the thickest flows. A 56-cm-thick crust is expected to develop at a distance of 300 km (the length of the Athabasca Valles main channel). These values are appropriately lower than estimates from the Keszthelyi and Denlinger model developed for terrestrial pahoehoe flows [9]. Discussion:  Dundas and Keszthelyi [6] argue that the rootless cones in Athabasca Valles could have been caused by atmospherically emplaced ground ice and that it would be difficult for lava erosion to reach deep ice layers. Our results support this statement, and the 25% H2O-75% rock substrate proportion is probably an upper limit to the amount of H2O likely to exist in the Athabasca Valles rock substrate, due to the limited volume that is generally occupied by pore space in a consolidated lava substrate. Although the composition of the Gusev lava matches spectral data from the area, no strong constraint on eruption temperatures exists. In future work, it would be useful to explore other lava flow parameters characterized by different eruption temperatures, even though significant differences in terms of erosion depths are not expected due to the short duration of the flow. Also, elements from available mechanical or thermo-mechanical models of erosion by lava could be incorporated. In the presence of short eruptive events, mechanical erosion could produce larger erosion rates and depths [10]. References: [1] Greeley R. et al. (1998) J. Geophys. Res., 103, 27325-27346.
