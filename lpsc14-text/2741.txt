(fmccubbi@unm.edu).  Introduction: The mineral apatite [Ca5(PO4)3(F,Cl,OH)] is present in a wide range of planetary materials. Due to the presence of volatiles within its crystal structure, many recent studies have attempted to use apatite to constrain the volatile contents of planetary magmas and mantle sources [1-9]. In order to use the volatile contents of apatite to precisely determine the abundances of volatiles in coexisting silicate melt or fluids, thermodynamic models for the apatite solid solution and for the apatite components in multicomponent silicate melts and fluids are required. Although some thermodynamic models for apatite have been developed [i.e., 10-14], they are incomplete. Furthermore, no mixing model is available for all of the apatite components in silicate melts or fluids, especially for F and Cl components. Several experimental studies have investigated the apatite-melt and apatite-fluid partitioning behavior of F and Cl in terrestrial systems [i.e., 14, 15, 16-17]; however, the partitioning has proved to be compositionally dependent [i.e., 16, 17], and experiments on magmatic systems relevant to extraterrestrial magmas have not been conducted. In the present study, we conducted apatite-melt partitioning experiments in a piston cylinder press at 1.0 GPa and 950-1000 °C on a synthetic martian basalt composition equivalent to the basaltic shergottite Queen Alexandria Range (QUE) 94201. These experiments were conducted to assess the effects of apatite composition on the partitioning behavior of F, OH, and Cl between apatite and basaltic melt. Experimental Methods: Three powdered mixes were synthesized based on the QUE 94201 composition with approximately 5 wt.% additional P2O5 (to induce early phosphate saturation). Each of the three mixes was either an F, Cl, or H2O endmember with ~1 wt.% of either F, Cl, or H2O. The mixes were prepared by first weighing silicates, oxides, Ca2P2O7, Ca(OH)2, CaF2, and MgCl2 powders in the proportions needed for obtaining the target compositions. Next, the powders were mechanically mixed sequentially by volume in an automatic agate mortar/pestle grinder for a total of 3.5 hours under ethanol. The Fe3+/∑Fe value in the mixture was 0.10. Because MgCl2 is soluble in ethanol, the Cl-bearing mix was ground under dry conditions.  Each experiment for the present study was conducted under "wet" conditions (undried starting materials and a talc cell), and mixtures of the three powders (each with a different F:Cl:H2O ratio) were packed into a graphite or Mo capsule. Next, the capsule was loaded into a talc-pyrex cell using the same cell assembly reported by Elardo et al. [18]. The assembled cell was then placed within a 1.27 cm (diameter) Depths of the Earth piston-cylinder apparatus (using the piston-out method) and pressurized immediately. Next, the temperature was raised to a melting temperature of 1250 °C. After melting for 20 minutes, the temperature was dropped to the desired crystallization temperature of 950-1000 °C and left to crystallize for 3.25-8.50 hours. The temperature of each experiment was controlled by a W5Re95-W26Re74 (Type C) thermocouple. At the end of each experiment, the run was rapidly quenched by shutting off the power to the system. Methods/Results: Experimental charges were pressed into indium metal within 1" aluminum metal discs and polished for subsequent analysis by SIMS (6f and NanoSIMS) and EPMA. The largest apatites that grew from the silicate melt were approximately 4-5 microns in the shortest dimension, so they could not be analyzed with the 6f ion microprobe. However, glasses from all the experiments were analyzed by the 6f to determine H2O contents. NanoSIMS was subsequently used to analyze both melt and apatite in each of the experimental charges. The apatite in each sample was also analyzed by EPMA, in order to compare the F and Cl data (along with computed OH) to the nanoSIMS results. Glass compositions were also determined by EPMA to obtain F and Cl contents. The F, Cl, and H2O contents of glass and coexisting apatites are presented in Table 1 for all 12 experiments  based on the average of approximately 5-15 analyses. F and Cl analyses of all glasses are from EPMA unless noted with an octothorp, in which case they are from NanoSIMS. All H2O abundances are from SIMS unless noted with an asterisk, in which case the amount of H2O was computed by stoichiometry. F values for NanoSIMS and EPMA in apatite were very similar and within 2σ standard deviations, so the F value presented is an average value from both techniques with the exception of experiment Q1.010 for which only nanoSIMS data was 2741.pdf

From the data in Table 1, we can calculate apatite-melt partition coefficients for F (4.5-19), Cl (15), and H2O (0.02-0.24). Although these are the first apatite-melt partitioning data reported for H2O that were derived from the direct analysis of H2O in both melt and apatite, previous studies have reported partitioning data for F and Cl (and H2O estimated stoichiometrically). Previous studies reported apatitemelt partition coefficients as follows: F (3.4-40), Cl (0.8-4.5) [16-17].  It is important to note that F, Cl, and OH are essential structural constituents in the mineral apatite, so the partitioning behavior of the volatiles should deviate substantially from Henrian behavior of trace elements. Similar to the partitioning behavior of Fe and Mg between olivine and silicate liquids [19-20], the partitioning behavior of F, Cl, and OH between apatite and silicate melt are best described by an exchange coefficient (Equation 1) [21-22]:  ࡷࡰ࡭࢖షࡸ࢏ࢗࡲିࡴ૛ࡻ ൌ 	ࢄࡸ࢏ࢗࡲ ൊࢄ࡭࢖ࡲࢄࡸ࢏ࢗࡴ૛ࡻൊࢄ࡭࢖ࡴ૛ࡻ                   (1)                    where ࢄࡸ࢏ࢗࡲ  is the wt.% F in the melt, ࢄ࡭࢖ࡲ  is the wt.% F in the apatite, ࢄࡸ࢏ࢗࡴ૛ࡻ	is the wt.% H2O in the melt, and ࢄ࡭࢖ࡴ૛ࡻ is the wt.% H2O in apatite. These exchange coefficients can change as a function of melt composition, pressure, temperature, apatite composition, and oxygen fugacity. Therefore, the available data on apatite-melt partitioning should be considered very limited from this study at 1.0 GPa and 950-1000 °C.  It is also important to note that H2O is highly incompatible in apatite compared to F and Cl under these conditions (ࡷࡰ࡭࢖షࡸ࢏ࢗࡲିࡴ૛ࡻ ൌ 0.011 െ 0.016; ࡷࡰ࡭࢖షࡸ࢏ࢗ࡯࢒ିࡴ૛ࡻ ൌ0.02 െ 0.08.) Discussion: Many have tried to use apatite as a tool for quantifying volatile abundances in parental magmatic liquids (X) and magmatic source regions (Y) from apatite compositions; however these models typically require that volatile partitioning in apatite is similar to trace elements using the following equations, which are all derived from the general batch melting equation and assume equilibrium crystallization:  ࢄࡴ૛ࡻࡼࡹ ൌቀ૚ିࡲࡼࡿࢇ࢚࢛࢘ࢇ࢚࢏࢕࢔ቁ	ൈ	ࢄࡴ૛ࡻ࡭࢖ࡰࡴ૛ࡻ࡭࢖షࡹࢋ࢒࢚                      (2)                             ࢅࡴ૛ࡻࡹࡿ ൌቀ૚ିࡲࡼࡿࢇ࢚࢛࢘ࢇ࢚࢏࢕࢔ቁ	ൈ	ࡲࡿ࢕࢛࢘ࢉࢋࡼࢇ࢚࢘࢏ࢇ࢒	ࡹࢋ࢒࢚࢏࢔ࢍ	ൈ	ࢄࡴ૛ࡻ࡭࢖ࡰࡴ૛ࡻ࡭࢖షࡹࢋ࢒࢚           (3)  Where ࢄࡴ૛ࡻࡼࡹ  is the H2O content of the parental melt, ࢅࡴ૛ࡻࡹࡿ  is the H2O content of the mantle source, ࡲࡼࡿࢇ࢚࢛࢘ࢇ࢚࢏࢕࢔ is the degree of crystallization before apatite saturation, ࢄࡴ૛ࡻ࡭࢖  is the amount of H2O in apatite (wt.%), ࡰࡴ૛ࡻ࡭࢖ିࡹࢋ࢒࢚ is the apatite-melt partition coefficient for H2O, and ࡲࡿ࢕࢛࢘ࢉࢋࡼࢇ࢚࢘࢏ࢇ࢒	ࡹࢋ࢒࢚࢏࢔ࢍ is the degree of partial melting that occurred to produce the parental melt. However, as discussed herein, the partitioning data between apatite and silicate melt should be treated as exchange equilibria because they are essential structural constituents in apatite. Consequently, equations (2) and (3) above require slight modification before quantification of water contents. Specifically, either the F or Cl abundances of the melt at the time of apatite crystallization is needed, which adds a degree of complexity to quantification of melt volatile abundances from apatite alone. In place of the term ࢄࡴ૛ࡻ࡭࢖ࡰࡴ૛ࡻ࡭࢖షࡹࢋ࢒࢚ in (2) and (3) above, which equals ࢄࡸ࢏ࢗࡴ૛ࡻ from (1), (4) should be used instead to estimate the water contents of a parental liquid or magmatic source region from apatite: ࢄࡸ࢏ࢗࡲ ൈ	ࢄ࡭࢖ࡴ૛ࡻࡷࡰ࡭࢖షࡸ࢏ࢗࡲషࡴ૛ࡻ ൈ	ࢄ࡭࢖ࡲൌ 	ࢄࡸ࢏ࢗࡴ૛ࡻ                     (4). Cl could be used in place of F in equation (4). References: [1] Boyce et al., (2010) Nature, 466. 466. [2] McCubbin et al., (2011) GCA 75. 5073. [3] McCubbin and Nekvasil (2008) Am Min 93. 676.
