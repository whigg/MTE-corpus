At a height of 30-50 km [11], the meteorite exploded with a flare and broke up into numerous fragments. Its largest fragment (570 kg) was lifted from Chebarkul Lake. We examined a fragment (2  by  1.4  cm)  of  this  meteorite,  which  had  an outermost  black  fused  rind  varying  from  a  few fractions of  a  millimeter  to  1 mm in thickness.  The meteorite  is  classed  with  ordinary chondrites  of  the LL5/S4-WO class [1]. One-third  of  the  found fragments of this meteorite show evidence of shockinduced transformations.New observations: The fragment we studied exhibits no traces of shock metamorphism (such as fractures filled with impact melt and/or planar elements). Chondrules and their fragments  make  up  a  little  less  than  half  of  the meteorite  by  volume  and  are  clearly  pronounced round  objects  of  barred,  radiating,  beam, porphyritic,  or  granular  texture.  The  chondrules consist  mostly  of  olivine   (Fa29-30)  and orthopyroxene   (En75 Fs24-25)  and  contain clinopyroxene  (En  44-46,  Wo  43-45,  Fs  7,5-9 ),  and plagioclase  (An  10  -15,  An  17-22).  The orthopyroxene contains  minor  Ca  and  Al  admixtures,  and  the clinopyroxene  contains  some  Na,  Ti,  and  Cr.  The matrix also consists of a coarse-grained aggregates of olivine, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, and plagioclase of the same composition as in the chondrules.Similar to the matrix, the metallic phase of the chondrules  consists  of  kamacite  and  taenite,  which bear  inclusions  of  troilite,  ilmenite,  and  chromite. Apatite  was  found  near  boundaries  between chondrules  and  groundmass.  The  olivine  and orthopyroxene  are  not  zonal,  and  their  relations suggest  their  equilibrium  crystallization,  as  can  be clearly seen in the granulated chondrule in shown Fig. 1 and the matrix in Fig. 2. The chemical composition of  the  minerals  was  analyzed  at  the  Laboratory  of Analytical  techniques  of  High  Spatial  Resolution  at the  Geological  Faculty,  Moscow  State  University, using  a  Jeol  JSM-6480LV  scanning  microscope equipped  with  an  INCA-ENERGY-350  EDS analytical setup, at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV and current of 2 nA.Fig1.

method described in [5, 9]. The temperature was also estimated  by  the  two-pyroxene  geothermometer  in versions  [4,  6,  7],  which  yielded  closely  similar temperature  values  constrained  within  the  range  of 890-9150C,  measured  accurate  to  520C.  The crystallization  temperatures  of  the  chondrules  was calculated  by  the  olivine-clinopyroxene  equilibrium [2] and was somewhat higher: 9330C. This difference likely  stems  from  the  errors  of  the  thermometers, which  were  calibrated  for  terrestrial  rocks  but  were now applied to meteorites. The pressure was evaluated by assuming that the temperature was within the range of 900-9300C.   Fig  3.  Rim  of  glass  around  fragment  of meteorite Chelyabinsk. Ablation traces are visible.The  crystallization  pressure  of  the  chondrites evaluated  by  model  [3]  is  underlain  by  a  pressure dependence  of  the  unit-cell  parameters  of clinopyroxene.  The  applicability  of  this  model  to evaluating  the  crystallization  pressure  of clinopyroxene in  ordinary chondrites  is  discussed in [5]. The pressure estimates lie within the range of 6.16.8 kbar. The effect of a temperature underestimate on pressure calculation by this technique is insignificant at pressures <20 kbar. According to data in [10], the crystallization  temperature  of  clinopyroxene  in ordinary chondrites  of  various  chemical  groups  and petrological  types  varies  from 900 to  15000C (these temperatures  correspond  to  the  temperatures  of magmatic processes), and the pressure varies from 0 to 10.6  kbar  (occasional  clinopyroxene  grains crystallized under pressures as high as 14.5 kbar).Fused rinds. Fragments of the Chelyabinsk chondrite were produced by an explosion of the main meteorite body above the Earth's surface. Upon the explosion, the  fragments  falling  onto  the  Earth's  surface  were partly  fused  in  the  atmosphere  and  now  have outermost  glassy rinds  of  variable  porosity (Fig.  3). The  marginal  part  of  the  rinds  shows  traces  of ablation.  The  composition  of  the  fused  rinds corresponds  to  a  mix  of  olivine  and  orthopyroxene with  minor  amounts  of  plagioclase,  clinopyroxene, metallic  constituents  (kamacite  and  taenite),  and troilite.  The  bulk  composition  of  the  rinds  was evaluated  by  scanning  an  area  of  400  μm2 by  an electron beam and is as follows: Na2O 0.1-0.9, MgO 27-35, Al2O3 0-2.4, SiO2 36-42, K2O 0.1, CaO 0-1.6, MnO  0.3-0.5,  FeO  25-25.6,  NiO  0-0.5.  During  the rapid melting of the meteorite and cooling of the melt, the  melt  had  not  enough  time  to  homogenize.  The opaque  glassy  rind  contains  skeleton  magnetite crystals ranging from a few fractions to 2 µm, which also crystallized at the rapid cooling of the melt in an oxidizing  environment.  The  temperature  of  the  melt whose  quenching  resulted  in  the  glassy rind  should have  been  higher  than  1300  -  15570C  (the  solidus temperature)  according  to  melting  diagrams  for  the Fa-An and Fo-En-SiO2 systems [8].Conclusions:  Our data on the chondrule and matrix minerals allowed us to evaluate  the temperature and pressure  by  the  olivine-clinopyroxene-orthopyroxene assemblage. The textural traits of the chondrules and matrix  with  a  normal  magmatic  crystallization succession  of  minerals  and  the  narrow  ranges  of temperature  (890-9500C) and  pressure  (6.1-6.8 kbar) suggest  that  the  minerals  crystallized  in  equilibrium from a chondritic melt at a certain depth in the parent body. Our  pressure  estimates  for  clinopyroxene crystallization in the parent body make it possible, according to data in [9],  to evaluate the radius  of the parent body during the planetary episode of its evolution at 600 - 700 km.
