The mineralogy, petrography [1,3], O-isotope compositions [2,4], and thermodynamic analysis [3,5] suggest formation of fa during fluid-assisted thermal metamorphism on the ordinary and carbonaceous (CC) chondrite parent bodies [1,3,6]. 53Mn53Cr chronology (t1/2 ~ 3.7 Myr) has been used to date the formation of fa [57]. Jacobsen et al. [8] reported the initial 53Mn/55Mn ratio in fa from Elephant Moraine (EET) 90161 (L3.05), (2.6±2.2)×106, measured in situ by NanoSIMS using San Carlos olivine (Fa~10) as a standard to correct for Mn-Cr relative sensitivity factor (RSF) in fa. However, we have recently demonstrated that matrix matched standards are required for accurate 53Mn53Cr chronology of fa [9]. Here we describe the mineralogy, petrography (SEM, EPMA, FIB/STEM), and in situ measurements of O and Mn-Cr isotope systematics (SIMS) of the fa-bearing assemblages in EET 90161. Method: The fa-bearing assemblages in EET 90161 were characterized with the UH Manoa JEOL JXA-8500F field emission electron microprobe. Several fa-bearing regions were studied with the FIB/STEM at UNM using the methods described by [10]. Mn-Cr isotope compositions of fa, and O-isotope compositions of fa, magnetite (mgt) and chondrule olivine fragments were measured in situ with the UH Cameca ims-1280 ion microprobe. The analytical protocol for O-isotope measurements was similar to that described by [11]. Mn-Cr isotope compositions of fa were measured using a similar protocol to that described by [7]. Synthetic fa (Fa99) was used to correct for instrumental mass fractionation and Mn-Cr relative sensitivity factor (RSF) [9]. As the Mn-Cr RSF is time-dependent, the number of cycles of the standard was matched to that of the unknown. The reported uncertainties (2) in O-isotope compositions, Cr-isotope ratio and Mn/Cr ratio include both the internal precision of an individual analysis and the external reproducibility for standard measurements during a given analytical session. Results: Two types of fa are identified in EET 90161: clean Fa95100 and complex Fa~90 (Table 1; Fig. 1). The clean fa occurs as subhedral overgrowths on type I and type II chondrule olivine fragments and as isolated, subhedral-to-euhedral grains (≤7x10 µm), often in association with mgt and troilite, in the matrix and fine-grained rims around type I chondrules. The complex fa replaces Fe-Al-Si-rich material in the matrix and has a porous appearance (Figs. 1a,b). Electron microprobe analyses of the complex fa show, on average, ~1 wt% of Al2O3 + Na2O + CaO and have generally low totals (~97 wt%). Dark and bright field TEM images (Fig. 1d,e) of the FIB-extracted sections across the boundary between the complex fa and Fe-Al-Sirich material indicate that the latter is amorphous. On a three-isotope oxygen diagram, the compositions of EET 90161 fa and type I and type II chondrule olivine fragments overgrown by fa plot above the terrestrial fractionation line (TFL) (Fig 2) with average Δ17O values of 4.8±1.7‰, 0.6±0.1‰ and 0.7±0.8‰ respectively (2SD). The O-isotope compositions of the clean and complex fa in EET 90161 are similar and overlap with that of fa in the Ngawi LL36 breccia. Fa in EET 90161 and Ngawi and mgt in Ngawi and Semarkona plot along mass-dependent fractionation line with a slope of ~0.5. Due to small grain sizes, no O-isotope compositions of mgt have been measured in EET 90161. Mn-Cr isotope measurements of fa in EET 90161 revealed the presence of 53Cr excess correlated with 55Mn/52Cr ratio (Fig. 3), indicative of in situ decay of live 53Mn. On a Mn-Cr evolutionary diagram, clean and complex fa define an isochron with an initial 53Mn/55Mn ratio of (4.35±1.23)×106. Using the quenched angrite D’Orbigny as the anchor [12,13], this ratio corresponds to an absolute age of fa formation of  4564.9 +1.31.8_+1.81.3_2.4 Ma, which is 4564.9 +1.31.8_+1.81.3_2.4  Myr after the formation of CV CAIs dated by [14].  Discussion: The textural occurrences of clean fa in EET 90161 are similar to those observed in CV and CO chondrites [3,15], suggesting that similar faforming processes occurred on the parent bodies of both ordinary and carbonaceous chondrites. Complex fa replacing amorphous Fe-Al-Si-rich material in EET 90161 has not been described in CCs and may indicate a different formation mechanism. The petrographic observations and the lack of resolvable differences in O and Mn-Cr isotope compositions of the two textural occurrences of fa in EET 90161, however, suggest the formation during the same alteration process – fluidassisted thermal metamorphism. We have previously suggested [16,17] that 17O values of chondritic fa and mgt can be used as a proxy for O-isotope compositions of water ices that accreted into chondrite parent bodies. The observed differences in O-isotope compositions of fa and mgt in UOCs and CVs+COs (Fig. 2b) having Δ17O ~ +5‰ and –0.1 to –1.8‰, respectively, and ~23 Myr age difference between fa formation on the OC and CC parent bodies [2,7, this study] may reflect evolution of O-isotope compositions of water ices in the inner protoplanetary disk. 1726.pdf
