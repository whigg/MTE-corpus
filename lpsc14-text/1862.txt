Introduction: Compton-Belkovich Volcanic Complex (CBVC) is a highly silicic non-mare feature having high thorium concentration and is also associated with enhanced hydration of possible endogenic origin on the far side of the Moon [1-9]. Previous studies involving morphological analysis describes the area to be a volcanic complex with elevated topography, central caldera [1] mantled by a thick layer of fine-grained pyroclastic material [8, 9]. Here we present a detailed analysis of these diverse volcanic features indicative of a series of effusive and eruptive events associated with silicic magmatism similar to ash-flow calderas on the Earth.      Data used: We have used high resolution Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) [10] mosaic of the CBVC region (2 meter/pixel resolution) for detailed morphological characterization. Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) [11] derived topography was used to study the volcanic features in a 3D spatial context and also to derive the relief and the profiles of the domes and the central collapsed caldera. LRO S-band Mini-RF data [12] were used to map the extent and the distribution of pyroclastic deposits at CBVC.       Observations: The CBVC region is characterized by three prominent pre-caldera domes in its north, west and east side with a central caldera (Figure 1); while the North dome is undisturbed, the boundary of the West dome facing caldera is marked by continuous development of steep and inclined escarpment features (Figure 1). The boundary of the East dome on the other hand is marked by arcuate crevasses  (Figure 1c) as a result of caldera formation. Ring faults bounding the escarpment features could be seen on the west caldera wall at two levels with a bench inbetween (Figure 1)  while on the east side their remnants could be seen in the form of arcurate boundaries of the head scarps due to its slope (Figures 1c, 3a). Renewed post-caldera volcanic activity has been observed within the central caldera in the form of relatively fresh Middle dome and small dome [1] (Figure 1b), turtle-shaped dome along a crater boundary (Figure 1a), flows and surface fracturing (Figures 1a, 1b), ring fracture domes along the ring faults (Figures 1c, 2a, b, c, 3c) and episodic eruption of pyroclasts and ash along the caldera boundary (Figures 1-4). A thin layer of fine ash is seen over the small domes (Figures 1a, 3b). The eastern flank of the East dome displays a peculiar depositional feature (>1km long) characterized by dune-like bedforms, thinning and tapering downward  (Figure 4a).  This portion when observed in Mini-RF image appears dark showing high Circular Polarization Ratio (CPR) and Degree of Linear Polarization (DoLP) values indicating radar waves penetration depth upto 1 meter in that portion (Figures 4b, c, d).        Discussions and Conclusion: The area with high thorium anomaly [5, 6] could be compared to a volcanic hotspot characterized by excessive volcanism,  associated with topographic swells  and  formation of such features may be related with the generation of   prolonged heat source and development of a long- lived magma chamber [13]. Study of the terrestrial silicic caldera [14-18] suggests that the silicic caldera evolution is associated with dome formation in both the early as well as late stages and their post caldera evolution is commonly characterized by unrest, often manifested in the form of both effusive and eruptive phases with voluminous pyroclastic eruptions or ash flows. The observed veneer of fine particles and  ash deposition features at CBVC could be related with terrestrial ash flows associated with eruptive phase of silicic magmatism and thus represents small magnitude dilute and turbulent flow eruptions such as  pyroclastic surge deposits. Our detailed observation suggests that initial volcanic activity at CBVC occurred in the form of three prominent dome formations followed by magma chamber collapse. The nature of collapse was guided by its topography. Renewed magmatic activity in the area resulted in the formation of small domes and various effusive and eruptive features localized within the caldera and along the ring faults. The varied morphological features associated with the highly silicic lithology of CBVC are thus  indicative of a series of deformation and explosive events  involving both effusive and eruptive phases. The reported  hydroxyl anomaly [7-9] in the area is consistent with its highly siliceous nature, mode of emplacement, associated caldera, as well as  geological formation/evolution process in episodes of effusions and eruptions. The reported presence of mafics [7, 8] like clinopyroxenes and spinel along with the pyroclasts could also be due to later mafic recharge event.       References: [1] Jolliff B. L. et al. (2011) Nat.
