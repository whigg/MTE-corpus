These components are most readily explained as being related to photodissociation and self-shielding in the precursor molecular cloud [2].  The extreme compositions of CV3 CAIs (Δ17O ≈ -25 ‰) are close to the solar oxygen isotope composition, which is enriched in 16O by around 6% relative to Standard Mean Ocean Water (Δ17O ≈ -30 ‰)  [3].  CAIs even more enriched in 16O have been described from Isheyevo (CH/CB chondrite) with Δ17O of -35 ‰ [4]. In CV3 CAIs, 16O-rich compositions are typically reflected in the mineral phases spinel, pyroxene, and forsterite.  On the other hand, melilite and anorthite show that they have experienced reaction with another reservoir closer to planetary (Δ17O ≈ 0) in composition.  The diverse compositions of CAI minerals define a line of slope near 1 on a plot of δ17O against δ18O.  The rare FUN (Fractionation and Unknown Nuclear) and F inclusions show an additional level of complexity involving oxygen isotope mass fractionation (heavyisotope enrichment) from the 16O-rich reservoir prior to back reaction with the planetary composition ((Δ17O ≈ 0). Refractory inclusions from the NWA 4502 CV3 chondrite show many similarities with CAIs from other CV3 chondrites: all major CAI types are present, including coarse-grained Type A, Type B and forsterite-bearing Type B (FoB); some CAIs appear to be complex inclusions [5]. Of particular interest is a Type A CAI #7, which has a large region in the core composed of hibonite and spinel.  This indicates CAI #7 is enriched in Al, and this could be indicative of refractory enrichment such as might occur during evaporation.  This is supported by Mg isotopic fractionation in CAI #7 [6]. In addition, CAIs in NWA 4502 show little evidence for iron-alkali metasomatic alteration that affected most CAIs from Allende. The NWA 4502 CAIs are therefore of interest, both in terms of whether they have similar oxygen isotope systematics to other CV3 CAIs, and specifically for NWA 4502 CAI #7 as to whether it might have fractionated oxygen isotopes.  Experimental Methods: Polished sections of NWA CAI #5 and #7 were prepared for analysis in SHRIMP SI.  In addition, a grain mount of 1-2mm fragments of Allende CV3 FoB CAI SJ101 along with reference minerals from the Duluth gabbros was prepared.  A polished thin section of Efremovka CV3 Type B CAI E44 was also used for comparison. Polished surfaces were coated with ca. 15 nm of Al. A Cs+ beam was focused to around 20 µm, and a low energy electron gun was used for charge neutralization. Al is used for the conductive coating in preference to Au because of a much-reduced emission of 16O- from the electron beam impact [7].  SHRIMP SI was operated with a 400 µm collector slit for 16O-, 100 µm for 17O-, and 300 µm for 18O-.  Mass resolution was sufficient to separate 16OH- from 17O- (<1% valley definition).  Analyses were made in a static multicollector mode with 16O- measured with a 1011 Ω resistor, and 17O- and 18O- on 1012 Ω resistors.  Analyses consisted of 5 sets of 20s, each set comprised of 10 × 2s acquisitions.  Typical count rate for 16O- was approximately 109 c/s.  Count times were sufficient to produce internal precision in δ17O better than 0.5 ‰, internal precision for δ18O was typically better than 0.1 ‰.  Reproducibility of δ18O was approximately ± 0.5 ‰.  Data were normalized to terrestrial reference materials FC1 (Duluth, USA) anorthite and pyroxene, Burma spinel, and Madagascar hibonite.  Melilite was assumed to have the same fractionation factor as anorthite.    Results:  Oxygen isotope compositions of CAIs measured are presented in Figure 1.  These are the first oxygen three-isotope data for CAIs to be produced in the SHRIMP SI.   (a) Allende FoB SJ101: Data for SJ101 show two general clusters - of five points near δ18O of -50 ‰, four are pyroxene and one is olivine, while three points above -20 ‰ are melilite.  These data are consistent with the results of oxygen isotope measurements by the University of Hawai'i Cameca ims1280 [8].  (b) Efremovka Type B E44: Data for E44 show two clusters - three points near δ18O of -47‰ are pyroxene, and two points just below the TFL are melilite.  These data are consistent with UV-laser fluorination analyses [9] although our pyroxene analyses are slightly more 16O-enriched possibly owing to some melilite contributing to the relatively large laser fluorination spots.  1671.pdf

   (c) NWA 4502 Type A CAI #7: Six hibonite and two spinel analyses for cluster near δ18O of -50 ‰, while nine analyses of melilite show a range from near -50 ‰ up to near 0 ‰. There is no clear relationship of oxygen isotope composition of melilite with location in the inclusion. There is no indication of variable mass dependent oxygen fractionation within this CAI.  (d) NWA 4502 Type B/FoB CAI #5: Data for CAI #5 are very similar to those from CAI #7 although melilite compositions are closer to the TFL.       Conclusion:  The oxygen isotopic compositions and distribution of the compositions between mineralogical phases of the NWA 4502 CAIs look very similar to that found in other CV3 chondrites.  While CAI #7 shows Mg isotopic fractionation, there is no indication of mass fractionated oxygen isotopes.     References: [1] Ireland, T. R. (2012) Australian Journal of Earth Sciences 59, 225.
