Introduction: During a nanomineralogy investigation of primitive meteorites, we identified a new scandium aluminate mineral, Ca2Sc6Al6O20 with P-1 rhonite structure, in ultra-refractory inclusions from the Murchison CM2 and the Vigarano CV3 chondrites. Electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), scanning electron microscopy, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and ion probe were used to characterize its chemical composition, structure, and O-isotope compositions of this mineral. A similar Sc-rich phase has been previously reported in the Acfer 182 CH chondrite based on EPMA [1]. Synthetic Ca2Sc6Al6O20 has not been reported. We describe here Ca2Sc6Al6O20 in CV and CM chondrites as an ultra-refractory mineral and consider its origin and implication for formation of the ultra-refractory inclusions in the solar nebula. This new mineral is currently under review by the Commission on New Minerals, Nomenclature and Classification of the International Mineralogical Association. Occurrence, chemistry, and crystallography: The mineral occurs with perovskite in the mantle-core area in a cluster of ultra-refractory inclusions with a Wark-Lovering rim consisting of Sc-bearing diopside, spinel and perovskite in Murchison section Me2642 (Fig. 1). The mineral also occurs with perovskite and melilite with a partial davisite rim in an ultra-refractory inclusion in Vigarano section USNM 7618 (Fig. 2). The aluminate occurs as aggregates with crystals at 1 to 4 μm in size. The mean chemical compositions of type aluminates by EPMA are given in Table 1. Murchison aluminate shows an empirical formula (based on 20 O apfu) of Ca2.00[(Sc4.05Ti3+0.45Al0.42Y0.06Dy0.02Gd0.01)(Ti4+0.27Zr0.22) (Mg0.25Ca0.19Fe2+0.05)]Al6.00O20, where Ti3+ was calculated based on stoichiometry. Vigarano aluminate has an empirical formula of Ca2.00[(Sc4.09Ti3+0.50Al0.27V3+0.18 Y0.02)(Mg0.31Ca0.22Fe2+0.17) (Zr0.23)](Al5.71Si0.29)O20. Aluminate and perovskite in the CAI from Murchison measured by the UH Cameca ims-1280 have 16Orich compositions (17O ~ 24±3‰ and 21±3‰, respectively), similar to those of the Zr,Sc-rich pyroxene in the the ultrarefractory CAI Romulus from Murchison [2]. In contrast, an unidentified Y,Zr,Sc,Al,Tioxide from Murchison [3] and Zr,Sc,Y oxides and  Fig. 2.

Zr,Sc-rich pyroxenes in the ultrarefractory CAIs 3N-24 and 33E-1 from the CV chondrites NWA 3118 and Efremovka, have 16O-depleted compositions (17O ~ 5‰) [4] (Fig. 3). EBSD patterns of Ca2Sc6Al6O20 in Murchison and Vigarano were obtained, which can only be indexed using the P-1 aenigmatite structure and give a best fit using the Allende rhonite structure from [5] (Figs. 4,5). The Ca2Sc6Al6O20 has Space Group: P-1, showing a = 10.367 Å, b = 10.756 Å, c = 8.895 Å, α = 105.98°, β = 96.04°, γ = 124.72°, and Z = 2.  Origin and significance: This scandium aluminate in the ultra-refractory inclusions is Ti3+-rich, apparently formed in a highly reducing environment. Texturally, the scandium aluminate and perovskite (and melilite) appeared early in the inclusions, before the formation of Sc-diopside and spinel, or davisite. Oxygen-isotope compositions of the Murchison aluminate imply formation in an 16O-rich gaseous reservoir, either as a condensate or as evaporative residue.  The scandium aluminate is a new ultra-refractory phase with crystal structure determined, joining other Sc-rich refractory minerals allendeite, tazheranite, davisite, kangite, panguite, eringaite, and thortveitite.
