TECTONICALLY PREFORMED VALLEY PATTERN AND FORMATION RELATED TO VOLCANIC STRUCTURE ON CERAUNIUS THOLUS.  T. Biró1, 1Eötvös Loránd University, Faculty of Science, Institute of Geography and Earth Sciences, Department of Physical Geography, H-1117 Budapest, Pázmány Péter sétány 1/C; tbiro.geogr@gmail.com    Introduction: Ceraunius Tholus (CT; 24.25°N, 262.75°E; Mars) is a Hesperian-aged [1] volcanic edifice at the Tharsis region [2]. According to the interpretation of [4] the – slightly elongated – structure of the cone has devoleped in four steps (1-4). After the built up of a former summit vent region (1) the western flank of the edifice collapsed and slumped as a plug of the flank (2). Subsequent to the sector collapse explosive activity had taken place which produced a pyroclastic mantle on the western flank segment (3). At the final structure-forming stage the summit region has collapsed (4). On the surface of CT the well-developed and assymetric valley network is one of the most significant morphologycal feature (Fig. 1 - I vs II). Nearly on the entire flank area a radial valley network (Fig. 1 - Zone a, b) consisting of similar (moderately deep and straigth) channels (Fig. 1 - I) had developed [1]. By contrast, on a northern and a southwestern segments (Fig. 1 - Zone c) sinuous, wider and deeper canyons can be observed (Fig 1. - II).  There are several hypotheses on the possible processes were played role in the forming of the wide, deep canyons within northern and southwestern segments: i) Volcanic activity: thermal erosion of lava flows [3, 4]; erosion by pyroclast density currents [4, 5]; collapse of former lava tubes [6]; ii) Fluvial processes: channel formation due to groundwater sapping [7]; surface runoff [8]; iii) Glacio-fluvial phenomenon: incision of meltwater related to summit ice cap [1], however, the explanation of these valley's unusual sinuous path [e. g. 2] is still lacking. In this paper a possible tectonic explanation proposed on the specific sinuous structure and on the assimetrycal valley pattern on the cone. Both features could be the result of the revealed subsurface volcanic structure due to linear erosion. The large channels with sinuous paths (Fig. 1, II): In the followings the three particular morphological features (i-iii) of the large, sinuous channels of CT are characterized, which distinguish them from the straigth, moderately deep (Fig. 1 - I) valleys. Present observations have been done using VO (516A24), HiRISE (ESP_011821_2045, PSP_006191_2045) and MOC (M07-04049, M04-01565) images.  i) Preferentially developed channel network. The valley network of the volcano is rather asymmetric in the sense that the large, sinuous channels had formed in preferred zones (Fig. 1 - Zone c). Three large canyon-like valleys are observed on the northern and one on the soutwestern segment of the flank (see Zone c in Fig. 1). The other flank units could be characterized by narrow and sublinear valleys (Zone a, b in Fig. 1).  ii) Zig-zag channel pattern. The common distinctive feature of large canyons is the partly or full-length quasi sinuous appearance. These valleys have a 'zigzag' appearence consisting of segments of 2-5 kilometer in length. The strike of neighbouring segments could differ with 90° which results the 'zig-zag' appearance.  iii) Blocks in the channels. In some cases massive blocks can be observed in the canyon walls (e.g., in ESP_011821_2045; PSP_006191_2045), especially in the joints of the above mentioned segments.  Structurally controlled valley formation: Both the location and the 'zig-zag' pattern of the large canyons on CT could be the result of structurally controlled incision. In this interpretation, the sinuousity of these channels is the consequence of a sector collapserelated en-echelon fault system, which had been revealed by linear erosion during the valley-forming period. This interpretation have made based on the similarity between the above mentioned features of the large channels (Fig. 1 - II) on CT and the en-echelon scarps on a neighbouring volcanic edifice Tharsis Tholus (TT) investigated by e.g. [9] and on terrestrial analogs.  The spatial arrangement of the valley network developed on the flank of CT apparently correspond to the faulting zones of TT (for high resolution interpreted tectonic map of the TT see [9]). These shearing zones on TT frame a flank segment 100° in width [9] very similar to the zone of large sinuous channels on CT. This similar pattern is proposed as the result of sector-collapse-related shear zones, which also had developed on CT [4] but mantled by proclastic material. In other words, both volcanic edifices suffered a sector collapse, but the slump-related fault zones directly could only be considered on the surface of TT. The 'zig-zag' structure is also a similar character of the paths of large channels on CT and the slump-related scarps of TT.  As terrestrial analogs sector-collapse-related 'zigzag' or en-echelon scarps on basaltic shield volcanoes [10] and stratocones [10, 11] could be mentioned. Scarps and structural lines with zig-zag manner can be observed on the following volcanic terrains: 1) Piton de la fournaisse volcano (southwestern part of Réunion 1403.pdf

[12]); 2) Tiagoiga scarp (northern part of Tenerife, [13]); the scarp due to Upper Vancari collapse event on Stromboli [14, 15]; northern rim of Valle de Boves on the central region of Etna [16, 17]. These scarps shows a zig-zag pattern similar to the large valleys on CT. On the Piton de la fournaisse river incision has taken place along the scarp, which resulted in a sinuous canyon on the flank. This valley is the best terrestrial analog to the large valleys of CT.  Several meter-scale features of the investigated valleys also provide information on the canyon-forming processes. The outcrops of the bedrock on the walls of the large canyons on CT imply that lava rock are close to the surface. Consequently, the harder lava rock is able to control the incision due to its more resistant behavior than loose pyroclastic veneers.  On the basis of the geologycal history of CT sketched by [4] and the above mentioned structural similarities between the CT, TT and terrestrial analogs the following structurally-controlled valley forming scenario is proposed (Fig. 2): The incision has taken place after the sector collapse and the deposition of pyroclastic mantle on the western flank. It is supposed that an en-echelon zone formed on the northern and southwestern segment of the flank of CT related to the lateral movement of slumping flank segment. This enechelon scarp could affect the local small-scale surface morphology in this two flank segments (Fig. 1 - Zone c) which resulted in a concentrated runoff along structurally disturbed bands. The greater width of the sinuous canyons as compared to other, smaller valleys of CT confirm the existence of these concentrated runoff zones. This path of the incision followed the tectonically affected internal structure of the edifice and thus preserved the sinuous or zig-zag pattern.   References:  [1] Fasset C. I. and Head J. W.
