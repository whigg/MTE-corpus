RE-EXAMINING THE MAIN ASTEROID BELT AS THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF ANCIENT LUNARCRATERS. David A. Minton1, James E. Richardson1, and Caleb I. Fassett2 1Purdue University Department of Earth,Atmospheric, & Planetary Sciences, 550 Stadium Mall Drive, West Lafayette, IN 47907 2Department of Astronomy,Mount Holyoke College, South Hadley, MA 01075 (daminton@purdue.edu)Introduction. It has been hypothesized that the impactors that created the majority of the observable craterson ancient lunar highlands were derived from the mainasteroid belt [1]. An alternative hypothesis, dubbed theE-belt hypothesis, postulates that a destabilized inner extension of the main asteroid belt produced only the sequence of basins beginning with Nectaris, along with theassociated small craters [2]. We investigate these hypotheses with a Monte Carlo code called the CrateredTerrain Evolution Model (CTEM), which models the topography of a terrain that has experienced bombardmentdue to an input impactor population. We take advantageof recent advances in understanding the scaling relationships between impactor size (Di) and final crater size(Df ) for basin-sized impact craters (Df > 300 km) inorder to use large impact basins as a constraint on theancient impact flux on the Moon. Our goal is to testthe hypothesis that impactors with the main belt asteroid SFD can produce the observed lunar highlands craterSFD, either in total, or for the more limited bombardmentsuggested by the E-belt hypothesis.Our comparison data set is the catalog of all observedlunar craters with D > 20 km obtained using the LunarOrbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) aboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft [3]. Our impactor population uses the most up-to-date size-frequency distribution (SFD) for the main asteroid belt as obtained by theWide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) [4]. For impactor sizes below 4 km, where WISE data becomes unreliable due to biases, we use the main belt SFD derivedfrom a commonly-used collisional evolution model result [5].We studied this problem in two steps. First we performed a series of regional simulations designed to determine the level of cratering needed to reproduce the totalabundance of mid-sized (20–130 km) craters found onthe lunar highlands. We next performed a similar set ofruns for a global lunar surface using the observed lunarbasins as a constraint.The CTEM code. A powerful Monte Carlo code forstudying the evolution of cratered terrains has recentlybeen developed, called the Cratered Terrain EvolutionModel (CTEM) [6]. We used CTEM to model the cratering history of the lunar highlands by bombarding simulated lunar surfaces with a main belt asteroid impactorpopulation.To determine the size of a crater from the parametersof a given impact event, CTEM uses the general solutionto the transient crater volume scaling relationship givenby Eq. 19 in Holsapple et al. (1993) [7], which includesboth gravity and strength terms. For basin-sized impactswe use a recently developed scaling relationship for lunar basins based on hydrocode simulations, with a smalladjustment to relate crustal annulus to rim-to-rim diameter [8].Our adopted basin scaling relationship from [8] is defined for two mantle thermal profiles, a weaker, warmerupper mantle (TP1), and a colder, stronger upper mantle (TP2). Because the near-side crust is thinner andpossibly warmer due to higher abundances of radioactive nuclides within the Procellarum KREEP terrain [9],this thermal dependence means that the size of basinsthat form on the near side tend to be larger than thoseon the far side for a given impactor size. This effecthas been seen in data returned by the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) spacecraft [10].We choose to apply either the TP1 or TP2 scaling relationship for a given crater with a 50% probability to reflect the hemispherical dichotomy of the Moon, and weonly apply our basin scaling relationship for impactorswith Di > 35 km. As an example, using this relationship, the 930 km Orientale basin can be producedby a Di = 80 km impactor with vi = 15 km s−1 intocold upper mantle (TP2). The 1160 km Imbrium basin isproduced by a similar impactor into warm upper mantle(TP1).Lunar highlands simulations. The total amount of cratering for an individual simulation is parameterized by aquantity we define as the “production function averagedmass,” M¯pf . This is the weighted mass of the entire production function at all sizes (excluding Ceres). A valueof M¯pf = 1022 g is equivalent to N>10 km = 37 usingour main belt asteroid SFD.Craters in the size range 90.5–128 km make for auseful diagnostic for determining how many impacts arerequired to match the regional lunar highlands crateringrecord, because the relative crater density, or R-value, forthis size range is at a peak. For our regional lunar highlands simulations, we determine what fraction of runs fora given value of M¯pf produce the observed D ≃ 100 kmcrater density. For our global simulations, we adopt theconstraint that we must produce no more than 50 basinswith Df > 300 km, 1 with Df > 1200 km (the size ofImbrium), and no basins larger than 2500 km (the size ofSPA) [3, 11, 12].We also performed a similar set of simulations totest the E-belt hypothesis. Under the E-belt hypothesisa destabilized primordial inner extension of the main asteroid belt, plus a small contribution from the main belt,could supply enough large impactors to produce the sequence of basins beginning with Nectaris [2]. We againperformed a set of regional simulations to determinethe total amount of cratering by a main belt-like SFDneeded to reproduce crater abundances on Nectarian-age2660.pdf

terrains. We then performed a global simulation to determine whether the basin constraint was met. For ourregional runs we use the constraint that crater densityon Nectaris basin is N(64) = 17 ± 5 and N(20) =135± 14 [13]. Our global simulations use the constraintthat we must produce no more than 14 basins [13], andnone with Df > 1200 km (the size of Imbrium).For each set of conditions we performed 100–1000CTEM simulations of the lunar surface. We tallied thecountable craters in each simulation and determine howmany of the simulations satisfy our constraints.Results. For our total lunar highlands simulations,Fig. 1 shows the fraction that fit our constraints as a function of M¯pf . None of 500 runs with M¯pf = 5 × 1022 gsatisfied the regional constraint, but 42 ± 6.5% of runswith M¯pf = 6 × 1022 g satisfied it. However, forM¯pf = 5 × 1022 g, only 1.6 ± 0.6% of runs satisfiedthe basin constraint, and only 0.6± 0.35% of runs satisfied it for M¯pf = 6× 1022 g. 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 0  1  2  3  4  5  6Fraction of runs that satisfy constraintProduction function averaged mass (×1022 g)Global: Basin constraintRegional: N90.5-128 km constraintFigure 1: Fraction of CTEM total lunar highlands runsthat satisfy our constraints as a function of productionfunction averaged mass, M¯pf .The E-belt simulation results are shown in Fig. 2.The fraction runs for a given value of M¯pf that produced the observed values of N(20) and N(64) for Nectaris [13] are plotted as green triangles and red squaresrespectively. The N(20) densities were more constraining than N(64), and suggest values of M¯pf = 1.75–2.25 × 1022 g in order to reach the observed crater densities on Nectaris. For our E-belt global basin constraint,we require that runs produce no more than 14 basins withDf > 300 km, and none with Df > 1200 km. The fraction of runs for a given value of M¯pf that satisfied thebasin constraint is plotted as black circles in Fig. 2. Only5 ± 2.2% of runs at M¯pf = 1.75 × 1022 g satisfied thebasin constraint, and 1.5 ± 0.4% of runs satisfied it atM¯pf = 2.25× 1022 g. 0.01 0.1 1 0.5  1  1.5  2  2.5  3Fraction of runs that satisfy constraintProduction function averaged mass (×1022 g)Global: Basin constraintRegional: N(64) constraintRegional: N(20) constraintFigure 2: Fraction of CTEM E-belt runs that satisfy ourconstraints as a function of production function averagedmass, M¯pf .Our results suggest that the main asteroid belt SFDis a poor model for reproducing the observed lunar highlands crater population. This is due to the relative abundance within the main asteroid belt of objects with whichproduce lunar basins larger than Imbrium compared withobjects that produces Df ≃ 100 km and smaller craters.This implies that the small body population that crateredthe lunar highlands had a significantly larger ratio of objects that create mid-sized craters relative to megabasinsthan the modern main asteroid belt.References[1] Strom R.G. et al.
