Introduction:  Carbon is the fourth-most abundant chemical  element in the universe,  yet, on Earth, it is not even in the top ten. Obviously, carbon was strongly depleted on Earth as a consequence of volatile loss in the inner solar nebula and during planetary formation. The carbon chemistry in the protosolar disk is complex and not fully understood and is likely to result in isotopic fractionation [1]. Because the isotopic composition of carbon on Earth agrees  remarkably well  with that  of  primitive  meteorites,  it  is  generally  assumed that the terrestrial and meteoritic carbon isotopic composition is similar (but not identical) to that of the Sun and solar wind. A possible deviation between solar and solar-wind  composition  would  indicate  mass  dependent  fractionation  processes  in  solar-wind  evolution and and gravitational settling is likely to be small. So far all measurements of the solar carbon-isotopic ratio were accomplished via spectroscopic observations (for an overview see [2] and [3]). These determinations are based on measurements of CO absorption lines in the solar (photospheric) spectrum. Most of the previous results show that the solar value is similar to the terrestrial  one,  e.g.,  [3]  found  12C/13C =84  ± 5.  However, newer  measurements  showed  a  puzzling,  non-terrestrial value of  12C/13C =80 ± 1 [4] for the photospheric 12C/13C. This situation was reversed when that  group revised their value to 91.4 ± 1.3 [5] using much more sophisticated  3D  spectral  synthesis  of  rovibrational bands of  CO in the solar  photosphere.  Nevertheless, these  photospheric  models,  as  sophisticated  as  they may be, all necessarily need to make certain assumptions.  Critically,  the  CO column density  is  quadratically  sensitive  to  the  absolute  abundance  of  oxygen [4], the results presented in these studies also depend strongly on it. The O abundance has undergone several dramatic revisions in the past decade [e.g., 6], motivating us to perform the study presented here which uses in situ solar wind data which are much less model dependent.  Furthermore,  Genesis  has  not yet  published values  for  the  solar  wind  12C/13C ratio  because  of  a background of CO2H from ion-molecular reactions of the extracted CO2 with H from the walls of the vacuum chamber [7]. SOHO/CELIAS/MTOF [8] has published in situ solar wind isotopic composition data, however, MTOF can not  be used to determine  the solar  wind carbon  isotopic  composition  because  it  is  an isochronous  time-of-flight  instrument.  It  contains  a carbon foil consisting of terrestrial carbon. Solar wind ions impinging on the foil have a certain probability to knock  one  of  the  foil  carbon  atoms  out  of  the  foil. Sometimes this knock-on atom is a charged ion. The key property of isochronous mass spectrometers which gives them their excellent  mass resolution is that the ion's energy and exit angle do not influence the time of flight because they fly through a harmonic potential. Therefore, a knock-on ion will result in the same time of  flight  as  a  solar  wind ion of  the  same mass (per charge).  This  property  results  in  a  very  high  background of  foil  carbon,  invalidating an  accurate  solar wind C isotope measurement. Data Selection: We accumulated five years (2001, 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2007) worth of slow (340 km/s < vsw < 500 km/s) solar wind data from the Solar Wind Ion  Composition  Spectrometer  (SWICS)  [9]  on  the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) [10]. We selected  slow wind  because  it  is  generally  cooler  and thus has a narrower velocity distribution function than the hot fast wind from high-speed streams. The slow wind  is  also  generally  more  fractionated  than  fast wind, so it gives us the best opportunity to search for isotopic  fractionation  in  the  solar  wind  acceleration process. No attempt was made to exclude interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). These are generally much more variable in composition than the ordinary solar wind [11], but it is still not known whether they  systematically  fractionate  the  solar  wind.  The strongly fractionated May 1998 ICME showed no isotopic fractionation [12]. We intend to extend the analysis described below to the full data set in the near future which will help reduce the statistical uncertainties. Figure 1: E-T matrix showing multiple solar wind ions. The rare 13C6+ isotope lies between the much more abundant 12C6+ and 16O7+ ions.  Data Analysis: A solar wind ion is determined by its mass,  m, charge,  q,  and energy,  E.  SWICS  measures these quantities by a combination of  E/q-selection,  time-of-flight,  T,  and total  energy,  E,  measurement. Thus, in a given E/q step, every ion fills a unique peak region in E-T space, as can be seen in Fig. 1. We have  carefully  characterized  this  peak  for  all  solar wind ions and subsequently used this information in a Poisson-statistics-based  Maximum-Likelihood  inversion to determine the flux of individual solar ions. The narrow E/q passband allows for crude m/q discrimination during cold solar wind conditions under the assumption that  the bulk solar wind flows at  the same speed.  We used this  property  to select  the  12C6+ and 13C6+ ions and to reduce the background of more abundant ions such as 16O7+ or 16O6+ by selecting only a limited number of E/q bins surrounding the  12C6+ and 13C6+ ions. From the inverted counts we computed the  12C6+ and 13C6+ differential fluxes which were summed to determine  their  overall  flux.  We  developed  a  detailed mathematical model for SWICS which gives us the detection efficiencies of all solar wind ions [13]. We applied this to  the individual  12C6+ and 13C6+ differential fluxes  in  the solar  wind speed  bins selected  for  this study.  We  found  a  slight  instrumental  bias  of  ~4% which is nearly independent of solar wind speed and corrected for it in our analysis. This correction is the single-most  important  contribution  to  the  systematic uncertainties in our results discussed below. Results: We determined the solar wind 12C/13C ratio in four velocity bins , 340 - 380, 380 - 420, 420 - 460, and 460 - 500 km/s and show the results in Fig. 2. The  four  measurements  all  lie  around  the  terrestrial value (indicated by a thin line) and no significant trend can be seen. The four points are consistent with a constant  value  of   13C/12C = 0.010335  ±  0.00207 (thick solid line) and with the terrestrial value. Their uncertainties are determined  by statistical and systematic effects, the shaded area shows the 1-σ uncertainty of the weighted  average.  Statistical  uncertainties  are  of  the order  of  3% and thus of  the order  of  maximum expected  isotopic  fractionation  in  the  solar  wind  and gravitational  settling.  Systematic  uncertainties  come mainly from the efficiency model discussed above, uncertainties in the exact  peak shape in  E-T space, and from the complex inversion process [14]. Discussion: The weighted average 12C/13C = 97.7 ± 10 is higher than but still consistent with the terrestrial ratio of  12C/13C = 89.2. Nevertheless, the tendency of the points to being enriched in  12C lends further support  to  the  evolving  evidence  from Genesis  that  the Sun is isotopically light. Summary and Conlusions: We have determined the  12C/13C isotopic ratio in the slow solar  wind and found a value which is consistent with but isotopically lighter the terrestrial  value. We expect to extend this study  to  the  full  ACE/SWICS data  set  in  the  future which will reduce the statistical uncertainties reported here. References: [1] Woods P.M. and Willacy K.
