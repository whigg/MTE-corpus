	  Hydrodynamic Escape does not Prevent the "Wet" Moon Formation.  M. Nakajima and D. J.

Email: mnakajima@caltech.edu   Summary: Despite the very high temperatures of the disk from which the Moon formed, hydrodynamic escape of hydrogen is severely limited for two main reasons: the limited lifetime of the disk (hundreds to thousands of years), and the collisions with oxygen atoms (i.e., diffusion-limited escape). As a consequence, the amount of hydrogen that escapes is small compared to the amount that would be plausibly present (e.g. 1000 ppm) and there is insignificant D/H fractionation. Loss of heavier elements can be larger (as a fraction of their starting abundances) if present at much lower abundance than water. Nevertheless, if the lunar potassium loss by hydrodynamic escape is unimportant, the depletion is accordingly attributed to differential accretion within an essentially closed system rather than escape to infinity.  Introduction:  According to the standard giant impact hypothesis, the Moon is thought to have formed by a collision between the early Earth and a Mars-size impactor [1-3]. This impact created a partially vaporized disk around the planet, from which the Moon was accreted. This model has been favored because it can explain several observed features, but it cannot easily explain the identical isotopic ratios between the Earth and Moon. This is because most of the disk materials come from the impactor, which presumably had different compositions from the Earth. To overcome this problem, several new impact models have been suggested. Ćuk and Stewart suggest that a small impactor hit a rapidly rotating Earth [4] while Canup suggest two objects with half Earth size collide with each other [5]. In these models, the composition of the disk is similar to that of the planet, therefore the isotopic similarly could be explained. These recent models create a disk with higher temperature (up to 6000-7000K) and vapor mass fraction (80-90%), with respect to the standard scenario (up to 4000-5000K, 20-30%) [6-7]. This is because the kinetic energy involved in the impact is greater than the other case.   From this partially vaporized disk, volatiles are thought to be lost or inefficiently accreted throughout the Moon accretion. This is indicated by the lunar small K/Th ratio  (~360) compared to other terrestrial bodies (~5500)  (K is much more volatile than Th) [810]. It has been suggested that a hydrodynamic escape caused this volatile loss. Hydrogen (as H or H2 but derived from H2O) is expected to escape from the disk efficiently due to its small mass. This can then drag along heavier elements such as potassium through collisions. It has been suggested that most of H, and hence water, was lost from the Moon, which formed the "dry" Moon [11]. This significant escape of hydrogen would mean that the water we see in the Moon arrived later (e.g., collisions with icy planetesimals). However, although the water content of the Moon is a subject to controversy, recent analysis on an early lunar crust suggests that the Moon may have contained as high as 10,000 ppm of water [12]. Additionally, the escape of hydrogen could increase the D/H ratio of the Moon to the extent that there is fractionation during escape. However, a recent study suggests that the Moon's original D/H ratio may have been approximately the same as the terrestrial value after removing the effects of cosmic-ray spallation and degassing processes [13].  Thus, a more satisfactory explanation is needed for the behavior of Moon's hydrogen. Here, we estimate the upper limit of the amount of hydrogen escape given that the initial disk contains a similar or possibly smaller amount of hydrogen compared to the Earth. The disk model used here is based on the suggested giant impact models. The key questions are whether the escape is significant enough to leave observable signatures of the water loss and the D/H enrichment of the Moon as well as the depletion of other elements (e.g., potassium). Note that minor hydrogen loss does not imply insignificant loss of a heavier element, because the significance of the loss depends on its initial abundance in the reservoir.  Method & Model:  In the upper reaches of the disk atmosphere, most of the heavier elements associated with the silicates and heavy oxides are condensed, so the major components present are hydrogen H and the oxygen O that comes from water. Accordingly, we assume O is the dominant heavy element in the disk. H is escaping from this O-rich and isothermal disk throughout the Moon accretion. The extent of H loss is estimated by solving a continuity equation and momentum equation. The model is based on the previous study developed for hydrodynamic escape from a planetary atmosphere [14]. The parameters are the disk temperature (Tdisk=2000K-7000K), lifetime of the disk (τdisk=200 and 1000 yrs), and the initial water content f (=1000 ppm [15] and 100 ppm). These ranges of Tdisk and τdisk cover the suggested impact models. The initial D/H ratio is set to 1.5×10-4 [16].  2770.pdf

In a diffusion-limited escape, the lighter element (H) escapes and the dominant heavy element (O) stays in the system [17]. The criterion for the diffusion-limited escape is described as   (3)  where, φ is the hydrogen flux, m1 is the hydrogen mass, g is the gravitational acceleration, k is the Boltzmann constant, and b is the diffusion coefficient. With the given range of Tdisk, φ satisfies this criterion. Therefore, the escape is diffusion-limited. The total amount of escaping hydrogen is estimated assuming the flux is time-independent (for the first order approximation). Figure 1A shows the water content in the resulting Moon. The figure shows that even for an extremely escaping condition (Tdisk=7000K, τdisk =1000 yrs), the loss of water is insignificant (~ 30 ppm). Figure 1B shows the lunar D/H ratio. Although it shows an enhancement of the D/H in the extreme condition, the increase of the D/H is minor and within the range of those of carbonaceous chondrites.  This minor hydrogen escape means that the observed water content of the Moon could be due to accretion of Earth-like material rather than later additions by impacts. Considering the fact that the Moonforming disk contains heavier elements than oxygen, even less hydrogen escapes from the system than we estimated. Therefore, the hydrodynamic escape is consistent with the so-called "wet (water abundant) Moon" hypothesis. Loss of other volatile elements, such K, requires further investigation because the K/Th ratio highly depends on the initial amounts of the elements in the reservoir.  As an alternative of the hydrodynamic escape, incomplete accretion may be a mechanism for the volatile loss. After the disk formation, the region exterior to the Roche radius cools more quickly than the inner part, because the part has a larger surface area and because the inner part continues to be heated by its viscous spreading while the outer part does not [18]. This leads to a Moon formation outside of the Roche radius. Some studies suggest that the inner part of the disk, which may remain partially vaporized, falls back to the Earth due to the disk-Moon interaction [19-21]. But if this is the case, the Moon may not lose its volatile materials, because the Moon would mainly form from the outer part of the disk, which should contain as much volatiles as the Earth. Therefore, it is not clear whether this model can explain the Moon's volatile loss. A more complete explanation for the volatile loss is required.
