MODELING CORE CRACKING, A KEY FACTOR IN THE GEOPHYSICAL EVOLUTIONAND HABITABILITY OF CERES. M. Neveu1, S. J. Desch1, and J. C. Castillo-Rogez2. 1Schoolof Earth and Space Exploration, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287, USA. 2Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91109, USA. (mneveu@asu.edu).The Importance of Core Cracking: Cracking of the rocky core of icy bodies could represent amajor stage in their evolution. The cracking depthdetermines the core cooling timescale, because thecirculation of aqueous fluids through fractures andchanges in core porosity affect heat transfer. Theextent of cracking also influences the temperatureT , confining pressure Pc, and water:rock ratio atwhich water and rock interact. The resulting chemistry determines the amount of chemical energy andnutrients available for life, and feeds back on fluidand rock properties. Therefore, core cracking needsto be properly modeled.We present a model to (a) quantify the extentof cracking in icy body cores, and (b) infer T , Pc,and the bulk water:rock ratio at which water-rockreactions may take place. This model requires inputfrom a thermal evolution code [1,2] that providestemperature and structure profiles inside icy bodiesover time. We applied our model to Ceres (radius475 km, density 2.1 g cm−3, semi-major axis 2.8AU), about to be visited by the Dawn spacecraft.Core Cracking Model: To our knowledge,there exists only one model of core cracking onicy bodies [3], despite the importance of this phenomenon. In this model, the silicate core of an icybody contracts as it cools. Grains of different minerals contract at different rates, causing stress andcracking. Cracks heal if the temperature and pressure are high enough for rock to be ductile. Building on the model of Vance et al., we have includedother processes by which cracking may occur, basedon models of hydrothermal systems on Earth.Thermal expansion mismatch. Core crackingcan occur if the core heats up and expands; thisis the reverse process of that studied by Vance etal. [3] (Fig. 1a). Thermal evolution models suggest that core temperatures for Ceres increase forthe first ∼2 Gyr after its accretion, because heatingby long-lived radionuclide decay exceeds cooling byconduction. Past 2 Gyr, cooling prevails. We modeled thermal mismatch using the equations of [3].Thermal pressurization of pore water. If a corewith pore water is heated, the water expands to ahigher extent than the silicate matrix (Fig. 1b).The pore pressure increase over Pc, dPpore, due toa temperature increase dT is given by:Figure 1: Cracking phenomena included in ourmodel. a. Thermal expansion mismatch of mineralgrains. b. Thermal pressurization of pore water.c. Swelling of rock upon hydration. d. Dissolutionand precipitation of mineral species.dPpore =αw(T, Pc)βw(T, Pc)dT (1)where αw and βw are the expansivity and compressibility of pure liquid water. A multiplicative term(1 + 2 bp/ap) accounts for the geometry of elliptical pores of minor and major axes ap and bp [4].Moreover, relaxation of the rock matrix can mitigate thermal pressurization: a termbpap3(1−2ν)E isthen added to βw, where E and ν are the rock'sYoung modulus and Poisson ratio [5].Rock swelling during hydration. Incorporationof water molecules into a dry rock matrix results inswelling of the rock (Fig. 1c). The correspondingchange in crack width ∆D of a 2-D crack after atime ∆t can be expressed as:∆D = −2[(ρhydr.ρdry)−1/3− 1]×Rhydr. ×∆t (2)where ρhydr. and ρdry are the densities of hydratedand dry rock, and Rhydr. is the velocity of the hydration front into a rock layer. If hydration swellingcauses a crack of width D to close, residual swellinggenerates compression stresses σ that can open newcracks. The stress σ is given by Hooke's law, σ =E�, where � = (∆D − D)/(Rhydr. ∆t) is the compression strain.1120.pdf

Figure 2: Orange curves: Phase diagram of purewater. Black curves: Pressure-temperature (P−T )profiles inside Ceres obtained using the thermal evolution model of [2]. Dashed curves: Brittle-ductiletransition (BDT) for serpentinite in two cases. TheBDT occurs near the critical temperature of water:since cracks occur in the brittle zone, we neglectsupercritical processes in cracks.Dissolution of mineral species. As fluids reactwith minerals, dissolution can erode cracks, whereasprecipitation clogs them (Fig. 1d). The resultingchange in crack width after a time ∆t is given by:∆D =N species∑i=1Ri ρw ∆t Vi(T, P )A/V(3)where ρw is the density of water, Vi is the mineralmolar volume, A/V = 2/D is the crack area-tovolume ratio, and Ri is the rate of dissolution:Ri = (A/V ) ki diss.(1− QiKi(T, P ))(4)with ki diss. an experimental rate constant, and Qiand Ki the activity product and equilibrium constant of the dissolution reaction [6]. A negativerate indicates precipitation. We consider only threespecies for simplicity: aqueous silica, carbonate,and chrysotile serpentine.Brittle-ductile transition in hydrated rock. Therock strength at which rock yields to stresses is thelower of its brittle and ductile strengths. We adoptbrittle strength parameters for serpentinite (coefficient of friction, frictional cohesive strength) from[7], and ductile flow parameters (grain size exponent, diffusion creep activation energy and volume)from [8]. We do not allow cracks to persist in theductile regime past a time (strain rate)−1.Other phenomena: Thermal expansion of therock matrix, fluid pressure changes linked to conduit size, elastic relaxation of cracks, anisotropy inrock properties, species transport, and, most importantly, supercritical processes [9] were not included.Fig. 2 shows that supercritical processes may notmatter much for Ceres, because the Pc − T conditions at which rock is brittle are in the subcriticalliquid region of the water phase diagram.Depth of Cracking: With nominal parametervalues, cracks occur everywhere in Ceres' core. Themain cracking process is pore thermal pressurization, which fractures the lower 80-90% of the corethat are most strongly heated. The upper 5-20%of the core are cracked from grain expansion mismatch, stronger at lower Pc. The former processdoes not occur past 2 Gyr, once Ceres' core ceasesheating [1]. Subsequent crack persistence dependson the crack healing timescale, which itself is sensitive to the mineral grain size d. For d = 0.5 mm,cracks remain open on Gyr timescales in the upper 50% of the core (100-200 km; Fig. 2). However, cracks heal faster for smaller d. If d ∼ 5µm[10], only the upper 50-100 km of the core remaincracked after 100 Myr. These results do not accountfor species dissolution and precipitation, which happen on much smaller timescales.Water:rock ratio: Our thermal evolution models predict that a liquid layer 5 km deep in contactwith the core could persist to the present day, provided Ceres accreted 1% ammonia antifreeze withrespect to water. If all the liquid can interact withall the cracked rock, the resulting bulk water:rockratio is of order 0.01 by mass. Thus, very littlewater may have reacted with rock. However, thisratio may be higher if more ice is melted, a possible outcome if hydrothermal circulation leads toenhanced heat transfer from the core into the iceshell. We plan to investigate this by fully couplingour thermal evolution and cracking codes.Acknowledgements: We thank the Keck Institute for Space Studies and the NASA Astrobiology Institute for funding this study.References: [1] Castillo-Rogez J.
