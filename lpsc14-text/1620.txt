Introduction: Scapolite is a common terrestrial hydrothermal, metamorphic, and metasomatic mineral which forms by the reaction of plagioclase and a Cl- or CO2-rich fluid [1-3]. It is less common as a primary igneous phase, but has been reported as megacrysts, phenocrysts, and oikocrysts in alkali-rich basaltic magmas [4-6]. Based on reflectance spectra, scapolite has also been suggested to exist on the surface of Mars as a possible alteration mineral [7].  Scapolite has three main end member compositions: marialite (Na4Al3Si9O24Cl), meionite (Ca4Al6Si6O24CO3), and mizzonite (~NaCa3Al5Si7O24CO3) [e.g., 1]. Unlike other-chloride bearing minerals (such as apatites, amphiboles, and micas), scapolite contains little to no OH.  The chemistry of scapolite can therefore be used as a tracer of the Cl and CO2 contents of the fluid responsible for its formation, independent of fH2O [2-3, 8].  Here we report the first occurrence of Cl-scapolite in a martian meteorite - in a melt inclusion in olivine in Nakhla - and use terrestrial metamorphic experiments and modeling to constrain its origin.  Sample: During a study of melt inclusions in Nakhla [9], Cl-scapolite was found, as an ~100 m-long patch, within one large melt inclusion in olivine (Fig. 1). Following repolishing to remove beam damage caused by high-current X-ray mapping and grid analysis, the scapolite was analyzed using 15 KeV and 10 nA beam current [9].   Fig. 1.  Melt inclusion NK12A1 in Nakhla, from [9].  Combined potassium x-ray map (orange) and BEI.  The melt inclusion containing the Cl-scapolite (Fig. 1) is dominated by high-Ca pyroxene, K-feldspar and K-rich glass, with minor chromite, Fe-sulfides, Fe-Ti oxides, and alteration material [9]. The occurrence of the scapolite appears to be texturally equivalent to the K-feldspar or the glass (i.e., interstitial to the pyroxenes), and may therefore be replacing, or contemporaneous with, one of these phases. It contains ~3.9 wt.% Cl, and has the formula (Na2.8Ca0.7K0.3)3.9(Si8.3Al3.7)12ClO24.  It is almost pure end-member marialite with little meionite component (Fig. 2). We did not analyze for C or S, but the scapolite contains enough Cl to preclude the presence of significant CO3 or SO4.   Fig. 2.

Martian scapolite from this study is shown for comparison (red).  Martian vs terrestrial. Alteration materials found in the nakhlites are thought to be both martian and terrestrial in origin [10-13]. The scapolite is found within an olivine-hosted melt inclusion that shows minor to moderate evidence for fracturing. The scapolite occurs well within the melt inclusion and is not adjacent to any large fractures. It is adjacent to the alteration material (labeled "iddingsite") which is thought to be martian in origin [11-13].  Cl- scapolite forms at conditions > 700 º C at 1 bar [8, 14-17], while terrestrial alteration would occur at surface temperatures and pressures. Therefore, based on textural and chemical arguments, we infer that the scapolite formed  in the martian crust and not as a product of terrestrial alteration. Cl-Scapolite Formation. Scapolite chemistry reflects the formation conditions and fluid composition (Fig 2.; [1-3]). We can use the chemistry of the martian scapolite, compared with terrestrial scapolite of known origin, to constrain its formation conditions. The scapolite in Nakhla is almost pure end-member marialite. Terrestrial marialite typically forms by hydrothermal activity of a brine with a high mole fraction of NaCl in the fluid [8] but it can also form as a late stage igneous phase occurring in the mesostastis or melt inclusions [4-6]. In terrestrial systems, the Cl may have been original to the system or introduced from an outside source through fluid migration [2]. From experimental results and natural systems, it has been shown that marialite is stable at 700 - 850 ºC at 1bar [14]. Much more is known about the C- bearing scapolites, which are stable to much higher temperatures and pressures and are consistent with hydrothermal to lowgrade metamorphic conditions [1]. Therefore, by analogy to terrestrial scapolites, the Cl-rich scapolite in Nakhla is consistent with formation during hydrothermal, and/or late-stage igneous, activity at a minimum temperature of 700 ºC. Conditions of Hydrothermal Alteration, Comparison with Alteration Mineralogy: We can compare the temperature recorded by the scapolite with recent estimates for conditions of formation of other alteration minerals in the Nakhla based on thermochemical modeling [18]. Bridges and Schwenzer [18] show that the Fe-rich carbonates precipitated from a CO2-rich brine at 150-200 ºC. The brine continued to cool until 50 ºC, at which point Fe-phyllosilicates precipitated. The temperature of hydrothermal activity recorded by the Cl-scapolite is > 700 ºC, significantly higher than the temperatures recorded by the alteration minerals. Further, the alteration minerals record a CO2rich fluid, while the Cl-scapolite forms from a Cl-rich, CO2-poor brine (otherwise we would have mizzinite or meonite instead of marialite). This could suggest that the phases are not related and may suggest a late stage igneous origin instead of hydrothermal origin for the scapolite. However, the alteration material is found adjacent to the scapolite, suggesting that they may be related and the Cl-scapolite simply records a higher temperature stage of the alteration.  Implications for Habitability: In order to evaluate the potential for habitability within the martian crust, it is vital to understand the temperature, duration, and composition of any fluids present [e.g., 19]. Orbiter and lander missions have revealed extensive evidence of hydrous minerals on the surface that precipitated from acidic to neutral pH and cold to warm temperature waters [20-23]. Mars Science Laboratory has already found evidence for near-neutral pH water in an ancient stream bed and from hydrous minerals [24-25]. Alteration minerals in the nakhlites have also revealed evidence for martian CO2-rich fluids at temperatures < 150-200 ºC [18]. Here we show that the fluid forming scapolite in Nakhla was warmer than previous estimates for martian fluids and was Cl-rich and not CO2rich. Any potential biologic activity would have to deal with high temperatures and saline fluids. Conclusions: We report the first occurrence of Clrich scapolite in a martian meteorite. The Cl-rich scapolite in Nakhla is consistent with formation from either a late stage Cl-rich, water-poor magma or magmatic Cl-rich hydrothermal brine at a minimum temperature of 700 ºC.
