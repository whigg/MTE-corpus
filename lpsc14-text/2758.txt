Introduction:  Flood basalts are a common feature of all the terrestrial planets, representing a ubiquitous process of heat escape from rocky bodies. Comparative planetology studies of these large igneous provinces have focused on the morphology of individual volcanic structures and flow features in order to understand the differences and similarities among endogenic processes operating through the history of the solar system. On the Earth, Venus, and Mars, a plethora of young distinct eruptive units are readily available for study. On the Moon, the low eruptive magma viscosity and resulting thin nature of lava units allows a 5- to 15-m thick regolith to subdue and mask the majority of individual flow morphologies [1]. A distinct exception are a series of 50 – 100 m thick, Eratosthenian-period flow lobes that extend across much of central Mare Imbrium [2].   Earth based 70 cm (P-band) radar signals can probe well beneath the mare regolith surface to provide information on the rocky transition zone situated just above the intact basaltic bedrock (Fig. 1). An investigation of Mare Serenitatis by [1] using recently acquired radar images identified a host of previously unseen volcanic features. These included flow-unit boundaries, and channels interpreted to be the collapsed remnants of plumbing systems similar to those of terrestrial basaltic volcanic fields. Another important result was the improved delineation of units for crater age dating, demonstrating the advantages of combining radar images with spectroscopically derived mare geologic-contact maps [e.g. 3,4]. Here we use the methodology of [1] to focus on Mare Imbrium (Fig. 1) in order to survey the range of volcanic features.  Radar Dataset & Methodology: We used P-band radar images of the lunar nearside obtained by transmitting a circular-polarized signal from the Arecibo Observatory and receiving echoes from the Moon in both senses of circular polarization at the Green Bank Telescope [5]. Radar returns in the same sense of circular polarization (SC) as that transmitted are attrib2758.pdf

uted to diffuse scattering by rocks >10 cm in diameter, at the surface and buried within the probing depth of the radar signal (10-15 m in the lowest-loss mare regolith). The Campbell et al. [1] Serenitatis study was the first to utilize the highest spatial resolution, 200 m/pixel P-band data for the nearside. This study contrasted the shallower-penetrating 12.6-cm radar images with the new 70-cm data to identify volcanic features differentiated by very subtle differences in TiO2 content. Applying the same techniques, we present new mapping of Mare Imbrium flow boundaries, particularly where TiO2 changes are subtle or masked by debris from large craters like Copernicus. Our study will also provide regional context for measurements made by the Chang’e 3 lander. Initial Study - South Imbrium Flow Feature: A lobate feature of enhanced radar backscatter is present  north of Monte Carpatus (Figs. 1, 2). This feature represents the strongest 70-cm echoes returned from any non-impact landform within Mare Imbrium. The feature is ~100 km long and ~200 km wide (Fig. 3), and its lobate morphology is suggestive of a lava flow complex. The feature is centered ~200 km southeast of the identified source of the >600 km long Eratosthenian lava flow units [2].  The presence of Copernicus ejecta across this part of Mare Imbrium (Fig. 1, 2) hampers studies in both visible (Fig. 1, 2) and near-IR spectroscopic data due to contamination of the mare surface by highland material. The ability of the P-band transmissions to probe beneath the thin Copernicus rays will offer a unique perspective on the regional geology.    References: [1] Campbell et al., (2014) JGR, In Press.
