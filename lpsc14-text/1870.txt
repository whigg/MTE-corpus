Introduction:  Samples of comets should retain the best preserved components of Solar System starting materials. Analysis of IDPs reveals their primitive nature, such as high presolar grains abundances [1,2,3] the presence of GEMS (Glass with Embedded Metal and Sulphides) [4,5] and primitive carbonaceous material [2,3,6,7,8]. These primitive features mean that IDPs provide access to samples of the early Solar System from bodies that are otherwise hard to access, and which may never have been sampled by meteorites. IDPs are composed of a complex mix of silicate and organic material and display a wide range of textures that provide clues about early Solar System reservoirs and mixing processes. This study focusses on a finegrained fragment from cluster particle 2 of collector L2071, hereafter named Balmoral1, on which multiple O isotope analyses were made along with H, C and N isotope analyses. The IDP was also investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) by removal of a section by FIB-milling. Methods: A FEI Quanta 200 3D DualBeam FIBSEM was used at The Open University to obtain an electron-transparent section of Balmoral1 by FIB-liftout. A Zeiss Supra 55V analytical FEG-SEM at the Open University was used to obtain high resolution, high magnification SE images.  The Open University NanoSIMS 50L was used to analyse H, C, N and O isotopes in imaging mode and O isotopes in spot mode using four separate analytical set-ups following similar protocols to [8,9]. Image data were combined and processed using Limage software (L. Nittler, Carnegie Institute of Washington).  HR-TEM imaging of the FIB-section was carried out at The Open University on a JEOL JEM 2100 at 200kV. The FIB-section was also examined at the University of Glasgow by LV-STEM using a Zeiss Sigma field-emission SEM operated at 20 kV/1 nA, following procedures of [10]. Results:  After pressing in gold, Balmoral1 is ~12x16 µm in size with a fine-grained texture (grains <<1 µm). Two spot analyses positioned at either end of Balmoral1, ~12 µm apart (Fig.1) gave O isotope ratios of δ17O, δ18O = 1.3 (±3.1), 1.6 (±1.1) ‰ for spot 1 and δ17O, δ18O = 56.0 (±3.0), 55.3 (±1.0) ‰ for spot 2 (Fig.1). Close inspection of the O isotope ratio map obtained prior to spot analyses revealed a region in the lower half of the particle enriched in the heavy isotopes of O.

ROI3 is the rest of the particle outside of the red region.   This heavy O isotope region (ROI 1; see Fig.2) is composed of two small regions (0.5 and 1 µm in size) approximately 3 µm apart, with δ17O, δ18O = 215 (±16), 198 (±14) ‰, (Fig.3) which are surrounded by a ~7 µm region (ROI 2) with a O isotope signature of δ17O, δ18O = 93.6 (±9.6), 88.8 (±5.8) ‰. The remainder of the particle (ROI 3) has δ17O, δ18O = 24.9 (±7.4), 13.5 (±5.8) ‰. ROI 1 and 2 both have C/H = 0.6 and ROI 3 = 1.2. δ13C and δ15N are within error for the two regions at ~-40 ‰ and ~250 ‰ respectively. δD = 502 (±112) ‰ for ROI2 and 1000 ‰ (± 34) for ROI3. It was not possible to obtain H, C and N isotope values for ROI1 due to its small size. Element ratios from NanoSIMS imaging (FeO, MgO, Si) reveal that ROI 2 does not have a composition between that of ROI 1 and 3, as might have been expected from its intermediate O isotope composition.

spatial extent) reveals Balmoral1 is composed of an aggregate of small grains (20-80 nm), held within areas of finer-grained and/or amorphous material that may be GEMS-like. The minerals present include clinopyroxene, olivine, pentlandite and orthopyroxene. Ni-bearing Fe-sulphides (pyrrhotite and pentlandite) and magnetite are also present in small quantities. There is no obvious mineralogical difference between ROI 2 and 3 and mineralogy is unknown for ROI 1.   Figure 3. Three-oxygen isotope plot for IDP Balmoral1.  Discussion: The O isotope ratios measured in ROI 1 and 2 of Balmoral1 are, when individual presolar grains are excluded, considerably more enriched in 17O and 18O than any ratios measured in IDPs (e.g. [9,11]), and much heavier than bulk meteorites. Heavy O isotope ratios of +200 ‰ have been reported in meteorite Acfer 094 in a poorly characterized phase (PCP; [12]), later named cosmic symplectite (CoS; [13]). The Balmoral1 TEM results reveal that the texture and mineralogy of CoS is not present in ROI 2 and while ROI 1 was not sectioned, FeO/MgO/Si ion ratios were sufficiently similar between ROI 1, 2 and 3 to indicate that ROI 1 was not similar to CoS. These element ratios also indicate that ROI 2 did not form by a simple mix of ROI 1 and 3 material and so may represent a separate heavy O component. The fact that the O isotope ratios of ROI 1 and 2 still differ by over 100 ‰ suggests that they either did not form from the same reservoir, or that the material forming one of the ROIs subsequently experienced a different history. The C and N isotopic signatures in ROI 2 and 3 are similar, suggesting they share a common organic reservoir, but their C/H ratios differ. δD differs by 500‰ with the heavy O region (ROI 1,2) being depleted in D. There is a subtle difference in texture between ROI 1,2 and ROI 3 with ROI1,2 being more compact, and the O isotope map shows a clear distinction between the ROIs. These results are somewhat puzzling and it is hard to pick apart the different components within Balmoral1 to make conclusions as to how they may have formed and be related. It is clear that the organic and silicate reservoirs are not related in a simple way. The low C/H of the heavy O isotope material, and the presence of pentlandite, that can  indicate an IDP is hydrated, is indicative of aqueous alteration. This region is also depleted in D whereas the surrounding material (ROI 3) is anhydrous with a more chondritic-like O signature but elevated D. There are sufficient differences to indicate that the very heavy O isotope ROIs in Balmoral1 did not form by the same formation mechanism as that proposed for CoS [12,13].  The rarity of this type of material and its presence in a CP-IDP, that most likely originated from a comet, suggests that this component formed at large heliocentric distance. As the level of 16O depletion is consistent with that expected from self shielding [e.g. 15], it is likely that this location was also close to that where O self-shielding effects were most pronounced (i.e. the outer solar nebula or even interstellar medium).  It would appear that ROI 2 was initially also ≈ +200‰ but experienced some aqueous alteration, interacting with a fluid more enriched in 16O and H which lowered the δ18O and δD but left a few small regions (ROI 1) unaffected. The results suggest that ROI 1 and 2 were incorporated into the material composing ROI 3 as a distinct clast that experienced alteration, presumably on the parent body. ROI 3 has an elevated O isotope signature in relation to chondrites which indicates that while it is primarily composed of fine-grained typical CP-IDP material (δ18O ≤ 0 ‰) with a significant chondritic-like fraction originating from the inner Solar System, it contains numerous small fragments of ROI 2 material (with unknown but high δ18O of ≥ +90 ‰). We propose that the Balmoral1 parent body formed in close proximity to the heavy O isotope reservoir(s) at large AU. The more chondriticlike O isotope dust in ROI 3 moved out to large AU by radial transport from the inner Solar System [16,17].
