DOCUMENTATION OF SAND RIPPLE PATTERNS AND RECENT SURFACE WINDS ON MARTIAN DUNES.  M. B. Johnson1 and J. R. Zimbelman1, 1Center for Earth and Planetary Studies, Smithsonian Institution (Independence Ave and Sixth Street SW, Washington, DC, 20013-7012; JohnsonMB@SI.edu)   Introduction:  Sand dunes have been shown to preserve wind flow patterns in their ripple formations on both Earth [1] and Mars [2]. This investigation, supported by NASA MDAP grant NNX12AJ38G, was created to document properties of existing ripples on martian dunes in order to assess the recent wind flows over the surface [3]. This information will provide insight into the modes of dune formation and add reasonable constraints to global circulation models. Sand Transport Background:  Observations of dune and ripple scale sand movements on Mars were first made by the Spirit rover [4]. Today, the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera provides unprecedented views of Mars, including abundant sand dunes and ripple patterns [2], with resolution as high as 25 cm/pixel [5]. However, the methods of sand transport are still debated. Wind speeds have yet to be measured in many areas and the complex structures and crest positions of dunes may be created by multiple wind directions or seasonal wind variations, which lead to ambiguities in dune interpretations. Resultant sharp crests and ripple patterns mapped by Neilson and Kocurek reveal that ripplescale patterns are a better indicator of recent wind flows which modify the principle crests (Fig. 1) [1]. The preservation of ripples in high resolution images offers the opportunity to document these recent wind flows on Mars. Methodology:  Martian study sites in this investigation are evaluated by the clarity of their available HiRISE frames and their location (longitude and latitude). Frames with stereo pairs are also preferred because of their ability to create digital terrain models in 3D modeling software. The resulting 14 frames studied to date (Table 1) are high resolution images of diverse areas across Mars. The ripple documentation method indicates the use of either the Java Mission-planning and Analysis for Remote Sensing (JMARS) geospatial information system (GIS) [6] or ESRI's Arc GIS. In both systems, lines were drawn perpendicular to ripple crests across three adjacent ripples in order to document ripple wavelength from line length and inferred wind direction from azimuth by the rule of maximum gross bedform-normal transport [7]. Because it is not possible in most areas to infer a unique wind direction, line orientations have a 180 degree ambiguity [8]. For example, a crest with a North-South alignment may have been constructed by an Easterly, Westerly, or bidirectional wind. Figure 2 is an example of these lines drawn on a dune in one HiRISE image. Note that due to the ambiguity, results will assume azimuths to be between 0 and 180 degrees. Actual orientations may be defined after further study by using information about dune morphology from terrestrial analogs.

Ripple patterns measured in June 1982 (top) and January 1983 (bottom) were used to identify winds modifying the star's principle crests. Fig. 2 of [1].

  Figure 2: Ripple mapping of HiRISE frame ESP_025645_1455 shown at two scales. The top image, centered at -34.25N, 138.47E, shows a partial view of the HiRISE frame with a white box outlining the relative location for the bottom image. Note that areas with clear ripple definition for tens of meters contain measurements while areas with overlapping patterns have been avoided.  Results:  The beginning stages of this study have yielded several preliminary results. The survey of the martian surface for study sites confirms that there are many types of dunes, including barchan and linear, in areas with adequate sand supply. The relationships seen between these dunes and their surface ripple orientations include flows parallel to the dune axis and linear termination zones (Fig. 3), which indicate the possibility of downwind elongation as seen in terrestrial studies [9]. Unclear and overlapping ripple patterns (Fig. 3) may indicate multiple dominant, perhaps seasonally varying, winds. Further study should expose additional ripple patterns of interest on Mars and allow for more terrestrial comparisons.  Figure 3: A partial view of HiRISE frame PSP_007663_1350 with three labeled ripple zones which indicate flow parallel to the dune axis (Zone 1), a linear termination zone (Zone 2), and a more complex area of overlapping ripples (Zone 3). This image is centered at -45N, 38.8E.  Summary:  With known ripple patterns and dune structures, information about the surface wind strength and direction may be inferred. HiRISE frames with adequate resolution provide the ability to document ripples for use with statistical analysis tools and wind rose programs. Conclusions from this study can be used to constrain martian global circulation models and make new comparisons between martian and terrestrial wind models. Stereo pairs will also be used to create 3D representations of some of these study sites. References:  [1] Neilson J. and Kocurek G. (1987) Geol. Soc. Am. Bull., 99, 177-186. [2] Ewing R. C. et al.
