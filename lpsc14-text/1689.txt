Intensive study of volcanic AL and laboratory experiments [6] revealed crucial conditions allowing accretion of fine particles into aggregates: 1) collisions of particles within a high density dusty flow; 2) presence of a binding agent, usually liquid water, ice, or electrostatic forces. During volcanic eruptions, these conditions are fulfilled by a turbulent Plinian cloud or within pyroclastic density currents. AL in impact ejecta are much more rarely described in ejecta deposits and cannot be observed forming in situ; hence, their origin is debatable. Three possible scenarios are usually considered: formation within an ejecta plume rising above the growing crater [7], accretion within a turbulent ejecta curtain [8], and formation in a density current associated with ejecta propagation [9]. In this paper we consider AL forming during re-entry of ejecta in the upper atmosphere.  AL in terrestrial craters: Although AL have been identified from a number of impact structures, the AL in ejecta deposits related to the Sudbury impact event have excellent preservation in sites ranging from 480 to 750 km from the impact crater [2]. The AL tend to be 1-2 cm in diameter with multiple accreted zones.  Although the largest AL are located closest to the impact site, the size variation is not extreme between the most proximal distal sites. Internal layers each tend to have a fining-out structure. The AL are distinct from crater infill accretionary clasts, which have evidence of multiple accretion events [10]. Other deposits of AL (e.g., Stac Fada [9], Alamo Breccia [11], or Chicxulub [3]) appear to have similar structures, although they tend to be less frequent and are often poorly preserved. Deposits provide important constraints on AL formation, but are not independently sufficient to model their formation.  Fig. 1. Accretionary lapillus of the Sudbury impact event.  Lapilli have a fining-out pattern and typical internal grain sizes of < 200 µm. Numerical model: We model ejecta re-entry into the atmosphere with the 3D hydrocode SOVA [12] using mainly its "dusty flow" subroutines. Particles are treated as solid non-deformable; they move through the atmosphere and exchange momentum and energy (including heat transfer via conduction and convection) with surrounding gases. Radiative transfer is also included although it plays a minor role for re-entry velocities below 4 km/s. Details of the procedure may be found in [13].  Initial conditions for re-entry (mass flux of ejecta velocities and re-entry angles) are derived from craterforming models. We use a power law SFD N>m~m-b with the exponent b of 0.8 and 0.9. The largest fragment for a given distance can be deduced from observations or empirical relations. The smallest fragments are usually 10 µm in diameter. Results: Three processes are typical for impact ejecta re-entry: 1) particle deceleration due to drag forces; 2) heating of the atmosphere and shock wave generation; 3) heating of particles by atmospheric gas (via conduction, convection) and by radiation transfer. Intensity of all these processes depends obviously on the total mass of ejecta and their velocity, but also on the ejecta SFD.  Test examples: The behavior of isolated particles (the total mass of re-entering particles is much smaller than the atmospheric mass they have to pass through) is quite simple: they are decelerated to free-fall velocity depending on their size (10 cm partilces - to 60 m/s; 1 mm particles - to 7 m/s near the surface). The atmosphere remains cold; particles are in thermal equilibrium with the atmosphere. In the case of massive reentry (total mass is comparable with the mass of atmosphere) of similar in size small (mm-sized) particles, a dense dusty cloud is formed which is heated to 600 K (see Fig. 2). Similar effects at distal sites are described in [14, 15]. More realistic re-entry conditions: If particles have different sizes, their behavior is much more complicated. The largest particles tend to penetrate to low altitudes, keeping their initial temperature, while smaller particles are decelerated at high altitudes, heat atmosphere to T> 600 K, and are at elevated temperatures themselves. As a result, these particles can release water if it was present in pores, if water was ejected and has been frozen in space (after the impact 1689.pdf

into a water-covered area), or in some cases, can release water from mineral structures. Large cold particles entering later may be coated by this water forming a liquid bridge to other particles, and may also push some small particles into lower altitudes. Substantial mixing of particles at temperatures and densities suitable for AL formation retains as long as ejecta are arriving at the top of the atmosphere, i.e., within a few minutes. When the flux ceases, the cloud becomes stratified with largest particles at its bottom and the smallest at the top. At approximately the same time, shock waves reflected from the surface stir the cloud again, strongly affecting the smallest particles, which may be thrown away from the site back to high altitudes (this effect was shortly described in [14] to explain the worldwide dispersion of low-velocity ejecta (esp. shocked quartz) after the Chicxulub impact.  Fig. 2. Temperature distribution in the atmosphere during the re-entry of ejecta with a total final thickness of 0.3 m (750 kg/m2, ~900 km downrange from a 200km-diameter final crater). Different colors correspond to different time moments (see the legend, MF - maximum of the ejecta flux, EF -end of the flux). Particles are 1 mm in size (left) and 10 cm (right). Large particles heat the atmosphere to 370 K at an altitude of 20-30 km, however, a dusty cloud is not formed; all particles reach the surface within 8 minutes. Small particles form a hot (600K) cloud at an altitude of 40 km shortly after their arrival to the top of the atmosphere; the cloud descends to altitudes of ~15 km and cools to 500 K when the flux reaches its maximum; later, the cloud moves slightly upward due to the reflection of shock waves from the surface; the dusty cloud density is ~ 0.1 kg/m3 and increases in the descending cloud. Deposition occurs after  ~1 hour. Variations with distance from the impact site: At distances between 400 - 1600 km from the crater (reentry velocities of 2-4 km/s) conditions are suitable for AL formation. Closer to the crater, low temperatures and a deficiency of small particles prevent AL formation. At larger distances, the temperature is too high and the density of small particles is very low. A downrange direction (usually unknown in terrestrial craters) is preferred for AL formation, as high-velocity ejecta are much more abundant there. Fig. 3 (left). Temperature profile for the same conditions as in Fig. 2, with particle SFD from 0.1 mm to 10 cm. Fig. 4 (bottom). Altitude of particles entering the atmosphere at different time moments. Small particles (<1 mm) are subject to oscillations, allowing collisions between particle. Discussion: Although more work is needed to prove the suggested model, conditions in a re-entering ejecta cloud are very similar to pyroclastic density currents, allowing formation of AL. We are quite certain that AL cannot be formed within an impact plume as described in [7] because the plume is too rarified [4]. The model [8] is not quantitative yet. However, it seems unusual that AL could be formed within a few second interval and then survive a long flight and then re-entry as intact structures. AL within "fallback" ejecta deserve separate consideration (intense post-impact processes are needed to make these ejecta [4]). Modeling of particles' interaction on a microscopic scale is our challenge for the future. References: [1] Brown R.J. et al. (2012) Physics and Chemistry of the Earth, 45-46, 65-78.
