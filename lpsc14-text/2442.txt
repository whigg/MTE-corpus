EFFECT OF PRESSURE ON Fe3+/FeT IN SILICATE LIQUIDS, ACCURATE DETERMINATION OF Fe3+/FeT IN SILICATE GLASSES BY MÖSSBAUER SPECTROSCOPY, AND APPLICATIONS TO MAGMA OCEANS.  Hongluo. Zhang1 and Marc. M. Hirschmann1, 1University of Minnesota, Earth Sciences Department, 108 Pillsbury Dr SE, Minneapolis, MN55455   Introduction:  The oxygen fugacity (fO2) prevailing in a magma ocean influences the geochemal behavior of volatile elements and in particular determines the compostion and mass of any overlying atmosphere as well as partitioning of volatiles between early terrestrial planetary interiors and exospheres .  In a vigorously convecting, well-mixed magma ocean (MO) in contact with metallic Fe at depth, the Fe3+/∑Fe ratio will be imposed by magma-metal equilibration. The fO2 imposed elsewhere in the MO depends on the effect of temperature and pressure on the activities of Fe3+ and Fe2+ in an isochemical liquid.  Previous studies have established the influence of temperature, composition and oxygen fugacity in silicate melt [1-5], but there constraints on the effect of pressure are limited to ≤3 GPa [4,6]. These studies establish that, at fixed fO2 relative to metal-oxide buffers, pressure decreases Fe3+/FeT, meaning that an isochemical magma will become more oxidized with increasing pressure [5-7].  We have conducted high pressure experiments to further investigate the relationship between pressure and Fe3+/FeT in fO2-buffered silicate liquids.  Quenched glasses were analyzed by Mössbauer spectroscopy.  Mössbauer spectroscopy is a commonly-applied method for such determinations, but there is significant controversy about the accuracy of such measurements, owing to likely differences in the recoilless fraction (ƒ) of Fe2+ and Fe3+[8-10]. Consequently, we also undertook low temperature Mössbauer studies to determine independently the recoilless fraction of Fe3+ and Fe2+.   Fig 1: Backscatter image of one sample, quenched from 5 GPa, 1600 °C, 4 hours, showing relation between glass and fO2 buffer. Experiments: The starting material is an andesitic composition [6], prepared from reagent grade oxides and silicates. For high pressure experiments 30 wt% of the total amount of Fe2O3 was added as 57Fe2O3. Samples were loaded into 2mm diameter Pt capsules and the fO2 within the capsule was controlled by the addition mixture of 10 wt.% Ru+10 wt.% RuO2 loaded as layers in both the bottom and top (Fig. 1). For experiments performed at 1 atm, isotopically normal Fe was employed. .  Experiments up to 3 GPa were performed in a 0.1/2”, end-loaded piston cylinder apparatus. Experiments above 3 GPa were performed in a 1000-ton multianvil device. Experiments were conducted above the liquidus at 1400-1750 °C and held at temperature for 4 h below 1600 °C and 12 min at 1750 °C.  1 atmosphere experiments were conducted in a vertical quench furnace with Ar-O2 mixtures employed to control fO2.    Homogeneity of the quenched glasses was verified by EMPA. Most glasses were ground into powder and analyzed for the Fe3+/∑Fe ratio using Mössbauer spectrometer at the Institute for Rock Magnetism, UMN. Mössbauer spectra were collected at room temperature (295 K) for all samples, and for two samples, VF3 (1 atm) and the M544 (3.5 GPa), data were also collected from 27 K to 295 K in ~10-40 K intervals. Results: Of the Mössbauer spectra collected at room temperature, 25 (including VF3 and M544), consist of two broadened quadrupole doublets corresponding to ferric and ferrous iron, and 11 also include broadened magnetic sextet corresponding to Fe3+, as also observed previously [5,6]. The Mössbauer spectra were fitted using the xVBF method and the RECOIL software package. Fe2+ and Fe3+ paramagnetic absorption were fitting with quadrupole doublets with 2D Gaussian distributions of the center shift (CS) and quadrupole splitting (QS). We fitted Fe2+ paramagnetic absorption with variable parameters: CS, Gaussian standard deviation of the CS distribution (σCS), QS, Gaussian standard deviation of the QS distribution (σQS), and correlation between the CS and QS distributions (ρ) and Fe3+ paramagnetic absorption with variable parameters: CS, QS, σCS and σQS. Fe3+ paramagnetic absorption fitting do not use ρ parameters as it should be essentially zero for low Fe content (<10 wt%) [7]. Fe3+ magnetic absorption was fitting with CS, QS, σQS, magnetic field of the component (H) and the Gaussian standard deviation of H distribution (σH). The fraction of Fe2+ and Fe3+ was estimated from the area of the subspectral components. For Mössbauer spectra, the ratio of the subspectral components owing to Fe3+ and Fe2+, ATFe3+ ATFe2+  , is related to the actual ratio of Fe3+ and Fe2+ present in the sample, N Fe3+ N Fe2+ by a constant, CT:ATFe3+ ATFe2+= CT × N Fe3+ N Fe2+  , where CT = fTFe3+ fTFe2+.

Fe3+/FeT by two methods. First, we measured the changes in intensities of the individual Fe3+ and Fe2+ doublets as a function of temperature, and fit the results to a Debye model [11] according to:   fT = exp −3ER2kBθD× 1+ 4 TθD⎛⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟2 xdxex −10θD T∫⎡⎣⎢⎢⎤⎦⎥⎥⎧⎨⎪⎩⎪⎫⎬⎪⎭⎪ .   (1) For glass M544, these resulted in Debye temperatures, θD of 373 K and 289 K for Fe3+ and Fe2+, respectively, and for VF3, θD=383 K (Fe3+) and 268 K (Fe2+).  Second, we extracted Debye temperatures from the temperature dependence to the center shift [11] δ (T ) = δ 0 −9kBT2McTθD⎛⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟3 x3dxex −10θD T∫ .            (2) In this case, for M544, θD of Fe3+ is 499 K and Fe2+ is 311 K and for VF3, θD of Fe3+ is 492 K and Fe2+ is 264 K.  These Debye temperatures allow calculation of fT via Eqn. 1.   Fig. 2 a) and b) are the CT obtained from equation (1) (blue dots) and (2) (red dots) for VF3 and M544 seperately. c) and d) are the Fe3+/∑Fe ratios obtained from the Mössbauer spectra (black dots) and the corrected Fe3+/∑Fe ratios by CT obtained from equation (1) (blue dots) and equation (2) (red dots) Differences between Debye temperatures from the methods are likely owing to anharmonicity in silicate glasses [8], but the resulting temperature-dependent values of CT and NFe3+/NFe2+ for VF3, the glass quenched at atmospheric pressure, are essentially identical (Fig 2a,c).  For the high pressure glass, the resulting room temperature value differs by 0.1 (Fig. 2b), but this causes only a small difference in calculated NFe3+/NFe2+ (Fig. 2d) . In both cases, corrected values of NFe3+/NFe2+ determined at 295K agree closely with corrected or uncorrected values determined at very low temperature (Fig. 2c,d), suggesting that the corrections are accurate and that appropriate values of CT for these glasses at 295K are 1.3±0.05. Thus, at least for the andesite composition examined, room temperature Mössbauer measurements must be corrected for recoilless fraction effects. Fig. 3 Fe3+/∑Fe ratios obtained from Mossbauer spectra and corrected by C295 K= 1.25. Curves indicate a simple thermodynamic model assuming ideal mixing of Fe2+ and Fe3.  Fe3+/∑Fe ratios in glasses quenched from high pressure experiments buffered by Ru/RuO2 when corrected with C295 K=1.25, decrease with increasing pressure and with increasing temperature (Fig. 3). The effect of temperature is approximately similar to that expected from low pressure determinations [6], but the effect of pressure is more modest, particularly above 4.5 GPa. A simple thermodynamic model was applied to describe the trend,  as shown in Fig 3. Discussion and Application:  Experimental data up to 7 GPa indicates that self-compression of Fe2+ and Fe3+ in a MO leads to more reducing conditions at low pressure. Consequently, atmospheres overlying MO for small planetary bodies such as the Moon or Mercury will be highly reducing, consisting chiefly of H2 and CO. The same may also be true for Mars. The trend may reverse at higher pressure, as is the case for solid peridotite [12,13], and so for Earth, Venus, and possibly Mars, more oxidized atmospheres above MO are possible. Diamond anvil experiments are underway to examine this hypothesis. References: [1] Sack, R. O., et al. (1981). Contributions to Mineralogy and Petrology 75(4): 369-376. [2] Kilinc, A., et al. (1983).
