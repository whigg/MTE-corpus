Olinger3, 1 Space Sciences Laboratory, University ofCalifornia at Berkeley, Berkeley CA 94720, USA, 2 HIGP, University of Hawai'i at Manoa, USA, 3 Los AlamosNational Laboratory, USAIntroduction: An accurate measurement of the isotopic composition of Mg in the solar wind is one of thehighest priority measurements to be carried out usingthe returned Genesis samples [1]. Since the Mg isotopic composition of the sun is highly likely to be chondritic to within �1h, a measurement of the deviationfrom chondritic values allows an accurate test of massdependent fractionation between the photosphere andthe solar wind, thus allowing, for example, for an improved estimate of the isotopic composition of oxygenin the Sun. Here we demonstrate a new technique formeasuring the depth profiles of Mg in Secondary Ionization Mass Spectrometry, in which images are recordedthat allow for pixel-by-pixel correction for depth andelimination of pixels that are contaminated by terrestrialmaterials.Al Epoxycover slipSiSW-exposed surfaceFig. 1: Schematic of sample mounting prior to backsidegrinding and polishing.Methods: We prepared Genesis Si sample 60633 byfixing it with cyanoacrylate to a glass coverslip, withthe SW-exposed surface facing away from the coverslip.We aligned the chip to within ∼ 1◦ of the coverslip byaligning the reflections of the pupil of the eye of thesample preparer in the Si chip and the coverslip, respectively. We then fixed the coverslip to a 25 mm Al round,so that the Si chip was inside a 9.5mm diameter holein the round (Fig. 1). We then filled the hole with EMBED 812 epoxy, and let cure for 48 hours at 60◦C. Wethen ground the Si chip in its Al round to a wedge, andpolished. Thus, with the sample mounted in the SIMSinstrument, the implanted profile is approached from thebackside, because the surface exposed to the SW is under the polished surface. After polishing, the samplewas optically transparent in the red. Using the observedinterference fringe spacing in the optical image, we estimated the wedge angle to be ∼1.0◦.We mounted the sample in the Cameca ims 1280 at theHawai'i Institute for Geophysics and Planetary Physics(HIGP), and collected rastered depth profiles in severalspots centered 30µm from the edge of the wedge. Weused a 200 pA O+2 primary beam focussed to a 2 µmspot. We presputtered a 30 µm × 30 µm raster at 2 nAbeam current before collecting 256 × 256 pixel rastermaps over 30 µm × 30 µm areas. We collected H, then30Si, then 24Mg-25Mg-26Mg by multicollection.Fig. 2: A frame in the course of a depth profile inGenesis sample 60636. Blue = Si, Red = H, Green =Mg. The image has been downsampled from 256 ×256 to 128 × 128.We analyzed the data independently at Hawai'i and atBerkeley by two methods. In the Hawaii method, wefound the maximum positive slope of the H profile byits smoothed first derivative which we used to align allthe pixels in the map by depth. We used the smoothedsecond derivative of the downsampled Si channel to determine the cycle at which we start to break through theSi chip and start collecting Mg contamination from Utahogenic Schmutz (UGS). At this point we cut off theprofile for that pixel. This introduces a bias in the Mgisotopic composition because heavier solar wind isotopes penetrate deeper into the chip. We correct forthis bias by using SRIM simulations of solar wind Mgisotopes. With the UGS well-separated from the implant profile, we use UGS as the isotope standard asits Mg composition is equal to the terrestrial value. Inthe Berkeley method, we used the barycenter of the Hprofile to determine the pixel depth correction, and rejected pixels which showed evidence for contaminationfrom UGS. The result has larger error bars because of2671.pdf

the lower statistics, but may be less contaminated withUGS.Fig. 3: The pixel-by-pixel peak position of the H profile, in the downsampled 128 × 128 image, convertedto a color spectrum. The peak is reached first at theupper left (blue) and last at the lower right (red). Weused to peak in the H profile to align the depth profilefor each pixel such that the peak is reached in the sameplane for all pixels. The blue regions are near the edgesand have been excluded from the dataset.Results: In Fig. 4 we show the depth-corrected Mg profiles for all three isotopes, using the Hawai'i method fordepth correction. The Berkeley method gives a similarresult. We get reasonably good separation between thesolar wind and UGS, but it is not yet as good as we hadexpected. One problem is that our primary ion beam hasa finite diameter (∼2 µm), which, when convolved withthe slope of the wedged collector, smears the solar windprofile in depth for each pixel. We are currently developing the ability to prepare sample with a smaller wedgeangle (∼0.3◦) and will decrease the primary beam spotsize (to ∼1 µm) to improve the separation between thesolar wind and the UGS.If Mg is fractionated similarly to O in the solarwind, we would expect a deviation from terrestrial of(δ25Mg,δ26Mg) = (−11.5,−23)h [2]. Our current 2σconfidence limits do not allow us to detect this deviationfrom terrestrial values. Approximately 30 scans equivalent to that shown in Fig. 4 would be required to reducethe statistical errors to the required level to distinguishthe prediction from (0,0) at the 2σ level.CycleCountsFig. 4.
