In addition to mareregion, which is dominated by HCP, it has been reportedthat several ray craters on highland regions show HCPdominant spectra [5]. Thus, the global distribution ofHCP-rich sites, especially for the lunar highland regions,would provide important information for the structureand evolution of the lunar crust and mantle. In this study,using the global data set of the SP, we conducted theglobal survey to find HCP-rich sites on the Moon, especially for the lunar highland regions.METHODSP has obtained continuous spectral reflectance data forabout 70 million points (0.5 by 0.5 km footprint) on theMoon in wavelength λ = 0.5-2.6µm and a spectral resolution of 6-8 nm [6,7]. Pyroxenes have absorption bandsminima near both 1 and 2µm with central wavelength ofboth minima moving to longer λ with increasing Ca [8].Analyzing the 70 million spectral data with the globalsurvey algorithm used in [2,3,4], we pick up the spectrawhich show a clear 1.0µm band diagnostic of HCP [5,8].We then eliminated the spectra whose absorption depthratio of 2µm to 1µm is smaller than 0.5 to distinguishbetween HCP and olivine-rich materials. In this case,more than 200 thousands points are selected (Fig. 1(a)).In order to select the HCP for the highland regions, wethen choose the spectra with Rp ≥ 0.1 (hereafter, brightHCP or BHCP), where Rp is photometrically correctedreflectance at λ = 0.75µm (this is because the typicalvalue of Rp for the highland regions is Rp >∼ 0.1 [9]).Finally, 2,256 points are selected as BHCP points, asshown in Fig. 1(b). Fig. 1(c) shows example spectra ofBHCP, which show a clear 1.0µm band as well as 2µmband.Figure 1: (a) The global distribution of HCP points. Thebackground map is the albedo map based on Rp [9]. (b)The same as (a), but for BHCP with Rp ≥ 0.1. (c) Thecontinuum-removed reflectance spectra measured at SPobservational points in several BHCP points.

2RESULTSFig. 1(b) shows that many BHCP points are locatedaround impact basins with mare basalts (e.g., Imbrium,Procellarum, Humorum, Nubium, Crisium, Humboldtianum, and Moscoviense). In these basins, most ofBHCP points occur at elevated altitudes at the rim orpeak rings of these basins, while the occurrence of BHCPpoints in the center region of mare is sporadic. In addition, we found that in the highland regions many BHCPpoints are grouped into several local craters (e.g., Tycho, Jackson, and Giordano Bruno craters). We canalso see that many BHCP points are found in lunar suspected cryptomare deposits listed in [10] (e.g., MendelRydberg, Schiller-Schickard, and Lomonosov-Fleming).Fig. 2(a) shows the close-up image of Tycho crater,where BHCP points are distributed in the crater floor,rim, and ejecta region. On the other hand, there arefew BHCP points outside the Tycho crater. Fig. 2(b)shows the close-up image of Giordano Bruno crater,where the BHCP points are mainly distributed over theejecta region. This indicates that the BHCP-rich materials originate from a shallow region, which were excavated by the impact to form this crater. Fig. 2(c) showsthe close-up image of BHCP points in Jackson crater.The BHCP spectra are found on the crater floor and terrace region, while they are not found at the central peakswhere many purest Anorthosite (PAN) spectra are found[1,2]. For other several complex craters with the centralpeaks, BHCP points are mainly found outside the centralpeaks, while other lunar-major minerals such as PAN aremainly located at the central peaks. This indicates thatthe BHCP-rich materials existed above the layers of PANbefore the formation of the complex craters. Fig. 2(d)shows the location of BHCP points in the cryptomare ofSchiller-Schickard region, where BHCP points are foundat small craters in the cryptomare.In summary, most of BHCP points are found inthe ejecta, rim, and floor of impact craters rather thanthe central peaks, suggesting that BHCP-rich materialsoriginate from relatively shallower region in the lunarcrust. This occurrence feature is different from the PAN,olivine-rich, and low Ca pyroxene-rich materials, whichare thought to be originated from relatively deeper region below the uppermost mixed layer in the lunar crust[2,3,4].DISCUSSIONThere are several possible mechanisms to form the occurrence trend of BHCP-rich materials on the highlandregions. The one of the important mechanisms is thecryptomare formation, because our survey detected manyFigure 2: The close-up images of the BHCP points in(a) Tycho, (b) Giordano Bruno, (c) Jackson craters, and(d) Schiller-Schickard cryptomare. Yellow and red rectangles indicate the BHCP and PAN points, respectively[1,2].BHCP points in the cryptomaria listed in [10]. In addition, gabbroic pluton (≈ HCP + plagioclase) into theshallower region of the upper crust may be pervaded overthe lunar highland regions, and impacts to form smaller,fresh craters could have exposed BHCP materials to thesurface [11]. Furthermore, since BHCP points are alwaysassociated with fresh impact craters, we also propose anadditional mechanism for the BHCP; the impacts meltedthe mixing layer composed of plagioclase and pyroxene,producing BHCP-rich materials in their crater floor, rimor ejecta regions. This is why many BHCP points originate from a shallower region, while PANs are mainlyfound at the central peaks. Although we need further investigations for their origins, our new data suggest thatthe top layer of the lunar crust in the highland regions isdominated by HCP-rich materials.REFERENCES[1] Ohtake et al., Nature, 461, 236, 2009.
