PETROLOGY OF THE NWA 7325 UNGROUPED ACHONDRITE − METEORITE FROM MERCURY, THE UREILITE PARENT BODY, OR A PREVIOUSLY UNSAMPLED ASTEROID? C.A. Goodrich1, N.T. Kita2 and D. Nakashima2, 1Planetary Science Institute, 1700 E. Ft. Lowell Drive, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA, cgoodrich@psi.edu, 2WiscSIMS, Dept. of Geoscience, U. Wisconsin, 1215 W. Dayton St., Madison, WI 53706 USA.  Introduction:  NWA 7325 is an ungrouped achondrite that was suggested [1] to be from Mercury, based on its very low Fe content and Al/Si and Mg/Si ratios compared to Messenger data [2].  We further investigate the petrology of NWA 7325 and examine possible connections to a variety of meteorite types.  In [3,4] we report in-situ oxgyen isotope and trace element analyses, Cr isotope composition, and in-situ Cr, V and Ti valence measurements.  Sample and Procedures:  Two sections were prepared from an ~2.2 g sample of NWA 7325.  BEI/SEI/EDS observations utilized the Zeiss EVO 50 XVP scanning electron microprobe at U. Mass.  Mineral compositions and X-ray maps were obtained using the Cameca SX-50 electron microprobe at U. Mass.   Results: The sections show a protogranular to poikilitic texture of ~0.25-1 mm-sized high-Ca pyroxene and ~0.1-0.7 mm-sized olivine grains surrounded or poikilitically enclosed by plagioclase.  Olivine grains are rounded with concave segments ("lobate" [1]) and commonly occur as partial or complete mantles around pyroxenes.  Modal abundances (~25-30% pyx, 10-15% oliv, 55-60% plag) are similar to those of [1,5].  The sections also contain several % voids with shapes similar to the olivine.   Olivine is homogeneous Fo 97.5±0.1 (64 analyses).  Its Fe/Mg-Fe/Mn (Fig. 1) and CaO-Cr2O3 (Fig. 2) compositions are unique compared with olivine in other primitive achondrites.  Large pyroxene grains are homogeneous Wo 45.3±0.2, mg# 98.2±0.2 (92 analyses), with 2.8±0.1% Al2O3, 0.92±0.07% Cr2O3, 0.17±0.2% Na2O, and TiO2 below detection limit of 0.05%.  This Al2O3 content is high compared with similarly magnesian high-Ca pyroxenes in other primitive achondrites [6].  Many grains show thin lamellae (~5 μm spacing) that appear to be shock lamellae.  Plagioclase has a mottled appearance (Fig. 3,4a), which is associated (Fig. 4b) with variations from ~An 85−94 (avg. of 188 analyses = An 89.6±1.2).  Its trace element composition is reported in [3].  It shows evidence of  reaction with pyroxene: 1) precipitation of wisps of Capyroxene adjacent to grains of pyroxene and olivine (pyroxenes show reacted edges, but olivines do not; Fig. 3); 2) invasion into adjacent pyroxene grains as veins of euhedral crystals (see [5]); and 3) resorption of pyroxene inclusions, with re-precipitation of mantles of more calcic pyroxene and sodic plagioclase (Fig. 4).  Troilite with ~2.5-6% Cr (and lamellae of daubreelite) is the most abundant minor phase.  It contains blebs of Fe,Ni metal with ≤15% Ni and 3.8% Co.  Patches of tiny sulfides are common in the plagioclase.   0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7020406080 brachinites & brach-like Divnoe low-Ca pyx ureilites augite-bearing ureilites lodranites winonaites molar Fe/Mn in olivinemolar Fe/Mg in olivineigneous fractionationredoxtoGRA 06128angritesγ-8NWA 7325 Fig. 1.

CaO and Cr2O3 contents of olivine in NWA 7325 are similar to those of some ureilites or Mg-An-rich lithology (γ8) in polymict ureilites [11].  Discussion: The subchondritic Mn/Mg of olivine in NWA 7325 (Fig. 1) suggests that it is an extreme residue or a cumulate [7].  Its plagioclase- and high-Ca pyroxene-rich mineralogy are more consistent with a cumulate [1].  It appears to have crystallized from an incompatible element-depleted melt, under conditions of extremely low oxygen fugacity [4].  Pyroxene and 1246.pdf

olivine were the earliest phases, with plagioclase growing around them.  Plagioclase was remelted and reacted with pyroxene (diopside + anorthite = wollastonite + albite) but not with olivine (in contrast to [1]), and then cooled rapidly.  Based on the presence of shock lamellae in the pyroxenes, and analogy to enstatite chondrite impact melt rocks with similar textures [8], we argue that this was caused by shock.  [5] argued for internal reheating instead, based on the paucity of shock features in olivine.  However, selective shock melting of low-melting T phases such as pyroxene is observed in ureilites that show little shock in olivine [9].          Fig. 3.

BEI. s Minor elements in olivine and pyroxene in NWA 7325 (Fig. 1,2) indicate that this meteorite does not belong to a known primitive achondrite group.  Further, the combination of An-rich plagioclase and very magnesian mafics is not observed in any group (Fig. 5).  However, a similar assemblage (clast γ-8, Fig. 5) occurs as one of the indigenous feldspathic lithologies in polymict ureilites [10-13]. The oxygen isotope composition of NWA 7325 [1,3] is consistent with this ureilitic lithology [12].  Trace elements in plagioclase [3] and minor elements in olivine (Fig. 1,2) further support a connection.  Nevertheless, Cr isotope compositions [3,14] indicate that NWA 7325 cannot be derived from the ureilite parent body (UPB).  We suggest that the UPB and the parent body of NWA 7325 share chemical and oxygen isotope properties, and experienced similar melting processes.  Alternatively, some of the feldspathic clasts in polymict ureilites that have ureilite-like oxygen isotopes may be derived from a second UPB.  Origin of NWA 7325 from Mercury [1] cannot be ruled out, but impact ejection of a plutonic rock from Mercury seems unlikely. References: [1] Irving A.J. et al. (2013) LPSC 44, #2164.
