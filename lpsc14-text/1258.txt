SHORT-LIVED RADIONUCLIDES IN THE EARLY SOLAR SYSTEM: NOT SO UNUSUAL AFTER ALL.  E. D. Young1, 1Department of Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences, UCLA (eyoung@ess.ucla.edu).    Introduction: Apparent excesses in 36Cl, 26Al, 41Ca, and 60Fe have been taken as evidence for injection of these short-lived nuclides into the early solar system by a variety of sources, including supernovae (SNe) proximal to the site of solar system formation.  Recent models have underscored the importance of enrichment of short-lived radionuclides in star-forming regions by winds from rapidly rotating massive stars in Wolf-Rayet (WR) or anticipatory pre-Wolf-Rayet phases of evolution [1, 2].  The analysis herein shows that apparent excesses in early-solar short-lived radionuclides disappear if one accounts for ejecta from such winds proximal to star-forming regions (SFRs).   Solar 26Al/27Al is Typical:  Jura, Xu and Young  [3] showed recently that the initial 26Al/27Al ratio for the solar system of ~ 5x10-5 is similar to star-forming regions today in the Galaxy.  This conclusion is based on the observation that if 26Al is produced locally by massive stars in SFRs, the proper calculation for estimating the concentration of 26Al in these regions is to divide the Galactic mass of 26Al by the mass of H2 rather than the mass of total H as is commonly done (because the former traces molecular clouds). This calculation, with correction for buildup of 27Al over the last 4.6 Gyr [4] yields 26Al/27Al ratios of  3 to 5x10-5 for SFRs in general.  In addition, white dwarf stars polluted by impacting asteroids show elemental abundances implying rock-metal differentiation.  The minimum 26Al/27Al required to produce melting in these bodies can be calculated and is ≥  3x10-5 [3].  Star-forming regions throughout the Galaxy have complements of 26Al similar to that present in the young solar system.  The fact that solar 26Al/27Al is typical of starforming regions in the Galaxy renders scenarios for acquiring 26Al in the solar system by special circumstances unlikely.  A more fundamental process is required. Mean Live vs. Abundance: Correlations between radioactive decay mean lives (τR, related to half-life by τR = t1/2 /ln(2)) and radionuclide abundances [e.g., 5] provide a test of various scenarios for the provenance of solar-system rock-forming elements.  In the simplest case of continuous production and radioactive decay, radionuclides with the shortest τR should be least abundant when their concentrations are normalized to their stable counterparts and production rates. We use the correlation between short-lived radionuclide (SRN) abundances and mean life to show that enrichment of SRNs in star-forming regions by WR winds leads to a coherent picture of inheritance of these nuclides from parental molecular clouds with cloud residence times of 108 years.   We use a modification of the analytical model of Jacobsen [6] for a two-box interstellar medium (molecular cloud vs. diffuse phase).  The analytical expression is: log NR,MCNS,MC⎛⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟− log PRSNe + (ΛW / ΛSNe )PRWPS⎛⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟=2 logτ R − log (1 − xMC )τMC + τ R[ ]− logT *      (1)  where NR,MC (NS,MC) are numbers of radionuclides (stable nuclides) in the molecular cloud (MC), PRSNe and PRW are production terms for radionuclides from supernovae (SNe) and winds (W), respectively,  xMC is the fraction of the ISM composed of MC,  τMC is the residence time in clouds, and T* is effectively the age of the Galaxy.  The terms ΛW and ΛSNe characterize the efficiency of capture of wind and supernovae ejecta, respectively.  Numerical simulations of mass ejections from young stellar clusters demonstrate that the wind and SNe production terms for the SRNs adjacent clouds reach a steady state consistent with the expression NR,MC /NR,Y ~ (1/τinject )/(τR-1/τinject ) where τinject is the characteristic timescale for addition to clouds  (~ 5 to 10 Myr) and NR,Y is the total yield (Figure 1).

lescence of cloud fragments and staggering of stellar formation times would tend to dampen the sawtooth pattern in Figure 1.  Application of Equation (1) to the most recent data where winds from rotating WR stars are ignored (ΛW = 0) leads to the plot in  Figure 1.  The excesses in the shortest-lived nuclides in Figure 1 relative to curves for τMC defined by the longer-lived nuclides are normally taken as the primary evidence for very specific (unusual?) circumstances surrounding solar system formation. The unknown in Equation (1) is  ΛW/ΛSNe.  In the absence of a priori information, we treat this efficiency ratio as a fit parameter and hypothesize that 26Al production is generally dominated by WR winds rather than SNe near star-forming regions, with the term ΛW/ΛSNe sufficiently large (~1500) that 26Al/27Al normalized by (P26SNe+ ΛW/ΛSNe P26W)/P27 falls on the residence-time curve defined by the longer-lived nuclides.  Most importantly, with this value for  ΛW/ΛSNe  and SRN yields for WR winds [7], all of the SRNs align on a single curve representing a cloud residence time of 200 +/− 100 Myr (Figure 3).   Discussion: The alignment of all nuclides in Figure 3 suggests a value for residence time of nuclides in clouds and a value for  ΛW/ΛSNe.  Both require independent assessment. The 200+/−100  Myr residence time in Figure 3 is consistent with the average rate of conversion of molecular cloud mass into stars; the Galactic molecular cloud mass, MMC, of 8.4x108  M and star formation rate, ψ, of 0.9 to 3 yr-1 in the present-day Galaxy [8] yield a timescale of MMC/ψ = 280 to 840 Myr.   The low early solar 60Fe/26Al relative to the average Galactic value implies  ΛW/ΛSNe of at least 300. A number of factors may contribute to high  ΛW/ΛSNe.  It is thought that the most massive stars (> 30 ~ M  ) will not necessarily produce energetic core-collapse supernovae but rather collapse directly to black holes after mass loss through winds [9].  The effect is for the most massive stars proximal to SFRs to be prodigious producers of winds but not supernovae. In this case, the solar abundances of the short-lived radionuclides could be telling us that winds provide the shortestlived nuclides (τR < 5 Myr) from the most massive stars proximal to star-forming regions while SNe dominate the sources of longer-lived nuclides produced mainly in the diffuse ISM.
