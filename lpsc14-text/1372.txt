AHIGH-RESOLUTIONMODELOFTHELITHOSPHERICMAGNETICFIELDOFMARS.A. Morschhauser1, V. Lesur2,M.

We use several techniques inorder to obtain a reliable and well-resolved model of the Martian lithospheric field. Static external fields were treated bya joint inversion of external and internal fields, whereas temporally variable external contributions were handled by regularizing the model using an iteratively weighted least-squaresalgorithm (IRLS) to approach a L1-norm [2], which allows fora better representation of strong localized magnetic anomaliesas compared to the conventional L2-norm. Further, a HuberNorm [3] was used to properly treat data outliers and the datawas weighted based on an analysis of the data instead of takingthe a posteriori root mean square of the misfit.Data: We use the complete MGS vector magnetometerdata set, acquired from 1999 to 2006, including the low-altitudeAB as well as the high-altitude MPO data [1]. In order toreduce the influence of solar-wind induced magnetic fields,only nighttime data was selected for the mapping phase orbit[4]. For the aerobraking and science phase orbit data, wedecided to use all AB data below 200 km altitude, as nighttimedata is scarce below this altitude. Although the contaminationby external field contributions is more significant in this case,the lower altitude of the AB data provides valuable additionalinformation on the shorter wavelengths of the field.Model: We express the magnetic field in terms of a scalarpotential field V , thus assuming that the data was collected in asource-free region. The vector magnetic field is then expressedas the gradient of a scalar potential V , which can itself beexpanded in terms of spherical harmonic (SH) functions byV (r, θ, φ) = Vint(r, θ, φ) + Vext(r, θ, φ)= aLintXl=1lXm=−l“ ra”lgml Yml (θ, φ)+LextXl=1lXm=−l“ar”l+1hml Yml (θ, φ)where (r, θ, φ) are spherical coordinates, a is the referenceradius of the model,Lint, Lext are the maximal SH degree andorder, and gml , hml are the Gauss coefficients for internal andexternal fields, respectively. Further, Y ml denote the Schmidtsemi-normalized spherical harmonic functions, where negativeorders (m < 0) are associated with sin(mφ) terms and zero orpositive orders (m ≥ 0) are associated with cos(mφ) terms.The SH model was expanded up to Lint = 110, whichwas determined to be adequate to sufficiently resolve the intense anomalies in the AB data. External fields were modeledseparately for the day- and nightside data and maximum SHdegrees of Lext = 10 and Lext = 5 were used for the dayand nightside data, respectively.Inversion: The quality of the inversion depends on theFigure 1: Map of the Martian magnetic field model evaluatedat the average planetary radius of Mars (R=3393.5 km). Thetopographic dichotomy and major impact craters are indicatedby the solid black and dashed lines, respectively.proper selection of data weights, which should optimally beweighted according to the probability densitiy function (PDF)of the underlying errors, such that noisy data are given lessweight than good data. In our case, these errors include measurement errors such as pointing errors and the accuracy ofthe fluxgate magnetometer as well as contributions of nonlithospheric fields. As these errors are difficult to quantifyand to model, the underlying PDF is unknown a priori, and isusually estimated a posteriori [4]. Here, we binned the data inareas of approximately equal size and calculated the respectivestandard deviation for each bin. The obtained standard deviations account for errors due to temporal variations in the dataif the bin size is selected appropriately, and can be used as apriori data weights.Static non-lithospheric contributions to magnetic field datawere found to be relevant at MGS orbit altitude [5] and we include a simple model of the external field. As the nature of theexternal field differs substantially on the day- and nightside,we used two different external field models. Further, largedata outliers were treated by implementing a Huber-Norm [2],which allows to statistically treat data outliers instead of rejecting them a priori.Remaining non-lithospheric field contributions generatedbelow the MGS mapping altitude can leak into the lithosphericmodel and lead to strong field oscillations when the modelis downward-continued to the surface. Hence, we minimizean additional constraint to suppress the leakage of externalfields into the model. To do so, we use a measure of the1372.pdf

Lithospheric field of Mars: A. Morschhauser et al.Figure 2: Map of the lithospheric field intensity at surface altitude as predicted by the presented model. The shown area islocated in Terra Sirenum and shows a low-field region withinan area of the strongest lithospheric fields of Mars.Figure 3: Radial down component of the lithospheric fieldat surface altitude as predicted by the presented model. Theshown area is located near the south pole and shows two isolated, relatively weak anomalies. The center of the southernanomaly is located ∼300 km northeast of Pityusa Patera.surface integral of the horizontal gradient of the radial magnetic field component. However, it is inevitable that somepart of the lithospheric signal will also be suppressed in thisway. We mitigate this effect by using an iteratively reweightedleast-squares algorithm (IRLS) [2], which approaches a L1norm, and allows for strong, localized magnetic anomalies tobe better represented than with the conventional L2-norm forregularization.Results: The lithospheric field model is shown in Fig.1for all three vector components of the magnetic field, whichhas been downward-continued to surface altitude. The topographic dichotomy and the largest impact craters (Hellas,Isidis, Argyre, Utopia) are indicated by black solid and dashedlines, respectively. In agreement with previously publishedmaps (e.g. [4,6]), it can be confirmed that the major impactcraters appear to be demagnetized and the northern lowlandsshow generally lower magnetic fields than the southern highlands. In addition, many details are visible at high-field regionswhile showing a low noise level in low-field regions.Conclusions: We presented a spherical harmonic modelof the Martian lithospheric magnetic field based on the entireMPO nightside and AB/SPO data set of the Mars Global Surveyor mission. Due to its high resolution and its ability to bedownward-continued to surface altitude, the presented modelwill help to better understand the magnetic field history ofMars. For example, the magnetic signature of smaller craterscan be investigated and weaker anomalies can be resolved. Inparticular, a region of low-field intensity has been discoveredwithin Terra Sirenum, surrounded by very strong fields (cf.Fig. 2). The presence of this feature could be confirmed bythe electro-reflectometry (ER) map of [7], but little ER data isavailable in the surrounding area due to closed field lines. Although it is also visible in other published models based on themagnetometer data, it is hard to detect at higher altitudes wheremost of the published maps have usually been interpreted.Another example of the ability of the new model to resolve comparatively weak features is given in Fig. 3, wheretwo isolated anomalies near the South Pole are shown. Theseanomalies show no obvious correlation with geological structure, but will certainly be very useful in determining paleopolesand the magnetization of the underlying crust in the future, astheir signal is not disturbed by nearby sources. Again, althoughthese anomalies are visible in other models as well as in theER data, they are too weak to be confidently identified at theMPO orbit altitude of 400 km. Other possible applications ofthe new lithospheric field model could include new estimatesof the Martian lithospheric magnetization, or the investigationof the magnetic signature of impact craters down to possibly200 km in diameter.When interpreting the map at surface altitude, it shouldbe kept in mind that the model resolution is limited by themaximum SH degree, corresponding to roughly 190 km at thesurface, and the actual litospheric field could contain muchfiner structure than can be resolved with this model.Acknowledgements: This work has been supported bythe German Research Foundation (DFG) within the PriorityProgram SPP1408 “Planetary Magnetism”.References [1] Acun˜a et al., J.
