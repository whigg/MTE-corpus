 QUANTITATIVE INVESTIGATIONS OF RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN TUMULI MORPHOMETRICS AND LAVA FLOW EMPLACEMENT. S. Sangha 1 (sangha@oxy.edu) and S. Diniega 2,  1 Occidental College, Los Angeles, CA, 2 Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA.   Background: We focus on inflated lava flows found on both Earth and Mars and characterized by a domed, rigid upper crust that has been lifted and insulated by a mobile, fluid interior [1]. This flow morphology forms when a lava flow is allowed to cool, but not completely solidify, so as to retain the fluid interior. Injections of lava from successive events propagate through pathways that offer the least resistance to horizontal flow. As cooling of the fluid interior continues, these subsurface lava pathways narrow, resulting in an increase in internal pressures, obstacles, and abrupt corners. All of these variables contribute to increasing resistance to the horizontal transport of flow, until lava preferentially inflates the rigid outer crust vertically rather than advancing the flow front forward [1]. Localized inflation can form distinctive surface features called tumuli—small-scale positive topographic features ~10 m in width with rounded shapes [2-6]. Such surface features may thus record information about the pathway structure of the lava flow's fluid interior [Fig. 1] [2-5].  In our broader study, our goal is to develop ways to use tumuli as records of both flow structure on both Earth and Mars [7]. In this presentation, we first aim to justify that tumuli are likely good records of flow structure. In particular, we establish that a strong correlation exists between the observed distribution of tumuli orientation and the general lava flow directions.                  Figure 1. A tumulus from the Amboy Crater Lava field, CA (top left) and a tumulus from the southern edge of Elysium Planitia, Mars taken from HiRISE image PSP_007685_1850 (bottom left). To the right of each of these are images of chains of tumuli atop of lava pathways in each lava field. Datasets: The Shuttle Radar Topography (Mission) dataset was used for terrestrial flow slope analyses with a vertical accuracy of ≤ 30 m and a horizontal accuracy of ≤ 50 m, while the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) dataset was used for Martian flow slope analyses with a vertical precision of ≤10 m and a horizontal accuracy of ≤100 m. As tumuli are a few tens of meters in size, we use HiRISE images (≤ 50 cm/px) for our Martian survey and Google Earth (≤ 2.5 m/px) for our terrestrial survey. We have compiled the largest interplanetary database of tumuli, with >2400 tumuli through seven fields within the Elysium Planitia region of Mars and >1300 tumuli through six diverse terrestrial fields. We continue to look for for more Martian fields through detailed tumuli identification criteria [8].  Results: In this investigation, analyses were limited to flows where we could deduce general and local flow directions from a discernible flow terminus and/or elevation profiles [e.g., Fig. 2]. (A generally decreasing elevation away from the source vent was assumed to be a good approximation for the general flow direction.) We also focused on simple flows (i.e., flows that appeared to develop in one period, versus compound flows). The flow direction then was compared with the aggregated distribution of tumuli orientations [Fig 3].   Figure 2.

Inset of elevation profile along apparent flow direction taken from the blue AA' line on the map.    A tumulus' orientation is defined by its long-axis, restricted to the 180° extending in the downflow direction (as one cannot visually distinguish the "front" from the "back"; e.g., tumuli oriented NW/SE are binned together). In all mapped images, the dominant flow direction is indicated by the purple arrow with the "transverse" flow direction roughly perpendicular to the arrow. We find that: A. for most flows, aggregate tumuli orientations have two dominant directions; these correlate with the the general flow direction and roughly transverse to the general flow direction [Fig. 3]. B. while the number of tumuli oriented with the general flow direction increases gradually with distance away from the source vent and towards the flow terminus, the number of tumuli oriented transverse to the general flow direction is relatively consistent [Fig. 4].  Discussion: We are particularly interested in a specific type of simple, fan-lobe inflated lava flow within which tube growth occurs primarily in the overall flow direction. However, many bifurcations of the pathways result in transverse spreading directions. Thus, the pathways create a "fan-shaped" flow. Within flows of this type, we expect to find that tumuli long-axis orientations broadly correlate with the field's flow direction, but with a significant secondary population that align with the transverse flow direction. In general, this was observed in seven fields.                         Only within a few extremely large fields did we not observe tumuli to be oriented with the general and transverse flow. Generally, we think that this is due to a survey bias as, in exceedingly large fields, we measured only a representative population of tumuli that extended along a single margin. Thus, we expect tumuli will only be orientated towards the local flow direction where lava tubes that terminate along the margin dominate and may thus be oblique with respect to the general and transverse flow directions. However, if we completed a survey of an entire field and found tumuli to solely be oriented with the general flow direction (as may be the case in the Nesjahraun lava field) this would suggest that the field is dominated by fingerlobe flows. These are a different type of inflated flow whereby lava tubes expand in the general flow direction, without much bifurcation (thus forming a series of "fingers" pointing in the same direction). Within this type of flow, we expect nearly all tumuli to be oriented in the general flow direction [9].   Future Work: In our broader investigations of how tumuli can be used as records of lava flow structure on Earth and Mars, we have found interplanetary similarities in: (1) tumuli morphometrics, (2) trends in tumuli morphometrics through the length of lava flows, and (3) correlations between tumuli orientation and general/local flow direction. Based on these results, we aim to clearly define ways in which tumuli can be used as direct records of lava flow structure in order to interpret emplacement conditions and pre-erosional flow extent.
