The impact melt pool theory for the formation of the IIE iron meteorites requires sufficient energy to allow melting and mixing of target (chondrite-like) and projectile (Fe/Ni metal) without causing catastrophic destruction of the target body. Previous theories for the formation of the IIE iron meteorites discuss an impact between a Fe/Ni projectile and a H chondrite-like body which produced melt pools, mixing the metallic and chondritic materials [3, 4]. One aspect of the formation of the IIE iron meteorites that is not fully understood is the thermal state of the target body, i.e. whether the impact occurred into a cold or an internally heated body.  In order to discover if sufficient impact melting is producible on a chondritic-like target body using a metallic projectile, laboratory impact experiments were undertaken using the Light Gas Gun at the University of Kent [5]. Impacts into targets at temperatures above room temperature have been performed by heating the target in a specially designed holder. The experiments used a projectile of the Odessa meteorite fired at a range of velocities between 2 - 4 km s-1 at a target of basaltic rock (selected as a chondritic analogue) which was held at a range of temperatures between 25- 800 °C. Here we present the initial results of these experiments.  Method: A Fe/Ni projectile was prepared as a 1.5 × 1.5 mm × 1.5 mm cube and placed into a sabot to be fired at a basalt target. The target was set to the required temperature using the hot target holder, to simulate targets of different formation stages from room temperature (25 °C) to approximately 800 °C, the upper temperature limit of the equipment. To prevent degassing of the basalt during heating within the target chamber (which is under a vacuum of ~50 mbar) the basalt samples are pre-heated to the required temperature in a vented furnace, so that any degassing of the basalt to occurs within the furnace and not the evacuated target chamber. Results: To date five experiments have been completed using Fe/Ni projectiles fired at velocities of approximately 2, 3 and 4 km s-1. The target for each experiment was a basalt cylinder 60 mm in diameter and between 75 mm to 130 mm in length. For each experiment the target temperature was set to a specific temperature between 25 °C - 800 °C (Table 1).  Results: Impact at 2 kms-1 (A): In an attempt to recover the projectile a velocity of 2 km s-1 onto a room temperature (25°C) target was used. The crater produced was small and rounded with few weak radial faults spanning away from the crater (Fig 1a). The energy from the impact did not cause spallation and disruption of the target, with the only deformation observed being the crater itself. The projectile was recovered post impact and had been flattered but no projectile material was observed in the crater, showing a lack of mixing between projectile and target. No products of impact melting were observed in the crater. Results: Impact at 3 km s-1(B): At 3 km s-1, and a target temperature of 25 oC, the impact did not cause disruption of the target and produced a rounded crater with three faint radial fractures extending approximately 3 cm. The projectile was recovered which had a similar inverted orientation as the projectile from shot (a). The crater dimensions produced by this velocity are similar to that produced in shot (a) (Fig 1b).   Results: Impact at 4 km s-1 (C, D and E): Each impact at this velocity caused the target to shatter on the surface at both extreme limits of the temperature range. The ejecta and spall from each shot was collected and pieced back together in order to identify the original crater. At the centre of each crater lay areas of white powdered basalt produced at the point of impact. Upon analyses no projectile material was observed within the craters suggesting that either the projectile bounced from the target (unlikely at 4 km s-1) or, that the projectile was partially vaporised and lost. No melt veins or glassy material have so far been observed within the craters and SEM analyses indicates little variation is observed in the major elemental composition of the crater material compared to pre-impact basalt, suggesting that melting of the target body has not occurred.  The impact onto the basalt at 4 km s-1 produced two sets of faults. The first set of fractures are radial and extend away from the point of impact. The second set are circular and fall approximately 5 mm from the edge of the target, causing edges of the target to splay away 1850.pdf

from the middle, forming these fractures (Fig 1c, d and e).  Variations in the craters' depth and diameter (Table 1) are observed with increasing temperature of the target (Table 1), leading to a preliminary observation that the crater efficiency appears to increase with target temperature, which may be linked to the structural strength of the basalt (as yield strength decreases with temperature).         Discussion: Crater dimensions increase with velocity of shot and the temperature of the target, however the results concerning temperature are only preliminary and further experiments are required to verify this observation.  Melting of target material as a result of an impact requires precise conditions in order to prevent complete destruction of the target and allow melting and mixing of the two materials. Initial tests using a 4 km s-1 Fe/N projectile caused the basalt target to shatter, even at 800 °C. At a slower velocity of 2 km s1, the projectile survived but did not become embedded or mixed with the basaltic target. Melting and mixing of projectile and target material within an impact crater melt pool does not detectably occur under the conditions tested so far by this study. However, it is possible that a hotter target close to silicate melting temperatures (1000 - 1200 °C) is required for this to occur. The next step is to undertake shots using velocities of 2 and 3 km s-1 fired at a target set at a range of temperatures between 200 °C to 900 °C.                   \\\ \\\\\\\\      These lower velocities allow the projectile to be collected post impact and prevent disruption of the target which was observed using velocities >3 km s-1.
