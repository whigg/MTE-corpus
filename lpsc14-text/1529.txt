Introduction: Short-lived nuclides have proven to be extremely useful for studying the evolution of early solar system. Among these nuclides, 60Fe (t1/2=2.62 Myr) has been the focus of much work recently because it cannot be produced by particle irradiation in the solar protoplanetary disk [1] and a high 60Fe/56Fe ratio in meteorites would tie the birth of the solar system to the explosion of a nearby supernova [2]. Our previous measurements of 58Fe/54Fe and 60Ni/58Ni isotope ratios in whole rocks and constituents of differentiated achondrites, unequilibrated ordinary chondrites, and metal-rich carbonaceous chondrite demonstrate that the 60Fe/56Fe initial ratio in the solar protoplanetary disk was (1.15 ± 0.26) × 10-8 and that 60Fe was homogeneously distributed among planetary objects [3]. Additionally, this system was used to constrain the timescales of core formation on HED and Mars to be less than a few million years after solar system formation [4].     Chondrules are major silicate constituents in primitive chondrites. Their formation ages have been welldetermined to be ~1-2 Myr after CAI condensation by 26Al-26Mg and Pb-Pb systematics  [e.g., 5-7]. Most chondrules formed by melting and subsequent rapid cooling. 60Fe abundance in unequilibrated ordinary chondules has been studied using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) [8-11], but the exact value of the 60Fe/56Fe ratio at the time of chondrule formation is still a matter of discussion in the literature [11,12]. Our previous MC-ICPMS measurements of chondrules from Semarkona and NWA 5717 has shown that this value was (1.041.31)10-8. To evaluate whether the low 60Fe/56Fe ratio measured in chondrites by us was the result of parent-body alteration, we have measured and additional seven Semarkona (LL 3.00) chondrules.     Sahara 99555 and DʼOrbigny are thought to be ideal samples to establish the timescales of crust formation on planetesimals because they have precisely defined crystallization ages based on internal mineral isochrons [13]. Hence, in this study, Fe-Ni systematics in the silicate fractions separated from Sahara 99555 were investigated to study the timescale of crustal crystallization on the angrite parent body and establish another chronological anchor. Results: Semarkona chondrules. Six Semarkona chondrules were measured and the results are shown in Fig.1A. Fe/Ni ratios range from 13 to 435. No 60Ni excesses were detected in the chondrules with relatively low Fe/Ni ratios (Fe/Ni<100) since our precision does allow us to resolve any 60Ni excesses caused by 60Fe decay. High Fe/Ni ratio as well as resolvable 60Ni excess was observed in one Type II chondrule (FeO ~ 15.2%) from Semarkona. Combined with the data from all chondrules, a single isochron can be defined with the slope of 60Fe/56Fe = (5.32±3.27)×10-9 and initial 60Ni value of 0.030±0.024 (MSWD = 0.25), at the time of its last equilibration. Spivak-Birndorf et al. [14] reported Ni isotope measurements of Semarkona chondrules and other more metamorphosed chondrites in an abstract, in which 60Fe was also resolved at a level of (~5×109). Sahara 99555. The Fe-Ni data for silicate separates in the quenched angrite, Sahara 99555 are shown in Fig.1B. The analyzed separates exhibit high 56Fe/58Ni ratios ranging from ~ 2,500 (for anorthite) to ~6,900 (for pyroxene + olivine) and radiogenic ε60Ni values from +0.21 to +0.54. The 60Fe/56Fe and initial ε60Ni inferred from mineral separates from the Sahara 99555 angrite are shown in Fig. 1B. The data points define an internal isochron (MSWD = 0.49) of slope 60Fe/56Fe = (1.96±0.77)10-9 and intercept ε60Ni = 0.05±0.12 at the time of closure to isotope exchange of the minerals investigated. This value agrees well with independent results reported for this meteorite, which give initial 60Fe/56Fe ratios of (1.8±0.5)×10-9 [15]. The 60Fe/56Fe ratio in Sahara 99555 is lower than that inferred from DʼOrbigny in our previous work [(3.42±0.58)10-9; 3], indicating that Fe-Ni systematics in Sahara 99555 was closed ~1 Myr later than DʼOrbigny. Discussion: In situ measurements of components of unequilibrated ordinary chondrites have given variable 60Fe/56Fe initial ratios ranging from 210-8  to 1210-7. According to our measurement, the Ni isotopic compositions of Semarkona chondrules (LL3.00) give an initial 60Fe/56Fe ratio of (5.32±3.27)×10-9 at the time of chondrule formation in the solar nebula. The timing of formation of these primitive chondrules has been constrained to be ~2 to 3 Myr after CAI based on Mn-Cr systematics and other systems, which translates into an initial  60Fe/56Fe ratio at CAI formation of (1.00±0.82)×10-8 in the region of the protoplanetary disk where Semarkona formed. This initial ratio is consistent with the estimate ob  tained from achondrites as well as chondritic constituents in our previous study [3], indicating that Semarkona chondrules formed within the first 3 Myr from a homogeneous, low 60 Fe chondritic reservoir in the early solar nebula.  The timescales of crust formation on planetesimals can be assessed through crystallization ages based on internal mineral isochrons from individual members of differentiated basaltic achondrites formed in the near-surface environment on asteroids. In terms of DʼOrbigny and Sahara 99555, the Ucorrected Pb-Pb ages are identical within uncertainties, corresponding to 4563.37 ± 0.25 Ma and 4563.53 ± 0.14 Ma, respectively [16-18]. We studied the 60Fe-60Ni chronometer in DʼOrbigny and Sahara 99555 angrites to investigate the concordance with other extinct chronometers. For DʼOrbigny, the 60Fe/56Fe ratio was estimated to be (3.42±0.58)10-9 [3]; for Sahara 99555, the 60Fe/56Fe ratio is estimated to be (1.97±0.77)10-9, giving a crystallization age of 6.7 ± 1.7 Myr, around 1~2 Myr younger than DʼOrbigny  crystallization.  Crystallization ages of the DʼOrbigny angrite can be constrained by different chronometers (e.g., 26Al26Mg, Pb-Pb, 53Mn-53Cr, 182Hf-182W, 60Fe-60Ni; 16-22), which agree within uncertainties; however, these ages of Sahara 99555 vary, implying that the isotopic systems in this meteorite were disturbed. Conclusion: Using a new estimate of the initial 60Fe/56Fe ratio in the solar system, we present the chronological application of the 60Fe-60Ni decay system to constrain the time of chondrule formation on Semarkona at 2.9±2.5 Ma after condensation of CAIs.
