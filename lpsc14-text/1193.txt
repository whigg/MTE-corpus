FERROUS IRON SMECTITES AND THEIR OXIDATIVE PRODUCTS: IMPLICATIONS FOR CLAY FORMATION AND ALTERATION ON MARS.  S. M. Chemtob1, R. D. Nickerson1 and J. G. Catalano1, 1Washington University, Dept. of Earth and Planetary Sciences, St. Louis, MO 63130 (chemtob@levee.wustl.edu)   Introduction:  Phyllosilicates have been identified in Noachian-aged terranes on Mars, both remotely by orbital spectroscopic methods [1,2] and in situ at Gale Crater by the Curiosity rover’s on-board XRD [3]. The Sheepbed Mudstone, site of recent in situ clay detections, was shown to contain a ferrous trioctahedral smectite [3,4]. This detection is consistent with predictions of reducing conditions during the Noachian [5] and thermodynamic models predicting ferrous saponites as products of weathering of martian basalts [6]. In contrast, the only Fe-bearing clays identified by orbital spectrometers (OMEGA, MRO-CRISM) to date are ferric (i.e. nontronites) [1,2]. This discrepancy may result from a lack of Fe(II) smectite spectral standards or from post-Noachian oxidation of Fe(II)-bearing phases at the martian surface. Because Fe(II)-bearing smectites are unstable in terrestrial atmospheric conditions, their structure and behavior during oxidation are poorly studied. Deciphering Mars’ alteration history requires an understanding of how ferrous smectites across the range of compositions produced by weathering change mineralogically upon oxidation. A previous study [7] observed the effects of several oxidants (O2, H2O2, NO3-) on a ferrous smectite. In this study, we selected a single oxidant (O2 in air) and observed the effects of smectite composition on oxidative susceptibility and the structure of oxidative products. Methods: Clays were synthesized by a sol-gel method, after [8]. Gels were precipitated from reagent salt solutions under anoxic conditions, then were hydrothermally aged at 200° C for 15 days. Precipitates were Ca-saturated, then washed and dried by vacuum desiccation. Aliquots of water-suspended clay samples were oxidized by bubbling with air for 7 days (here labeled “ox”). For select compositions (A and C in Fig. 1),  air-oxidized samples were hydrothermally matured at 200° C for 7 days (labeled “rextll”), then oxidized for an additional 7 days (labeled “reox”).  Clay chemistries were determined by ICP-OES after digestion following LiBO2 fusion [9]. XRD patterns were collected on a Bruker D8 Advance powder diffractometer in an anoxic sample cell. Fe K-edge Xray absorption fine structure spectra were collected in transmission mode at beamlines 5-BM and 12-BM at the Advanced Photon Source. VNIR spectra were collected in air using an ASD portable spectrometer.  Results: Eight smectite compositions were synthesized in three compositional series: ~20 mol% Al (AD), ~30 mol% Al (E-F), and ~10 mol% Al (G-H) (Fig. 1). Stoichiometries suggest that the smectites typically have octahedral site occupancies between 2.5 and 3 (close to trioctahedral) and layer charges of 0.4-0.5 per half unit cell. Mid- and high-Al clays contain octahedral Al (e.g., the calculated formula of clay C is Ca0.18(Fe1.58Mg1.20Al0.19)VI(Si3.49Al0.51)IVO10(OH)2.) XAFS: The Fe K-edge energy shifts with Fe oxidation state [10] (Fig. 2). The extents of oxidation in oxidized materials were determined by fitting unknown XANES spectra as linear combinations of the unoxidized precursor and the CMS standard NAu-2 (nontronite), and are displayed in Table 1. All clays experienced only partial oxidation after 7 days exposure to air, consistent with previous results [6]. Typical extents of oxidation were 20 – 50%. Al content was not  Figure 1.

a strong predictor of extent of oxidation; however, within a single compositional series, Fe content correlated with extent of oxidation (Table 1, A-D). Recrystallization after air exposure allowed for further oxidation upon air re-exposure (up to 83% for Areox) (Fig. 2). Structural changes: The extent of structural changes during oxidation was observed to be a strong function of smectite composition. XRD patterns of unoxidized clays (not shown) showed (060) d-spacings of 1.53-1.56 Å (Table 1), consistent with a trioctahedral structure and similar to the 1.53 Å spacing calculated for the Sheepbed saponite [3]. Fe-rich clays (A, B, E, G) experienced modest shifts (~0.01 Å) to shorter (060) spacings upon oxidation, suggestive of a shift to a more dioctahedral structure. In contrast, Mg-rich clays (C, D, F, H) experienced little or no structural shift following oxidation (Table 1). This contrast between compositions in oxidative restructuring is mirrored in VNIR spectra. Spectra of all samples display OH and H2O combination modes at 1.4 µm and 1.9 µm and M-OH bands between 2.2-2.5 µm (Fig. 3). Upon recrystallization and reoxidation, Fe-rich clays developed a red Fe3+ edge (Fig. 3). MOH band positions vary with clay composition (Fig. 4) [11]. Upon oxidation, Fe-rich clays display significantly shifted M-OH bands; however, M-OH bands of oxidized Mg-rich clays are essentially unchanged from their unoxidized precursors (Fig. 4). Implications: This study illustrates that chemical composition exerts a controlling effect on the structural response of ferrous iron smectites to low-degree oxidation. Oxidation of Fe-rich clays forms spectrally distinguishable secondary phases that approach the structure of the oxidized Fe endmember (i.e. nontronite). Mgrich clays experience significant oxidation upon air exposure, but the products may be spectrally indistinguishable from their unoxidized precursors.  These results have clear relevance to clay detections at Gale Crater. Unoxidized smectites synthesized in this study appear to be robust structural and chemical analogs to clays in the Sheepbed mudstone. The observed (060) spacing of 1.53 Å suggests that the Sheepbed saponite is a mixed Fe-Mg smectite rather than a Fe endmember (Table 1).  References: [1] Murchie et al. (2009) JGR, 114, E00D06.
