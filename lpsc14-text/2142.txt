ALUMINUM-MAGNESIUM ISOTOPE SYSTEMATICS OF PORPHYRITIC CHONDRULES AND PLAGIOCLASE FRAGMENTS IN CH CARBONACEOUS CHONDRITES.  A. N. Krot1,2*, K. Nagashima1, and M. Bizzarro2. 1HIGP, U. Hawai'i at Mānoa, Honolulu, HI 96822, USA *sasha@higp.hawaii.edu. 2Centre for Star & Planet Formation & Natural History Museum of Denmark, U. Copenhagen, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark Introduction: The mineralogy, petrology, bulk chemical and isotopic (O and N) compositions indicate that CH and CB metal-rich carbonaceous chondrites are genetically related meteorites [1,2]. We have previously suggested that CBs consist almost entirely of the components formed during a single-stage highly-energetic event, most likely in an impact generated plume: Fe,Nimetal±sulfide nodules, zoned Fe,Ni-metal grains, nonporphyritic (skeletal and cryptocrystalline) magnesian chondrules, and uniformly 16O-depleted igneous CAIs [35]. In addition, the CHs contain ~50% of typical chondritic components: magnesian (type I) and ferroan (type II) porphyritic chondrules and uniformly 16O-rich CAIs [4,5]. Recent U-Pb isotope measurements of magnesian skeletal chondrules from Gujba (CBa) confirmed their late-stage formation, 4562.52±0.44 Ma, ~5 Myr after CV CAIs with the canonical 26Al/27Al ratio [6,7]. High-precision Al-Mg isotope measurements of bulk magnesian skeletal chondrules from Hammadah al Hamra 237 (CBb) revealed no resolvable excess of 26Mg (26Mg*): the inferred initial 26Al/27Al ratio [(26Al/27Al)0] is (4.5±8.3)×107 [8]. The origin and timing of the CH porphyritic chondrule formation are not understood. Based on the mineralogy and O-isotope compositions of the CH porphyritic chondrules, Krot et al. [9] suggested they define their own population. Here we report on the results of in situ Al-Mg isotope measurements of porphyritic chondrules and isolated plagioclase grains from the paired CH chondrites Acfer 182 and 214 with the UH Cameca ims-1280 ion microprobe. Analytical procedure: Mg-isotope compositions were measured using primary 16O− ion beam accelerated to 13 keV with an impact energy of 23 keV. The measurements were done with a focused ~5 µm 16O− primary beam with a current of 100 pA. 24Mg+, 25Mg+, and 26Mg+ were measured sequentially in monocollection mode using monocollector EM. 27Al+ was measured using multicollection FC simultaneously with 25Mg+. The mass-resolving power was set to ~4200, sufficient to separate all interfering hydrides and doubly charged 48Ca++. The instrumental mass-fractionation effects were corrected using Miyake-jima anorthite assumed to have terrestrial Mg-isotope compositions. 26Mg excess due to decay of 26Al (26Mg*) was calculated using an exponential law with an experimentally defined mass fractionation exponent of 0.514 [10].  Results and Discussion: Al-Mg isotope systematics was measured in plagioclase in 6 Al-rich chondrules containing relict CAIs (Figs. 1a,b), 5 type I and 1 type II chondrules (Figs. 1c,d), and 5 isolated coarse plagioclase crystals (Figs. 1e,f). None of the chondrules measured show evidence for thermal metamorphism or aqueous alteration. Chondrule plagioclase grains are anorthite-rich (An9699). The isolated plagioclase grains show a range of compositions (An99.5Ab0.5 to An7Ab88). One of the Ab-rich grains contains thin exsolutions of K-rich plagioclase and inclusions of Cl-apatite, ferroan olivine (Fa79, 1.6 wt% MnO) and pigeonite (Fs69Wo8, 1.6 wt% MnO) with thin (~1 µm) exsolution lamellae of ferroan augite (Fs46Wo33, 0.9 wt% MnO) (Fig. 1f). The inferred (26Al/27Al)0 in CH chondrules and isolated plagioclase grains studied are given in Table 1. Because minerals with low 27Al/24Mg ratio in chondrules have not been measured yet, these ratios represent model isochrons forced through the origin (27Al/24Mg = 0, 26Mg/24Mg = 0.13932). Only two out of 14 chondrules measured (~15%), 1 Al-rich and 1 type I, show resolvable 26Mg* corresponding to (26Al/27Al)0 of (4.9±2.6)×106 and (6.2±5.2)×106 (±2). This is the lowest number of chondrules with resolvable 26Mg* among all unmetamoprhosed ordinary and carbonaceous chondrites studied so far (Fig. 2). For a comparison, ~35% of CR chondrules and virtually all chondrules in type 3.0 ordinary, CO, and Acfer 094 (ungr.) show resolvable 26Mg* [1118]. Assuming uniform distribution of 26Al in the protoplanetary disk after epoch of CAI formation, these observations together with the common presence of very refractory 16O-rich relict CAIs (grossite-rich and hibonite-rich) in CH porphyritic chondrules [19; Fig. 1b] suggest that they may represent the youngest population of chondrules formed by melting of isotopically diverse solid precursors in the disk. The nature of the late-stage melting event(s) that produced CH porphyritic chondrules is unclear. Based on the presence of the uniformly 16O-depleted igneous CAIs in CH and CB chondrites, Krot et al. [5] suggested that they formed by remelting of typical (16O-rich) CAIs in an impact generated plume having an 16O-poor composition. If this the case, some of the porphyritic chondrules could have been melted or remelted in the plume as well. In contrast to CH chondrules, 3 out of 5 coarse plagioclase grains measured [1573 2-10 (An99.5Ab0.5), 1573 1-3 (An7Ab88), and 1579 4-1 (An6Ab89)] show resolvable 26Mg*, corresponding to the inferred (26Al/27Al)0 of (1.4±1.2)×106, (8.9±2.8)×107, and (7.4±4.2)×107, respectively. These data together with the mineralogy, chemical compositions and sizes of the plagioclase 2142.pdf

grains appear to preclude their formation as a result of fragmentation of chondrules or metamorphosed chondrites. Instead they probably represent fragments of differentiated bodies. The high Al/Mg ratio (30005000) in Ab-rich grains and the observed antiperthite texture and pyroxene exsolutions in one of them (Fig. 1f) suggest relatively slow cooling after crystallization. The similar texture was described in Ab-rich plagioclase in the Watson IIE iron meteorite [20]. Oxygen-isotope and trace element measurements of these plagioclase grains may help to elucidate their origin. In addition to the mineralogically pristine nonporphyritic and porphyritic chondrules [5,8,this study], CH chondrites contain thermally metamorphosed porphyritic chondrules (Figs. 1g,h) and several kinds of hydrated lithic clasts [21,22]. These observations may indicate that CH chondrites accreted diverse types of materials, suggesting they represent accretionary breccias that sampled the protoplanetary disk, possibly, during a debris stage of its evolution.
