WHAT IS THE SURFACE TEMPERATURE OF THE MOON?  J. L. Bandfield1 P. O. Hayne2 and D. A. Paige3,1Space Science Institute (jbandfield@spacescience.org); 2Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology; 3University of California, Los AngelesIntroduction: Surface temperature is fundamentalproperty and we need accurate knowledge of it in order  to  understand  planetary  surfaces.  In  their  ownright, temperatures can be used to determine near surface thermophysical properties that can lead to an understanding of the processes that form the surface layerand regolith. Infrared measurements also contain spectral features dependent on surface mineralogy that areconvolved with temperature dependent  radiance.  Theaccurate separation of the temperature and mineralogical signals in the spectra is essential for the determination of both surface temperatures and mineralogy.This is an important problem for the interpretationof both thermal infrared and near-infrared observationsof the lunar surface [e.g., 1-7]. With knowledge of surface temperature, it is possible to separate these two effects, allowing for further analysis of surface mineralogy  and  thermophysical  properties.  Methods  havebeen developed to retrieve surface temperatures  and,as is often necessary with shorter wavelength data, recover surface reflectance free of residual temperatureeffects [1,2,4,6].The lunar  surface  has  two properties  that  greatlycomplicate  the notion of  surface  temperature;  1)  thesurface is extremely rough [3,8], and 2) the regolith ishighly insulating [e.g., 9]. These two properties ensurethat  thermally  isolated  surfaces  can  be  separated  byjust  a  few millimeters  and  can  have  vastly  differenttemperatures  depending  on  the  local  solar  incidenceangles [10-12] (Fig. 1). Consequently, remote observations of the lunar surface typically have a wide varietyof temperatures within the measurement field of view.This leads to  properties  such  as  infrared  “beaming”,for example [13].The  emitted  spectral  radiance  from  a  surface  ofmixed  temperatures  cannot  be  approximated  by  amodel that only uses a single temperature. Under mostcircumstances,  this  assumption  will  result  in  a  blueslope in the resulting emissivity or thermally correctedreflectance spectra [3,7]. The effects of anisothermalityare most severe at short wavelengths and the resultingeffects on the spectrum are greatest at high angles ofsolar  incidence  with relatively low average  temperatures. In fact, the highest temperature surfaces with thelowest angles of solar incidence are the least susceptible to this effect (Figs. 2-3).Model: In  order  to  properly  account  for  surfaceanisothermality, it is necessary to account for surfaceroughness effects.  For this work, we use a simple radiative equilibrium model for daytime measurements.This closely approximates the lunar surface temperatures because of the slow rotation and low thermal inertia of the lunar surface. Where the sun is below thelocal horizon, surface temperature is set to 100K (similar  to  nighttime  surface  temperatures).  To  modelroughness,  we use  a simple Gaussian  distribution ofslopes similar to that of [8].  This reduces the surfaceFigure 1.  The lunar regolith is both rough and highlyinsulating.  Temperatures  of  sun-facing versus  shadedsurfaces  in  this  image  can  vary  by  nearly  200K.(Apollo image AS15-82-11105)Figure 2.

slopes/roughness  to  a  single  parameter  (RMS  slopedistribution),  while maintaining reasonable fidelity tonatural  surfaces.  Using the modeled temperatures  foreach  slope/azimuth  combination  and  slope  distributions, the mixture of Planck radiances are calculated inproportion  to  their  contribution  to  the  measurementfield of view. The resulting modeled spectral radiancecan  be  directly  compared  with  spacecraft  measurements (Fig. 3) [e.g., 7].Results: Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Diviner radiometer data show clear signs of severe anisothermality as expected. Multiple angle observations of a surface have shown brightness temperature variations ofup to 65 K with the varying proportion of sub-pixelshaded and sunlit surfaces in the measurement field ofview. In addition, shorter wavelength brightness temperatures  deviate  from  longer  wavelengths  with  increasing  solar  incidence  (Fig.  3).  Comparison  of  themodeled  brightness  temperatures  with  LRO  Divinermeasurements shows good agreement with a 25° RMSsurface slope distribution, broadly similar to previouswork [8].Implications: Interpretation of thermally correctedlunar surface reflectance or emissivity spectra must either incorporate roughness modeling or be restricted tolow angles of solar incidence. Accounting for roughness is essential for the interpretation of lunar compositions, but has not been implemented for the thermalcorrection of lunar near infrared measurements [2,4,6].The  lack  of  accounting  for  surface  roughness  islikely to be at least part of the cause of the variable intensity of the 3  μm OH- absorption on the Moon.  Although a distinct  absorption feature is present  and isclearly attributed to H2O/OH- [14-16], the variability inits strength shows a pattern and magnitude similar tothat expected from surface roughness effects (Fig. 4).For  example,  the blue  slope  will  be  most  intense  athigh latitudes and during early morning/late afternoon.Similar effects are likely to be present in NIR measurements of any airless body, and a better understanding of the effects of roughness and anisothermality onemitted radiance can lead to greatly improved corrections  and  derivation  of  surface  temperature  distributions in these datasets.References: [1]  Clark,  R.N.
