 WHAT IS THE SURFACE TEMPERATURE OF THE MOON?  J. L. Bandfield1 P. O. Hayne2 and D. A. Paige3, 1Space Science Institute (jbandfield@spacescience.org); 2Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology; 3University of California, Los Angeles Introduction: Surface temperature is fundamental property and we need accurate knowledge of it in order  to  understand  planetary  surfaces.  In  their  own right, temperatures can be used to determine near surface thermophysical properties that can lead to an understanding of the processes that form the surface layer and regolith. Infrared measurements also contain spectral features dependent on surface mineralogy that are convolved with temperature dependent  radiance.  The accurate separation of the temperature and mineralogical signals in the spectra is essential for the determination of both surface temperatures and mineralogy. This is an important problem for the interpretation of both thermal infrared and near-infrared observations of the lunar surface [e.g., 1-7]. With knowledge of surface temperature, it is possible to separate these two effects, allowing for further analysis of surface mineralogy  and  thermophysical  properties.  Methods  have been developed to retrieve surface temperatures  and, as is often necessary with shorter wavelength data, recover surface reflectance free of residual temperature effects [1,2,4,6]. The lunar  surface  has  two properties  that  greatly complicate  the notion of  surface  temperature;  1)  the surface is extremely rough [3,8], and 2) the regolith is highly insulating [e.g., 9]. These two properties ensure that  thermally  isolated  surfaces  can  be  separated  by just  a  few millimeters  and  can  have  vastly  different temperatures  depending  on  the  local  solar  incidence angles [10-12] (Fig. 1). Consequently, remote observations of the lunar surface typically have a wide variety of temperatures within the measurement field of view. This leads to  properties  such  as  infrared  "beaming", for example [13]. The  emitted  spectral  radiance  from  a  surface  of mixed  temperatures  cannot  be  approximated  by  a model that only uses a single temperature. Under most circumstances,  this  assumption  will  result  in  a  blue slope in the resulting emissivity or thermally corrected reflectance spectra [3,7]. The effects of anisothermality are most severe at short wavelengths and the resulting effects on the spectrum are greatest at high angles of solar  incidence  with relatively low average  temperatures. In fact, the highest temperature surfaces with the lowest angles of solar incidence are the least susceptible to this effect (Figs. 2-3). Model: In  order  to  properly  account  for  surface anisothermality, it is necessary to account for surface roughness effects.  For this work, we use a simple radiative equilibrium model for daytime measurements. This closely approximates the lunar surface temperatures because of the slow rotation and low thermal inertia of the lunar surface. Where the sun is below the local horizon, surface temperature is set to 100K (similar  to  nighttime  surface  temperatures).  To  model roughness,  we use  a simple Gaussian  distribution of slopes similar to that of [8].  This reduces the surface Figure 1.  The lunar regolith is both rough and highly insulating.  Temperatures  of  sun-facing versus  shaded surfaces  in  this  image  can  vary  by  nearly  200K. (Apollo image AS15-82-11105) Figure 2. Modeled brightness temperatures for a typical lunar surface roughness (25° RMS). Apparent temperature variations and spectral slopes become severe at  high  angles  of  solar  incidence  and  short  wavelengths. 240 280 320 360 400 4  8  12  16  20 Wavelength (μm) Solar Incidence = 80° 60° 70° 50° 40° 0° 30° Br ig ht ne ss T em pe ra tu re (K )  slopes/roughness  to  a  single  parameter  (RMS  slope distribution),  while maintaining reasonable fidelity to natural  surfaces.  Using the modeled temperatures  for each  slope/azimuth  combination  and  slope  distributions, the mixture of Planck radiances are calculated in proportion  to  their  contribution  to  the  measurement field of view. The resulting modeled spectral radiance can  be  directly  compared  with  spacecraft  measurements (Fig. 3) [e.g., 7]. Results: Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Diviner radiometer data show clear signs of severe anisothermality as expected. Multiple angle observations of a surface have shown brightness temperature variations of up to 65 K with the varying proportion of sub-pixel shaded and sunlit surfaces in the measurement field of view. In addition, shorter wavelength brightness temperatures  deviate  from  longer  wavelengths  with  increasing  solar  incidence  (Fig.  3).  Comparison  of  the modeled  brightness  temperatures  with  LRO  Diviner measurements shows good agreement with a 25° RMS surface slope distribution, broadly similar to previous work [8]. Implications: Interpretation of thermally corrected lunar surface reflectance or emissivity spectra must either incorporate roughness modeling or be restricted to low angles of solar incidence. Accounting for roughness is essential for the interpretation of lunar compositions, but has not been implemented for the thermal correction of lunar near infrared measurements [2,4,6]. The  lack  of  accounting  for  surface  roughness  is likely to be at least part of the cause of the variable intensity of the 3  μm OH- absorption on the Moon.  Although a distinct  absorption feature is present  and is clearly attributed to H2O/OH- [14-16], the variability in its strength shows a pattern and magnitude similar to that expected from surface roughness effects (Fig. 4). For  example,  the blue  slope  will  be  most  intense  at high latitudes and during early morning/late afternoon. Similar effects are likely to be present in NIR measurements of any airless body, and a better understanding of the effects of roughness and anisothermality on emitted radiance can lead to greatly improved corrections  and  derivation  of  surface  temperature  distributions in these datasets.
