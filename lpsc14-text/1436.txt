Introduction: The presence of water molecules in the soil of Gale Crater is thought to be direct evidence for the existence of a water reservoir in the crater a long time ago. Layered sediments over the Gale Crater floor are thought to have accumulated in past epochs, when episodes of water inflow and evaporation took place in the crater. The layers of water-bearing minerals contain the history of these episodes. Testing of water content in the shallow subsurface is the primary research goal of the Russian contributed active neutron instrument DAN onboard the NASA’s rover Curiosity [1, 2]. Results: The first data analysis of the DAN investigation onboard the Curiosity rover is presented for 154 individual points of active mode measurements along 1900 meters of the traverse over the first 361 sols in Gale. It is found that a model of constant water content with depth should be rejected for practically all tested points, while a two-layer model, with different water contents in the subsurface layers, is supported by the data (Table 1). So-called direct two-layer model (water content increasing with depth) works for odometry ranges between 0 – 451 meters and beyond 671 meters. The mean water abundance of the top and bottom layers corresponds to 1.5 – 1.7 wt% and 2.2 – 3.3 wt%, respectively, while at some tested spots the water content is estimated to be as high as about 5 wt%. An inverse two-layer model (water content decreasing with depth) is supported by the data for the odometry range 455 – 648 meters, with an estimated mean water abundance of 2.1  0.1 wt% and 1.4  0.04 wt% in the top and bottom layers, respectively (Table 1).       The special DAN observation campaign was proposed to perform DAN active measurements each 0.75 – 1 m to search for variations of water bulk composition within 20 m route across contact area between Sheepbed and Gillespie members of the Yellowknife Bay formation. It was found that several subunits in Sheepbed and Gillespie could be characterized with different depth distribution of water and different content of chlorine. The variations of average water within 60 cm depth were detected as large as 2-3%. The difference in chlorine variations was ranged within 0.81.5%.  Table 1. Average parameters of soil for four different ranges of the Curiosity odometry Traverce ranges 0 – 455 m 455 – 671 m 671 – 876 m 876 – 1900 m Top water (%) 1.68  ± 0.08 2.17  ± 0.12 1.50  ± 0.04 1.48  ± 0.03 Bottom water (%) 2.23  ± 0.08 1.41  ± 0.04 2.64  ± 0.06 3.33  ± 0.07 Aaverage water (%) 2.07  ± 0.05 1.47  ± 0.03 2.31  ± 0.04 2.65  ± 0.04 Top layer (cm) 13 ± 1 6 ± 2 16 ± 1 22 ± 1 Chlorine  (%) 1.07  ± 0.02 1.14  ± 0.02 1.19  ± 0.01 1.17  ± 0.01  Discussion: The martian soil contains water in three distinct forms: the first form is water chemically bound inside minerals, the second form consists of water molecules adsorbed in multi-layers over the surface of regolith grains, and the third form is free water ice in the porous volume of the regolith. The third form of water cannot exist in the upper most layer of subsurface at the latitude of Gale because of sublimation, so one should focus on the first and on the second. According to the DAN data, the majority of testing spots along the initial 1900 meters of  traverse have the socalled direct water distribution, where the drier top layer, with about 1.5 – 1.7 wt% of water, lies above the wetter bottom one with about 2.2 – 3.3 wt% of water (see Table 1). The thickness of the top layer is about 10 – 20 cm, which is consistent with the skin layer depth for temperature variations. Therefore, one may suppose that the top layer has less water due to diurnal and annual temperature variations and interaction with the atmosphere. Only chemically bound water and some adsorbed water might reside in the top layer under these conditions, and the content of such water is about 1.5 – 1.7 wt%. The bottom layer is more isolated from the thermal wave and from the atmosphere, and the soil of this layer may contain more adsorbed water on the surface of grains. Using the mean values for the testing spots with direct two-layer models (Table 1), one may estimate that the bottom layer might have an additional 0.7 – 1.6 wt% of adsorbed water.  1436.pdf

  In the odometry range of 455 – 671 meters (see Table 1) the DAN data support the inverse two-layer model with a larger water content in the top of the soil. Its thickness is only a few cm, which is at the limit of DAN sensitivity for detection of a layered deposit. The domination of inverse two layer models for the majority of testing spots along the particular range of the traverse supports its reality. The Rocknest area of aeolian sediment lies in this odometry range, which have exceptionally small water at the bottom layer 1.0 wt% and the exceptionally high content of water at the top layer 3.0 wt% (odometry position of 490 meters). As a possible physical explanation of the phenomenon of inverse two-layer water distribution, one may suggest that DAN detected some additional deposition in the uppermost layer of a some unusual soil with large water content, about 2 – 3 wt%. It covers the standard soil having a water content of 1.5 – 1.7 wt%, which is rather similar to the estimated water content of the top layers at testing spots with direct two-layer distribution. The larger water content in the unusual soil could be either related with larger fraction of hydrated minerals, or with larger specific surface of aeolian sediments.  Perhaps the utmost surprise of the current data analysis is the relatively small content of water in the soil along the traverse. For the odometry ranges consistent with the direct two-layer model, the verticalaverage water in the subsurface is about 2.1 – 2.7 wt% (Table 1). These values for water content based on DAN data are about 2 times smaller than the value > 5 wt% in the area of Gale Crater deduced from the orbital data of the GRS suite of instruments onboard the NASA Mars Odyssey spacecraft [3]. Among all tested spots along the traverse, there are only about 10% of spots, which are consistent with the 2-layer models of subsurface water supported by both DAN surface data and HEND data from the orbit (see Figure 1). DAN data for these spots request the largest values of water content in the bottom layer in comparion with the overall distribution of these parameter for all testing spots along the traverce (Figure 1). In addition to the difference between the surface and the orbital data for the content of ground water, it is also the difference in the estimated content of chlorine in the soil: DAN data requests about 1.1 – 1.2 % of chlorine along the traverse, while the orbital measurements by GRS gamma-ray spectrometer point out to the content about 0.5% (see [4]). The simplest possibility to explain the discrepancy between the surface and the orbital observations could be the assumption that DAN data represent some local area around the traverce, which is much smaller in comparison with the field of view of the Mars Odyssey instruments on the orbit (for HEND the radius of field of veiw is about 300 km). One could not know the morphological origin of this area, but should assume that its soil less water and more chlorine than the soil of the area around it. It could be part of the Gale floor around the landing site, or the enture crater as well. However, one may speculate that, during thr early epochs, the transport of soil by water streams and removal of soil by atmospheric erosion were working together producing the depletion of water and inhancement of chlorine in this area. Further measurements toward the Mount Sharp might allow to test this assumption.    Figure 1. Distributions are shown of estimated water content in the top (top) and in the bottom (bottom) layers of subsurface  for testing sites along the traverce. Blue part represent 10% of sites, which models are consistemt with both DAN and HEND data.  References: [1] Grotzinger J. P. et al., (2012), Space Sci. Rev., 170, 5-58. [2] Mitrofanov I.
