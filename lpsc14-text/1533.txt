REANALYSIS OF THE PENETRATION DATA PROVIDED BY LUNOKHOD ROVER ON THE MOON.  A. ElShafie1,2 and V. F. Chevrier2, 1 National Office for Research on Measurement and Evaluation Systems, 2 Arkansas Center for Space and Planetary Sciences, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR 72701. aelshafi@uark.edu.       Introduction:  Lunokhod 1 and 2 rovers were onboard Luna17 and 21 missions to the Moon. A 5 cm diameter penetrometer was equipped on Lunokhod 1 and 2, assigned to penetrate up to 10 cm deep with a maximum penetration weight of 23 kg in order to investigate the mechanical properties of the lunar subsurface [1]. Along the traverse in the region of Lemonnier crater in the transitional zone from the sea region to the highland on the Moon, Lunokhod 2 conducted penetration testing using its cone penetrometer [1]. Figure 1 shows the penetration forces as a function of depth for various tests conducted by the Lunokhod 2 penetrometer [1]. Analysis of the penetration curves suggested that curve 6 and the first part of curve 1 correspond to the minimum and maximum penetration forces, respectively [1], corresponding to penetration into the loosest and hardest regolith materials [1]. Up to that level of interpretation, no further analysis was reported about using the Lunokhod penetration forces to interpret the subsurface stratigraphy. Luna 16 and 20 were  capable of drilling and sampling from the subsurface of the lunar regolith. These samples were placed in a sealed capsule and sent to Earth for analysis. Luna missions provided bulk density, angle of internal friction and void ratio for lunar regolith which correspond to the maximum and minimum penetration curves (curve 1 and 6) in Figure 1. Regolith bulk density was found to have a minimum and maximum value of 1.04 and 1.798 kg m-3 corresponding to regolith void ratio of 1.88 and 0.67 and angle of internal friction of 25 and 50°, respectively for Luna 20 samples. Luna 16 reported a minimum and maximum bulk density of 1.115 and 1.793 kg m-3 with void ratio of 1.70 and 0.67 minimum and maximum angle of internal friction of 25 and 50°, respectively [1]. As shown in Figure 1, sudden changes in the penetration forces as a function of depth are observed from the shape of the penetration curves which indicate inhomogeneities in the subsurface regolith. The main objective of this work is to theoretically reproduce the penetration forces as function of depth as in Figure 1 in order to estimate the subsurface densities which correspond to each penetration curve.   Methodology:In order to reproduce curves in Figure 1; we used the following method: We theoretically calculate the maximum and minimum bearing capacity factors using the penetration force shown in curves 1 and 6 and their properties [2] as input data and apply it to the model provided by [3].  Figure 1. Penetration forces as a function of depth on the Moon as conducted by Lunokhod 2.  Figure 2. Maximum and minimum force as a function of depth conducted by Lunokhod  2 as well as the theoretical predicted force of penetration for part of curve 1 and curve 6 described in Fig.1.  1) We correlate the maximum and minimum bearing capacity factors and regolith bulk densities to the angles of internal friction. 2) We theoretically calculate the penetration forces using the estimated bearing capacity factors for curves 1 and 6 based on knowledge of the bulk density, void ratio and angle of internal friction; and compare them to the data provided by Lunokhood 2 (Fig. 2).  3) For the other curves (2 to 5) in Figure 1, we use a bulk density as input data and apply it to the model to calculate the theoretical penetration forcethat we compare to the experimental data provided by Lunokhood 2 for each curve. We vary the bulk density until we get a good fit between the theoretical penetration forces and Lunokhood 2 data (Fig. 3).  Results: An increase in penetration force as a function of depth is observed for curve 2, the first 30 mm for curve 3 and the first 32 mm for curve 5. The fitted bulk density is 1650 kg m-3 for curve 2, 1350 kg m-3 for curve 3 and 1100 kg m-3 for curve 5.  0510152025303540450 20 40 60 80 100Depth (mm)Force (N) 12345605101520250 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80Depth (mm)Force (N)1st part of curve 1B.D = 1798 kg m-3 Nq = 610    f = 50°Curve 6B.D = 1040 kg m-3 Nq = 23.15    f = 25°1533.pdf

     Figure 3. Penetration force as a function of depth conducted by Lunokhod 2 and its corresponding theoretical forces.   Two density levels are observed for curve 4. From 0 to 30 mm the density is estimated to be 1200 kg m-3 while the rest of the curve is fitted with a density 1330 kg m3. The rest of the penetration depth for curve 3 (~30 to 100 mm) and curve 5 (~38 to 43 mm) could not be reproduced using the model, probably due to the limits imposed by the maximum and minimum void ratios extrapolated from curves 1 and 6.. However the density corresponding to the depth of ~30 to 100 mm in curve 3 is less than 1350 kg m-3 and the depth of ~38 to 43 mm for curve 5 is greater than 1100 kg m-3 since the data are below the fit for curve 3 and above the fit for curve 5.     Figure 4. Stratigraphic section of the bulk density as a function of depth for curve 1 – 6 conducted by Lunokhood 2 penetrometer.   Conclusion: Based on our analysis of the Lunokhod 2 penetration force data, large inhomogenitites of the subsurface regolith bulk density are observed and are probably due to variation of subsurface porosity along the route of Lunokhod 2 at different depth (Fig. 4). A decrease in the subsurface density as a function of depth (curve 3, Fig.4) might be due to shifting or faulting in the deposited layer due to quackes or impacts. Therefore, it is possible to predict the subsurface density from penetration force curves (Fig. 4).  References: [1] Leonovich, AK. et al. (1976) Space Activity Impact on Sci. and Tech. 1 : 321-32.
