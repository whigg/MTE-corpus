Because it is  an  M-type  asteroid  with  a  fairly  flat,  featureless spectrum,  it  is inherently difficult  to study using  remote observations  compared  to other  types of asteroids. In addition, Kleopatra has an unusual dog-bone shape (see Fig.  1) and two natural  satellites orbiting around it  [1].  The satellites orbit  at  radii  of 454 km and 678 km, with the innermost being 6.9 km in diameter and the outermost being 8.9 km in diameter. Here, we focus on the presence of the two satellites recently  found  orbiting  Kleopatra.  One  hypothesis about the origin of the satellites is that they formed in a single large impact that also gave Kleopatra its elongated shape [1].  We consider  an alternative hypothesis: that a significant portion of the satellites' mass is comprised of ejecta produced in smaller impacts over the lifetime of Kleopatra. Kleopatra's shape gives rise to a gravity field that is much different than that of a spherical body. For a spherical body, the gravitational field is well represented by that  of a point mass. Depending on its departure velocity, ejecta that is moving under the influence of a point-mass gravity field will follow one of two types of trajectories: closed (elliptical) or open (hyperbolic). Ejecta on a closed trajectory will return to the surface while ejecta on an open trajectory will leave the system entirely. In this scenario there  is  little  chance  ejecta  will  accumulate  in  orbit (unless non-gravitational forces are considered). In contrast, an elongated object such as Kleopatra has  a  gravity field  that  allows for  a  third  result  in which ejecta neither immediately returns nor escapes. Ejecta  departing  Kleopatra  under  certain  conditions (departure  location,  velocity, and  direction)  may end up in  a  quasi-stable orbit  where it  could remain  for some time before returning  to Kleopatra  or escaping the  system.  This  concept  is  illustrated  in  Figure  2. While  in  this  quasi-stable  orbit,  the  ejecta  has  a greater likelihood of colliding with one of Kleopatra's satellites.  Over time,  a  great  amount  of ejecta could accumulate on the satellites. Method: This work is divided into two parts: First, we estimate the total mass of ejecta we can expect to have been produced due to impacts over the lifetime of Kleopatra.  Second, we estimate what fraction of that ejecta material  may have remained  in  a  quasi-stable orbit around Kleopatra—neither  returning  directly to the surface nor escaping. To answer the first part, we assume Kleopatra has seen roughly the same impact history as the asteroid Vesta, and use results of the Dawn mission [3] to estimate the crater  size distribution  over the  lifetime of Kleopatra.  From the  crater  size distribution,  we can estimate the total  amount  of ejecta produced by impacts  on  Kleopatra  using  results  from  experimental impact studies [4]. For  the  second  part  of  the  question,  we model Kleopatra's  gravity using  a  tri-axial  ellipsoid  of dimensions 217x94x81 km [5]. Then, given a simulated impact  on the surface of the ellipsoid,  we propagate Figure 1: A radar shape model of Kleopatra [2]. Figure 2: Ejecta departing at a certain location (horizontal axis) and velocity (vertical axis) may end up in a quasi stable orbit. This plot is valid for the equatorial plane of the ellipsoid, with the contours indicating the Jacobi constant in the rotating frame.  ejecta trajectories over the range of departure velocities and directions to assess the fate of the ejecta particles  after  impact.  Impact  simulations  are  performed over the surface of the ellipsoid. We then compare the fraction of trajectories that neither immediately return nor escape to the total number of propagated trajectories, yielding an estimate of the fraction of ejecta material that ends up orbiting the asteroid. Results: Applying the crater distribution measured by Dawn  at  Vesta,  we estimate  that 7.1×1016 kg  of ejecta  has  been  produced on  Kleopatra  from craters between 1 km and 30 km in diameter. Assuming the satellites are spherical, we estimate that together they have a mass of  2.1×1015 kg. Therefore, the mass of the satellites is roughly 3% of the total ejecta mass. From  simulations  of  impacts  on  the  surface  of Kleopatra, approximately 2% of trajectories achieve a quasi-stable state  not  possible for  a  nearly spherical object,  where  a  point  mass  model  of gravity  dominates.  Ejecta  following  these  trajectories  spends  a longer time in orbit around Kleopatra,  increasing the likelihood that it may deposit on one of the satellites. Such ejecta may comprise a significant portion of the satellites' mass. [1] Descamps  P.  et  al.  (2011)  Icarus,  211, 1022-1033. [2] Ostro S. J. et al. (2000) Science, 288, 836-839.
