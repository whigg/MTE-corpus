Introduction: Bulk meteorites exhibit nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies for several elements, including Mo and Ru [1-3] (Fig. 1). The Mo and Ru anomalies correlate as predicted from s-process nucleosynthesis theory, indicating a heterogeneous distribution of a common s-process carrier at the bulk meteorite scale [1,2]. In contrast, other elements, including Os and W (with exception of IVB irons) exhibit uniform and terrestrial isotope compositions, indicating that the presolar carriers of at least these elements were well mixed in the nebula [4-9]. These contrasting isotopic characteristics are not well understood, but bear important constraints on the origin of the nucleosynthetic isotope heterogeneity in the solar accretion disk.

Sequential leaching of primitive chondrites is a powerful tool to identify the isotopic signatures of the distinct presolar components present in meteorites [e.g. 10,11]. Here, we present the first Ru isotope data obtained by sequential leaching of the Murchison and Allende chondrites. The new data are discussed in the context of existing Os, Mo and W isotope data for the same leachates [10,11] to (i) evaluate any correlated behavior of Ru, Mo, W and Os isotope anomalies, and (ii) to asses the origin of correlated Ru and Mo isotope anomalies in bulk meteorites (and the absence of Os and W anomalies in the same samples). Analytical Methods: A 16.5 g powder of Murchison and a 4 g powder of Allende were sequentially dissolved as follows: L1: 9M HAc, 1 day, 20°C; L2: 4.7M HNO3, 5 days, 20°C; L3: 5.5M HCl, 1 day, 75°C; L4: 13M HF - 3M HCl, 1 day, 75°C; L5: 13M HF – 6M HCl, 3 days, 150°C; L6: insoluble residue. The Murchison samples were already analyzed for Os [10] as well as Mo and W isotope compositions [11]. Sample aliquots were dried and redissolved in dilute H2SO4. The insoluble residue (L6) was fused by alkaline fusion [12] and then dissolved in dilute H2SO4. Ruthenium was purified by distillation of volatile RuO4  trapped in H2O2. Ruthenium isotopes were measured on a ThermoScientific Neptune Plus MC-ICPMS at the University of Münster. Samples were introduced using a PFA nebulizer attached to a Cetac Aridus II desolvating system. Isobaric interferences of Mo and Pd were corrected by monitoring 97Mo and 105Pd. Measured Ru isotope ratios were normalized to the terrestrial 99Ru/101Ru using the exponential law. Alternatively, the Ru isotope data were normalized to the terrestrial 100Ru/101Ru, to identify possible anomalies on 99Ru from 99Tc-decay in SiC [13]. The Ru isotope data are reported in εiRu as the parts per 104 deviation from the terrestrial Ru isotope composition.

Results: The Ru isotope data reveal large internal anomalies in Allende and Murchison, which can be accounted for by variable contributions of s-, r- and pprocess Ru nuclides. All samples plot on a welldefined ε100Ru vs. ε102Ru correlation line, which slope is in good agreement with that predicted for mixing between presumed s- or r-process components and terrestrial Ru (Fig. 2a). In ε98Ru vs. ε100Ru space (Fig. 2b) most samples plot along a calculated s-process mixing line, indicating variable amounts of s-process Ru released in the individual leach steps. Some samples seem to slightly deviate from the s-process mixing line, possibly indicating anomalous 99Ru from 99Tcdecay (hosted in SiC [13]) in these samples. Evidence for this comes from the observation that for 100Ru/101Ru normalized data, significant scatter is observed for correlations between ε99Ru and other Ru isotope ratios. At the same time, well-defined correlations are obtained between Ru isotope ratios not involving 99Ru. Fig. 3: ε100Ru vs. ε92Mo (a.) and ε186Os (b.) for leachates (L1-L5) and acid-resistant residue (L6) from Murchison in comparison to mixing lines between a presumed s-process component and terrestrial Ru, Mo, Os.  Discussion: The Ru isotope results show that there is no obvious correlation between the Mo and Ru isotope anomalies in the leachates (Fig. 3a). This is surprising, because the ε92Mo vs. ε100Ru correlation of bulk meteorites indicates a heterogeneous distribution of a common s-process Mo-Ru carrier at the bulk meteorite scale (Fig. 1). That carrier, however, does not seem to be present in primitive chondrites, at least not in Murchison. In contrast, the Ru isotope anomalies in the Murchison leachates are broadly correlated with those in Os (Fig. 3b), consistent with a common sprocess carrier for Ru and Os in Murchison. This again is surprising, because there are no resolvable Os isotope anomalies at the bulk meteorite scale, in spite of widespread Ru isotope variations. A similar observation was made for Mo and W isotopes [11]. In summary, while the leachates reveal correlated isotope anomalies for the Ru-Os and Mo-W pairs, bulk meteorites exhibit correlated anomalies in Ru and Mo, and no anomalies in W and Os. The origin of these disparate isotope systematics is not obvious. Perhaps the most straightforward interpretation of the bulk meteorite data is that they reflect variable abundances of a presolar carrier of s-process Ru and Mo. This carrier did not contain appreciable amounts of W and Os, accounting for the correlated Mo-Ru isotope anomalies and the absence of anomalies in Os and W. This would imply that W and Os are predominantly hosted in a different, homogeneously distributed presolar carrier. The major problem with this interpretation is that the Murchison and Allende leachates do not provide clear evidence for separate presolar carriers of 'light' (Mo-Ru) and 'heavy' (W-Os) nuclides, but rather reveal correlated Mo-W and Ru-Os isotope anomalies. This may reflect incongruent behavior of these elements during leaching and/or the destruction or modification of the presolar carriers of Mo, Ru, W and Os by nebular or parent body processes [11,14]. The fact that Ru and Os in the leachates correlate as expected from nucleosynthesis theory would then require that the Ru and Os released from presolar phases were incorporated into new phase(s) with approximately solar proportions. Clearly, a better understanding of the effects of nebular and parent body processes on presolar components and a better in-situ characterization of the carriers of isotopic anomalies is needed for constraining the origin of the disparate isotope systematics in bulk meteorites and leachates of primitive chondrites.
