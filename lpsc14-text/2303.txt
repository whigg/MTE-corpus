 High Resolution Optical Spectroscopy of Comet C/2012 S1 ISON from R=1.6-0.4 AU Pre-Perihelion  A. J. McKay1 and A. L. Cochran1, 1University of Texas Austin/McDonald Observatory.   Introduction:  The chemical composition of cometary ices is among the most primitive in the Solar System.  For this reason studies of cometary composition are important for constraining planetary formation models.  As the best way to characterize the chemical composition of the cometary population as a whole is through remote-sensing spectroscopy of volatiles in the gas phase, it is paramount that the coma physics and chemistry responsible for the observed emissions is understood. Comet C/2012 S1 (ISON) provided an unprecedented opportunity to study coma physics and chemistry for a sun-grazing comet.  Due to its early discovery, observations of ISON could be planned well in advance of its perihelion passage at only 2.7 solar radii.  Although it did not survive perihelion passage (and therefore observations of how the comet's observed composition changed after exposure to the harsh nearSun environment were not possible), observations of how ISON's observed composition changed as it moved towards the Sun were possible throughout the pre-perihelion observing window. We present high spectral resolution optical spectroscopy of ISON obtained pre-perihelion in October and November 2013, spanning a heliocentric distance range of 1.6-0.4 AU. Observations:  We obtained high resolution optical spectroscopy throughout ISON's pre-perihelion leg using three instruments: HIRESb on the Keck I telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, ARCES on the Apache Point Observatory 3.5-meter telescope in Sunspot, NM, and the 2DCoude on the 2.7-meter Harlan J. Smith Telescope at McDonald Observatory.  All these spectrographs provide high spectral resolution (R=30,000-60,000).  This enables several avenues of analysis not possible at lower spectral resolution, such as observations of the forbidden oxygen lines at 5577, 6300, and 6364 Angstroms, and ortho-para ratios in NH2. We present more details of the observations in Table 1. Results: We report detection of many species in our high spectral resolution data set.  CN, C2, C3, CH, NH2, [OI], NH, and OH are all detected (OH and NH are only detected with HIRES since ARCES and 2DCoude do not go far enough into the UV to detect these features).  Near peak-brightness in early November, we also detected Na, K, and H-alpha.  Some representative spectra are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. We infer several interesting results pertaining to the gas activity and coma physics from our observations: 1) The rotational temperature of both C2 and CN increased with decreasing heliocentric distance, as evidenced by the increase in the strength of the C2 bandhead and the formation of a band-head in the CN spectra for heliocentric distances of less than 0.6 AU. 2) The relative intensity of the C2 lines increases relative to lines of other species, such as [OI] and NH2, suggesting that the origin of C2 is fundamentally different from these other species (for instance photodissociation of molecules for [OI] and NH2 vs. sublimation of carbonaceous dust particles for C2). 3) Na and K were detected only when the comet was within 1 AU of the Sun, suggesting that sublimating dust grains may be responsible for the release of these metals into the coma. 4) We detected the [OI] 6300Å line throughout the apparition, which gives us a proxy for the H2O production rate.  We were able to detect the [OI] 5577Å line in October.  In the November observations, mixing with C2 emission was too severe, making it impossible to isolate the [OI] 5577Å line.  The October observations indicate a typical flux ratio of the [OI] 5577Å and [OI] 6300Å lines, which suggests that ISON has a typical CO2/H2O ratio[1,2].   We will present preliminary production rates for the observed species.  We will compare our observed production rates and abundances to candidate parent species (i.e. molecules that could release the observed species into the coma via photodissociation) observed at IR and sub-mm wavelengths. Future Work: We have a rich data set that provides many possible analyses other than those presented here.  Future work includes measurement of the ortho-para ratio in NH2,, and the 14N/15N ratio in both CN and NH2,.  Both of these quantities are important cosmogonic parameters that can reveal key aspects of cometary formation. In addition, we will be able to measure the changing kinetic temperature of the gas.
