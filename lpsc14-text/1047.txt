Introduction:  Near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) are being discovered at a rate of ~1000/year and this rate will soon increase by a factor of several with upgrades to both the Catalina Sky Survey1 (CSS, 2014 and 2015), the Palomar Transient Factory2 (PTF), and the coming on line of Pan-STARRS-2. NEA characterization is falling well behind discovery, forming a bottleneck for programs. The largest program of optical-near-IR spectroscopy, the MIT-IRTF program3, obtains ~16 nights/year, acquires ~100 NEA spectra/year, and has an accumulated total of ~1000 spectra (mostly at H < 15, R.P. Binzel, priv.comm.). At current rates it will take 100 years to obtain compositions, sizes, and shapes of the ~20,000 H<22 NEAs.  We have proposed the LINNAEUS program [1] in response. LINNAEUS combines 50% of the observing time on the Kitt Peak 2.1 meter telescope with an optimized low-resolution optical spectrograph, the SED Machine, to obtain 1200–2000 NEO spectra per year for a total of 4200 – 7000 in 3.5 years of observing. LINNAEUS would provide an order	  of	  magnitude	  increase	  over current rates, keeping pace with the expected discoveries . The need for speed:  Most NEAs are found within 0.5 mag of their brightest point in that apparition and fade rapidly after discovery, so that 50% have V>20 after 10 days (Fig.1). Moreover on their next apparition they are typically several magnitudes fainter [2].  Hence rapid follow-up, preferably within 1-2 nights of discovery is required to capture the bulk of the population. We cannot wait to select only NEAs of interest.                                                                  1 http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/css/  2 http://ptf.caltech.edu/iptf/  3 http://smass.mit.edu/minus.html The value of optical spectra:  Optical reflectance spectra provide key information for NEAs. Composition. Main Belt asteroids (Figure 2) were the basis of the Bus-Binzel [3] asteroid taxonomy scheme. They provide a breakdown of types into Carbonaceous (C), Stony (S), and “Metallic and unknown” (X), and to several sub-types.  Density. Knowing a Bus-Binzel type also puts limits on the typical density	  of the NEA by comparison to comparable objects with densities measured by radar. Size.  Asteroid diameters are highly uncertain in most cases. The wide range of asteroid albedos, from 0.03 (for the OSIRIS-REx target Bennu, 1999 RQ36) to 0.25, means that optically derived areas are uncertain by factor of almost 10. This translates to a factor ~3 in diameter and a factor ~30 in volume, and mass.  The thermal infrared emission of NEOs gives a much better estimate based on black body area (modified by thermal inertia considerations, e.g. [4]). However, in the short term no thermal infrared survey is capable of detecting large numbers of NEOs. [In the longer term, after 2016, the B612 Sentinel mission4 or the proposed NEOCam mission5 may do so.]  Fortunately, the Explore-NEO and NEOWISE projects made direct measurements of the thermal emission of hundreds of asteroids [5,6]. This allowed comparisons of Bus-Binzel types with albedo. They showed that within a given Bus-Binzel type the albedo, pV, has a fairly tight distribution. Well-classified Sp asteroids have a median pV	  = 0.27 with a dispersion, σ	  = 0.08, Cp asteroids have a median pV = 0.07 with σ	  = 0.05, and Xp asteroids have a median pV = 0.13 with σ	  = 0.13 [6]. So by using optical spectroscopy as an albedo-measuring device, the derived sizes, especially for S and C type NEOs, will become usefully accurate.  LINNAEUS: There are 3 key elements to the LINNAEUS program: the telescope, the instrument and the software. 1. Kitt Peak 2.1m (KP2.1): telescope is well matched to NEA spectroscopy. With the SED-machine the KP2.1 can reach V=20.5 in 30 min at a signal-tonoise ~15 per resolution element at R=100. KP2.1 is                                                                                                     4 http://b612foundation.org/sentinelmission/  5 http://neocam.ipac.caltech.edu   FIGURE 1: FADING OF NEAS AFTER DISCOVERY. 1047.pdf

undersubscribed so that large amounts of observing time - 50%, even 100% - are available. KP2.1 has 11.5 arcsec image quality, and can track moving objects up to 8 arcsec/s as demonstrated for 2005 YU55 [7]. Clear nights on KP2.1 are well-correlated with those on CSS, as they are both in Southern Arizona. 2. SED-machine (SED-M): spectrograph is also well matched to NEA spectroscopy. SED-M was designed to obtain spectrophotometrically accurate spectral energy distributions of faint transients with poorly known positions [8] at the Palomar 1.5m. SED-M is an optical, broad wavelength (0.37µm < λ < 0.92µm) spectrograph with low resolving power (R ~ 100), sufficient to see key diagnostic features in NEO reflectance spectra.  FIGURE 2: WEAK DEFINING FEATURES IN NEA OPTICAL SPECTRA SED-M uses a spectrophotometrically precise IFU that takes spectra covering a 19×19 arcsec field.  FIGURE 3: OPTICAL IFU SPECTRA OF NEA 1999 QE2 TAKEN WITH SED-M ON THE PALOMAR 1.5M DURING COMMISSIONING (JUNE 2013).  To achieve spectrophotometric accuracy of a few percent, SED-M has two advantages: (1) all the light at all wavelengths is captured independent of seeing quality and differential refraction, due to the IFU design, and (2) SED-M comes equipped with the “Rainbow Camera” (RC), an imager that simultaneously monitors the 8.7×8.7 arcmin field surrounding the IFU in the 4 Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) ugri	  bands. With these images atmospheric absorption variations can be removed by comparing star magnitudes to the wellcalibrated SDSS catalog. The comparable SNIFS instrument has achieved photometric accuracy of better than 2% [9]. The RC also serves as a guider unit.  3. Software – scheduling and pipelines: To obtain reliable operations at the intended pace requires automating optimal target selection and reliable pipeline data processing and the distribution of results. We will leverage Chandra X-ray Center expertise in these areas to provide a robust system at modest cost. Pipeline development includes: (1) automated management of calibration exposures; (2) evaluating data set completeness; (3) level of processing autonomy; (4) exception management; (5) data products. We will archive 3 levels of data product: Level 0: the raw data from the telescope formatted for convenient use; Level 1: calibrated spectra and images; Level 2: derived products (taxonomic types, periods). Products can be extracted from the archive in standard PDS Small Bodies Node and IVOA6 formats, either directly or via the IAU Minor Planet Center7.  Summary:  LINNAEUS is a cost-effective program to provide much-needed characterization information on thousands of near-Earth asteroids at an order-ofmagnitude higher rate than at present, sufficient to keep pace with discoveries.
