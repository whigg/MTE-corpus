Here we discuss collatoral results of this work concerning summit-pit crater formation and the role of target heat flow on pristine crater morphology.  Summit-pit craters are complex craters with a central peak, or closely packed ring of peaks, with a pit at the center. They have been noted on both rocky and icy bodies [e.g., 2, 3]. Central 'floor-pit' craters however are far less ubiquitous and are noted only on large bodies with ice-rich surfaces, such as Mars and the icy Galilean satellites. These craters possess a large pit at or near to the center of the crater floor.  Over time, crater depths decrease due to erosion, infilling, viscous relaxation/isostatic rebound. The knowledge of pristine (uneroded, unrelaxed, unfilled) crater depths on planetary bodies and comparison to older counterparts has been used to estimate rates of erosion/infilling and relaxation [e.g., 4, 5]. In both cases, the expected pristine crater depth for a given crater size is an important starting parameter. Method: Our simulations employed the iSALE hydrocode [6], a multi-material, multi-rheology extension of the SALE hydrocode [7] We used a simple spherical and homogeneous water ice projectile, with an impact velocity of 15 km s-1 and an impact angle of 90Â° (See [1] for details). The target was a simple two layer model with water ice above liquid water; target heat flow was varied accordingly. The equation of state and static strength properties used in these simulations are detailed in [1 & 6 and references therein]. Suites of simulations were performed for a range of projectile sizes and ice thicknesses. The crater morphology created by the various impactor size/ice thickness combinations is noted in Table 1. The dimensions of the simulated craters were measured and the depth-diameter results presented in Figure 1.   Results: For ice thickness of 8 km or less, the craters produced by the simulated impact of a projectile with a radius of ~400 m or less had morphologies that were affected by the presence of target layering. Table 1 summarizes the internal morphology created for each combination of projectile radius and ice thickness. Images of model results and comparison to actual Europa crater profiles are presented in [1]. Our simulated impacts produce summit pit craters in cases where the final crater diameter is ~ 3 times the crustal thickness. The floor pit morphology seen in larger craters on icerich bodies was not created by any of the simulations in this work. Our large impactor simulations instead produced a central melt pool.  For ice thickness greater than 8 km, impactors with a radius < 400 m (at 15 km/s) formed central peak craters (as expected for impacts of this size on Europa).  However, despite the consistent crater morphology, the depth of the simulated craters was still affected by changes in the applied heat flow (Figure 1).  Figure 1 shows the depth-diameter (d/D) trends from simulated impacts into various ice thicknesses.  Higher heat flow led to shallower craters and resulted in a d/D trend 'inflection' (the point at which crater depth begins to decrease with increasing crater diameter) at smaller crater diameters.

Impact into thinner ice thickness produce craters with more rim collapse and thus smaller diameters.  Discussion and Conclusions: Our simulated impacts produced summit-pit craters in cases where the final crater diameter was ~ 3 times the crustal thickness. No summary equations are presented here however, as the small number of summit pit craters produced during our simulations does not provide statistical support for this general trend. We suggest that central pit formation (both summit-pits and floor-pits) in craters occurs due to a variety of formation mechanisms. Summit-pits, which are seen on both ice-rich and rocky bodies [e.g., 2, 3], likely form during host crater formation, probably due to sub-surface layering affecting central uplift development [e.g., 8]. Drainage or evaporative escape of impact generated melt or gas could then add to the summit-pit volume [c.f. 9]. We propose that floor-pits, seen only on ice-rich bodies, require a different formation mechanism to summit-pit craters. On Europa, Grainne, Cilix and Pwyll are summitpit craters. Their final crater diameters of 13.5, 18.4 and 23.7 km [10] suggest weaker layers were present at the time and location of each impact, at depths of approximately 4.5, 6.1 and 7.9 km, respectively. In real terms, the formation of summit-pits in our simulated craters is indicative of a weak layer at depth; it does not require the presence of a strengthless layer (i.e., a sub-surface ocean). The presence of sub-surface lakes within the ice layer [c.f. 11], or localized melting due to nearby geologic activity could also produce these weak layers.  Pristine craters formed in a target with high heat flow were shallower and showed an inflection in the depth-diameter trend (see Figure 1) at smaller crater diameters than for the same impact into a target of lesser heat flow. This result has strong implications for studies of the viscous relaxation, isostatic readjustment and erosional development of crater morphology over time: Not only is the efficiency of relaxation/rebound increased by a high target heat flow [e.g., 5], crustal heat flow over the history of a planetary body must also be taken into account when considering the "starting" crater depth as it will be shallower for craters formed in times of higher heat flow.
