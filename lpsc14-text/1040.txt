The  means  by  which  this  water gained access to the original anhydrous constituents of the  meteorites  is  the  subject  of  considerable  debate. Studies of rock texture, mineralogy and bulk chemical composition have concluded that solutions were generated by the melting of water ice  in situ, and remained essentially static as a consequence very low intergranular  permeabilities  [e.g.  3,  4].  By contrast,  results  of oxygen  isotope  work  and  modelling  have  suggested that the fluids moved considerable distances within the parent body [5, 6]. Given the intergranular permeability of the CMs, an extensive fracture network would be required to support such flow.Clues  to  how the  two  very  different  models  for aqueous alteration of the CMs can be reconciled have been recently provided by Rubin [7]. He recognised a good correlation between the magnitude of impact-induced compaction of CM meteorites and their degree of aqueous processing, with the more highly deformed meteorites  being  more  altered.  Here  we  have  asked whether compaction was accompanied by the development of fracture networks that could have provided the conduits  for  aqueous  solutions  that  mediated  all  or some of the alteration. Materials and methods: This study has used thin sections of five CM carbonaceous chondrites: Murchison  (CM2.5),  Murray  (CM2.4-2.5),  LON  94101 (CM2.3),  QUE  93005  (CM2.1)  and  SCO  06043 (CM2.0).  Backscattered  electron  (BSE)  images  were obtained from each sample with a  FEI Quanta fieldemission SEM. Using the BSE images, the degree of impact-related  compaction of  each meteorite  was assessed  by  measuring:  (i)  the  aspect  ratios  of  chondrules,  chondrule  fragments  and  chondrule  pseudomorphs (hereafter ‘chondrules’ for brevity), and (ii) the orientations of the chondrule long axes relative to a reference direction. The axes of any fractures or mineral veins were also recorded.Evidence for dynamic compaction of CMs:  In their study of the shock stages of CMs, [8] found that almost all are classified as S1 (i.e. they have not experienced a single impact of  >~ 5 GPa). The shock stages of three of  the meteorites  studied here  have  been  determined previously are they are essentially unshocked: Murchison (S1-S2 [8]; S1 [7, 9]), Murray (S1 [8]), QUE 93005 (S1 [7]). Despite this finding that most CMs are S1, [7] demonstrated that many have a petrofabric (defined by the  preferred  orientation  of  objects  including  chondrules, chondrule fragments and phyllosilicate aggregates),  and attributed it to compaction during impacts. Here  we  have  sought  to  obtain  a  semi-quantitative measure of shock pressure experienced by our sample set using chondrule aspect ratios together with the petrofabrics defined by common orientation of their long axes.  Experiments on Murchison by [9]  showed that chondrules are progressively flattened with increasing shock pressure,  and  flattening is  in the plane  of  the shock wave. These data therefore provide an empirical calibration  of  flattening  against  shock  pressure.  The same experiments also demonstrated that fractures start to develop at ~20 GPa, and become wider and more abundant as pressures increase.Results: The mean aspect  ratios of chondrules in each of the studied thin sections are as follows: Murchison  (1.67±0.51,  n=20),  Murray  (1.28±0.27,  n=23), LON  94101  (1.29±0.19,  n=21),  QUE  93005 (1.35±0.27,  n=21),  SCO  06043  (1.97±0.46,  n=23). Following [7], the petrofabrics can be depicted in histograms showing the deviation of chondrule long axis from the  median azimuth of  the population.  For  example, SCO 06043 (CM2.0) has a strong petrofabric defined by chondrule pseudomorphs as indicated by a sharp peak near their median azimuth (Fig. 1). The petrofabric of each meteorite is expressed as the percentage of chondrules whose long axes lie within 10º of the median  azimuth.  Values  are  as  follows:  Murchison (50%), Murray (13%), LON 94101 (33%), QUE 93005 (43%), SCO 06043 (57%). Murchison and Murray lack fractures  and  veins,  whereas  LON  94101  contains  a calcite vein [10] and QUE 93005 and SCO 06043 both have dolomite veins [11, 12].1040.pdf

These results indicate that the meteorite has not been appreciably compacted.  It  is also free of fractures and mineral veins, thus further highlighting its low intensity stress history.LON 94101 and QUE 93005 chondrules are flatter, and together define a stronger petrofabric; [7] likewise found a petrofabric  in QUE 93005.  These properties are consistent with compaction, and the presence within both meteorites of carbonate veins indicates that the parent body experienced tensional stresses greater than the yield strength of the rock to open fractures. This stress came prior to completion of parent body aqueous activity so that the fractures were cemented by carbonates. All  of  the  chondrules  in  SCO 06043  have  been aqueously altered, and so the aspect ratios of chondrule pseudormorphs were measured. They have a high mean aspect ratio, and common orientation of the chondrule pseudomorphs  defines  a  strong  petrofabric  (Fig.  1). This meteorite contains dolomite veins that lie sub-parallel to the foliation. Pre-terrestrial dolomite veins have been  described  from another  CM2.0  meteorite,  ALH 84051 [13],  although their orientation relative to any petrofabric in the rock is unknown.Murchison  does  not  fit  the  pattern  of  the  other samples  in  terms  of  the  approximate  correlation between degree of aqueous alteration and strength of petrofabric.  It  is  the  least  altered  meteorite  of  the sample set, lacks mineral veins and pre-terrestrial fractures,  yet  has  a  strong petrofabric  that  is  defined by chondrules with high aspect ratios. Impact fracturing and aqueous alteration: Results of this study are largely consistent with the findings of [7] that the more highly altered CMs have evidence for a greater degree of compaction. It is possible that this correlation is due to the more highly aqueously altered chondrules being less resistant to compaction owing to the  presence  within  them  of  ductile  phyllosilicates. However, the presence of mineral veins in three of the meteorites  that  have  an  impact-related  petrofabric  is consistent with them having been exposed to considerable stress. As the experiments of [9] generated fractures only at pressures of  >~20 GPa, this suggests that LON 94101, QUE 93005 and SCO 06043 are likely to have been exposed to impacts of a corresponding magnitude.With  regards  to  Murchison,  the  high  degree  of chondrule flattening is likely to be the outcome of multiple impact events of a relatively low magnitude (i.e. below  the  threshold  that  generates  fractures)  rather than a single high intensity shock event. The effectiveness of this mechanism was demonstrated by [14], who showed  that  multiple  low intensity  impacts  into  Allende (CV3) will progressively flatten its chondrules. Conclusion:  The CM parent  body/bodies  experienced  tensional  stresses  accompanying  impacts  that were  of  a  sufficient  intensity  to  open  up  fractures. Aqueous solutions subsequently entered  the fractures to  precipitate  carbonates.  These  solutions  may have been sourced by slow movement through the matrix of the enclosing meteorite, or originated from another parent body region that was ‘tapped’ by the propagating fracture network. We suggest that the latter possibility is more likely given the evidence from LON 94101 that the  vein  calcite  is  very  different  in  oxygen  isotope composition from calcite in the surrounding meteorite matrix [15]. This isotopic difference is consistent with crystallization of the vein calcite from solutions or a different temperature and/or oxygen isotope composition. This study supports the findings of [7] that many of  the CMs have undergone compaction by impacts. Murchison records several  low intensity impacts  that progressively flattened its chondrules but did not exceed the yield strength of the meteorite matrix. LON 94101, QUE 93005 and SCO 06043 experienced shock pressures sufficient to open fractures that enabled the ingress of aqueous solutions. We conclude that the CM parent  body/bodies  had  a  low primary  porosity  and permeability, but where exposed to impacts a secondary (fracture) porosity was developed whose high permeability could have supported limited fluid flow.References: [1]  Browning L.B. et al.
