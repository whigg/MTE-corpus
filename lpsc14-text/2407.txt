However, the vertical structure of the crust, which iskey to understanding its thermal [4, 5] and seismic [6] characteristics, and its origin and subsequent modification, is currently poorly known [2, 3]. Here, we analyze GRAIL datausing an admittance approach to determine the vertical densitystructure of the lunar crust.Approach: We used spherical harmonic coefficients of theMoon’s gravity [1], topography [9], and topography-inducedgravity [2] fields up to spherical harmonic degree ` = 550.The gravity data were derived from the GRAIL nominal andextended missions’ tracking data; the topography data werederived from the principal axis referenced Lunar Orbiter LaserAltimeter (LOLA) data [9]. A localized, multitaper sphericalharmonic analysis was performed [7, 8] at each position on agrid of 400 nodes distributed in a quasi-equal area fashion [2],yielding a node spacing of ∼290 km. Optimal windows (tapers) of large spectral bandwith (L = 58) were used to localizethe gravity and topography-induced gravity data in sphericalcap regions 15◦ in radius. The resulting fields were expandedin spherical harmonics, from which the effective density ρeff(which compares the observed gravity to the predicted gravity)as a function of ` was calculated:ρeff(`) =Sgb(`)Sbb(`), (1)where g and b refer to the observed gravity and to the gravitypredicted from topography assuming unit density, respectively,and Sfg is the cross-power spectrum of two functions f and gon the sphere.The resulting localized effective density spectra typicallyshow an increase in density with decreasing ` (e.g., Figure 1),implying that density increases with depth [3, 10]. Thesespectra were fit to two kinds of theoretical spectra assumingeither a linear or an exponential density profile in the crust.The fits were performed for the high-degree part of the data(250 ≤ ` ≤ 550), in order to avoid the effects of flexure and/orcrustal thickness variations at lower degrees. Our methodis therefore mostly sensitive to the shallow density structureof the crust (typically depths z < 10-15 km). The bestfit parameters describing the theoretical spectra were derivedusing a grid search.Linear density model: Figure 2 shows the spatial distributionof the best-fitting linear density gradient a. The mare regionsexhibit high surface densities and a distinct decrease in densitywith depth, as expected if (high density) mare basalts overFigure 1: Example of observed and modeled effective density spectra for two endmember regions on the farside. Corresponding regionsof interest are located (cf. Figs. 2-3) inside (B) and external to (A) theSouth Pole-Aitken (SP-A) basin region. Note the general lower effective density of the non-SP-A spectrum. Data are displayed over thedegree range L < ` < 660 − L, with L = 58 the multitaper window’s spectral bandwidth. The various lines depict the observed effective density spectra (thick black line), with associated ±3 standarderror levels, the best-fit theoretical spectra assuming an exponentiallyvarying density (red), and the local correlation (blue).lie (lower density) anorthositic crust. The linear model canthus discriminate between mare and non-mare regions, andalso provides a potential way of identifying regions of buried(crypto-) mare [11]. However, some mare are not detected,probably because these features are too small, either laterallyor vertically. By constrast, most of the farside is characterizedby an increase in density with depth, with typical gradients of10-30 kg m−3 km−1. The Apollo 12 & 14 landing sites lie ina region that resembles the farside in terms of vertical densitystructure. The Apollo 15 & 17 sites, where the only lunar heatflow measurements were carried out [5], lie in typical marebearing regions with negative values of a. The general densityincrease with depth that characterizes the farside highlandspresumably reflects a decrease in porosity with depth [3, 10].2407.pdf

DENSITY STRUCTURE OF THE LUNAR CRUST: J. Besserer et al.Figure 2: Best-fitting shallow crustal density gradient a inferredfrom a linear model profile [ρ(z) = ρsurf + a z]. Triangles depictthe location of the six Apollo landing sites. The two dash-dotted linesindicate equidistant points at 1000 and 2000 km from the center of theSP-A impact basin. Thin lines outline the maria. The thick line showsthe radial extent (15◦) of the employed localization window. The twohexagons indicate the locations depicted in Fig. 1. The purple dashedlines depict the limit between regions with a > 5 kg m−3 km−1 andwith a < 5 kg m−3 km−1. Data are presented in an equatorial view,centered on the farside – Mollweide equal area projection.Exponential density model: We now focus on regions characterized by a density increase with depth, in particular thefarside and the SP-A basin region. In the following, regionswith gradients less than +5 kg m−3 km−1 (our finite gridsearch step) were excluded (purple dashed line in Figure 2).We assume a more realistic density distribution consisting ofan exponential profile given by ρ(z) = ρsurf +∆ρ (1−e−z/d),where d is an e-folding depth and ∆ρ is the total density contrast across the crust. We assume that ρ0 = ρsurf + ∆ρ is thatof the intact surface rock (i.e. grain) density. For each location,the local, window-averaged value of ρ0 was calculated from agrain density model [12], although our results did not change ifa single, constant value for ρ0 was used. For the farside highlands as a whole, the best-fit density profile characteristics are:d = 10± 2 km and ρsurf = 2261+34−42 kg m−3, correspondingto a typical surface porosity of 21-24 % (the average grain density being 2917 kg m−3); the equivalent density gradient witha linear model is a ≈30 kg m−3 km−1. Such high inferredsurface porosity values are compatible with Apollo samplesand lunar meteorites [13]. Figure 3 shows the spatial distribution of the e-folding lengthscale d. The most striking result isthat the SP-A impact basin region has a significantly shallowerlow-density (porous) layer than the rest of the farside, withd = 5-10 km, instead of 15-25 km.The SP-A region appears to possess a shallower porouslayer than the rest of the farside. This could be the result of:impact-induced removal (excavation) of pre-existing fracturedmaterial; annealing of pre-existing fractures [2] within SP-A;generation of a thick, pore-free impact melt sheet [15] withinSP-A; intrusive processes; redistribution of thick (porous) SPA ejecta deposits over the rest of the farside; or a combination of these factors. The SP-A impact may have causedwidespread deposition of up to a few kilometers of ejecta [16,17].Figure 3: Spatial distribution of the best-fitting lengthscale d for amodel with an exponential density profile [ρ(z) = ρsurf + ∆ρ (1 −e−z/d)]. General image format is the same as in Fig. 2. The masked(white) areas corresponds to a < 5 kg m−3 km−1 in Fig. 2. Thegray, dashed line corresponds to the best-fit ellipse (outer topography[14]) for SP-A.Conclusion: Mare regions are characterized by a distinct decrease in density with depth, while the farside is characterizedby an increase in density with depth at an average rate of∼30 kg m−3 km−1 and typical surface porosities of 20%.The Apollo 12 & 14 landing site region has a similar densitystructure to the farside, permitting a comparison with seismicvelocity profiles [18, 19]. The SP-A impact basin region appears distinct with a near-surface low-density (porous) layer2-3 times shallower than the rest of the farside. This resultsuggests that redistribution of material during the large SP-Aimpact likely played a major role in sculpting the lunar crust.Mapping the spatial distribution of shallow porosity, as wehave attempted here, will allow comparison with other datasets (e.g., seismic velocities, surface composition).References: [1] Zuber M.T. et al.
