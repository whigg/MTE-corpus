Introduction: The 176Lu-176Hf systematics of ancient rock samples provide powerful constraints on the early silicate differentiation history of parent bodies [e.g., 1]. Defining the 176Hf/177Hf evolution of the bulk silicate part of planetary bodies is crucial to fully exploit this isotope tracer. The 176Lu-176Hf parameters of chondrites (CHUR) [2], are commonly considered adequate proxies when calculating the bulk 176Hf/177Hf evolution of terrestrial planets. This central hypothesis has been challenged, however, and an initial 176Hf/177Hf of the Bulk Silicate Earth (BSE) ca. 4 εunits below CHUR at 4.567 Ga was proposed [3]. It was suggested that significant fractions of 176Lu in chondrites underwent irradiation-induced, accelerated decay that significantly contributed 'excess 176Hf' to chondrites but that such contributions were insignificant for the terrestrial building blocks [3]. The close isotopic similarity in Cr, W, and Ti between the Moon and the Earth [4-7] implies an intimate genetic link between their silicate portions. Thus, lunar Lu-Hf systematics offer a test for the competing initial 176Hf/177Hf BSE values: Any proposed lunar LuHf parameters can be tested by comparing KREEP (i.e., the residual liquid of the lunar magma ocean, LMO) model ages to other age estimates for LMO crystallization and KREEP formation, which consistently exceed 4.3 Ga [e.g., 8-14]. Further, given the enriched character of KREEP, its initial 176Hf/177Hf value is the lower limit for the bulk 176Hf/177Hf of the Moon and the BSE at the time of KREEP formation. Here, we test the competing initial 176Hf/177Hf BSE values using existing Sm-Nd and Lu-Hf data for KREEP-rich lunar samples [15] and data for 3 newly analyzed specimens. We show that the Lu-Hf systematics of KREEP require a 176Hf/177Hf[4.567 Ga] of the terrestrial and lunar building blocks that is higher than that of [3] and conforms with that of CHUR. Samples and analytical methods: Newly analyzed samples include: KREEP-rich soil (14163), and 2 basaltic clasts from KREEP-rich breccias (12010, 14321). To monitor neutron capture (NC) effects, nonradiogenic Hf isotope compositions were analyzed on spike-free powder aliquots. Sample preparation followed [15,16,17]. Isotope analyses were conducted on a Neptune Plus MC-ICPMS at the University of Münster. External reproducibilities (2 SD) were better than 30 ppm for 176Hf/177Hf. Replicate analyses (n≥5) yielded 95% confidence intervals below 5 and 9 ppm for 178Hf/177Hf and 180Hf/177Hf. Analyses of non-radiogenic Sm isotope compositions and Sm-Nd systematics are underway. All 176Hf/177Hf and the 143Nd/144Nd data from [15] are given as ε-values (parts per 104 deviations from CHUR [2]); all 180Hf/177Hf and 178Hf/177Hf values are reported as µ-values (ppm deviations) from terrestrial Hf. Still lacking some Sm isotope data, preliminary NC-corrections assume a neutron energy spectrum halfway between the most extreme lunar values [15,16]. Fig. 1: 176Lu/177Hf vs. 1/Hf and new 176Lu/177Hf estimate for KREEP using data from [13,15,18] and including our new data for 14321 and 14163 (orange). Note that no analogous trend exists for 147Sm/144Nd vs. 1/Nd (not shown). Results:  Samples 14163 and 14321 display 176Lu/177Hf of ca. 0.0187 at Hf contents of 7 and 26 ppm, 12010 of ca. 0.022 at 4 ppm Hf (Fig. 1). Samples 14163 and 12010 show resolved, coupled µ178Hf and µ180Hf variations up to +225 and -380 ppm, typical of NC-induced effects [15,16], whereas sample 14321 lacks resolvable NC-effects. The εHf of 14321 of ca. -5 and the NC-corrected εHf value for 14163 at 3.9 Ga (typical age for KREEP-rich breccias [19]) overlap those reported in [15] including two samples that show no NC-effects (Fig. 2). In contrast, sample 12010 has an εHf value of ca. +26 at 3.9 Ga (not shown). Discussion: The close compositional match of soil sample 14163 and the basalt clast from 14321 to previous data for KREEP-rich samples (Figs. 1, 2) implies that their compositions are also dominated by KREEP. In contrast, our 12010 split likely sampled one of the abundant mare basalt clasts in 12010 [20] and is thus excluded from the following discussion of KREEP. Defining the 176Lu/177Hf of KREEP is crucial for obtaining accurate model ages. Because KREEP-rich  rocks are mixtures of pure KREEP with various lunar rock types, all of which have lower Hf contents and higher 176Lu/177Hf, an estimate for the composition of KREEP is found by projecting the linear regression in Fig. 1 to the inverse of the Hf content of KREEP [21]. Given the high Hf content of KREEP (i.e., the low 1/Hf), this estimate is robust even for a large uncertainty on the true Hf content of KREEP.

Model ages only use whole rock data. A total of 7 KREEP-rich lunar samples, three of which did not require any NC-corrections, overlap at an εHf of ca. -5 at ca. 3.9 Ga (Fig. 2). These data yield a Lu-Hf KREEP model age of 4.37±0.02 Ga (Fig. 2) using chondritic lunar bulk Lu-Hf parameters, which is in excellent agreement with Pb-Pb age constraints from KREEP zircons [10,11], and Sm-Nd KREEP model age estimates from [8,9] and that shown in Fig. 3. In contrast, any 176Lu/177Hf values feasible for KREEP yield unrealistically low Lu-Hf model ages of ca. 4 Ga (Fig. 2) for an initial lunar 176Hf/177Hf value equal to that proposed for the BSE by [3]. The new, non-radiogenic Hf isotope data for 14321 imply that the zircon Lu-Hf data of [11] lack significant NC-effects and substantiate their concordance with the data for KREEP-rich rocks. Thus, the collective data in Fig. 2 alongside those of [22], imply that the Moon cannot have had a strongly subchondritic initial 176Hf/177Hf as proposed by [3] unless the bulk lunar 176Lu/177Hf was markedly superchondritic (ca. 0.05), which has been ruled out [15]. Further support for chondritic 176Hf/177Hf[4.567 Ga] of the Earth- and Moon-building blocks comes from zircon data: In principle, the initial 176Hf/177Hf values of Hadean zircons constrain the maximum initial value for the BSE [e.g., 23], those of the oldest KREEP zircons constrain a maximum initial value for the Moon. If KREEP was ultimately derived from a primary reservoir (formed during LMO differentiation) having bulk lunar or more enriched (i.e., lower) Lu/Hf, the lunar zircons also give a minimum 176Hf/177Hf[4.567 Ga] of the lunar building blocks. These limits bracket the CHUR value at 4.567 Ga, strongly suggesting that the Lu-Hf parameters of the Earth and Moon are chondritic. Fig. 3: εNdi of KREEP-rich whole rocks from [15].

Conclusions: The consistency of the Lu-Hf KREEP model age using chondritic lunar Lu-Hf parameters with other age estimates for the primordial lunar silicate differentiation and the Lu-Hf systematics of lunar and some Hadean terrestrial zircons strongly suggest that the BSE, the bulk Moon, and chondrites evolved according to the same Lu-Hf parameters.
