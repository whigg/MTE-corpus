Yet, most CRISM discoveries were madeaveraging tens of pixels due to the uncertainties in thespectral shapes of single pixels. While great progressin data calibration and reduction have been made inthe current version (TRR3) of CRISM data and eventhe prototype MTRDR [2], challenges still remain especially in regions of lower signal to noise and for observations performed in the last couple of years due to theaging hardware. We focus our attention on these “problematic” scenarios and explore the potential of a novelspectral artifact mitigation technique that is the first stepto exploiting the full CRISM inherent resolution. Thistechnique leverages the latest improvements on atmospheric correction based on radiative transfer [3, 4] as analternative to the currently available “volcano scan” correction. Spectral artifacts in CRISM images are due toresidual atmospheric contributions and detector-basedeffects that are column-dependent and other spatially localized temperature-dependent effects. We are proposing a denoising approach that separately addresses bothsources of spectral distortions.Noise Suppression:1) Atmospheric Correction using DISORT Modeling:CRISM spectra are atmospherically corrected using theDiscrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer (DISORT) [5, 6]code, which is a public domain general purpose Fortranprogram for discrete-ordinate-method radiative transferin scattering and emitting layered media. The atmosphere is treated as a plane-parallel medium in whichindividual layers are homogenous but interlayer properties can be varied. The numerical implementation isdiscussed in [5] and “front-end” routines optimized forstudy of the Martian atmosphere in [7]. DISORT isused to calculate I/F for atmospheric conditions relevant to each CRISM image for a series of surface albedos. These forward models are used to generate lookuptables that are then used to convert CRISM I/F to surface albedo (e.g., [8]). DISORT-based atmospheric retrievals have been used to model CRISM and OMEGAspectra [8, 9] and has recently been optimized for thecolumn-dependent spectral sampling and resolution ofthe CRISM spectrometer [3].2) Column-Average Based Noise Suppression : We assume that the lambert albedo (or apparent reflectance)Y (i, j, k) obtained by the DISORT stage can be modeled at each CRISM pixel i, j and each spectral channel(band) k can be modeled as a combination of the signal corresponding to the surface contribution S(i, j, k),some detector (column) dependent artifact nd(i, j, k)and other (random) noise processes n(i, j, k), namelyY (i, j, k) = S(i, j, k) + nd(i, j, k) + n(i, j, k). Bothresidual atmospheric distortions [3] and some detectorartifacts [10, 11] have a column dependency. We approximate the column-dependent distortions as a scaledversion of some fixed detector-specific ”noise” profilend(i, j, k) = α(i, j)µ˜y(k), where α(i, j) is a scalingfactor proportional to the integrated albedo of the signal Y at pixel (i, j). The noise profile µ˜y(k) can beextracted from the average signal over the lines at eachsample (column) by considering the residual of a splinefitting to the average spectrum of a given column. Thisis because such a spectrum is expected to be a combination of the average mineral (surface) contribution in thecolumn, which is a smoother function and the detectorspecific noise profile (assuming that the other (random)noise processes have 0 mean). We can simply removethe column-dependent distortion α(i, j)µ˜y(k) from thereflectance values Y (i, j, k) by subtraction.3) Neighborhood based despiking: the remaining noiseterm n(i, j, k) exhibit high frequency variations in thespectral domain and it is spatially localized. Our approach consists of identifying spectra with unnaturallylarge intensity differentials iD(k) = y(k)−y(k−1)+y(k)−y(k+1), where y(k) is the value of the signal atchannel k after the column-dependent noise correction.A spectral region of y is “spiky” if it exhibits intensitydifferential greater than 115% of the average intensitydifferential. The spiky region is corrected by estimatingthe shape of the signal y in that region from the spectralshapes of the non-spiky neighboring pixels in the sameregion.Experiments and Results: We consider CRISMcubes acquired by the IR (L) detector and concentrateon the spectral range between 1.1127 to 2.6285µm. Ourpreliminary observations of the results of the algorithmon images selected from Gale crater and Acidalia Planitia are encouraging. The images were chosen due tothe elevated spectral noise. Here we show an exampleof typical results. The algorithm is applied to the image FRT00017F45 (henceforth 17F45) (version TRR3of CRISM). Fig. (1) show a comparison of single pixelsof the image where the available corrections are made(in red) in comparison to pixel obtained after the noisesuppression pipeline described above was used. Theprocessing lead to significant improvements in the spectral shape. In particular the column average based cor2900.pdf

Especially in the wavelength range between 1.8 2.0 µm the artifacts of atmospheric corrections are removed making the hydration bands more clearly visible 1a, 1c and 1d). The area is being currently studiedin a paper submitted to this conference [?]. The proposed approach seems to identify previously undiscovered phases together with confirmed mineral species.References: [1] S. Murchie, et al. (2007) J GeophysRes-Planets 112(E5) ISSN 2156-2202.
