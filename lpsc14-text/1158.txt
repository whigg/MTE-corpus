Introduction: The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Curiosity drilled at two locations (John Klein, JK, and Cumberland, CB) within the Sheepbed mudstone member of Yellowknife Bay, Gale Crater. Both the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument suite and the Chemistry & Mineralogy X-Ray Diffraction/X-ray Fluorescence (CheMin) instrument analyzed several portions of the JK and CB drill samples.  SAM detected hydrogen gas (H2) during solid sample evolved gas analyses (EGA) of the samples.   Methods: For SAM EGA quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) analyses, the delivered sample fines were initially heated from ambient conditions in SAM (~30 °C) to ~835 °C at 35 °C/min [3].  For some SAM analyses, the sample heating approach involved a low temperature hold (termed a "boil-off") followed by heating at a steady rate to ~835 °C in order to mitigate the contributions of MTBSTFA (a derivatizing agent) to the SAM instrument background [1-3].  Evolved gases were carried through manifold lines to the QMS by a He carrier gas.  The pressure of He in the oven was ~30 mb and the flow rate was ~0.8 mL/min [3].  The SAM-like EGA-MS laboratory analog systems-including the high fidelity SAM testbed-were used to analyze several milligrams of <150 µm phyllosilicate reference material under SAM-like conditions (flight SAM-like carrier gas, gas flow and pressure conditions, temperature range, and heating ramp rate). Smectite: Smectite has been detected at abundances of ~20 wt% by CheMin analyses in the <150 µm fraction of Sheepbed Mudstone [46]. This detection is confirmed by SAM EGA data [8]. Laboratory and testbed EGA experiments confirm that evolution temperatures for water and hydrogen measured by SAM are consistent with thermal decomposition of smectite (Fig. 4). There are many distinct sites where smectite can store water or hydrogen (Fig. 1). Phyllosilicate minerals incorporate hydroxyl groups into their octahedral layer within the chemical structure (Fig. 1). Smectite also stores water in an expandable interlayer layer between the 2:1 sheets either in association with solvation cations or as free H2O molecules [e.g., 7].  In addition, atmospheric water is likely adsorbed to mineral surfaces [8].  Adsorbed and interlayer H2O evolves at low temperatures (<250 °C), whereas structural OH groups remain bound until higher temperatures, generally >400 °C [7,9].  SAM observations of evolved hydrogen: Three blank cups and ten JK/CB subsample portions were analyzed by the SAM EGA. A high temperature H2 peak (>750 °C) was detected in all of the blanks.  Hydrogen deuteride (HD, m/z 3) was observed in the blanks above 750 °C, but it was barely above the detection limit. Each JK and CB sample evolved two to four distinct high temperature H2 peaks (Fig. 2).   Some of the runs with a 475 °C boiloff evolved a small H2 peak below 200 °C (Peak 0). All JK and CB samples evolved an H2 peak starting at 400 °C (Peak 1), followed by a larger peak (Peak 2) that starts at 600 °C. Another large peak (Peak 3) often evolves between 750-850 °C, though the peak maximum varies in temperature, sometimes overlapping with the Peak 2 evolution completely.  Peak 2 usually trends with both H2O and HD, indicating a common source for these volatiles (Fig. 3). Most H2 evolved above 400 °C is likely derived from structural dehydroxylation of clay minerals [9].

The HD (m/z 3) evolution trends closely with H2, except at very high temperatures (>~750 °C, Peak 3) where H2 has a peak and HD does not (Fig. 3).  This behavior is also seen in the blanks (H2 peak >750 °C with very little accompanying HD), so Peak 3 could be interpreted as an instrument background effect. After subtracting the possible instrument background, including the Peak 3 contribution, the JK single-portion samples (JK1-2, and JK4) evolved an average of 3.5 ± 0.6 nmol of H2 above 400 °C, and CB single-portion samples (CB1-3, and CB5) evolved 3.5 ± 2.0 nmol of H2 above 400 °C. Variability in hydrogen data: Although the samples are theoretically homogenized by the MSL sample processing system, the observed variability of H2 evolution temperature, abundance, and peak shape suggests the sample is not completely homogeneous.  It is also surprising to see differences between two nearby (~3 m apart) drill sites from within the same rock unit, however the presence of veins in the drill hole wall suggests that the JK site has likely undergone more post-formation alteration than CB [e.g., 4].  High-fidelity rover testbed work has constrained the sample portion size delivered to SAM to 45 ± 18 mg [9], so portion size may provide a significant source of variability between subsamples.  However, the H2 abundance does not trend with abundance changes of other major volatiles [9]. Therefore, variations in subsample size cannot explain the differences entirely so the possibilities of nonhomogeneous mixing, variable background levels of H2, or complex chemistry within the SAM oven during pyrolysis must be considered.   There is evidence for reactions between H2 and the other evolved volatiles, such as O2 and SO2, in the SAM oven.  For example, it is likely that some of the H2S evolved from JK and CB samples results from the reaction of SO2 and H2 [9-10]. Hydrogen evolution from smectite during laboratory SAM-like EGA: SAM-like EGA setups, including the high-fidelity SAM testbed, are being used to analyze Mars analog minerals. On these systems, the smectite minerals also evolve H2 at high temperatures (Fig. 4), generally coincident with the evolution of H2O from dehydroxylation.  The Fe-saponite griffithite appears the most consistent with JK and CB data in terms of evolution temperature and peak shape of H2O [11] and H2 (Fig. 4).   Conclusion and Implications:  Though the H2 EGA data from SAM exhibits variability likely due to factors such as sample heterogeneity, variable background contributions (which are still being studied), and complex reactions between compounds in the SAM oven during heating, it seems very likely that a portion is related to H2O from dehydroxylation of the ~20 wt% smectite clays present in the subsamples.  The SAM TLS and QMS independently measure δD in H2O, and QMS data can also determine δD in H2 [12]. The δD in the >400° C H2 and H2O show important differences from the δD in the lower temperature evolved H2O. These differences may record information about past and present environments on Mars [12-14].   Acknowledgments: A.E.B. acknowledges CRESST for funding, A.C. McAdam and J.

The H2 peak above 750 °C (shaded) does not correlate to an H2O release and has a much lower δD than the smectite dehydroxylation peaks, so this H2 may come from another source. Figure 4.
