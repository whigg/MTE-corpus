Introduction: Ever since lunar samples were returned they have been known to have formed under reducing conditions, and the oxygen fugacity (fO2) under which they formed has been a subject of interest. There are many studies in the literature, with a general consensus of one log unit below the iron-wüstite buffer, or IW-1, as the best estimate of the fO2 of the lunar mantle [1]. The fO2 of the Ti2O3/TiO2 buffer lies several orders of magnitude below IW and most lunar pyroxene and olivine have high FeO contents, so lunar silicates have long been expected to have negligible Ti3+/Ti4+ ratios. With the recent detection of Ti3+ in FeO-bearing chondrules [2], however, the assumption that FeO and Ti2O3 cannot coexist is not safe. Despite decades of effort, some uncertainty remains regarding the fO2 of the lunar mantle and the presence of Ti3+ in lunar samples. For example, results for the fO2 of the Apollo 17 orange glass source region span most of the range of suggested lunar values, from IW-0.6 [3] to IW-2 [4]. Even for the higher value, experimental results suggest that ~10% of the Ti would be trivalent [5], and inferences of small Ti3+ components in lunar pyroxenes have been made on the basis of crystal chemistry [6,7]. From the work of [5], it appears likely that the lunar mantle contained significant amounts of Ti3+, and although measurement of the valence of Ti in lunar rocks could decrease the uncertainty about the fO2 of their formation, such measurements have not been performed. The conclusion that the redox state of mare basalts was not significantly modified since they were generated [4] makes the valence of Ti in them a potentially valuable recorder of both the redox state of the lunar mantle and its spatial variability. We have used XANES (X-ray absorption near-edge structure) spectroscopy to measure the valence of Ti in a small but diverse suite of lunar igneous rocks.  Samples and Methods: The sample suite consists of two basalts and two plutonic rocks, selected to represent a range of sources, compositions and crystallization conditions. Samples are: 10020 (A-11 Ti-rich, low-K basalt); 15555 (A-15 low-Ti basalt); 15415 (A15 anorthosite); and 76535 (A-17 troctolite). Areas of the polished thin sections to be analyzed were documented by SEM and analyzed by electron probe. Titanium K XANES spectra were collected using the GSECARS X-ray microprobe in fluorescence mode, with a 1 µm X-ray beam. Valences were determined following the results of [8]. That study demonstrated that Ti K-edge XANES spectra of pure Ti4+-bearing minerals fall into two, distinct valence-coordination clusters on a plot of pre-edge peak intensity vs. energy.  Those with all Ti in tetrahedral coordination have high intensities and low energies, whereas those with all Ti in octahedral coordination have low intensities and high energies. Any Ti3+ present in olivine and pyroxene is expected to be in octahedral coordination, yielding a third data cluster, pre-edge peaks with relatively low intensity and low energy [9]. Titanium valences in unknowns were determined by applying the lever rule to mixing lines for XANES results for standards representing these three endmember occurrences. Valences are reported as values between 3 and 4, representing averages for the analytical volumes, with uncertainties based on X-ray counting statistics. Sample petrography and mineral chemistry:  10020. This basalt has ~50 vol% clinopyroxene with 1-3 wt% each of TiO2 and Al2O3, 31% plagioclase laths (An82), 12% acicular ilmenite, and ~5% olivine phenocrysts (Fo70) [10]. 15555. This basalt is vuggy and has less ilmenite, more olivine and coarser pyroxene than 10020, with 0.5-1 wt% TiO2 and 1-2 wt% Al2O3 in the cpx [11]. Reported modes for this apparently heterogenous sample are: cpx 40-65%; plag 25-35%; olivine 5-20%; opaques 2.7-5%; and mesostasis 0.2-5% [12]. 15415. A pristine, unbrecciated anorthosite with ~98% coarse (~2-3 cm) plag (An96) and ~2% fine (~100 µm) augite (En39Wo45Fs16) and trace amounts of hypersthene (En57Wo3Fs40) and ilmenite [12]. 76535. A troctolite composed of ~60 vol% plagioclase (An96), ~35% olivine (Fo87) and ~5% orthopyroxene (En84Wo1Fs11) with trace augite, metal and phosphate [10]. Both the opx and cpx have ~0.5 wt% TiO2 and ~1 wt% Al2O3 [13]. Results:  The valence of Ti in the pyroxene and olivine of each of these samples is given in Table 1. Values identified as "merge" are valences calculated from summation of spectra in an attempt to correct for orientation effects, whereas "mean" values are averages of results for individual spectra. In both basalts, all analyses are within 2σ of 4.0, except for the analysis of pigeonite in 15555. Both analyses of troctolite 76535 are within 1σ of 4.0. Some variability is seen in the analyses of 15415, which range from 3.6±0.1 to 4.3±0.1. When all eight spectra are merged, however, the result is 4.0±0.1. In addition, significant proportions of tetrahedrally coordinated (tet) Ti are observed, with higher values in  the highland samples than in the basalts. The pyroxene in the basalts tends to have 30-40% of its Ti in tetrahedral coordination, whereas that in 15415 averages 49% and the 76535 pyx analysis has 87% (Table 1). Table 1.

Most of the measurements of the valence of Ti in the basalts are within error of 4, favoring the previous estimates of the fO2 of the lunar mantle of ~IW-1 [1] rather than ~IW-2. Based on experiments by [5] higher proportions of Ti3+ would be expected if the fO2 of crystallization were closer to IW-2. The presence of Ti3+ in lunar pyroxenes has, in the past, been inferred on the basis of the assumptions that all Ti4+ subsitutes for divalent cations in octahedral sites, charge compensation is accomplished through a coupled substitution of two Al for two Si cations in tetrahedral sites, and that Ti/Al ratios in excess of 0.5 indicate the presence of a Ti3+ component [6,7]. The present results show that this conclusion is based on an oversimplified assumption and is not justified. Large proportions of Ti enter the tetrahedral site; these cations do not require a coupled substitution with Al for charge balance, and they can account for Ti cation abundances that are in excess of half the Al. For example, the EMP analyes of 10020 pyx average 0.113 Ti and 0.203 Al cations per six oxygens. This gives 0.011 Ti cations in excess of half the Al, and the analyses average 0.032 tetrahedral Ti cations. For this sample, Ti3+ was not detected by XANES, and its presence need not be inferred to account for the Al/Ti ratios, though a small component cannot be ruled out. The Ti4+ cation has a larger ionic radius than the Si4+ cation, and it has been shown experimentally [14] that the substitution of Ti4+ for Si4+ is favored by high temperatures and low pressures. It is also geochemically favored in environments with limited availability of Al for coupled substitutions. The availability of Al appears to be the dominant factor, as illustrated by comparison with Al-,Ti-rich pyroxene that is known as "fassaite" [15], found in meteoritic refractory inclusions. Although fassaite formed at high temperatures (1230°C [16]) and low pressures (~10-3 bar), conditions that favor tet Ti substitution, all of its Ti is in octahedral coordination [15,17]. This is apparently due to the high Al2O3 contents of the gas or liquid from which it formed; fassaite typically contains ~20 wt% Al2O3. Lunar pyroxene has much higher proportions of tet Ti than fassaite and much lower Al and Ti contents. Also, compared to mare pyx, the lunar plutonic pyx has somewhat higher tet Ti proportions despite having formed at higher pressure, and it is Al-poor. The pyx tet sites have lower symmetry than the octahedral sites, making orientation effects important in the XANES analyses.  We can overcome this obstacle by (a) collecting spectra of a grain at different orientations and merging the spectra; and (b) analyzing multiple grains in a sample and merging the spectra, cancelling the effects if the grains are randomly oriented. We applied the latter technique to 15415, and with individual Ti valence measurements ranging from 3.6 to 4.3, the merged spectrum gives a value of 4.0. In future work we will investigate the orientation effects further.  References: [1] Wadhwa M. (2008) RiMG 68, 493-510. [2] Simon S. et al. (2008) LPS XXXIX, abst. #1271. [3] Sato M.
