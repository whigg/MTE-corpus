RADAR DERIVED SHAPE MODEL OF BINARY NEAR-EARTH ASTEROID (285263) 1998 QE2Alessondra Springmann (sondy@naic.edu), P. A. Taylor, E. S. Howell, M. C. Nolan,Arecibo Observatory, National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center, Arecibo, Puerto Rico, USAL. A. M. Benner, M. Brozovic´, J. D. Giorgini, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA, USAJ. L. Margot, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USAWe report progress on a shape model of binary nearEarth asteroid system 1998 QE2 derived from radar datataken during its May 2013 close approach to Earth [1] aswell as subsequent days in June 2013. Roughly 16% ofNEAs are binary systems [2, 3], allowing us to determinethe density of the primary. The secondary moons shapeis resolved in radar data and its rotation appears to betidally locked with the primary.Preliminary results indicate that 1998 QE2 is dark,cratered body approximately 3 km in diameter with aspin period of 4.75 ± 0.01 h (P. Pravec, personal communication). The primary shows minor topography withno obvious boulders, and the equator deviates somewhatfrom circular (Fig. 1). If the primary has a sphericalshape, it has a density of ρ ≈ 0.75 g/cm3; while for a1999 KW4-like shape, ρ ≈ 1.0 g/cm3.Figure 1: Arecibo radar data of 1998 QE2 taken on June7. The secondary appears as a bright streak to the upperleft of the asteroid. The primary is 3 km across and theimage resolution is 7.5 m/pixel along the vertical axis.The image is a sum of three runs taken 10 minutes apart.The rotation of the secondary is consistent with beingtidally locked, and radar data show a non-spherical shapewith a indention near one end (Fig. 2). The size ratio ofthe primary to the secondary is≈ 4:1, with the secondarybeing approximately 750 m in size. The primary andsecondary are in a circular mutual orbit, with a period of1.3045± 0.001 days. The semi-major axis is 6.212± 0.1km, approximately four times the radius of the primary,with an eccentricity e < 0.01. This orbit is typical forbinary NEAs.The mutual orbit plane is consistent with the equator plane of the primary or the mutual orbit normal isroughly parallel to the spin axis of the primary. The primary's rotation appears prograde from fits to a subset ofradar data. The orbit of the secondary is consistent withbeing low inclination and equatorial, but the system's rotational axis is not aligned with its heliocentric orbit normal. It is likely that YORP has not pushed the system tothe typical endpoints of 0 or 180 degrees obliquity.Figure 2: Arecibo radar data of the 1998 QE2 secondaryshowing an indentation on June 7. The dent moves fromclose to horizontal to more canted as it approaches equaldistance, indicating that the dent must be toward the endand not the middle of the wedge-shaped secondary. Thesecondary is 750 m across.We observed 1998 QE2 in the infrared (0.8-4 µm)at the NASA IRTF on five dates between 30 May and10 July 2013. The reflected spectrum is featureless andred-sloped, similar to outer-belt asteroids, perhaps withorganic-rich material on the surface. The thermal emission is very strong at wavelengths beyond 2.3 microns,1313.pdf

The best-fit simple thermalmodel suggests an visible albedo of 0.05 ± 0.03, and aplot of the model on the observed combined spectrum isshown in Fig. 3. This model assumes a spherical shapeand an equatorial view. Although this model fits thesedata well, the same thermal parameters do not matchspectra on the dates in June and July, suggesting thatthe correct viewing geometry needs to be included. Thedark red featureless spectrum does not match any meteorites well. Once the shape model is better determined,the thermal parameters can then be better constrained aswell.We use a non-linear, iterative inversion process formodeling the shape of both the QE2 primary and secondary called shape. Details of the inversion methodare available in Magri et al. [4], based on the method ofHudson [5]. A model derived from radar data will bepresented, to help further constrain system geometry anddynamics.References[1] A. Springmann et al.
