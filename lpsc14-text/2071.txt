Introduction:  Refractory metal alloys are predicted to be the first solids to condense from the cooling Solar Nebula [1, 2]. Assemblages of refractory metals within carbonacous chondrites were first described by [3, 4]. These are composed of the transition elements W, Re, Os, Ir, Mo, Pt, Rh, Ru, Zr and Hf [3]. These opaque assemblages (OAs) or fremdlinge have been affected by oxidation, sulfidisation and re-mobilization into non metallic phases [5, 6]. Sub-μm refractory  metal alloys known as refractory metal nuggets (RMNs) with compositions and crystal structures consistant with a condensation origin have also been described [2, 7]. These are similar in morphology and composition to the  solids predicted by [1, 2] that condense primarily from a cooling gas of solar composition. RMNs therefore can potentially provide insights into processes acting at the advent of Solar System formation. The assumption has been RMNs occur exclusively within Ca-Al rich inclusions (CAIs) [8]: those insights have tended to be associated with CAI formation. Here we present results from in situ analyses of carbonacous chondrites that contradict this assumption. RMNs are found within  all chondritic components. Method: A suite of carbonaceous chondrites (Vigarano, Allende, Adelaide, Kaidun, ALH77307 Renazzo and Acfer 094) were analysed  on the X-Ray Flourescence Microscopy (XFM) beamline at the Australian Synchrotron, using the Maia detector, which allows for rapid data collection and analysis at high resolution across a broad energy range (4-18 keV) [9], utilizing its custom-made 384 Si-diode detectors. This analytical protocol generated element maps covering whole thin sections (or large selected areas) at 2µm resolution and a sensitivity of 50-100ppm for elements such as Os, Ir, and Pt [10], allowing detection of a suite of trace and minor elements. The element maps were created with the GeoPIXE software, which utilizes a dynamic analysis matrix method to deconvolve the elements spectral peaks [11]. The high energy of the XFM beamline is such that diagnostic elemental Xrays are collected from  ≥100µm into the sample.  The samples were subsequently analysed on the Zeiss 1555 VP-FESEM at the Centre for Microscopy, Characterisation and Analysis (CMCA) at the Univeristy of Western Australia. Energy-dispersive Xray spectroscopy (EDS) at 25KeV confirmed the presence of some RMNs that were on the surface of the sample, validating the detection of these elements via two methods. Results:  The Synchrotron data was analysed targeting refractory element hotspots such as Os, Ir, and Pt. This method yielded an average of 20 potential RMNs per sample with a maximum  of 70 in Vigarano and a minimum of two in Adelaide (Table 1). Due to the proximity of the Kα and Lα peaks for Os, Ir and Pt with both one another and more abundant elements (i.e., Zn), as well as the thickness of the sample, it is difficult to differentiate individual peaks from the peak of the most abundant element which overprints and defines the shape of the spectra in that energy range. A detailed analysis of potential peak overlaps was undertaken for every grain in order to avoid misidentification of PGEs, and any false positives removed. For confirmed RMNs, Synchrotron and EDS analyses show that these RMNs occur as alloys of several PGEs. The size of RMNs observed in the Synchrotron data for >95% of cases are pixel size, consistent with grains ≤2µm.   The depth variations between the two techniques (100µm for Synchrotron and 1µm for EDS) generates an issue when locating RMNs in EDS maps. Given their size ((90nm-1.2µm [8], sub- µm to µm-scale (this work)), the likelihood (99%) is that the grain will be buried beneath the sample surface. However, a followup study of each identified hotspot with detailed Backscattered electron (BSE) and EDS mapping revealed a number of cases where grains could be identified and analysed at the surface.

analyses clearly show that RMNs can also be found within other components of carbonaceous chondrites such as chondrules, and matrix (Figure 1).  This observation may have some far reaching implications. The assumption that RMNs are unique to CAIs has limited interpretations about their origin to high temperature regions close to the proto-Sun. The fact that we observe RMNs in other components in carbonaceous chondrites raises questions about how they formed.

The presence of PGEs were confirmed using EDS. RMNs condense at high temperature [1]. Their prescence within relatively unaltered ('cold') matrix material has significant implications for conditions in the early Solar Nebula. There appear to be several possibilities regarding their formation: 1) disk temperatures exceeded ~1800K out to asteroidal distances; 2) localized high-temperature (>~1800K) events occurred at asteroidal distances (in excess of temperatures generally associated with chondrule formation); 3) materials condensing over the complete temperature range were extremely well mixed in the disk. We can test these possibilities using a range of additional techniques. Following a similar approach to [8], we can use the specific mix of elemental abundances within each grain to define where that grain falls on an ideal condensation curve. With data gained from in situ analysis providing a spatial context, we can obtain cooling rates for grains in different chondritic components - allowing us to choose between formation mechanisms for non-CAI RMNs.  By analyzing different components, in different meteorites, this approach offers the interesting possibility of tracking cooling rates at various points in space and time within the early Solar Nebula, generating a detailed thermal history to compare to disk models. Conclusion:  The combination of Synchrotron data with SEM and EDS analysis allows us to rapidly identify PGE hotspots within carbonaceous chondrites, generating a large dataset which retains its spatial context. This opens the way to a wider spectrum of possibilities when interpreting the origin of RMNs. RMNs are not unique to CAIs but can be observed in other components in carbonaceous chondrites that have not seen such extremes of temperature such as matrix and chondrules. This could provide insights into the thermal structure of the early Solar Nebula. Further analysis of these grains in situ utilizing LA-ICP-MS, FIB, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atom probe analysis will help establish their value as tracers of the thermal history of the inner Solar Nebula.
