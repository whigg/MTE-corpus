Introduction:  Astronomical observations indicate that one or more supernovae (SN) ocurred in the vicinity of our solar system in the recent past (~10Myr) [1,2]. One possible indication of the arrival of SN (or perhaps AGB) debris locally was the detection of 60Fe/Fe (T1/2 = 2.62 Myr [3]) excesses in a ferromanganese crust from the Pacific Ocean [4,5]. Another indication came from the Moon. In a previous study [6] we reported a 60Fe/Fe depth profile constructed with 2 samples of the Apollo 12 core 12025, 4 samples of the Apollo 15 core 15008, 2 samples known as ‘skim’, ‘scoop’  and ‘under boulder’ soil collected near the shade of a small boulder in Station 9 during the Apollo 16 mission (shaded samples), and 5 samples of the deep drill core 60007/6, sampled during the same mission. We complete the previous work by reporting new measurements of 53Mn (T1/2 = 3.7 Myr [7]) in the same samples, including deeper samples of the 12025 core, and by using those measurements for a critical assessment of the 60Fe results. We also determined  the activities of 60Fe and 53Mn of 7 samples from 4 iron meteorites; these activities were used to establish reference levels for local production due to galactic cosmic rays. Experimental Methods:  To all samples (60 to 190 mg) we added 10 mg Mn carrier. After digestion in 5 mL 7M HNO3, 5 mL conc. HF, and 1 mL conc. HClO4, an aliquot (5 wt%) of the resulting solution was taken for elemental analysis by ICP-MS. The rest (main sample) was evaporated and re-dissolved in 8M HCl from which iron was extracted with di-isopropyl ether and then back extracted into 1M HCl. The main sample (minus iron) was evaporated once again and dissolved in 9M HCl for separation of Mn by anion exchange. Mn was precipitated from the Mn eluate with KClO3 as MnO2(s). We used ICP-MS to determine the elemental compositions of the sample aliquots, and accelerator mass spectrometry to measure 53Mn/Mn ratios (in the same samples as reported in [6]) at the Beschleunigerlaboratorium der LudwigMaximilians-Universität und Technischen Universität München in Garching, Germany [8]. Results and discussion:  53Mn. Our results are summarized in Fig. 1. All results agree with the previous published results (all measured via neutron activation analysis) [9-12]. Depths are expressed in g/cm2 using the bulk densities for each sample set: 1.92 g/cm3 for 12025, 1.65 g/cm3 for 60007, 1.5 g/cm3 for 15008 and for the shaded samples.   Fig. 1: 53Mn measurements. Black circles correspond to core 12025; red triangles to core 15008; green diamonds to core 60007/6 and grey hexagons to the set of ‘skim’, ‘scoop’ and ‘under boulder’ samples.  60Fe. Preliminary results were shown in [6]; final results are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 2. First measurements by Cook et al. [13] are also included. Iron and nickel contents for this work are summarized as well. For a complete elemental composition, refer to [5].  60Fe is synthesized not only in stars but also in spallation processes in extraterrestrial matter by cosmic rays. For this reason,  the contribution of local, galactic cosmic ray (GCR) production of 60Fe was estimated from measurements in a set of iron meteorites. These meteorites are composed mainly of iron and nickel and serve as reference for the cosmogenic production of 53Mn and 60Fe. The expected contribution of solar cosmic rays (SCR) to production in the lunar samples can be neglected [6, 13]. Fig. 2 shows the 60Fe depth profile constructed with all data made up to this date. The expected contribution of cosmogenic production of 60Fe has been subtracted. From the integrated deposition of about 107 at/cm2 we infer a local interstellar fluence of 60Fe of 4×107 at/cm2. In Fig. 3 we compare the activities of 53Mn and 60Fe in all our lunar samples with our measurements of iron meteorites. Cook et al. [13] had already concluded 1778.pdf

that samples from the 60007/6 core had activities consistent with being of local, cosmogenic origin. We found that samples (1,2,4,5,6,7) have a significant 60Fe activity (1σ to 2σ above the estimated GCR contribution, respectively) [6]. The elevated 60Fe activities of the lunar samples are inconsistent with the production by GCR, SCR or meteoritic contamination. However we cannot exclude cosmogenic production alone for the corresponding 53Mn activities. Supernovae produce appreciable quantities of both 60Fe and 53Mn whereas AGB stars produce 60Fe but little 53Mn. Thus, we infer that interstellar material from either or both sources may be present on the lunar surface. Fig. 2: 60Fe depth profile. The dashed red line is an estimated profile used to integrate the data up to a depth of ∼3 cm in the lunar surface.  Acknowledgement: We thank Dr. S.
