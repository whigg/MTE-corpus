The activation energy defines the diffusive mobility of the H in the crystal, with a high energy value indicative of a location with a trapping, vacancy-type defect [1, 2].  In this work, we explore the distribution of activation energies upon implantation and the associated H-retention times; this for comparison with recent observation of OH on the lunar surface.  We apply a Monte Carlo approach: for simulated solar wind protons, we assume at implantation that they have a distribution of activation energies, U, with a central peak, Uc and width, Uw. We then derive the diffusion time and count the fraction retained for long periods in the near-surface (those 'loitering' in the surface with diffusion times > 105 sec).  We find that that surfaces characterized with a distribution with predominantly large activation energy values (U > 1 eV) will retain implanted Hs for long times. Surfaces with the distribution predominantly at small values (U < 0.2 eV) will quickly diffuse away implanted Hs. However, surfaces with a large portion of activation energies in a mid-range between 0.3 eV < U < 0.9 eV will tend to be H-retentive in cool conditions but transform into H-emissive surfaces when warmed (as when the surface rotates into local noon). These mid-range activation energies give rise to a diurnal effect with a clear minimum in retained Hs at local noon, similar to recent reports [3].  The adjacent figure shows 240000 proton implantations having a distribution of activation energies with a width in the distribution of ~0.3 eV. The associated diffusion times (or retention times) is shown in panel b. Note that most of the H's quickly diffuse out of the surface (to possibly be observed as a neutral H emission [4]). However, some small fraction loiters for long periods of time (> 105 s). These long-lasting H implantations are found at the cool dawn and dusk terminators (panel c) and are likely candidates for OH formation.  References: [1] Starukhina, L.V (2001J. Geophys.
