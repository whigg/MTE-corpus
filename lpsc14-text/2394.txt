Introduction: The lunar "KREEP" component is hypothesized to have been produced by the crystallization of the Lunar Magma Ocean and represents the last ~0.5% of liquid remaining. It is represented in the lunar sample collection as basaltic materials and pluton rocks. KREEPy basaltic rocks fall into 2 categories of petrogenetic models: pristine melts of the lunar interior; and impact melts. Differentiation between these two models has proven to be difficult.  The classic method for differentiating impact generated melts from pristine melts of the lunar interior is by quantifying the abundances of Highly Sidirophile Elements (HSE), as impact melts are enriched in HSE's when compared to other lunar materials [1]. Such analyses require the destruction of a relatively large amount of sample, which is often not possible for valuable KREEP samples. Qualitative petrographic methods have also been used to differentiate the two hypotheses for KREEP basalt formation, such as [2], although this method is not without error [3].  Figure 1: Plagioclase CSD's of all Apollo 14 KREEP basalts compared to mare basalts and known impact melts. 14310, 14276, 14073, and 14064 plot consistently with Impact melts whereas 14160 plots with mare basalts basalts.  Figure 2: Pyroxene quadrilateral made from EPMA data collected on 14155.11, 14160.214, 14130.25 14432.2. 15434.181 is shown for comparison [3]. The pyroxene compositions of 14160.214 and 14155.11 are similar to 15434,181, a known pristine basalt melt, rather than to 14310, a known Impact melt. The current state of research suggests that both petrogenetic models seem to be correct for different groups of samples (Figs. 1 and 2). For example those KREEPy samples collected from Apollo 14 are hypothesized to be impact generated (e.g., [4]), where those found at Apollo 15 and 17 are considered to be pristine melts of the lunar interior (e.g., [5,6]). We test these hypotheses using petrographic and crystal stratigraphic methods. Method: Crystal Size Distributions (CSDs) were created following the method described by Neal et al. [7] and Roberts and Neal [8] by first creating photomosaics of each sample by assembling individual photomicrographs in Adobe Photoshop©, and then tracing the phase of interest (with the outline of the sample, and importing the data from Photoshop into imageJ [9] to give the area of the sample and the best fit ellipse of each crystal of the phase of interest. Dimensions of the best fit ellipses and area of the sample were imported to CSDslice [10] and CSDcorrections [11]. More details can be found in [7,8,11-13]. Electron Probe Microanalysis (EPMA) was carried out at Washington University in St. Louis using a JEOL JXA-8200 electron microprobe to collect major element data to quantify mineral compositions and zonations. Acceleration voltage was set to 15kv, beam current was 25nA and spot size varied between 3µm and 5µm (spot size was reduced do to size constraints). Four phases were studied, Plagioclase, pyroxene ilmenite and K-feldspar, in total 196 points were analyzed using EPMA. Data from the 106 pyroxene analyses can be seen in Figure 2.  Figure 3: Chondrite normalized trace element profiles for Pyroxene analysis can be seen for 14155.11, 14160.214, 14130.25 14432.2 15434.181 equilibrium liquids. Please note 14160.214 9 10 11 and 12 (highlighted) are a core to rim transect. Trace element analyses were conducted at the University of Notre Dame MITERAC lab using a Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (LA-ICP-MS). Ablation was carried out on a UP213 laser system with a spot size of 55 and a fluence of 10 to 11 J/cm2, and a frequency of 5Hz. ICP-MS was carried out on a Thermo Scientific Element 2 using 1 minute for background and 1 minute for sample uptake time, followed by at least a 45 second washout time. Argon was used as the sample gas with a flow of .6 l/min and Helium was used as the carrier gas at 1.0 l/min. a total of 47 sites were ablated (27 Pyroxene and 22 Plagioclase).  Partition coefficients for calculating pyroxene equilibrium liquids were calculated using the method of (sun et al 2013). Calculated equilibrium liquids can be found in figure 3. Plagioclase partition coefficients for calculating plagioclase equilibrium liquids were calculated using the method of [16] and modified by [17]. Calculated plagioclase equilibrium liquids can be found in figure 4.   Figure 5: close up of sites 8 to 13 on 14160.214, slight changes can be seen from core (9) to rim (11) in the OPX, and a notable overgrowth of CPX (12 and 13) can be seen. Results: Plagioclase appears to have come on the liquidus after pyroxene as the equilibrium liquids are KREEP like (fig. 4).  14155,11 and 14160,214 plot consistently with pyroxenes from known pristine basalts (Fig. 2). For 14160,214, the plagioclase CSD (Fig. 1), and trace element analysis/crystal stratigraphy suggest that it is not an impact melt, and moreover requires a magma recharge event to explain the trace element profiles (Figs. 3 and 5 numbers 9, 10 and 11 are a core-to-rim transect and have been highlighted). These revelations about 14160,214 emphasize that a multipronged approach that combines CSD's and crystal stratigraphy (major and trace elements) should all be used when defining the origin and evolution of these small samples.
