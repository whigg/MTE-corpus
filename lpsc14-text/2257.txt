Introduction:  The Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) and Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin) instruments on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) analysed several subsamples of sample fines (<150 µm) from three sites in Yellowknife Bay, an aeolian bedform termed Rocknest (hereafter "RN") and two samples drilled from the Sheepbed mudstone at sites named John Klein ("JK") and Cumberland ("CB"). SAM's evolved gas analysis (EGA) mass spectrometry detected H2O, CO2, O2, H2, SO2, H2S, HCl, NO, OCS, CS2 and other trace gases.  The identity of evolved gases and temperature (T) of evolution can support mineral detection by CheMin and place constraints on trace volatile-bearing phases present below the CheMin detection limit or difficult to characterize with XRD (e.g., X-ray amorphous phases).  Here, we focus on potential constraints on phases that evolved SO2, H2S, OCS, and CS2 during thermal analysis. Methods:  For SAM EGA-MS analyses, delivered sample fines were heated to ~835oC at 35oC/min.  Evolved gases were carried through manifold lines to the SAM QMS by a He carrier gas.  The pressure of He in the oven was ~30 mb and the flow rate was ~0.8 standard cubic centimeters per minute.  The SAM breadboard and other SAM-like EGA-MS laboratory systems were used to characterize analog samples under SAM-like conditions (flight SAM-like carrier gas, gas flow and gas pressure conditions, T range and heating ramp rate).  Results and Discussion: SO2 and H2S were released from the RN (SO2: ~3-23 µmol; H2S: ~41-109 nmol) [1], JK (SO2: ~1.4-2.9 µmol; H2S: ~36-95 nmol) and CB (SO2: ~0.4-1.4 µmol; H2S: ~18-67 nmol) [2] samples during EGA. The JK and CB mudstone samples evolved less SO2 than RN and exhibited a lower SO2/H2S ratio [2]. Overall, the CB and JK, as well as RN, samples exhibited SO2 and H2S evolution over a 500-800 oC range, but JK and CB exhibited an additional SO2 evolution near 300 oC (Fig. 1). CheMin analyses revealed ~1 wt% pyrrhotite (and possibly <1 wt % pyrite in JK), and several wt% Ca-sulfates (bassanite, anhydrite) in CB and JK [3]. In RN, the only Sbearing phase detected by CheMin was anhydrite [4].  Thermal decomposition of the Ca-sulfates are not likely responsible for evolved SO2 because they typically decompose at temperatures above those reached by SAM (>835 oC). The sulfides, however, are a likely source of the JK and CB SO2 (and H2S, see below).   Figure 2.  Representative SAM EGA-MS m/z 34 traces attributable to H2S from RN, JK and CB at high T.  NOTE: The ~ 350 oC peak in the m/z 34 traces is coincident with the large O2 peak evolved from the samples and results from the O2 isotopologue (16O18O), not H2.S.     Figure 1.

The CB and JK samples' SO2 evolution near 300 oC is coincident with a major O2 evolution from the samples attributed to the breakdown of an oxychlorine phase [1,5]. This SO2 likely results from partial oxidation of the sulfide by the O2 during heating, and SAM-like EGA-MS of pyrrhotite/Ca-perchlorate mixtures exhibit both <500 oC SO2 as well as higher T SO2 generally consistent with the 500-800 oC release.  The lower T SO2 was released from the analog mixtures at a higher T (~450 oC) than CB and JK (~300 oC) and this is likely due to a different oxychlorine phase in the martian samples which evolves O2 at a lower T or reactions occurring within the SAM oven with other samples phases (e.g., Fe-oxide phases [6]) which result in a lower T O2 release.   Although all the CB and JK samples evolve SO2 from 500-800 oC, there are generally two wide peaks,  one near 600 oC and one near 700-750 oC. CB and JK H2S traces exhibit these two peaks as well, but the ~600 oC peak is much lower intensity than the ~ 700750 oC peak (Fig. 2). H2S is likely produced from the interaction of evolved H2O, H2 and/or HCl with the reduced sulfur phases in the SAM oven, and/or produced from the reaction of SO2 and H2. The larger 700750 oC H2S peaks are coincident with the high T H2O evolution from the dehydroxylation of CB and JK smectites [2] and the high T H2 evolved from CB and JK [2,7].  Also, ~700 oC evolution of H2S has been observed from SAM-like EGA of sulfide/smectite mixtures coincident with high T dehydroxylation H2O evolution (data not shown).  The reaction of H2 with SO2 is generally favored at high T [e.g., 8], as well.   Very small abundances (nmol to sub-nmol levels) of OCS, and in some cases CS2, are also evolved from CB and JK (and RN) samples at high T, approximately coincident with the ~700-750 oC evolution of H2S.  OCS and CS2 are probably products of reactions involving a carbon source such as CO2, CO or reduced carbon and reduced sulfur at high temperature.  CO2 or CO could originate from decomposition of trace calcite and CO2, CO or reduced C could result from partial decomposition of organic compounds [9] from meteoritic, or possibly from indigenous martian, sources [10]. If all sulfur evolved from CB and JK (in SO2 + H2S) is assumed to originate from pyrrhotite, the amount of pyrrhotite calculated (assuming a 50 mg SAM sample [1]), is ~0.1-0.4 wt%.  This is less than the ~1 wt% estimated from CheMin analyses, which may indicate only partial oxidation/reaction of sulfides to produce the evolved S-compounds.  It also indicates that contributions to the S-volatiles evolved in the SAM T range from other sample sulfur phases are likely very minor.  Several Fe-sulfates evolve SO2 in a 500-800 oC T range (e.g., ferric sulfate (Fig. 3)), but the implied acidic formation conditions are generally inconsistent with the rest of the mudstone mineral assemblage that indicates circumneutral pH formation/post-formation environments.  Some sulfites are consistent with the 500-800 oC SO2 evolution (e.g., Casulfite, Fig. 3) and with near neutral pH conditions. As in RN fines [10], there is evidence that a fraction of JK and CB sulfur is associated with an X-ray amorphous phase that does not decompose in the SAM T range.  If SAM-derived SO3 abundances (JK: ~0.4 wt%; CB: ~0.2 wt% [2]) and CheMin-derived SO3 abundances [3] (JK: ~3.4 wt.%; CB: ~1.8 wt.%) are subtracted from APXS-derived bulk SO3 abundances (JK: ~5.94 wt.%; CB: ~2.57 wt% [11]), ~2.1 wt.% and 0.6 wt.% remain for JK and CB respectively.  This is consistent with the ~30 wt% amorphous material detected in JK and CB by CheMin [3] and with preliminary SAM-like EGA of synthetic SO42-adsorbed allophane and npOx samples by Rampe and Morris [in prep] which has shown that SO2 can evolve over a range of high temperatures >835 oC. It is also supported by the commonly observed adsorption of sulfate onto iron oxides and other soil phases in terrestrial environments [e.g., 12]. The proposed S-rich alteration environment [e.g., 13] and ubiquitous fine-grained Ferich material on Mars may be comparatively more likely to have S-anions adsorbed onto soil materials. Implications:  SAM EGA data from JK and CB are consistent with evolved S-species derived dominantly from sulfides, although mass balance calculations between APXS, CheMin and SAM data suggest that some S is associated with the ~30 wt% X-ray amorphous material detected by CheMin. Although more oxidizing diagenetic fluids were likely responsible for the precipitation of Ca-sulfates in veins in the Sheepbed mudstone, the presence of sulfides (and also magnetite) indicate that the bulk rock remained relatively reduced. Reducing environments are generally favorable for organic preservation, and an organic C source of some of the C in OCS and CS2 released during pyrolysis of JK and CB cannot be ruled out.
