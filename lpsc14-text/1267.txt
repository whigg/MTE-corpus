Tungsten is a moderately siderophile elementthat may provide constraints on the pressure, temperature, composition, and oxygen fugacity conditions, andon the timing of core formation in the Earth. Previousexperimental studies suggest that pressure exerts littleto no influence over W metal-silicate partitioning upto 24 GPa1-8, and indicate that the stronger influencesare temperature, composition, and oxygen fugacity.However, core formation models based in part on W,predict metal-silicate equilibration pressures outsidethe available experimental pressure range, requiringextrapolation of parameterized models 3,5,6,7. Therefore,higher pressure experimental data on W were neededto constrain this important parameter.Experiments:  We measured the partitioning behavior of W in high pressure and temperature experiments using the multi-anvil press (MAP) in the highpressure lab at NASA-JSC, and using laser-heated diamond-anvil cells in the Laboratory for Mineral Physics at the University of Maryland (UMD). Startingmaterials consisted of a mixture of natural peridotiteand metal powders with approximately 2:1 and 5:1wt% silicate to metal ratios for MAP and LHDAC experiments, respectively. The metals consisted of Fe andW in a ratio of approximately 5:1 wt%.The MAP experiments were conducted usingCOMPRES standardized octahedral assemblies withfive experiments in MgO capsules and three in graphite capsules. The experimental run temperatures rangedfrom approximately 2400 to 2700 K, and pressuresranged from 10 to 26 GPa.LHDAC experiments consisted of a mixed silicateand metal foil that was approximately 5-8 micronsthick, sandwiched between two insulating peridotitelayers. Pressure calibration was by ruby fluorescence.Temperatures were determined by fitting measuredthermal emissions to the Planck radiation function.Two experiments were at 3800 K and a third at 4400K. Pressures ranged from 28 to 50 GPa. LHDAC samples were recovered for compositional analysis using aFEI Quanta 3D FEG focused ion beam (FIB) atNASA-JSC, yielding sample sections approximatelyone micron thick (Figure 1).Figure 1. LHDAC sample G36; P = 28 GPa and T = 3800 K;qs-quenched silicate melt, qm-quenched metallic liquid, fpferropericlase.Recovered samples were analyzed using electronmicroprobes at both NASA-JSC (Cameca SX-100) andUMD (JEOL JXA-8900R).Results and Discussion:  Liquid metal/liquid silicate partition coefficients (DW) were calculated foreach experiment using the mass fractions of W in themetal and silicate phases. Experimental oxygen fugacity was determined from the Fe contents of coexistingsilicate and metallic melts, assuming ideal solutions.Using the present data combined with literature data1,2,4,5,6,7,8, the metal-silicate partitioning of W wasparameterized using multiple linear regression to yieldthe  regression equation log DW (± 0.30) = a + b (ΔIW)+ c / T + d P / T + e ΣfiXi + f XC + g XS; the silicatecompositional parameters (fiXi) are the mole fractionsof SiO2, Al2O3, CaO and MgO, and the metal parameters XC and XS are the mole fractions of C and S. Regression coefficients and their 1-sigma uncertaintiesare: a = 1.07 (0.61), b = -1.41 (0.12),c = -2669 (550), d = -83 (11), e [SiO2 = 2.49 (0.80),Al2O3 = 5.99 (1.63), CaO = -10.4 (1.21),MgO = -3.10 (0.79)], f = 1.78 (0.33), and g = -2.75(0.78).Using this regression equation, log DW was calculated along a peridotite liquidus9,10 with fO2 = -2.3ΔIW, silicate compositional terms of XSiO2 = 0.38,XAl2O3 = 0.02, XCaO = 0.03, and XMgO = 0.51, and metalcompositional terms of XC = 0.009 and XS = 0.03.

ing pressure along a peridotite liquidus, i.e. in a deepening magma ocean. Isolating the pressure and temperature dependencies by calculation along isobars andisotherms, log DW varies by approximately 1.4 logunits over 0-60 GPa, and by approximately 1.0 log unitover 2000-4000 K. Within uncertainties, these relationships indicate that the pressure and temperaturedependencies are of roughly equal importance across aP-T range applicable to probable conditions of a deepmagma ocean.Applying this parameterization, and literature parameterizations11 for Ni and Co, to the problem of coreformation in the Earth, a pressure-temperature solutionof 50 GPa and 3600 K was determined along aperidotite liquidus for a single-stage, magma oceancore formation model. A total pressure-temperaturesolution space of 48-54 GPa and 3500-4200 K wasdetermined (Figure 2). A continuous accretion modelbased on exponential planetary mass growth rate, linear mantle and core density growth rates, and homogeneous accretion resulted in a pressure-temperature solution of 59 GPa and 3900 K that represents the finaldepth of the magma ocean along a peridotite liquidus.Figure 2.

Core-mantle partition coefficients based on silicate Earth and core compositional models12,13,14.The timing of core formation in the Earth can beconstrained using the Hf-W geochronometer. Themagnitude of the W isotopic anomaly in this system isdirectly related to the partitioning of W into the core.Using the W parameterization of this study, the Hf/Wratio is predicted to decrease substantially with increasing pressure and depth. A primitive mantle Hf/W = 20is predicted along a peridotite liquidus at approximately 53 GPa and 3800 K (Figure 3).Figure 3. Evolution of Hf/W ratio during core formation,calculated along a peridotite liquidus, assuming 60% volumefraction mantle melting and 3 mol% S in the core.Conclusions: This research has extended the experimental pressure and temperature ranges of W metal-silicate partitioning data and thereby provides betterconstraint on model predictions that previously required extrapolation from lower P-T data. We find thatthe temperature and pressure effects on W metalsilicate partitioning are essentially equal. Single-stageand continuous accretion models based on W, Ni andCo show pressure and temperature ranges indicative ofequilibrium core formation in a deep magma ocean; aHf/W ratio that is consistent with a primitive mantlevalue was predicted at similar pressure-temperatureconditions.References: [1] Walter, M.J. and Thibault, Y.(1995) Science 270, 1186-1189, [2] Hillgren, V.J., etal.
