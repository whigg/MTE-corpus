In 1992 concerning a number of suspected tektites found in the ruins of the Mayan City of Tikal, Guatemala, a number of major expeditions have been made to the San Ignacio area of Belize.  This is the area where petroleum geologist, Jean Cornec has done a great amount of field work. He discovered the strewn field and collected many specimens which are near “in situ.”  The agricultural fields which are the prime hunting areas were rain forest just a few years ago.  The tektites are usually not found in a random pattern, but in clusters.  At times under good conditions, several will be found in a small area in a few minutes.        There are now well documented specimens showing teardrops, disks, dumbbells and elongated spheres.        Each expedition has had the effect of expanding the size of the strewn field which is now documented to cover more than 4000 sq. kilometers.  The size of the strewn field is now estimated to be about a half million sq. kilometers covering much of the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, San Salvador and possibly Costa Rica.  Finding tektites in Costa Rica and San  Salvador would be very difficult due to recent volcanic ash falls.        The exact number of specimens is not known because many have been collected by local farmers. The total number is estimated to be more than 500. An effort will be made to get an even more exact age.  This is necessary because they appear to be coeval with the Australasian tektites at .786 my. Their SiO2 of 62 wt % content is much lower indicating a separate event.  Their H2O content is approximately 70 ppm.        The largest, well documented specimen is owned by J. Cornec which is 43gms.  It is believed that with more field work, specimens weighing over 100 gms will likely be found.  The most intersting tektite found so far is a 3.8 gm Muong Nong-type layered tektite which was very trace element rich and is described in detail in the references.  Acknowledgement is given to Geoffrey Braswell, Anthropologist of UC San Diego who, while doing research on Mayan obsidian artifacts found two tektites.  One was from Topoxte ruins in Guatemala and the other at Dzibilchaltun south of Merida, Mexico.  Brian Burrer for intensive hunting and field work.   [1] Povenmire H.
