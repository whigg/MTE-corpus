 INTERIOR STRESS WITHIN THE NEO BINARY SYSTEM 1999 KW4 Toshi Hirabayashi1, Daniel J. Scheeres2, 1University of Colorado at Boulder, CO 80309-5004, USA, 2University of Colorado at Boulder, CO 80309-0429, USA; masatoshi.hirabayashi@colorado.edu Abstract: Internal stresses in 1999 KW4 Alpha due to the tidal effect of Beta are investigated. Results show that Alpha requires at least 20 Pa of cohesive strength to not fail, that the maximal stress fluctuates by 20% over a relative orbit, and that Alpha's failure mode is consistent with an equatorial ridge. Introduction: Binary asteroid 1999 KW4 consists of an oblate primary Alpha (1.53 km by 1.49 km by 1.35 km in diameter) and a prolate secondary Beta (0.57 km by 0.46 km by 0.35 km) orbiting with a semi-major axis of 2.55 km [1]. Alpha is spinning with a period of 2.765 hr, while Beta's spin is synchronous with its orbital motion with a period of 17.422 hr. Alpha is currently considered to be close to its surface shedding spin period of 2.66 hrs (Hirabayashi et al. submitted to Icarus). At present, one of the equilibrium points is 7 m above the surface [2]. On the other hand, the motion of this asteroid system is excited due to its mutual orbit. An understanding of the tidal dissipation within this system is of crucial importance for estimating its age and its eventual evolution [2, 3]. The current study explores the internal stress of Alpha by using finite element analysis (FEA). Specifically, we investigate critical elastic perfectly-plastic states. The term critical states means the stress state given by the critical values of the cohesive strength. Materials are characterized by friction angle, cohesion, and dilation angle. The internal stress change of Alpha with the different orientation of Beta is also discussed. Physical properties of 1999 KW4: The radar models of Alpha and Beta are used (http://echo.jpl.nasa.gov/links.html) and all system parameters from Ostro et al. [1] are taken at their nominal values. The spin periods of Alpha and Beta are fixed as 2.763 hrs and 17.422 hrs, respectively. The mass of Alpha is 2.353× 1012 kg, while that of Beta is 0.135× 1012 kg. Given the shape models, the densities are also given as 1.97 g/cm3 and 2.81 g/cm3. Also, the semi-major axis is 2.55 km. On the other hand, it is assumed that the mutual orbit is perfectly circular and the inclination of Beta's orbit is zero (an assumption that will be relaxed in future studies). Structural behavior involves elastic and plastic states. In the elastic regime, Young's modulus is given as 1 × 105 Pa, which allows for deformation on the order of 1 meter, and Poisson's ratio is fixed at 0.25. These values are typical values of soils. In the plastic regime, the yield condition is supposed to follow the DruckerPrager yield criterion. The angle of internal friction is assumed to be 40◦ and the flow rule is characterized by a dilation angle of 10◦ (based on the analysis by Schanz and Vermeer [4]). Loading history modeling for finite element analysis: The present paper utilizes the commercial software ANSYS (academic teaching introductory, 14.0) to perform FEA for this problem. Since our focus is elastic perfectly-plastic theory and a non-associate flow, which can yield a range of different final solutions, it is necessary to discuss the loading path in our simulations. Since Alpha has experienced its deceleration and acceleration due to the YORP effect at the rate on the order of 10−11 rad/s per year and the tidal dissipation raised by Beta [2], loading history may play a role in the evolution of the current stress configuration. The present paper assumes that a single accretion process of Alpha led to the current spin and gravity field at the same time and these have not changed majorly since that time. To model this loading input, all body forces (i.e., gravity and centrifugal acceleration) are equally loaded into the body from the zero scale to the full scale. Internal stresses in Alpha: We calculate the internal plastic state of Alpha. Figures 1 through 3 describes plastic solutions of Alpha with Beta located in the +x direction (for x, see the plots), obtained by FEA. Later, the orientation of Beta is described by the rotation angle, an angle between the position of Beta and the minimal principal axis of Alpha. The cohesion used for the critical value is 20 Pa. The contour color shows the ratio of the current stress state to the yield stress, or the stress ratio. If the stress ratio is 1.0, then the region experiences plastic deformation. Figure 1 gives the surface view, while Fig. 2 shows the equatorial plane (view from the +z direction). Figure 3 shows deformation vectors on the cross section over the intermediate and maximal principal axes. The vectors describes the magnitude [m] and the direction of the total deformation. The change of the internal stress due to the orientation of Beta is also calculated. In this abstract, to preliminarily evaluate the internal stress, we use the average stress over the whole volume, which can be uniquely determinable under the zero-traction condition. The details are found in the earlier studies (e.g., Holsapple [5]). The technique for the total volume stress of a real shape is given by Hirabayashi and Scheeres [6]. Figure 4 shows the stresses along the minimal and intermediate principal axes. Note that the minimal stress is ∼ −90 Pa, where a negative value is compression and a positive value is tension. The dashed line is the minimal principal axis component of the average stress, while the dotted line is the intermediate axis component. The solid   line indicates the maximal stress. This shows that 20% of the stress component changes over every rotation. If the rotation angle is between -315◦ and 45◦ or between 135◦ and 270◦, then the component in the minimal principal axis is maximum; otherwise, the component in the intermediate principal axis is maximum. Discussion: Plastic states appear across the majority of the equatorial plane in the case where the cohesive strength is 20 Pa. For a lower level of cohesion, Alpha would fail plastically and undergo significant additional deformation especially in the center and in the front ridge. Since the magnitude of the stress is the same as that of the cohesive strength, it implies that the cohesive strength may play an important rule in suspending the body in its current state. From the fact that the object has plastic states and deforms outwards in the equatorial region sandwiched between the stable (i.e., elastic) states, the failure mode would rather come from a vertical compression of the equatorial plane so that the ridges are generated by migrating outwards. The plastic region on the equatorial plane results from the fact that the stress components in the minimal and intermediate principal axes are near zero, while the component in the maximal principal axis is highly compressive because of the gravity. This condition generates strong shear across this region. The averaged stress over the whole volume in Fig. 4 shows that the maximal and intermediate stresses change as the rotation angle varies. Since the tidal effect is larger as an element is further from the center of mass, it becomes maximum on the surface. In our presentation, we will also discuss the change of the plastic solutions given by FEM to characterize the tidal effect of Beta on Alpha. Figure 1: Stress ratio of 1999 KW4 Alpha.
