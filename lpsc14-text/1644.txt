INTERIOR STRESS WITHIN THE NEO BINARY SYSTEM 1999 KW4 Toshi Hirabayashi1, Daniel J.Scheeres2, 1University of Colorado at Boulder, CO 80309-5004, USA, 2University of Colorado at Boulder, CO80309-0429, USA; masatoshi.hirabayashi@colorado.eduAbstract: Internal stresses in 1999 KW4 Alpha dueto the tidal effect of Beta are investigated. Results showthat Alpha requires at least 20 Pa of cohesive strength tonot fail, that the maximal stress fluctuates by 20% over arelative orbit, and that Alpha’s failure mode is consistentwith an equatorial ridge.Introduction: Binary asteroid 1999 KW4 consistsof an oblate primary Alpha (1.53 km by 1.49 km by 1.35km in diameter) and a prolate secondary Beta (0.57 kmby 0.46 km by 0.35 km) orbiting with a semi-major axisof 2.55 km [1]. Alpha is spinning with a period of 2.765hr, while Beta’s spin is synchronous with its orbital motion with a period of 17.422 hr. Alpha is currently considered to be close to its surface shedding spin periodof 2.66 hrs (Hirabayashi et al. submitted to Icarus). Atpresent, one of the equilibrium points is 7 m above thesurface [2]. On the other hand, the motion of this asteroid system is excited due to its mutual orbit. An understanding of the tidal dissipation within this system is ofcrucial importance for estimating its age and its eventualevolution [2, 3].The current study explores the internal stress of Alphaby using finite element analysis (FEA). Specifically, weinvestigate critical elastic perfectly-plastic states. Theterm critical states means the stress state given by thecritical values of the cohesive strength. Materials arecharacterized by friction angle, cohesion, and dilationangle. The internal stress change of Alpha with the different orientation of Beta is also discussed.Physical properties of 1999 KW4: Theradar models of Alpha and Beta are used(http://echo.jpl.nasa.gov/links.html) and all systemparameters from Ostro et al. [1] are taken at theirnominal values. The spin periods of Alpha and Betaare fixed as 2.763 hrs and 17.422 hrs, respectively. Themass of Alpha is 2.353× 1012 kg, while that of Beta is0.135× 1012 kg. Given the shape models, the densitiesare also given as 1.97 g/cm3 and 2.81 g/cm3. Also, thesemi-major axis is 2.55 km. On the other hand, it isassumed that the mutual orbit is perfectly circular andthe inclination of Beta’s orbit is zero (an assumptionthat will be relaxed in future studies).Structural behavior involves elastic and plastic states.In the elastic regime, Young’s modulus is given as1 × 105 Pa, which allows for deformation on the orderof 1 meter, and Poisson’s ratio is fixed at 0.25. Thesevalues are typical values of soils. In the plastic regime,the yield condition is supposed to follow the DruckerPrager yield criterion. The angle of internal friction isassumed to be 40◦ and the flow rule is characterized bya dilation angle of 10◦ (based on the analysis by Schanzand Vermeer [4]).Loading history modeling for finite element analysis: The present paper utilizes the commercial software ANSYS (academic teaching introductory, 14.0) toperform FEA for this problem. Since our focus is elasticperfectly-plastic theory and a non-associate flow, whichcan yield a range of different final solutions, it is necessary to discuss the loading path in our simulations.Since Alpha has experienced its deceleration and acceleration due to the YORP effect at the rate on the orderof 10−11 rad/s per year and the tidal dissipation raisedby Beta [2], loading history may play a role in the evolution of the current stress configuration. The presentpaper assumes that a single accretion process of Alphaled to the current spin and gravity field at the same timeand these have not changed majorly since that time. Tomodel this loading input, all body forces (i.e., gravityand centrifugal acceleration) are equally loaded into thebody from the zero scale to the full scale.Internal stresses in Alpha: We calculate the internal plastic state of Alpha. Figures 1 through 3 describesplastic solutions of Alpha with Beta located in the +xdirection (for x, see the plots), obtained by FEA. Later,the orientation of Beta is described by the rotation angle,an angle between the position of Beta and the minimalprincipal axis of Alpha. The cohesion used for the critical value is 20 Pa. The contour color shows the ratioof the current stress state to the yield stress, or the stressratio. If the stress ratio is 1.0, then the region experiences plastic deformation. Figure 1 gives the surfaceview, while Fig. 2 shows the equatorial plane (viewfrom the +z direction). Figure 3 shows deformationvectors on the cross section over the intermediate andmaximal principal axes. The vectors describes the magnitude [m] and the direction of the total deformation.The change of the internal stress due to the orientationof Beta is also calculated. In this abstract, to preliminarily evaluate the internal stress, we use the average stressover the whole volume, which can be uniquely determinable under the zero-traction condition. The detailsare found in the earlier studies (e.g., Holsapple [5]). Thetechnique for the total volume stress of a real shape isgiven by Hirabayashi and Scheeres [6]. Figure 4 showsthe stresses along the minimal and intermediate principal axes. Note that the minimal stress is ∼ −90 Pa,where a negative value is compression and a positivevalue is tension. The dashed line is the minimal principal axis component of the average stress, while the dotted line is the intermediate axis component. The solid1644.pdf

line indicates the maximal stress. This shows that 20%of the stress component changes over every rotation. Ifthe rotation angle is between -315◦ and 45◦ or between135◦ and 270◦, then the component in the minimal principal axis is maximum; otherwise, the component in theintermediate principal axis is maximum.Discussion: Plastic states appear across the majority of the equatorial plane in the case where the cohesive strength is 20 Pa. For a lower level of cohesion,Alpha would fail plastically and undergo significant additional deformation especially in the center and in thefront ridge. Since the magnitude of the stress is the sameas that of the cohesive strength, it implies that the cohesive strength may play an important rule in suspendingthe body in its current state. From the fact that the object has plastic states and deforms outwards in the equatorial region sandwiched between the stable (i.e., elastic) states, the failure mode would rather come from avertical compression of the equatorial plane so that theridges are generated by migrating outwards. The plasticregion on the equatorial plane results from the fact thatthe stress components in the minimal and intermediateprincipal axes are near zero, while the component in themaximal principal axis is highly compressive because ofthe gravity. This condition generates strong shear acrossthis region.The averaged stress over the whole volume in Fig.4 shows that the maximal and intermediate stresseschange as the rotation angle varies. Since the tidal effect is larger as an element is further from the center ofmass, it becomes maximum on the surface. In our presentation, we will also discuss the change of the plasticsolutions given by FEM to characterize the tidal effectof Beta on Alpha.Figure 1: Stress ratio of 1999 KW4 Alpha.
