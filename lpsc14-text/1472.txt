PETROGRAPHIC AND SEM ANALYSES OF PROTEROZOIC IMPACT SPHERULES FROM THE GRÆNSESØ LAYER, GREENLAND. Lai, T.1 and Davatzes, A.K.1, 1Department of Earth and Environmental Science, Temple University 1901 N. 13th St. Philadelphia, PA 19122 (weepingbabylonica@gmail.com).  Introduction: Spherules in the upper part of the Grænsesø Formation from NE Midternæs and Grænseland, South Greenland are likely distal molten droplets formed within an impact plume after a large impact event at c. 2130-1848 Ma [1]. The spherulebearing layer is dolomitic and has a thickness of approximately 1 m at all sites observed, with a concentration of about 18% spherules [1]. Since the time of the impact, diagenesis of the spherules and low-grade metamorphism has changed some original mineralogy, and the spherules are now primarily composed of quartz, chalcedony, sericite and Kfeldspar [1]. Petrographic and SEM analysis reveal the diversity in mineralogy and texture among the spherules. The analyses presented here were performed on samples 71380 and R334. Prior work on sample 71380 is reported in [1].   Methods: To determine the composition of the samples, several petrographic thin section and rounds were generated from the two samples. The samples were then analyzed using a polarized light microscope and a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Bulk chemical composition was determined using the ThermoScientific Niton XL3t-900 X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) instrument.  Results and discussion:  Petrographic thin section analysis revealed a high diversity in the size and texture of spherules within the sample, consistent with an impact origin. The analysis also revealed several dumbbell and teardrop shaped spherules (Figures 1A,B). This could indicate closer proximity to the source of impact. Many spherules displayed bulbous, dark-rimmed structures around their borders (Figure 1A-C). The dark material along the rims of the spherules are concentrations of carbonaceous matter and are heterogeneously distributed, with some spherules lacking a rim, and others having variable thicknesses.  Isotopic analyses (δC13 values consistent with photosynthesis) had previously been used to suggest that the spherules were biologic in origin, however, Chadwick and others argued for an impact origin with hydrocarbon migration [1]. Alternatively, the carbonaceous matter may be fossilized remnants of bacterial activity on the glassy impact spheres, much like those seen in pillow lavas in the Barberton greenstone belt [2] and modern sea-floor glasses [3]. Spinels and spinel-like forms were not observed as yet in the spherules, however further studies in the environmental mode without carbon coating will be used to determine if these forms have been replaced by carbon. The lack of spinel structures does not negate the possibility of previous spinels among the spherule samples.   1472.pdf

Bulk chemical analyses revealed relatively low levels of Cr and Ni (<129ppm and <175ppm, respectively) in both samples, consistent with the lack of preservation of primary spinels.  As a whole, both samples have similar bulk chemistry, though petrographically they are not similar. The only major difference in bulk chemistry is that sample 71380 has higher concentrations of Ba (445-655 ppm compared to 333-396 ppm in R334).  SEM analysis did reveal pyrite and phosphates along spherule margins in both samples. Common phosphate forms included monazite and fluorapatite (Figure 1D,E). Fluorapatite crystals are fibrous and needle-like because of the low concentration of fluorine [4] (Figure 6). The apatite in these samples is chemically consistent with authigenically crystallized apatite, not replacement forms.    Conclusions: Despite the lack of Ir and Cr evidence to support an impact origin, the spherules in the Grænsesø Formation are consistent with an impact origin. The original mineralogical composition of the spherules are uncertain because none of the primary glassy or crystalline phases have survived. However, geochemical analyses have yielded diversity among the spherules, suggesting a wide range of diversity among the original chemical makeup of the spherules. In addition, a mix of teardrop, dumbbell and spherical forms are present in the layer. Aggregate thickness of the bed ranges from 18cm [1] to 25cm [5] to 40cm [6].  All of these are comparable to some of the earlier Precambrian impact layers, and estimates of impactor size range from 3070km in diameter.  The textural and mineralogical diversity, as well as the size distribution is also comparable to the larger Archean impacts, which seem to show a greater degree of diversity compared to the smaller Proterozoic and Phanerozoic impacts [7]. Further work on size, composition and concentration is ongoing.           References:  [1] Chadwick et al. (2001) J. Geological Society 158, 331-340. [2] Banerjee et al. (2006) EPSL 241, 707–722.
