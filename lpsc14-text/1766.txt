Asteroid-Meteorite Connections in the Hungaria Background Population: Correlations with Primitive Achondrites?   M. P. Lucas1 and J. P. Emery1, 1Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, University of Tennessee, 1412 Circle Drive, Knoxville, TN 37996, mlucas9@utk.edu  Introduction:  The Hungaria group (group = asteroids sharing similar orbital space) of ~12,000 small        (D <11 km) asteroids is a poorly understood population both compositionally and dynamically. These objects have relatively high inclinations, and populate a zone roughly defined by; 1.78 < a <2.0 AU, e <0.18, and 16˚< i < 34˚ [1]. This orbital space is occupied by the Hungaria family (family = asteroids with similar orbits, originating from a common parent asteroid via catastrophic collision) of mainly Xe-type objects [1,2,3]. This family comprises a significant fraction of the Hungaria group, but not all of them [4]. Indeed, the Hungaria family is set among a compositionally diverse background (background = group minus family) asteroid population [1, this study]. Recent dynamical work has suggested that the Hungaria asteroids are the survivors of an extended and now largely extinct portion of the asteroid belt (E-belt) that existed between 1.7 and 2.1 AU early in solar system history [5]. Deciphering the mineralogy of the Hungaria asteroids may place constraints on the material from which the terrestrial planets accreted. Among asteroids with semi-major axes interior to the main-belt (e.g., Hungarias, Mars-crossers, and near-Earth asteroids), only the Hungarias are located in relatively stable orbital space [5]. Hungaria asteroids have likely resided in this orbital space since the planets completed their migration to their current orbits. The accretion and igneous differentiation of primitive asteroids appears to be a function of chronology and heliocentric distance [6]. However, partially-melted or differentiated bodies that originated in the terrestrial planet region were either accreted or scattered out of this region early in solar system history [5]. Thus, the Hungaria asteroids may represent the last remaining reservoir of the material that accreted to form the terrestrial planets. We have undertaken a near-infrared (NIR) spectral survey of Hungaria asteroids at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) to characterize their compositional diversity and to forge connections between these objects and analogous meteorite groups. Thus far, we have acquired NIR spectra for a sample of 30 Hungaria asteroids focusing mainly on the background population (Table 1). We hypothesize that primitive achondrites (acapulcoites and lodranites), are petrologically related to asteroids in the Hungaria background population. These meteorites are the residues left from low-degrees of partial melting of chondritic material [7]. We test this hypothesis by performing detailed spectral band parameter analyses on Hungaria asteroids and on six primitive achondrite spectra obtained from the Keck/NASA Reflectance Experiment Laboratory (RELAB) database (Table 2). Observations:  NIR spectral data were acquired for 23 asteroids using the SpeX spectrograph [8] in low-resolution prism mode at the IRTF. These data were supplemented with visible (VIS) data where available. Spectra of seven objects were obtained from the MIT-UH-IRTF survey (Table 1). We distinguish our sample between Hungaria family (two objects) and Hungaria background (28 objects) asteroids using proper orbital elements. Data reduction was performed with IDL-based Spextool provided by the IRTF.  Spectral Band Parameter Measurements:  Asteroid spectra are utilized to determine their surface mineralogy from strong 1 µm and/or 2 µm absorption bands caused by the presence of the Fe2+ cation in the mafic silicate minerals olivine and pyroxene. Band parameter values (Band I and II centers and depths, and Band Area Ratio) were measured utilizing a new IDL-based code [9]. This routine divides the absorption bands by a straight-line continuum by fitting 5th order polynomials to absorption band shoulders and fitting the continuum tangentially to the shoulders. Band centers and depths are measured three times using 3rd through 5th order polynomial fits to the lower 1/2 of each absorption band. Errors are calculated using Monte-Carlo methods. The averages of the three fits are adopted as the final values. To compare band parameter values to meteorite spectra measured at room temperature in the laboratory, temperature corrections (Δ) as described in [10] are applied after calculating the equilibrium temperature of the asteroid based on the method found in [11].   Results:  Preliminary results indicate a compositionally diverse Hungaria background population prevalent in S- and S-subtypes (20 out of 28 objects – Figure 1). Furthermore, spectral band parameter analyses of 17 of these S and S-subtypes show that two main meteorite groups appear to be represented, unmelted ordinary chondrites (mostly L chondrites); and the partially-melted primitive achondrite meteorites acapulcoites/lodranites (Figure 2). Spectral Diversity Among Hungaria Asteroids: We identified the taxonomic class of the 30 Hungaria asteroids using the BusDeMeo asteroid spectrum classification tool (http://smass.mit.edu/busdemeoclass.html). We plotted the spectral classification of our sample asteroids in H vs. a space of the Hungaria region. Figure 1 shows that S- and Q-type asteroids dominate the 1766.pdf

background population. Four objects in or near the family zone (blue cone) are likely Xe-types, consistent with the taxonomic classification of the presumed largest collisional fragment 434 Hungaria. Xe-types are thought to be related to the igneous enstatite achondrite meteorites (aubrites) [2].

Eight asteroids and four meteorites cluster in the spectral region of the primitive achondrite group. These spectral comparisons suggest that at least some background objects have experienced lowdegrees of petrologic evolution. Spectral and geochemical characterization of additional primitive achondrites is crucial to corroborate these connections. Table 2. – Primitive achondrites analyzed in this study.
