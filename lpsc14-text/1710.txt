Introduction: Both OMEGA (Observatoire pour la Minéralogie, l'Eau, la Géologie et l'Activité) and CRISM (Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars) spectrometers onboard respectively Mars Express and MRO (Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter) have revealed detections of alteration minerals witnesses of water- rock interactions [e.g.: 1; 2; 3]. The proportion of carbonates and serpentine seem to be low compare to other alteration phases [4]. During Early Mars, the production of carbonation and serpentinization are suspect to be more ubiquitous than actually reported [5; 6; 7]. We describe here our spectroscopic investigation of alteration minerals on the crustal outcrops of a large region of Mars between Isidis and Hellas impact basins with CRISM data.   Spectroscopic study: We use CRISM data that we pre-process with CAT [8]. The CRISM data are first corrected from the atmosphere effect using a ratio with a CRISM scene of Olympus Mons, scaled to the same column density of CO2. Then, the data are filtered in order to remove the spectral spikes and the spatial stripes. Because the signal to noise ratio in CRISM data is low, we perform a personal noise removal pipeline describe in [9]. We also use a special investigation tools described in [9] to highlight the presence of carbonates, serpentine, chlorites and smectites. This method allows a discrimination of those minerals by the study of the combination of the position of center of absorption near 2.3 and 2.5 µm after continuum removal. For instance, the carbonates are detected by those combinations of absorption in addition to the presence of the drop near 3.8 µm.   Detections on impact craters: We focused our study on the oldest and/or deepest crust exposures. Because of the absence of graben and faults in the region, this study focuses on impact craters as natural drills. We study 40 impact craters from 6 and 80 km diameter. 26 craters reveal alteration phases (Figure 1 A) with the following assemblages: chlorite-carbonates (5), chlorite-serpentine (4), chlorite-serpentine-carbonates (5), and smectite-chloritecarbonates (5) and smectite-chlorite-serpentine with carbonates (6) and without carbonates (1). There is nocorrelation between mineralogical assemblages detected and the size of the crater. Most of the time, we detect the same mineralogical assemblages in the ejectas, the walls and the central peak of the craters suggesting that the alteration mineral we are analyzing may have been exhumed by the impact craters formation. We assess by crater counting techniques [10] the minimum ages of the formation of the impact craters. The craters ages range from 3.8 Gy to 0.5 Gy and there is no evolution of the mineralogical assemblages with the ages. The age of the outcrops as well as the geometry of the detection in the impact craters suggest that the alteration pre-date the impact craters formation and has been exhumed from depth by the crater formation.   Figure 1: A:Global map of detections. Detections appear in yellow, and the CRISM cubes without detection are the white circles. Hesperian terrains are in purple, Noachian terrains are in brown. B: Histogram with the number of CRISM cubes with detection versus the estimated elevation before excavation.      Reconstruction of a cross-section: Using the current position of the outcrops and the crater size, we estimate the pre-impact elevation of the rocks hosting altered minerals like in [11]. By this technique over the 26 studied impact craters, we tentatively reconstruct the about 15 first kilometers of the crust from west to east starting at 60° of longitude to 140° of longitude. We study the regional repartition and the distribution as function of the depth of the different mineralogical assemblages. The carbonates, serpentine and chlorites are widespread distributed while smectites seems to be restricted to the west flank of Tyrrhena Patera [Figure 2 A]. The carbonates, serpentine and chlorites are also widespread with depth while smectite are in the shallower part of the crust [Figure 2 A].  Nevertheless, we have to keep in mind that the largest craters able to deeply drill are less present than the smallest ones. For example, under -6 km, we have only 4 craters to  access this part of the crust while we have 13 craters for the 6 first kilometers [Figure 1 B].This may introduce an observational bias.  Figure 2: Longitude versus estimated altitude before excavation with mineralogical assemblages.   Hydrothermal alteration and Carbonation: The smectites production is more efficient at T<100°C and under a high W:R ratio [12]. Chlorite and serpentine productions are more efficient at greater temperature (~350°C) and low W:R ratio [13]. The presence of smectite restricted at shallower depth is consistent with a high W/R and a low temperature close to the surface. We so suggest a heat source from depth possibly linked to Tyrrhena Patera and a source of water from the surface or the subsurface. The carbonation implies CO2 rich fluids. Such fluids may be linked to a CO2 rich atmosphere or be link to a regional alkali magmatism.         Conclusion: Our results show that serpentinization/chloritization and carbonation of the Noachian crust occur in a very large region of Mars. The widespread detection of carbonates raises the question of the interaction between the Noachian crust and CO2 rich fluids. In addition to evidences of warm water circulation, serpentine formation attests of possible reducing conditions with H2 production. The presence of carbonate attests of CO2-rich fluid circulation either during or after the main hydration stage. If carbonation and serpentinization of the Martian crust are not restricted to our study area, the primitive Martian crust could have hosted environmental conditions favorable for emergence of life.
