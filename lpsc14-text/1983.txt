Introduction: Enstatite meteorites are recognized as being among the most reduced materials in the Solar System, containing essentially FeO-free silicates and silicides, nitrides and sulfides formed at exceptionally low O2.   In spite of the conditions under which they are thought to have formed, oxidized phases are known within enstatite meteorites, including FeObearing silicates in unequilibrated enstatite chondrites [1] and the oxides perovskite and geikielite in the ALH 84008 aubrite [2].    Simon et al. [3] recently examined the valence state of Ti in silicates in enstatite chondrites, determining average Ti valence for E chondrites from 3.12 to 3.72.  These authors suggested that such relatively oxidized Ti is consistent with reduction of previously-oxidized precursors during the formation of E chondrites and relatively sluggish oxidation of Ti relative to Fe.  A possibly unappreciated indicator of multiple oxidation states lies in the inferred valence state of Cr in enstatite meteorites.  Previous work on chondrules and ureilites [4,5] has demonstrated the predominance of Cr2+ over Cr3+ in olivine in these moderately reduced meteorites.  Yet, it has been asserted that Cr in daubréelite (FeCr2S4) and caswellsilverite (NaCrS2) occurs as Cr3+, while Cr in heideite ((Fe2+,Cr2+)1+x(Ti3+,Fe2+)2S4) is argued to be Cr2+ [6,7], despite all forming under moderately- to highlyreducing conditions.  Here we examine the valence state of Cr in olivine and sulfides in the MacAlpine Hills (MAC) 88136 EL3 chondrite.           Materials and Methods: MAC 88136 was examined as a possible source of a Cr2+ silicate standard, owing to the presence of olivine in this unequilibrated enstatite chondrite containing up to 0.7 wt.% Cr2O3 [8]. We measured Cr XANES for forsterite and an opaque phase in thin section using beam line X27-A and bulk meteorite using X23-A2 at NSLS.   We expected that daubréelite would be the dominant carrier of Cr in the bulk sample of MAC 88136.  Results: The Cr K-edge shifts to higher energy as the Cr valence increases from 0 (Cr-foil) to 3+ (uvarovite, Ca3Cr2Si3O12) to 6+ (crocoite, PbCrO4).  The Cr XANES for MAC 88136 forsterite is intermediate between Cr foil and uvarovite, suggesting the dominance of  Cr2+ (Fig. 1).    Linear combination fits of the XANES for forsterite (assuming 100% Cr2+) and uvarovite (100% Cr3+) to the XANES for a redox series of silicate glasses, generally reproduced Cr2+/Cr3+ ratios for those glasses determined by colorimetry.  This supports the conclusion that MAC 88136 forsterite contains all or nearly all of its Cr as the 2+ valence state.       Figure 1.  Cr XANES spectra for the valence standards Cr-foil (Cr0, black), uvarovite (Cr3+, green), and crocoite (Cr6+, red), as well as Cr-forsterite within MAC 88136 (blue).   The Cr K-edges for the sulfide spectra are at energies similar to those for forsterite, indicating that Cr2+ dominates in sulfides (Fig. 2).            1983.pdf

  Figure 2.  Cr XANES spectra for the valence standards uvarovite (Cr3+, green) and crocoite (Cr6+, red), as well as Cr-forsterite within MAC 88136 (blue) and Crsulfide (black).  Note the similar energies for the Cr Kedge for sulfides and olivine.   Discussion:  Our results strongly suggest that all or nearly all Cr in forsterite in the MAC 88136 enstatite chondrite is Cr2+. This result is consistent with the highly-reduced nature of these meteorites, but seems counter to the results for Ti valence state [3].  [8] pointed out a correlation between Fe and Cr in enstatite chondrite olivines, suggesting that both were subject to reduction during metamorphism.   One possible explanation is the Fe and Cr are more readily reduced than Ti.  Likewise, we infer that nearly all Cr in sulfides in this enstatite chondrite occurs as Cr2+.  Although consistent with expectations, this runs counter to the widely-held assertion of Cr3+ in daubréelite.   It appears that a single, highly-reduced oxidation state is recorded in MAC 88136.  Rather than requiring Cr3+ for charge balance within daubréelite (FeCr2S4), we suggest that sulfur-sulfur bonds occur within the daubréelite structure, akin to those found in pyrite (FeS2).         Interestingly, [7] appear to have correctly determined the valence state of Cr in heideite, while at the same time asserting that all of the Ti in that phase is Ti3+.   Given the recent results of [3] suggesting that Ti in enstatite chondrite olivine is a mixture of Ti3+ and Ti4+, determination of the valence state of Ti in heideite could be informative.     Further in situ work on a range of enstatite meteorite Cr- and Ti-bearing sulfides is needed to fully understand the valence state of these important elements and implications for the redox history of these meteorites.
