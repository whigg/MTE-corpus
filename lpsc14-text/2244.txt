Introduction:  The identification of saponite and and amorphous material in the Sheepbed mudstone of Gale Crater by CheMin XRD on Mars Science Laboratory [1] has highlighted the importance of understanding the nature of martian phyllosilicates and amorphous material, as they have the potential to reveal the fluid history of habitable terrains [2,3].  The nakhlite meteorites are the only martian samples on Earth which contain phyllosilicates and poorly crystalline or amorphous material [4-10], which we can study  by new XRD and X-ray Absorption techniques and TEM to provide an accurate Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio, composition and structural comparison to the in situ analyses on Mars.  TEM measurements show a 2:1 T-O-T structure with d001-spacing of 0.96 nm in a saponite phase within Lafayette olivine fractures, similar to griffithite [6], and a 1:1 T-O structure with d001-spacings of 0.7 nm in an Fe-rich serpentine within the Lafayette mesostasis [6,10].  Most of the veining silicate is a weakly crystalline to amorphous gel of similar composition to the fully crystalline saponite [6,10].  The phyllosilicate and amorphous part of the nakhlite fracture-fill veins formed as  a metastable assemblage at ~50 oC from a rapidly cooling, short-lived hydrothermal fluid, derived from the surrounding nakhlite rocks which had been partially dissolved into a CO2-rich brine [7].   Methods and Samples:  We analysed nakhlite samples at Beamline I18 of the Diamond synchrotron, Oxfordshire, UK. We used a spot size of 2.5 x 2.5 µm, with XRF mapping of elements of Z>20, across the  tracks.  Fe-K X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Structure (XANES) was also gathered in order to determine the proportion of Fe3+ in the veins. The XRD measurements reported here were taken at 13 keV, in transmission mode, and the observable d-spacing range on mineral standards was ~9 to ~1.5 Å, corresponding to 2θ = 5.5 to 38.4o.  XRF and Fe K XANES analyses and maps, with a 2.5 µm pixel resolution, were also obtained. EPMA analyses were made with a Cameca SX50 (Open University).  Samples analysed include polished sections of the Lafayette (BM 1958, 775), Nakhla (BM 1911, 369) and NWA817 nakhlites.  Nontronite NG-1 and NAu-2 are powder reference clays [11].    Results:  Chemical Formulae and Ferric Content of Nakhlite Phyllosilicate.  In order to calculate the Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio in the phyllosilicate, we measured the position, in eV, of the Fe-K pre-absorption edge centroids (Fig. 1).  By using a range of mineral standards of known ferric content, we then constructed a calibration plot of centroid position versus Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio (Fig. 2).  The regression line coincides nearly exactly with one determined previously by [12] for silicate glasses.  Using our calibration together with analyses of the major elements, we calculate that the average chemical formula of the saponite minerals within the Lafayette olivine fractures is a stoichiometric, trioctahedral ferric saponite with formula: (Ca0.2K0.1)0.3(Mg2.6Fe2+1.3Fe3+1.7Mn0.1)5.7[(Si6.7AlIV0.9Fe3+0.4)8.0O20](OH)4.nH2O.  The highly ferric silicate gel at the centre of the veins has Fe3+/ΣFe values of up to ~0.9.    The Ferich serpentine mineral within the mesostasis fractures of Lafayette is completely ferric (Ca0.1Mg0.7Fe3+1.0AlVI0.4)∑2.2[Si2O5]OH4.    The Nontronite NG-1 trace on Fig. 3 shows a broadened and asymmetric diffraction peak at 4.57 Å. The shape and breadth is indicative of turbostratic disorder which is present is almost all smectite minerals [13]. The Lafayette saponite traces have peaks at 4.59 Å which are very similar in shape and breadth, and it is assumed that the saponite also exhibits turbostratic disorder.      Figure 1.

Transmission XRD Analyses of Ferric Saponite and Poorly Crystalline or Amorphous Gel.  NWA817 Vein (ol) is a vein of poorly crystalline or amorphous gel within olivine, which was also analysed.  Lafayette Saponite analysed in a vein surrounded by olivine, which was also analysed.  XRD Analyses: Peaks in Lafayette saponite were identified at 6.46, 5.85, 5.70, 4.59, 2.846, 2.778, 2.636, 2.056, 1.886, 1.772, 1.580, 1.550, 1.471 Å that are not associated with the surrounding olivine grain (Fig. 3).  Lafayette serpentine has peaks at 5.86, 3.774, 3.348, 3.183, 2.661, 2.513, 2.384, 2.306, 2.146, 2.056, 1.978, 1.50 Å (Fig. 4) that are not associated with the surrounding feldspathic mesostasis.  The NWA817 gel has one detected peak, at 2.525 Å, that is not clearly associated with the surrounding olivine.   Figure 4.  XRD Analyses of Lafayette Serpentine and Surrounding Mesostasis.    Discussion:  The siderite-rich alteration assemblage in the nakhlites [6,7] is distinct from the carbonate-poor or -free Sheepbed assemblage [1-3].  However, the trioctahedral ferric-rich saponite component may be analagous to the trioctahedral smectite identified in the Yellowknife Bay assemblage by [1].  In addition to the similar composition and structure, both contain turbostatic disorder.  Ferric serpentine present in the nakhlites has not yet been identified at Gale Crater.  The detection of only one d-spacing in the NWA817 vein gel that was not clearly derived from the surrounding olivine grain, is in contrast to the Lafayette saponite but consistent with the poorly crystalline nature of this material.  The amorphous material in Sheepbed has been compared to allophane from alteration of the surface of basalt [1].  The rapidly cooled, metastable fracture fill veins present in the nakhlites are another possible type of source material for amorphous grains analysed in Gale Crater [14,15].
