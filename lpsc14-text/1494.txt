Introduction:  Landforms inferred to have formed as a result of glaciation on Mars are common in the martian mid-latitudes, including concentric crater fill, lobate debris aprons, and lineated valley fill [1-12]. We have completed new mapping of the spatial extent of these landforms in the northern mid-latitudes (3050ËšN), using mosaics of CTX image data supplemented by mosaics of THEMIS-VIS data.  The criteria used here for mapping of glacial landforms (following [4]) are consistent with those utilized in previous studies at comparable resolution [3-7,9,11-12]. From these data, we have derived new constraints on the volume of glaciogenic fill in this region [see 13].  We focus here on the timing and persistence of glaciation. In total, 131 craters were classified as "synglacial", meaning they formed after ice was already present on the surface, but experienced subsequent deposition of ice within their interior (Fig. 1). Because accumulation of a crater population is a slow process, the number of craters in this category provides strong evidence that glacial units were present for an extended period of time across the northern mid-latitudes.  This is a qualitative indicator that the glacial period during the Amazonian was long-lived, supporting other evidence for an extended duration of activity [14, 15].   In addition, some craters, occurring with substantially lower frequency (n = 23), post-date glaciation (Fig. 2).  Qualitatively, this implies that the period allowing accumulation of ice ended relatively recently. Methods: The main challenge for interpreting these results more quantitatively in terms of timing and persistence of glaciation is in estimating the relevant count area. In our definition, this is the region in which a new crater that forms would preserve signatures implying it post-dated with ice deposition. Since the most obvious signatures of this type are typically in the ejecta deposit in the immediate surroundings of craters (Figs. 1, 2), we applied a buffered crater counting approach [e.g. 16].  We compute buffers around the mapped area of the ice-rich units in the northern mid-latitudes assuming a buffer region of one crater diameter (representing the extent of typical ejecta) beyond the crater rim.  For 5-km diameter craters in this study, the equivalent count area is ~2x106 km2. Results:  Based on the number of synglacial craters, we estimate that glaciation has occurred for at least 600 My in the mid-latitudes (Fig 3), and that the era during which widespread ice accumulation occurred in the northern mid-latitudes ended on average at ~100 Ma, on the basis of the density of post-glacial craters.   Discussion: Glaciation need not have occurred continuously across this entire period, and may have varied in intensity spatially and temporally. However,      Figure 1. Two examples of synglacial craters.  These formed after ice was already present in the northern mid-latitudes based on the interactions of crater ejecta with surrounding ice-rich material (here, lobate debris apron surfaces). Later, additional glaciation / deposition of ice occurred, leading to the crater fill presently observed in each crater.  since accumulation of ice and its survival at the surface are presently not favored in these locations, these observations indicated that during the Middle to Late Amazonian, Mars was commonly in a different climate state than it is today [see also 17]. Based on this observation, we hypothesize that Mars today may presently be experiencing somewhat lower obliquity and drier atmospheric conditions than its long-term average state over the past billion years.

These formed after ice was already present; however, unlike the examples in Fig. 1, no substantial later accumulation of ice occurred on these feature interiors, suggesting they post-date the era where accumulation was favored or possible.    Figure 3. Incremental crater size-frequency plots compared with isochrons from [18].  The plotted points are the number of craters in a given size bin per unit area, with the area calculated in a buffer around mapped ice-rich units in the northern midlatitudes. The frequency of post-glacial craters (A) is consistent with the last period of glacial deposition in ending around an average age of ~110 Ma.  The frequency of post-glacial plus synglacial craters (B) gives an estimate of how long the observed glacial deposits must have been present: over at least ~600 My.
