Introduction:  The NWA 8159 Martian meteorite is an augite basalt, with characteristics that set it apart from other meteoritic samples of Mars [1]. It is unclear at the current time whether NWA 8159 is a distinct sample from a new locality on Mars or genetically related to a known Martian meteorite group. Here we  compare petrographic and redox characteristics of NWA 8159 with observations and results of experimental studies of the MIL 03346 nakhlite in order to address this important question.  Petrography: NWA 8159 consists predominantly of augite pyroxene (~50%) and plagioclase (~40%) with minor olivine, orthopyroxene and magnetite [1]. Olivine phenocrysts (Fa61-76) are mantled by intergrowths of orthopyroxene and magnetite, which likely formed as the phenocrysts reacted with a more oxidizing melt [1]. The presence of near-endmember magnetite in NWA 8159, both in olivine reaction mantles and within the groundmass, indicates a high oxygen fugacity (fO2). Although currently poorly constrained, a magnetite-ilmenite pair yields fO2 ~3 log units above the nickel-nickel oxide (NNO) buffer (equivalent to approximately QFM + 4, [1]). Augite compositional trends in NWA 8159 are unique among Martian meteorites, most similar to those of naklhite cumulus and mesostasis augite (Figure 1).           Figure 1. Comparison of NWA 8159 augite compositions with those in the MIL 03346 nakhlite and experimentally derived compositions at NNO - 0.5 (after [2]).  Plagioclase in NWA 8159 is An54-65 and is only partially converted to maskelynite [1]. Although refractive indices of NWA 8159 plagioclase have not been determined, these observations constrain the peak shock pressure to be ≤ ~26 GPa, after the work of [3]. The presence of shock veins [1] is consistent with this estimate. Characteristics of the MIL 03346 mesostasis: MIL 03346 has the highest abundance of intercumulus mesostasis among the nakhlites [4]. It is characterized by olivine, augite and titanomagnetite possessing dendritic or hopper crystal shapes, and anhedral silica grains embedded in silicate glass [5-7]. The high abundance of mesostasis and the high proportion of mesostasis glass suggests that MIL 03346 cooled rapidly; the lack of plagioclase, unique among nakhlites to MIL 03346 and NWA 998, may also be attributable to rapid cooling that precluded plagioclase nucleation [4], at least in part [2]. Experimental studies constrain the cooling rate of MIL 03346 mesostasis to between 3 and 20 °C/hr [2, 8].   The oxygen fugacity of MIL 03346 is among the highest reported for the martian meteorites [5, 9].  Augite cores contain 10 to 24 % Fe3+/ΣFe on the basis of stoichiometry and Mössbauer analysis of iron speciation, consistent with conditions of crystallization close to NNO + 1 [5]. Blocky, subhedral magnetite [6] is consistent with such a high oxygen fugacity, if the magnetite is considered part of the cumulus assemblage, i.e., in equilibrium with augite cores [2]. The mesostasis of MIL 03346 contains fayalitic olivine, titanomagnetite and SiO2 (cristobalite, [7]), and is therefore close to the Quartz-Fayalite-Magnetite (QFM) buffer, although the oxide is titanomagnetite with variable amounts of TiO2 and in some cases exsolved ilmenite lamellae [6]. Application of the CaQUIlF oxybarometer to the MIL 03346 mesostasis yields estimates of fO2 ~ NNO - 1 (~ QFM) [2]. Endmember magnetite has not been observed in the mesostasis of any nakhlite [4]. Using the Ca-QUIlF thermodynamic model [10] we calculate that the crystallization of endmember magnetite in this composition requires fO2 of at least NNO + 1. Comparison of NWA 8159 with MIL 03346 mesostasis and the nakhlites: Although texturally distinct, NWA 8159 shares several characteristics with the mesostasis portion of MIL 03346: the bulk major and minor element composition of NWA 8159 (as inferred from compositions of cross-cutting shock melt veins) is similar to that of the MIL 03346 intercumulus melt composition (Table 1). Notably, an experimental run at NNO - 1 and 3 °C/hr on the MIL 03346 composition by [2] produces a texture and mineralogy very similar to that of NWA 8159, including subequal pro portions of augite and plagioclase (Figure 2). Secondly, NWA 8159 augite compositions are similar to that of MIL 03346 augite, including both cumulus and mesostasis augite, as well as to experimentally-formed augite crystallized from the MIL 03346 intercumulus melt composition (Figure 1).  The composition of olivine in NWA 8159 (Fa61-76) overlaps with that of cumulus olivine in the nakhlites (Fa55-66; [4]). Peak shock pressure recorded by NWA 8159 plagioclase is intermediate between that of the low-shock nakhlites and the high-shock shergottites [3]. Although the inferred fO2 of NWA 8159 is higher than that of the MIL 03326 mesostasis, it is closer to that of the MIL 03346 mesostasis than to most other Martian meteorite lithologies.  Table 1.

Implications for the origin of NWA 8159: The similarity between NWA 8159 bulk major and minor element composition; mineral compositions, especially to experimental crystallization products based on the MIL 03346 intercumulus melt composition; and the similarity in olivine compositions to those found in nakhlites all suggest that NWA 8159 is related to the nakhlite Martian meteorite suite.  The comparison between the MIL 03346 mesostasis composition and the NWA 8159 magma is not perfect, however: MIL 03346 mesostasis is relatively enriched in Ti and K and depleted in Al; experimental plagioclase compositions (An40Ab56Or4) are notably more sodic and potassic than plagioclase in NWA 8159. Furthermore, the fO2 of NWA 8159 is significantly higher. However, NWA 8159 may represent an oxidized, evolved melt related to the nakhlites.  The nakhlites are considered by most workers to be a cogenetic suite, based on similarities in cumulate mineralogy, geochronology, trace element geochemistry, and other factors. It is generally agreed that the suite represents different portions of the same igneous system. In the model of [9], the most cumulate-rich nakhlites (and the chassignites) were emplaced in a shallow magma chamber, whereas the mesostasis-rich members - including MIL 03346 - were erupted onto the surface as lava flows, propelled by volatile exsolution, and carrying augite and olivine phenocrysts from the magma chamber [9]. The rapid cooling rate of MIL 03346 mesostasis and higher fO2 is consistent with this model; Hammer [8] suggests that MIL 03346 was emplaced within an inflated (≥ 0.8 m) pahoehoe lava sheet, and McCubbin et al. [9] suggest degassing of Cl-rich fluids as a mechanism for increasing fO2. Such a model allows for the eruption of other lavas, including phenocryst-poor melts representing expelled interstitial liquid. The absence of such lavas among Martian meteorites was noted by [8];  NWA 8159 may be the first example. Conclusions: We propose that NWA 8159 is a crystallized differentiate of the nakhlite suite, most likely derived by fractionation from the nakhlite parental melt by loss of accumulated augite and olivine. The fractionation of these phases, accompanied by unbuffered fO2 conditions of the remaining melt, caused NWA 8159 to crystallize under highly oxidizing conditions. Olivine crystals within NWA 8159 may represent xenocrysts, derived from the nakhlite magma chamber, that were incorporated into the NWA 8159 melt before eruption at the Martian surface.
