Introduction: The discovery of Comet ISON (C/2012 S1) at a heliocentric distance of ~6AU, and its identification as a dynamically new comet passing within two solar radii of the Sun in November 2013, presented an exceptional opportunity to investigate the heliocentric evolution of a comet's volatile composition and how that composition responds to an intensive heating event. We performed ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy  of C/ISON with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to monitor the evolution of CO production with heliocentric distance, search for compositional changes associated with the intense heating episode near perihelion, and measure the D/H ratio. Hubble Observations:  We observed C/ISON with Hubble at four different epochs: May 2.5 (r=3.8 AU, Δ=4.3 AU), Oct 8.8 (r=1.5 AU, Δ=1.9 AU), Oct 21.9 (r=1.23 AU, Δ=1.53 AU), and Nov 1.5 (r=1.0 AU, Δ=1.2 AU). No molecular or atomic emissions were detected in May, but a stringent upper limit on the CO production rate was obtained. OH emission was detected during all the later observations and showed strong temporal variations on Nov 1. CO was clearly detected on Oct 21.9 and Nov 1.5, from which we derive a CO/H2O ratio of ~1.5%. Both atomic carbon and sulfur emissions were detected on Nov 1. No D emission was detected during the attempts to measure it on Nov 1, as the comet's gas production rates were significantly smaller than some early predictions suggested. Further details will be presented at the meeting.
