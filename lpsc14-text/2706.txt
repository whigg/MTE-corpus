GRAVITATIONAL POTENTIAL OF HAUMEA WITH A ROCKY CORE. Luke Probst1and S. J. Desch1. 1School of Earth and Space Exploration, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287.(steve.desch@asu.edu).Background: The Kuiper Belt Object (KBO)Haumea is a unique object in the solar system.Haumea apparently suffered a large impact billionsof years ago: it is the only KBO associated witha collisional family, family members identified because they share icy surfaces with Haumea [1]. It ispredicted [2] that some collisional family members(termed the “black sheep” of the collisional family)may be fragments of an undifferentiated rock/icecrust on the proto-Haumea. Modeling the structureof the proto-Haumea and testing this hypothesis requires knowledge of the current Haumea’s core size.The mass of Haumea is well constrained at 4.006×1021 kg because of its two satellites (Hi’iaka and Namaka) [3]. While its surface is icy [1], its overallbulk density is closer to that of rock. As determined using its light curve, Haumea also has an extremely fast rotation period of 3.9 hours (rotationrate ω = 4.5 × 10−4 s−1), which has deformed thebody into a shape consistent with a Jacobi ellipsoidwith semi-axes 980 x 759 x 498 km [5,6]. A Jacobiellipsoid with these axis ratios is consistent witha homogeneous body with density ≈ 2585 kg m−3[5]. With this average density, Haumea must havea rocky core under its icy exterior. Haumea therefore is not a homogeneous body.All these factors complicate a determination ofHaumea’s internal structure and the size of its rockycore in particular. Assuming the mass and axislengths above, a body of pure ice with density 1000kg m−3 would have mass 1.552 × 1021 kg, implying a core mass ≈ 2.5 × 1021 kg. But the size ofthis core depends on the material density. Its meanradius could vary from 565 km if its density were≈ 3300 kg m−3, like that of ordinary chondrites [7],up to the full radius of the body, 718 km, if it weremade of hydrated rock. The fast rotation of thebody also means the core could possibly be a triaxial ellipsoid in shape, further complicating matters.Our goal is to constrain the size and density ofHaumea’s core. We seek solutions of its density andindividual axis lengths that yield the right mass ofHaumea (assuming the remainder is ice), and whichare consistent with the core’s rotation rate (= ω).In this abstract we describe preliminary steps toward this goal.Jacobi Ellipsoids: We first assume that the coreis a Jacobi ellipsoid with axis ratios fixed by itsown density and rotation rate. That is, we ignorethe gravitational effects on the core of the overlyingice. In that case [5],2ω23GMc=∫ ∞0u(a2c + u)(b2c + u)duanda2c b2c∫ ∞01(a2c + u)(b2c + u)∆(ac, bc, cc)du= c2c∫ ∞01(c2c + u)∆(ac, bc, cc)du,where ∆(ac, bc, cc) =[(a2c + u)(b2c + u)(c2c + u)]1/2and the subscript refers to the core.We simultaneously solve these formulas with a coremass Mc = (4pi/3)ρcacbccc, where ρc is the assumeddensity of the core material. These provide 3 equations for the 3 unknowns ac, bc, cc if ρc is treatedas a free parameter. For example, if we were tofix ρc = 2.9 g cm−3, we would find ac = 882 km,bc = 696 km and cc = 332 km.Constraining the fourth unknown, ρc, requires inclusion of knowledge about the icy mantle, whichhas known axes a, b and c from observations [5].Similar expressions as the ones above would applyto the outer axes of Haumea except that it is not ahomogeneous body. Because of this complication,no analytical solution probably exists to describethe equilibrium axis ratios as a function of the coremass. Instead we must try various core axis ratios and determine those that are consistent withHaumea’s core mass and which also provide a gravitational field such that Haumea’s outer surface isan equipotential. Only one value of ρc will do so.Methods; At each fixed value of ρc, we fix ac anduse the integral equation above to solve for bc as afunction of ac. The value of cc is then fixed by themass of the core. A solution for ac is found thatsatisfies both integral equations.We then determine the density ρc by treating itas a free parameter and varying it to minimize thefollowing metric:M = 1NN∑inˆg · nˆ,2706.pdf

where the sum is taken over N points on the surfaceof the ellipsoid, nˆ is the unit vector normal to theouter (surface) ellipsoid defined by Haumea’s lightcurve, and nˆg is the normal vector in the directionof the effective gravitational field, the gravitationalfield to which the centrifugal force ω2r has beenadded. If the surface ellipsoid is also an equipotential surface, then M = 1 and the solution isoptimal. We generate points on the surface ellipsoid by generating values of µ and ν in the ranges−c2 < µ < −b2 and −b2 < ν < −a2, thus generating points x2 = a2(a2+µ)(a2+ν)/(a2−b2)/(a2−c2),with similar formulas for y and z. The normal issimply found: nx = 2x/a2, etc. The gravitationalfield is found by direct integration of the gravitational acceleration across grid elements.Results: We expect the metric M = 1 for spherical (non-rotating) bodies regardless of their density.We also expectM = 1 for a homogenous Jacobi ellipsoid with the right axis ratios for a given uniformdensity. We expect M < 1 in general for Haumeafor a rocky core under an icy mantle, except for asingle value of the core density ρc. Complete resultsregarding the internal structure of Haumea will bepresented at the conference.References: [1] M Brown et al. 2006 ApJ 639, 43.[2] JC Cook, SJ Desch & ME Rubin 2011 LPSC42, 2503.
