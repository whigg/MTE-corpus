These alteration assemblages can provide important insight into the nature of lunar magmatic/hydrothermal degassing, as well as the redistribution of fluid-mobile elements during such activity. Models proposed for the origin of volatiles involved in lunar alteration include proximaly degassing magma or derivation from volatile-rich impacting bodies [1, 2]. In either case, relatively little is known about the composition of the fluid phase(s), or the temperatures and pressures at which alteration occurred, however such information is vital for understanding the alteration processes and origin and nature of the volatiles involved. In this abstract we present thermodynamic calculations and isotopic modeling that better constrain the temperature, sulfur fugacity, and composition of the fluid phase that was responsible for the formation of the sulfide replacement textures present in lunar samples 67016, 294, 67016, 297, and 67915, 150. Sulfidation Reaction Textures and Mineral Compositions: The clasts within lunar samples 67016, 294, 67016, 297, and 67915, 150 that contain troilite, represent both Mg-suite and ferroan anorthosite lithologies. The alteration assemblages present in these clasts typically consist of troilite veins that cross cut the existing magmatic phase assemblage, as well as pseudomorphic troilite and low-Ca pyroxene replacing olivine (Figure 1). Troilite also has been observed adjacent to metallic Fe and Fe-Ti oxide grains. Textural relationships suggest that "sulfidation" assemblages pre-date the breccia-forming impact event [3].  Estimates of the modal abundances of troilite (occurring in the pseudomorphic intergrowths) range from 20% to 54% [3]. The modal abundance of olivine in the replacement textures is also highly variable, suggesting that the sulfidation reactions ran to various degrees of completion.  This observation has been interpreted to reflect differing rock/fluid ratios among the three samples. The incomplete sulfidation of the olivine and metallic iron in the alteration assemblages strongly suggests that the magmatic silicate-oxide-    metal phase assemblage was buffered by the composition of the vapor phase.  Thermodynamic Constraints from Sulfidation Reactions: The sulfidation reactions responsible for the formation of the troilite present in the samples can be described by the following equilibria:  1) 2Fe2SiO4 oliv +S2 gas = 2FeS troi + Fe2Si2O6 opx +O2 gas  2) Fe metal +S2 gas = FeS troi  3) Fe2TiO4 ulvo + 0.5S2 gas = FeTiO3 ilm + FeS troi +     0.5O2 gas  Because of presence of complex exsolution features in the spinel, we have chosen to concentrate on the compositionally simpler phases present in reactions 1) and 2).   With these two simultaneous equilibria, it is possible to calculate both the temperature at which the observed alteration assemblage formed as well as the sulfur fugacity of the gas phase provided fO2 is independently known. In order to solve the simultaneous equations for temperature and sulfur fugacity, knowledge of the activities of the fayalite component the olivine, ferrosillite component of the pyroxene, and the equilibrium fO2 are required. Fortunately, many independent estimates of lunar oxidation state are readily available including one for this sample [3]. These estimates range from IW1 to IW-1.5. The activities of Fe2SiO4 oliv and Fe2Si2O6 opx have been calculated from the EPMAdetermined phase compositions application of the appropriate solution models. Univariant curves for Figure 1.

Equilibrium temperatures are highly dependent upon the assumed fO2 value. For example, changing the equilibrium fO2 value from IW-1.2 to IW-1.3 depresses the calculated temperature by nearly 40˚C (from 915˚C to 877˚C). Interestingly, the     relationship between temperature and assumed fO2 also suggests that the observed phase assemblage cannot attain equilibrium at sub-magmatic temperatures under redox conditions more oxidizing than IW-1. The equilibrium temperatures calculated from the sulfide- silicate- and Fe-FeS equilibria are 50˚C to 100˚C greater than the temperatures estimated from two-pyroxene thermometry [3], suggesting that sulfidation reactions occurred prior to pyroxene equilibration, as the system cooled.  The presence of both metallic iron and troilite indicate that the sulfur fugacity of the vapor phase was low. Our calculations indicate that the logfS2 value of the vapor phase was on the order of 10 -7.9 to 10 -8.5 bars.  This quantitative evaluation of the sulfur fugacity in the vapor phase coupled with the independently-derived oxygen fugacity values can be used to place important constraints on the composition of the vapor phase. Assuming that the gas is carbon free and therefore confined the O-H-S system, it is possible to calculate the composition of the gas phase, provided that either fH2 or fH2O are defined a priori. At the lunar fO2 values and temperatures derived from the sulfidation reactions, we have calculated fH2/fH2O and fH2S/fS ratios for the vapor phase. The fH2/fH2O ratios range from 4.2 to 5.2 and the fH2S/fS ratios range from 2 x 10 9 to 3.5 x 10 9. Preliminary calculations performed at lithostatic pressures of 100 MPa and 200 MPa [3] indicate that such a gas phase would be dominated by H2 (>80 mol. %) followed by minor quantities of H2O (< 15 mol.%) and  H2S (< 3 mol. %).  Constraints on the Gas Composition from Sulfur Isotopes:  Results from thermodynamic modeling of the temperature and pressure conditions must be reconciled with those provided by the isotopic composition of the troilite in the sulfidation assemblages. The δ 34 SCDT measured for both the veined- and pseudomorphic-triolite ranges from 1.0‰ to -3.3‰ [3]. These compositions are lower than both the chondritic ratio of bulk moon, as well as the heavy sulfur enriched lunar soils. The simplest explanation for the isotopic signature of the troilite is that the gas phase did not have a chondritic δ 34 S composition and that the sulfur isotopic composition of the troilite simply mirrors that of the vapor from which it grew. This interpretation is in line with our gas speciation calculations because isotope fractionation between H2S and FeS at 900°C is negligible; the gas speciation calculations suggest that H2S is the dominant S species in the gas, whereas S2 is of negligible abundance. However, it is difficult to reconcile these low S isotope compositions with known S isotope compositions of most lunar materials, which range from ~0‰ to ~ +16‰ [3 and references therein]. The simplified modeling presented above has neglected the presence of any carbon-bearing species in the gas such as COS, CS, or CS2. However, isotopic fractionation factors calculated between these gases and troilite [4] indicate a very small potential for significant isotopic fractionation at the calculated equilibration temperatures, with αgas-troilite < 1.0003 (i.e. <~0.3‰ difference between gas and troilite).  Thus, except perhaps for a case of extreme distillation processes enriching the troilite in the light isotope of S, precipitated from a stream of gas in which C-S gases are the dominant S-bearing gas phase, our assessment suggests that the S isotope composition of the fluid phase was isotopically negative. Isotope fractionation during magmatic degassing seems a reasonable explanation for an isotopically light S gas phase [3, 5].
