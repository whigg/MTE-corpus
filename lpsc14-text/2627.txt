Introduction: Nonspherical particles (acicular or clumped) are common in the Martian regolith.  Radiative transfer models used to interpret the physical and compositional state of the regolith frequently assume a simple particle shape to keep complex calculations of light scattering properties numerically tractable.  Here we explore the tradeoff between balancing realism with computational rigor in light scattering calculations for example Mars analog minerals in a series of numerical experiments designed to explore the effects of particle packing and clustering on Mars and answer some basic, but important, questions: 1. What is the effect on integrated optical properties of always assuming that the shape of the fundamental scattering unit is spherical?  Simply requiring that some subvolume of a larger modeled "regolith" have a length scale longer than that of the mean free path is not likely to be adequate.  Assuming random orientation, how do light scattering properties change if a subvolume has corners, like a square or rectangular prism?  The shape of the subvolume will have a practical impact in terms of packing of subvolumes in simulations of the larger regolith environment. 2. Furthermore, what is the effect of changing the shape of the constituent particles within a subvolume of regolith?  Another degree of realism that can be incorporated (that also increases the packing fraction above that for monodisperse spheres) is to model irregular clusters of spheres combined into our subvolume.  We will initially examine the results of using individual sphere clusters (with numbers ranging from 5-15 spheres) as the basic unit.  We will also consider a size distribution of the individual clusters. Methodology:  For the radiative transfer models, we rely on publicly available codes: the multisphere Tmatrix (MSTM) code, versions 2.2 and 3.0 [1] .  Results are also cross-checked with the discrete dipole approximation code DDSCAT version 7.2 [2-5] to verify that constructing cubes with MSTM does not introduce discretization errors.  Below, we use the Casulfate mineral gypsum as our test case, which has well-quantified refractive indices and is one of the most well identified minerals on Mars. EBCM Modeling.  The MSTM code exactly computes the scattering properties of a collection of particles, based on a rigorous solution of the Maxwell equations, and accounts for all near- and far-field effects. This is currently one of the best available numerical codes to compute light scattering by layers of particles that are densely packed on planetary surfaces and has been applied to many planetary problems [6, 7, 8, 9]. We first created a monodispersion, i.e., a distribution of "gypsum" spheres having a single grain size.  This theoretical case is intended to isolate the effects of constituent shapes when we replace spheres with other particle shapes (e.g., cubes, rectangular prisms) en route to realism (Fig. 1). The model inputs are the size parameter of the particles (x=2πr/λ), the complex refractive index of each particle, the total number of particles (N), and the number density of the medium defined through the size parameter X=2πR/λ of the whole volume of radius R filled by the particles. The larger N and the refractive index are, the longer the computation time. Because the imaginary index of refraction k is small, we adopted a single wavelength where spectral features are commonly seen in minerals, λ = 2.5 µm, and an effective grain radius of reff ~ 8 µm.  For gypsum, we assumed n = 1.523169994E+00 and k = 3.023610625E-04 at λ = 2.5 µm, based on new laboratory measurements [10].  The MSTM code calculates the scattering, absorption, and extinction efficiencies and cross sections that make up the single scattering albedo; asymmetry parameters; Stokes scattering matrix elements, e.g., the phase function (Figs. 2-3); and maps of electric field distributions.  In Figs. 2-3, the effect of changing the particle shape from a sphere, which is the default for radiative transfer models, to a cube breaks up the resonance structures in the phase function, particularly for larger X values.  We will explore similar effects on other scattering properties (e.g., single scattering albedo) and further construct "gypsum" rectangular prisms, with length-to-width rations ranging from 1.78-4.11, as estimated from SEM imaging of real gypsum grains.  The full extent of corner effects are not anticipated from the latter calculations, but such prisms approach realistic particle shapes for gypsum.   Significance:  This work will directly improve our understanding of Mars relative to current knowledge in the areas of identifying, mapping the distributions, and quantifying the abundances for minerals by addressing long-standing questions on fundamental physics in the martian surface (e.g., what is the fundamental scattering unit for closely packed dust or regolith grains?).  The ultimate goal is to clearly identify and characterize the compositional and size regimes where near-field or clustering effects will fundamentally change the way 2627.pdf

that Mars spectral and photometric observations are changed.  Such models help quantify how much the single scattering albedo lowers and the phase function changes in real Mars dust minerals.
