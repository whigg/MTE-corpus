EVOLUTION OF THE PROTOLUNAR DISK.  Wm. R. Ward,  Planetary Science Directorate, Southwest Research Institute, 1050 Walnut St., Boulder, CO 80302, ward@boulder.swri.edu  Introduction: The giant impact (GI) hypothesis of lunar formation proposes a ~Mars-sized impactor obliquely collided with the Earth during its final stage of accretion and launched material into orbit around the Earth  from which the Moon subsequently formed [1,2].   Following its emplacement, disk material interior to the Roche distance, rR ~ 3R (where 86.38 10R cm= ×  is the Earth's radius), cannot undergo accretion due to tidal shear.  Instead, material will viscously spread, with some being re-accreted by the Earth while the rest diffuses outward.  Material flowing across the Roche boundary can be incorporated into accreting moonlets, which eventually coalesce into the Moon itself.  The diffusion rate depends on the strength of the disk viscosity, ν ∼ π2G2σ2/Ω3, due to gravitational instability [2-4], where σ is the disk surface density and  its orbit frequency.  Early estimates of the spreading timescale for the disk were very short due to the assumption that disk material nearly fully was condensed. This assumption proved unjustified because the viscous dissipation rate,  = (9/4)σνΩ, would be so fast that a significant portion of disk material would vaporize [5].  If both vapor and condensed silicate are present, a stratified structure could develop wherein a gravitationally unstable, midplane magma layer, σ(r), is surrounded by a stable vapor layer, σV [6]. The relative proportions of the two phases can then adjust so that the combined amount of material diffusing out of the magma layer to be accreted by the Earth or Moon matches the amount of condensing vapor raining down on the magma layer.  The condensation rate is given by the amount of released latent heat, l  ergs/gm, required to make up the deficit between the photospheric radiation, L= 2σSBT4ph from the disk surfaces, with σSB being the Stephan-Boltzman constant and Tph = 2000oK the phase equilibrium temperature and the viscous energy dissipation, i.e., ΩE�111.7 10= ×                .                    (1)  / ( ) /V t Eσ−∂ ∂ = − �L lFreely Expanding Disks: The resulting magma layer's evolution is characterized by a varying in-plane radial flux of material, F(r, t), that can be found from Euler's equation, F = -∂g/∂h, where g = 3πσνh is the viscous couple, and is the specific angular momentum at radius r in a Keplerian disk with 1/ 2( )h GMr=275.97 10M g= × being the Earth's mass. This is differentiated to find ∂2g/∂h2 = -∂F/∂h and is to be combined with the continuity equation,         ∂(σ+σV)/∂t = -(2πr)-1∂F/∂r = -(G2M2/4πh3)∂F/∂h.  (2) The LHS of eqn.(2) can be expressed in terms of g and h by using eqn. (1) together with the substitutions,              Ω = (GM)2/h3  ;  σ = (GM)2g1/3/π(3G2)1/3h10/3 . (3) Differentiating σ with respect to time ultimately leads to the diffusion equation         21/ 3 3 2 22 2 2 2 44 1 4 1( ) ( 3 )3 3(4)g g g gh G MG h g t h G M hπ∂ ∂= + −∂ ∂ AL�with the final source terms on the RHS due to the material condensing from the vapor reservoir. Quasi Steady-state Solutions:  The active supply enables the magma layer to maintain a quasi steadystate where /g t 0∂ ∂ ≈/ o.  The layer tends to be driven to this state from its initial post-impact configuration.  Of course, eqn. (1) tells us that this is not the case for the vapor layer.  To solve for the magma steady-state profile, it is convenient to cast the defining equation in non-dimensional form by introducing the following forms x x x′ ≡ for each variable x , where their reference values are defined as:     1/ 2( )oh GMR≡ =4(4 /o p14 25.05 10 /cm s×)( / )g R hπ≡ L GM lR 2.76= 31 2 210 /g cm s× ⋅1/3 6 2.30 10 /                                    2 2( / 3 )o og R GM 6( / )M Rσ π≡ g cm= ×8 2 /cm s                                    = 2 2/3)M 9.20 10×1610 /( / 3o p oh g R Gν ≡/o o pF g h≡ 5.47 g s= × . and are evaluated for the Earth.      The equation giving the steady state of g takes the compact form,                   .

Eqn.

Also shown in Fig. 1 are (i) the solution for the case 0η =/E� L(grey curves), appropriate when the viscous heating is negligible, , and (ii) the surface density (dashed curve in top panel) for which viscous dissipation could supply all the radiated energy, .  The proto-lunar disk is much closer to (i), implying viscous heating plays a relatively minor role, although this would not necessarily be true for other planet/disk situations [7]. /E →� L 01→     There is a stagnation point in the flux, 0F ′ = , near the halfway mark, with a positive value exterior to that indicating material flowing toward the accretion zone of the Moon.  Negative values of  in the inner portion of the disk indicate material flowing toward and destined to be accreted by the Earth.  The flux at the earth boundary and at the Roche distance are  and .  Thus, the total rate of magma leaving the disk through both boundaries is F ′04080.61)R p0opF ′ = −(1.129=1610 / 0.RF ′519. /moonF F F′ ′ g s× m yr− = = .

(6) Consequently, it takes 3.4 yrs to completely replenish a magma layer.  However at the beginning, most of the disk material is in its vapor state surrounding the magma layer and continues to condense, so it requires  "cycles" to deplete the disk.  Assuming a total vapor + magma mass of ~2 lunar masses, the time to deplete the disk at this rate would be ~ 50 years.  This is roughly the time scale for the disk to radiate all of the latent heat released by condensation at the two ~2000oK photospheric surfaces [5]. / ~a      Summary:  . The overall timescale for the protolunar disk evolution is set by the time to radiate its latent heat as suggested by Thompson & Stevenson [5]. . If it has a stratified structure [6], the magma layer spreads on a time scale of a few years as suggested by Ward & Cameron [2].  However, a quasi steady-state magma layer contains only ~14% of a lunar mass, so most of the disk material starts out in the vapor reservoir. . A freely expanding disk could supply material to the accretion zone at the rate of Fp ~0.027 lunar masses/yr, which is ~65% of the total material diffusing out of the disk (the rest being accreted by the Earth).   . Finally, this free expansion process could be curtailed if an accreting Moon begins to tidally confine the disk [8] and lead to a hiatus of reduced flow across the Roche boundary until the lunar embryo tidally migrates beyond its 2:1 resonance with the Roche boundary.
