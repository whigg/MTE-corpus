Hungary   Introduction: Eearlier the Hungarian Mars Astrobiology Group proposed the MSO-DDS hypothesis which supposed that living organisms may couse the darkening of frost cover at Polar Regions of Mars [1-3]. Regardless the possible hypothetic living organisms, these sites are still interesting because of the conditions annually favorably for the ephemeral occurrence of microscopic liquid water. Several exciting landing sites at Southern Polar Region frosted fields, like the Pityusa Patera, the Inca City, [4-6], and other craters in the subpolar belt are discussed below. The main goal is these sites are suitable for the ephemeral appearance of microscopic liquid water, and in theory even for hypothetically organisms too [7-9], 1-3 mm below the soil surface (tens of centimeters below the frost) are there existing or not. Method: We analyzed MOC, HRSC, HiRISE images and the corresponding topographic data. The proposed landing sites: The sections below show the basic parameters of the proposed landing sites (Fig.1.)

The appearance of an analyzed area (209°E, 69°S) at different dates. (On the B images from the DDS started seepages.). (A) and (B) show the same terrain in the same year with 90 Earth days' difference. Image (A) (R04-00399) was acquired in winter at Ls =165°, while (B) (R07-00376) was acquired in spring at Ls = 216°. The appearance of slope albedo structures on virgin, undisturbed frost cover (A) along the ridge of a dune is obvious, which is consistent with their development as seasonal phenomenon. [9]  "Konkoly" crater (1°E, -68°S, diameter about 70 km, [9]:    Fig.9.a.,b."Konkoly" and Richardson crater. The target region to show these MSO theoretically photosynthesizing units are on the Dark Dune Spots [9, top  images by Mars Express; left below colored 2 HiRISE photos ].Seepages depart from DDS  (viole, blue)  Richardson crater (179°E, -72°S, diam. about 60 km, (bottom of the page) Conclusion: These circumpolar locations are interesing because of ephemeral apprearance of microscopic liquid water. Because under different climates the water could exist there substantially longer duration, these sites are useful to analyze, could any hypothetical Martian biota remained on the planet [3]. These landing sites may have the possibility to discover the Martian living organisms in the form of CryptoBiotic Crust formed by extremophile bacteria.
