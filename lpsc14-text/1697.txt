Cohesive Self-Gravitating Aggregates and their Path of Disruption Paul Sa´nchez and DanielJ. Scheeres, Colorado Center for Astrodynamics Research, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309-431(diego.sanchez-lana@colorado.edu)We simulate the failure mechanics of cohesive andcohesionless, spherical and ellipsoidal self-gravitatingaggregates in order to better understand the geophysicsof rubble pile asteroids. The aggregates are slowlyspun up to disruption controlling for angle of friction,cohesion and global shape. In particular we observewhether these bodies fail by shedding or fission andfind a clear transition from one to the other as a function of geophysical properties.Introduction:During the last few years different researchers haveused DEM codes for the simulation of small rubblepile bodies. This research has pushed code developersto implement different models to simulate frictionaland cohesive forces. This however, has led to different paths for the disruption of self-gravitating aggregates depending on the researcher and even the codethat has been used. Notice that we have not used theterm asteroid as an equivalent to the simulated aggregates. We have done this intentionally, though imagescan and do resemble real asteroids, the fact is that theoutcomes of a simulation, and how real they are, depend on how well said simulations capture the physicsof the real system.In this paper we take two parameters, angle of friction (θ) and cohesive strength (σc), and explore theireffect on the disruption process of aggregates with different initial shapes. We have chosen to use sphericaland ellipsoidal shapes as the starting point of the evolution as these are classical forms that could also bestudied analytically.Simulation Method:The simulation program that is used for this research applies a Soft-Sphere Discrete Element Method[1, 2, 3, 4] to simulate a self-gravitating granular aggregate. The particles, modelled as spheres that followa predetermined size distribution, interact through asoft-repulsive potential when in contact. This methodconsiders that two particles are in contact when theyoverlap. When this happens, normal and tangentialcontact forces are calculated ([5]).The calculation of the normal forces between colliding particles is modeled by a linear spring and a dashpot. The elastic force is modelled as~fe = knξnˆ, (1)the damping force as:~fd = −γnξ˙nˆ, (2)and the cohesive force (fc) between the particles is calculated as a function of the (not simulated) interstitial regolith [6] and the size of the simulated particles.Scaling arguments allow us to regard simulations withthe same aggregate size and different σc as equivalentto simulations of aggregates of different size and thesame σc.Then the total normal force is calculated as ~fn =~fe + ~fc + ~fd. In these equations kn is the elastic constant, ξ is the overlap of the particles, γn is the damping constant (related to the dashpot), ξ˙ is the rate ofdeformation and nˆ is the vector joining the centres ofthe colliding particles. This dashpot models the energydissipation that occurs during a real collision.The tangential component of the contact force models surface friction, static and dynamic. This is calculated by placing a linear spring at the contact point,attached to both particles, at the beginning of the collision [5, 7], producing a restoring frictional force~ft. The magnitude of the elongation of this tangential spring is truncated in order to satisfy the localCoulomb yield criterion ~ft ≤ µ~fn. In addition, wehave also implemented rolling friction as suggested by[8]. For this, a winding spring provides a torque toparticles in contact. In form, it is very similar to surface friction, but is related to the relative angular displacement. This type of friction allows us to obtainaggregates with angles of friction of up to ∼35o, typical of cohesionless aggregates on Earth, though anglesof ∼40o are not rare.The particles (initially cohesionless and frictionless) are left to coalesce in the desired shape so forming very homogeneous internal structures. The aggregates are spun up in small, discrete increments aroundtheir CM and the disruption process is observed.Results:For our simulations we have chosen the followingangles of friction: 12o, 25o and 35o. These values werecalculated using the Drucker-Prager yield criteria [9]and represent only the lower bound of the envelope forcohesionless aggregates.We first show the disruption mode of cohesionlessaggregates. Fig. 1 shows the disruption of spherical(top) and ellipsoidal (bottom) aggregates with increasingly higher angles of friction from left to right. Forθ=12o, the initially spherical aggregate deforms first toan oblate and then to a prolate spheroid, finally shedding some particles. No surface friction was includedin these simulations so this is in fact a granular liquid. For θ=25o, the deformation stops when an oblate1697.pdf

For θ=35o, there isalso deformation towards an oblate spheroid, but to alesser degree and the mass shedding is not particle byparticles, but in groups of a few.The deformation of the ellipsoidal aggregates follow a different pattern. For θ=12o, the aggregate simply deforms into something that could be seen as extreme shedding. For θ=25o, the aggregate has somemore structural strength as surface-surface friction hasbeen included. Deformation occurs at the centre, theplace where greater stress is located. For θ=35o, theaggregate deforms very little and shedding particlesfrom one end is preferred to fission. As in the sphericalcase, shedding occurs in groups of a few particles.In both cases, the inclusion of extra sources of friction at the particle level translate into greater structuralstrentgh, less deformation and a greater angle of friction. This is how all these aggregates are related, if thebody is strong enough to resist deformation, the spinups can continue until at some point the particles atthe farthest ends can get into orbit. Of course, how thedeformation occurs depends on the initial shape. Prolate spheroids cannot go towards spherical or oblateshapes, but the opposite direction is possible.Fig. 2 shows the deformation and disruption of threeinitially spherical aggregates (top) and three initiallyellipsoidal aggregates (bottom) with increasing cohesive strength from left to right. All of them have afriction angle θ of at least at 35o. From these imageswe see that as cohesion is increased the nature of thebody distortion and deformation changes. For low cohesion the body tends to shed chunks of material fromits surface, while for increasing cohesion the body undergoes larger deformations that lead to the fission ofsignificant components of the body. If, instead, we assume that the cohesion is constant for these bodies butFigure 2: Deformation and disruption of three initiallyspherical (top) and three ellipsoidal (bottom). From left toright the aggregates have greater cohesive strength (or samestrength and diminishing size)that their size is scaled, the aggregates measure about 1km, 3 km and 14 km across and the particles, or groupsof particles, have a similar size, making this a problemof resolution, i.e., the number of particles used in asimulation.These results start to raise fundamental questionsregarding the difference between shedding and fission.Is it shedding when it is dust grain by dust grain ejection from the main body or when it is in groups of 10,100 or 100000 dust particles? Is it fission when a 1 mpiece of the asteroid detaches or when it splits in themiddle? These questions will be further pursued in theconference presentation.References: [1] P. Sa´nchez, et al.
