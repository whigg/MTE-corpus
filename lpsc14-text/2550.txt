Introduction:  Approximately 70 unpaired meteorites have been classified as martian based on distinctive elemental and isotopic signatures.  These meteorites show evidence for early differentiation of Mars [14].  The martian meteorites display a very large range of trace element abundances and isotopic composition. Various trace element and isotope-based models suggest that the compositional variability observed in the martian meteorites is the result of mixing processes between distinct source compositions [5-8].  NWA 7635 was found in southern Morocco in 2012 and was classified as an olivine-plagioclasephyric shergottite with a bulk oxygen isotope value of Δ17O=0.293±0.005‰ [9]. Based on petrology, mineralogy and bulk composition, it is unique among shergottites because of its maskelynite phenocrysts, lack of obvious phosphates (see below), and it is inferred to reflect fractionation well beyond the stage represented by QUE 94201 [9].  Hf-Nd isotopic analyses will allow comparison of source characteristics with other depleted shergottites.  Here, we present Sm-Nd and Lu-Hf isotopic results for NWA 7635 and place these new data in the context of existing Sm-Nd and Lu-Hf data for shergottites with the aim of identifying similarities and potential source affinities between several other depleted shergottites.  Samples and Analytical Procedures: A thick section was analyzed for trace element abundances in the major constituent phases by LA-ICPMS at the University of Houston. The abundances of Nd were also used to estimate the amount of spike to add to the samples for isotopic study. A ~1 g aliquot of NWA 7635 was gently ultrasonicated in milli-Q water and subsequently crushed in an aluminum oxide mortar and pestle.  The crushed material was sieved into various size fractions, of which the 200-325 mesh fraction was used for mineral separations via heavy liquid separation (acetylene tetrabromide) and magnetic separation. A total of three fractions were used to construct a Sm-Nd isochron: 'Magnetic1' (olivine rich), 'Magnetic 2' (pyroxene rich) and 'fines' (fine grain fraction from mesh size >325 mesh). These were gently leached in room temperature 1 M HCl for 10 minutes, both leachate and residue fractions were analyzed. An additional ~100 mg bulk sample was processed for whole rock Sm, Nd, Lu and Hf analyses, and four fractions from a Pb-Pb sequential leaching study were also measured for Sm and Nd.  Neodymium and samarium were purified using a two column procedure, isolation of the REE via cation exchange (AG50W-X8-200 resin) and isolation of Sm and Nd (AG50W-X4 resin in NH4 form with HIBA). All chemical separation procedures were carried out in clean lab facilities and all isotope analyses were carried out using the Nu Plasma II MC-ICP-MS at the University of Houston. Results:  REE Concentrations: The chondritenormalized REE abundances of the primary phases are presented in Figure 1. In situ trace element analyses of plagioclase, pyroxene, and olivine show similar REE patterns to bulk NWA7635 and other depleted shergottites [10-13], but at lower concentrations suggesting the presence of a minor REE-rich phase. The bulk rock and mineral compositions show depletion in LREE with an increasing slope from LREE to MREE and a near flat pattern from the MREE to HREE.  A positive Eu anomaly is observed in plagioclase, whereas olivine, pyroxene and bulk rock have small negative Eu anomalies.  Figure 1. Chondrite-normalized REE abundances for NWA 7635 mineral phases (this study) and bulk powder [9].  Sm-Nd systematics: The results of Sm-Nd isotopic analyses are presented on an isochron diagram in Figure 2.  The Sm-Nd isotope data yield an age of 2326 ± 130 Ma (2σ, MSWD=5.3) and an initial ε143Nd value of +26.3.  This age is defined by whole rock, 'fines', 'Magnetic1-R (olivine-rich)', 'Magnetic2-R (pyroxene-rich)', 'Leachates' and 'HF-leachates'. 'Leachates' consist of a weighted average of the gentlest leaching step from each of the four leached sample fractions. Even though no phosphate minerals have been found in NWA 7635, all of the four gently leached fractions contain about half of the Nd in the sample and have low Sm/Nd ratio, and correspondingly low 143Nd/144Nd ratios. This indicates that these fractions probably conNWA 7635 Bulk Plagioclase Olivine Pyroxene S am pl e/ Cho nd rit e  sist of micro-phosphates possibly occurring along grain boundaries and/or within melt inclusions, and is consistent with the REE budget for the primary phases. The 'HF leachates' consist of a weighted average of three strong HF leachates of the same sample aliquot used for Pb-Pb analyses.     Figure 2.  Sm-Nd isochron diagram for NWA 7635. 'Whole Rock' = unleached whole rock, 'Fine'=leachate residue of fine-grained fraction, 'Magnetic1' = residue of magnetic fraction 1 (olivine-rich), 'Magnetic2' = residue of magnetic fraction 2 (pyroxene-rich), 'Leachates (phosphate)' = weighted average of four leachates from 'fine', 'Magnetic1', 'Magnetic2' and bulk rock powder from Pb-Pb sequential dissolution, 'HF Leachates' = weighted average of three HF containing leachates from Pb-Pb sequential dissolution.  The data form a mineral plus bulk rock isochron age of 2326±130 Ma with an initial 143Nd/144Nd isotope ratio is 0.51097±0.00035 (2σ). A Model-3 solution from Isoplot (v.3.50) [14] was used to calculate the isochron.  Lu-Hf Isotope Systematics: The measured whole rock 176Hf/177Hf isotope ratio is 0.287860 ± 0.000009 and 176Lu/177Hf ratio is 0.1200. Based on the Sm-Nd age of 2326 Ma and the whole rock Lu-Hf isotope data, the calculated initial ε176Hf of NWA 7635 is +44.1. Discussion: The Sm-Nd age of 2326±130 Ma defined by the mineral fractions reported here is significantly older than any for other depleted shergottites (327-596 Ma) [2, 15]. This old age for NWA 7635 makes it the first and only dated shergottite from the early Amazonian epoch in Mars geologic history.  Source 147Sm/144Nd  and 176Lu/177Hf isotope ratios of NWA 7635 and other shergottites are calculated using a two-stage model assuming a differentiation age of 4.513 Ga and the CHUR parameters of [16]. The decay constants used for 176Lu and 147Sm are 1.867 × 10-11 a-1 and 6.539 × 10-12 a-1, respectively.  The calculated source 147Sm/144Nd and 176Lu/177Hf isotope ratios of NWA 7635 are 0.297 and 0.0650 respectively. In Figure 3 the source compositions are plotted on a binary mixing array defined by enriched, intermediate, depleted shergottites and ALH 84001. NWA 7635 plots as the most depleted shergottite, extending the existing depleted shergottite range. The source composition of NWA 7635 falls, within uncertainty, on the mixing array, showing that it derived from a source that is more depleted in trace elements but similar to the sources of other shergottites, and has the largest fraction of cumulates to residual trapped liquids compared any other shergottites. Since NWA 7635 is highly depleted in Hf (high Lu/Hf ratio) and old, the calculated 176Lu/177Hf ratio has a relatively large uncertainty. Further age constraints using other isotope systematics such as Rb-Sr, Ar-Ar, and Lu-Hf are required to improve this initial ratio estimate.   Figure 3.

DS = depleted shergottites; IS = intermediate shergottites; ES = enriched shergottites; ALH = ALH 84001.  The black binary mixing line is based on source compositions of cumulate (enriched end-member) in the upper mantle assemblage (UM1) of [17] produced in a 2000-1350 km deep magma ocean.  Isotope data used for the source calculations of shergottites are from [18-23].    References: [1] Harper C.L. et al. (1995) Science 267, 213-217. [2] Borg L.E. et al. (1997) GCA 61, 4915-4931.
