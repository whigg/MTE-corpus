Introduction:  Knowledge of dust matter distribution in the planetary systems play an important role for security of space flights, successful searching for hazardous small bodies, solving of exoplanets origin problem [1].  So, models of localization of dust matter in the gravitational systems are of great scientific and practical interest.  Below, we consider the region of stable motion of   a particle with negligible small mass m3 in the frame of the planar circular restricted photo gravitational  three body problem [2], [3], [4]. Let us, m1 and m2 are mass of main bodies, r12 is a distance between these bodies, q1 is the “solar” constant, R is the radius of the particle, ρ is its density, c is  the velocity of light, G is the gravitational constant, rSE is the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun.   We find the positions of the libration points, - distance r3 in respect of the system center mass, – state the stability of these libration points, based on Lyapunov’s method for the first approximation and numerically investigate the region of motion the particle stability, using method of Runge-Kutt integrating, where N is a number of points in the picture. (The regions of stable motion of the particles, in the given model, will be considered as the regions of concentration of dust matter in the system).   Fundamental Equation:  In accordance with works [2] and [3] we have the vectorial differential equation (1) of the particle m3  motion near the point of libration (some analogue of the Lagrangian point libration “L2”) in the uniformly rotating system. d2R3 /dt2+Gm1(1–β)(r3-r1+R3)/(׀r3-r1+R3׀)3 +  Gm2(r3-r2+R3)/(׀r3-r2+R3׀)3)-2[dR3/dt, Ω]–Ω2(R3+r3)                            (1) Here, r3 is  the radius-vector determined the position of libration point in respect of the center mass of the system (unperturbed motion) and R3 is a radius vector determined the position of m3 in respect of the libration point (perturbed motion). r1 and r2 are radii – vectors in respect of the center mass of the system determined the positions of major bodies with mass m1 and m2 correspondingly. Ω is the angular velocity of uniformly rotation of major bodies. β is depended upon properties of the spherical particles .b,RcmGqr,b SE0112001043               (2) r1=-m2/ (m1+m2) r12, r2=m1/ (m1+m2) r12,             (3)  31221rmmG  .                          (4) Examples:  For the numerical experiments we put R=10-4m, ρ=1000kg/m3, c=3∙108m/sec, G=6.672∙10-11 m3/(sec2∙kg), m1=2∙1030kg, m2=0.001m1, rSE=149.6∙109 m, q1=1360Wt/m2.  b varies between the limits from 0 to 175.35. In the process of the equation (1) solving we use the following units: m1 is the unit of mass, r12 is the unit of length, the unit of time t is corresponded for the case G=1.  In Fig.1. the dependence r3=r3(b) is presented. In Fig.2. the dependence θ=θ(b) is presented, where θ is the angle between vectors r23 and r13 with the vertex placed in the investigated point of libration. Fig.3. and Fig.4 illustrate the stable motion of the particles near the points of libration. Fig.5. and Fig.6. show “unstable” motion of the particles with mass m3 near the points of libration at finite interval of time. Note, if m1=1, then the stable motion (near L2) is observed for m2/m1< 25/2-3∙691/2/2 = 0.04006420562288772112360; if   m1+m2=1, then the stable motion is observed for m2/m1<½691/2/18=0.038520896504551397078652.   Fig.1. The distance r3, determined the positions of the points of libration (analogue of L2), in respect of the center mass of the system (m1 and m2), depended on b. Units of length equals r12.      Conclusions: a) In the  considered celestial mechanical model in the  case of equilibrium  the light small-sized particles are placed near the star and heavy  large-sized particles are placed near the classical Lagrangian point “L2” (Fig.1). b) The angle θ varies between the limits from 60 degrees (the Lagrangian point of libration L2) for b=0 to almost 90 degrees for b 1798.pdf

tends to 175.370357169036216809331 (Fig.2.). c) For the small values of initial velocities V0x=V0y of the body with mass m3 this body moves in the restricted region (Fig.3) and (Fig. 4). d)  For the large values of initial velocities V0x=V0y of the body with mass m3 this body may escape the system (Fig.5.) and (Fig.6). In the next work we checked up this results applied them to real clouds of dust matter in the solar (and exosolar) systems.      References: [1] Ipatov S. I. and Mather J. C.
