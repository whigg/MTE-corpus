Thermal decomposition of perchlorate (ClO4-) salts in the Rocknest samples are a possible explanation for this evolved oxygen release [1, 2]. Releative to Na-, K-, Mg-, and Fe-perchlorate,  the thermal decomposition of Ca-perchlorate in laboratory experiments released O2 in the temperature range (400-500°C) closest to the O2 release temperatures observed for the Rocknest material [1]. Furthermore, calcium perchlorate could have been the source of Cl in the chlorinated-hydrocarbons species that were detected by SAM [2].  Different components in the Martian soil could affect the decomposition temperature of calcium perchlorate or another oxychlorine species.  This interaction of the two components in the soil could result in O2 release temperatures consistent with those detected by SAM in the Rocknest materials. The decomposition temperatures of various alkali metal perchlorates are known to decrease in the presence of a catalyst [4, 5, 6].  The objective of this work is to  investigate catalytic interactions on calcium perchlorate from various iron-bearing minerals known to be present in the Rocknest material.  Materials and Methods:  Reagent grade Ca(ClO4)2•4H2O from ACROS ORGANICS was dissolved in deionized water, flash frozen with N2(l), and subsequently, freezed dried in a Labconco Freezone 4.5 Plus evaporator.  The dehydrated Ca-perchlorate was ground with an agate mortar/pestle and sieved (≤ 125 µm) in a N2(g) purged glove box to miminmize rehydration. The iron minerals that were mixed with the Ca-perchlroate included a synthetic magnetite (MTS4), synthetic hematite [7], pyrite, and fayalite with a magnetite contaminant (Forsythe Iron Mine in Ontario, Canada,# 49 V 1555). A Mauna Kea Volcano dust sample (HWMK919) was used as a Martian soil analog [8] (≤ 5 microns) and also mixed with Caperchlorate. With the exception of the HWMK919 material, all samples were ground with an agar mortar and pestle and sieved to less than 125 microns.  Each iron mineral (except pyrite) used for the mixtures represented a mineral component discovered in Rocknest material [9]. HWMK919 contains Feamorphous material which is analogous to the amorphous material detetected in the Rocknest material [9]. Simulated SAM analyses were conducted using a Setaram Sensys-Evo differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) coupled to a Stanford Research Systems Universal Gas Analyzer (MS) which together have been configured to operate similarly to the SAM oven/QMS system. Samples in the JSC-SAM-testbed were heated from 25 to 715°C at a heating rate of 35°C/min while being purged  (3 mL/min)  under 30-75 mbar He carrier gas.  Rehydration of Ca-perchlroate was minimized by quickly mixing 3.2 mmol Ca-perchlorate outside of the glovebox with 1 and 5 molar equivalent (3.2 and 16 mmol, respectively) of each individual Fe phase. The HWMK919 is a palagonitic material with a complex mineralogy which made it difficult to determine molecular weight of the sample. Therefore, the sample was prepared with 0.5 or 2.5 mg of HWMK919 to mimic the relative amounts of material used for the other Fe-bearing minerals Calcium Perchlorate Thermal Decomposition:  The thermal decomposition of Ca-perchlorate typically occurs as follows [11].   (a) [Ca(H2O)4](ClO4)2→Ca(ClO4)2  + 4H2O  (b) Ca(ClO4)2→Ca(ClO4)2  (melt)  (c) Ca(ClO4)2↔CaCl2 + 4O2 Reaction (a) is a summary reaction that represents multiple dehydration steps.  Ca-perchlorate melts (b) and then finally decomposes by releaseing O2 and forming CaCl2 (c) [11].  Results and Discussion:  The above reaction mechanism is reflected by the thermal data (Fig. 1) where the first endotherm corresponds to reaction (a) (≤ 150°C), the second endotherm corresponds to reaction (b) (≤ 400°C), and the large exotherm reaction (c) (≥ 400°C). The Fe-bearing minerals only affect reaction (c) exotherms as indicated by the observed temperatures shifts relative to Ca-perchlorate alone (Fig. 1).  The relative order of Fe-minerals that decreased the Ca-perchlorate decompositon peak temperature the most were magnetite (-35°C) >hematite (-30°C) >pyrite (-10°C) >HWMK919 (-0°C)  >fayalite (+10°C) (Fig. 1). Evaluation of the O2 peak temperature release data of the mixtures relative to the Ca-perchlorate only sample (Fig. 2) followed the same order as the thermal data. The order was  magnetite (-25°C) >hematite  2057.pdf

However, the largest differentials (~20-25°C) caused by magnetite and hematie does not drop the perchlorate O2 release to match that of Rocknest  The pyrite, HWMK919, and fayalite-calcium perchlorate mixtures resulted in little to no change in the peak decoposition temperature. However, the HWMK919 mixtures does provide on onset temperature that better correlates to the Rocknest O2 release (Fig. 2) and needs to be further investigated. Although fayalite had little effect on the perchlorate O2 release temperature,   HCl (m/z 36) and Cl (m/z 35) releases temperatures (>580ºC) were consistent with HCl release temperatures detected in Rocknest (data not shown). Evolved chlorine species were also observed with the pyrite and the HWMK919 mixtures >450ºC (data not shown). Evidence of evolved chlorine from pure calcium perchlorate was previously reported [2], but was inconsistent with the results found in this study.  These results suggest that Fephases may have a role in releasing Cl species at temperatures greater than perchorate decomposition temperatures.  Conclusions: Iron oxides (magnetite and hematite) have the most effect on reducing the decomposition temperature of calcium perchlorate species.  Both iron oxides are reported to exist in Rocknest, about 2 wt. %   Figure 2: Evolved oxygen release from Rocknest, and MS results for Ca(ClO4) and Ca(ClO4)+Fe analog materials versus temperature.

This suggests that these Fe-oxides may be in part responsible for the lower O2 evolution temperatures observed from the windblown deposit. However, when comparing the catalytic tendencies of these iron bearing minerals to the evolved O2 release found by SAM none of the crystalline components in the investigated minerals resulted in similar O2 release temperature.  The amorphous HWMK919 mixture did not yield an exact O2 peak temperature match, but its overall O2 temperature release did span most of the Rocknest O2 release temperature range. Since its O2 release did span across the SAM’s observed O2 release more work evaluating amorphous Fe phase mixtures is needed. Evolved chlorinated species were only detected during analysis of  of the HWMK919, fayalite and pyrite mixtures indicating that Fe-phases may have a role in releaseing the HCl phases detected in Rocknest. Future work will evaluate magnesium and  sodium perchlorate/chlorates mixed with Fe phases as potential sources of evolved O2 and HCl from Rocknest. References: [1] Leshin et al.
