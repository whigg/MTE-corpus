Then the rover departed with the lander on 15 December, 2013. The APXS can work soundly during its first mission profile. The performances of the instrument were described in this article.   Instrument: Four components of APXS were integrated to provide a sound instrument working on the lunar surface. The relationship of the four modules was shown in figure 1. Fig.1 the logical relationship between the four components of the APXS payload The characteristics of the four components were listed in Table 1.
