Introduction:  Despite observational evidence that about 15% of the Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs) are binary [1, 2], only a handful of the approximately 184 known craters on Earth have been suggested as potential doublets, i.e. Clearwater East & West, Kamensk & Gusev, Ries & Steinheim, Suvasvesi North & South, Serra da Cangalha & Riachão [3, 4, 5]. However, poor state of preservation, or insufficient/inadequate melted material have hampered the necessary precision of the biostratigraphic or radiometric datings of the putative doublets [5].  Binary asteroids develop when solar energy thermal YORP (Yarkovsky–O’Keefe–Radzievskii–Paddack) effect make a rubble pile asteroid spin so fast that loose material is thrown out from its equator to slowly accumulate into a satellite [6]. It is mainly asteroids of >200m in diameter that may develop into binaries [1], which gives that the number of confirmed craters on Earth in the size-range for possible binaries to develop is about 130 [4]. However, due to effects of the relative position of the two objects and impact obliquity, only about 15% of the binary asteroids that actually strike the Earth surface will have the necessary separation of 8Dp between the two objects, where Dp denotes the diameter of the principal object, to generate true doublet craters with no overlap [4, 7]. Likewise, the maximum distance between two craters to be considered a doublet is 120Dp as this is maximum limit of stability of an asteroid satellite [8]. This leads to that only about 2-3 of the known craters on Earth in the given sizerange will be doublets with completely separate craters, which is in pair with what is suggested by the observed putative doublets [4]. However, as all of these doublets are disputed [5], the important comparison between calculated and observed doublets is still on square one. For this reason, our recent confirmation of the ~700 m wide Målingen structure (Fig 1.) as an impact crater contemporaneous to the nearby, more than ten times larger Lockne crater [9], is of great importance as the currently only available full-scale ground truth of the effects of a binary impact event.

Whereas the Målingen structure until recently was known only as an enigmatic, km-wide, circular feature with lithologies of similar type as at Lockne [see summary by 9], the Lockne crater has been extensively studied for the last decades. Its geological features, its age, and the processes involved in its formation are known in great detail [e.g. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Despite its relatively high age [458Ma, dating by 11 and absolute age correction by 16] the crater retain much of its original shape, sedimentary infill, and ejecta deposits. This is much due to the fortunate combination of a marine target environment with continued sedimentation covering the newly formed structure, and that it then became completely covered by overthrust nappes of the Caledonian orogeny. Subaerial and glacial erosion have since then come to expose the crater, but with surprisingly small effects on its original morphology and impactites.  200 m Målingen 1024.pdf

A disadvantage with the orogenic thermal overprint of the crater is that it has prohibited any attempt for radiometric dating. Nevertheless, the relatively rapid postimpact sedimentation in the crater has allowed detailed dating based on chitinozoan biostratigraphy [9, 11]. The impact event occurred during the lower part of the L. dalbyensis chitinozoan zone, which belongs to the lowermost Haljala Stage of Baltoscandia [17, 18]. Recently, a 148.8 m long core drilling (Målingen-1) through the sedimentary infill of Målingen provided evidence for its impact formation [9, 19], and gave the same biostratigraphic position (L. dalbyensis Zone) as for the Lockne event [9]. Of additional importance for the argumentation of a simultaneous formation of the two craters is that the neither of the inspected cores (i.e., Lockne-2 and Målingen-1) show any sign of reworking or distal ejecta layer in the post-impact sequences of either crater. Considering the relatively short time span of 0.1-1 My for the L. dalbyensis Zone, the obtained age for the craters is 458 ±0.5 My (an error of <0.1%). Schmieder et al. [5] state that “only synchronicity of two neighboring impact events within ~±0.5% hardens the evidence for double impact”. Hence, we here propose the Lockne-Målingen doublet structure to be the first unequivocal example of an impact of a binary asteroid on Earth, and as such, in a marine target setting. that, in a marine target setting. 1] Thelander T.
