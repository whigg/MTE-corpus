Introduction: The presence of Na salts in the plume emissions of Enceladus indicates water-rock interaction in the history of the icy moon [1,2]. Silica (SiO2) nano-size particles detected in the saturnian system could be from Enceladus [3,4], further supporting aqueous processes [5]. Interaction of silicate rocks with water leads to the formation of Si-bearing ions and neutral aqueous (aq) species in solution (mainly SiO2, HSiO3 - and NaHSiO3) and condensed SiO2 phases may form upon cooling, evaporation or freezing of the fluids. On Earth, amorphous opaline silica (SiO2 nH2O or SiO2(am)) commonly deposits at hot springs (e.g., at the Yellowstone National Park) and at the seafloor hydrothermal vents. Similar processes have been proposed to explain the origin of opaline silica in Gusev crater on Mars [6]. However, silica phases may not easily deposit from solutions that are strongly undersaturated with respect to SiO2. Fluids formed during serpentinization of olivine-rich rocks are SiO2-undersaturated [7]. Secondary silica phases have not been reported in carbonaceous chondrites [8] and corresponding parent body fluids could have been undersaturated as well. Our initial models for early Enceladus demonstrated a possibility for deposition of amorphous silica through cooling of ocean-forming fluids [13]. The recent experimental work [14,15] makes a case about formation of silica nano-size particles during cooling of hot (T  > 100 oC) fluids on today's Enceladus. Here, we have evaluated concentration and speciation of Sibearing solutes in typical chondritic fluids. We explored conditions of saturation of solutions with respect to silica phases in order to constrain the origin of silica particles on Enceladus. Modeling Approach: Chemical equilibria have been calculated in a water-rock system at temperature (T = 0 to 300 ◦C), pressure (P = P[H2O liquid-gas saturation] to 100 bars), and water/rock mass ratio (W/R = 0.3 to 2) which are applicable to Enceladus and other bodies consisting of solids of near-solar composition. The rock was presented by the H2O-free composition of Orgueil CI carbonaceous chondrite, which is a proxy for rocks in the outer solar system. Redox conditions (fH2) were varied from H2-rich environments in a closed system at 100 bars to oxidized conditions that correspond to complete removal of H2 gas at the pressure of H2O liquid-gas saturation. Some oxidizing cases were modeled by simulated setting  fH2 in agreement with the CO2/CH4 ratio in the plume [cf., 13], even if CH4 does not equilibrate with CO2 in natural fluids. The oxidized cases provided a better match to the composition of Enceladus' plume and Ering particles [1,2], though the origin of H2 in plume gases remains unclear. Calculations were performed with GEOCHEQ codes [16] which we used elsewhere [13,17]. Conditions for saturation of SiO2(am) in cooled fluids were explored by calculation of chemical equilibria in initial rock-free solutions at 0 oC. Additional mineral deposition through fluid evaporation or freezing was modeled with the FREZCHEM code [18].  Concentration and Speciation of Si-bearing Solutes in Chondritic Fluids: The concentration and speciation of Si solutes are mostly controlled by solubilities of secondary Fe-Mg serpentine, Na-K-Ca-Mg saponite, and Fe-Mg chlorite in altered chondritic rock. The concentration of SiO2(aq) gradually increases with T and is not very sensitive to the P and redox state of the system. Commonly, SiO2(aq) is the dominant Si-bearing solute in high-T systems (Fig. 1). Serpentine-saponite secondary mineralogies, which are typical for CI/CM chondrites [8], correspond to slightly lower concentrations of SiO2(aq) than in chloritebearing mineral assemblages shown on Fig. 1.  Some models that involved a major oxidation of organic C [c.f., 13] led to talc-carbonate serpentinefree assemblages equilibrated with SiO2(aq)-enriched fluids. Elevated concentrations of SiO2(aq) in the contact with talc-bearing rocks are consistent with experiments [14,15]. However, talc-rich assemblages are inconsistent with observations in chondrites [8] and corresponding SiO2(aq)-rich fluids could have not occurred on asteroids and icy moons.  Aqueous species HSiO3 - and NaHSiO3 dominate in high-pH and low-T fluids (Fig. 1), consistent with equilibria HSiO3 - + H+ = SiO2(aq) + H2O(l) and NaHSiO3(aq) + H + = Na+ + SiO2(aq) + H2O(l). NaHSiO3(aq) is more abundant in Na-rich solutions. NaHSiO3(aq) and HSiO3 - could be very abundant (up to 10-2 mole (kg H2O) -1) in hypothetical super-alkaline NaOH-type fluids coexisting with Na-less serpentine±chlorite mineralogy without Na-bearing saponite [17]. The concentration of SO2(aq) is not elevated and solutions are far from saturation with respect to silica.  Fig. 1. Concentrations of solutes, the pH, and total concentration of Si-bearing species which represent interaction of CI-type chondrites with water at W/R = 1, 100 bars total pressure and 10% of C reacted. The redox state is set to be consistent with the CO2/CH4 ratio of ~2.5 in the Enceladus' plume [c.f., 13]. The fluid coexists with secondary mineralogy dominated by serpentine, saponite, chlorite, and magnetite.

With the exception of unusual NaOH-type and talc-related cases, bulk concentration of Si species in CI-chondritic fluids at 0-300 oC is about 10-4 mole (kg H2O) -1 and may not exceed 10-3 mole (kg H2O) -1. Saturation of Low-T Fluids with Respect to Amorphous Silica: A solution becomes supersaturated with respect to SiO2(am) if the activity (a) of dissolved silica exceeds aSiO2(aq) set by equilibrium SiO2(am) = SiO2(aq); Keq = aSiO2(aq)/aSiO2(am) ≈ aSiO2(aq) ≈ -3.11 (at 0 oC and 1-100 bars). In the considered hydrothermal solutions, calculated aSiO2(aq) was much less than at solution saturation with respect to quartz or SiO2(am). Cooled rock-free fluids remain undersaturated with respect to amorphous silica (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the increase in pH upon cooling decreases concentration and activity of SiO2(aq) at the expense of other Si-bearing solutes. One exception is the observed precipitation of SiO2(am) upon cooling of hydrothermal (T  > ~220 oC) fluids equilibrated with a talc-rich rock without serpentine discussed in the previous section.  Modeled freezing of cooled fluids led to precipitation of amorphous SiO2. However, a freezing scenario for Enceladus needs to be reconciled with the coagulation of nano-size silica particles at even moderate ionic strengths [15,19]. Conclusions: Aqueous alteration of carbonaceous chondritic materials forms fluids which are strongly undersaturated with respect to silica phases, consistent with observations in chondrites. Cooling of typical chondritic fluids to ~0 oC may not cause precipitation of silica as suggested in [14,15]. If hydrothermal activity is the source of the observed nano-particles further efforts are needed to understand the process. References: [1] Postberg F. et al. (2009) Nature 459, 1098-1101.
