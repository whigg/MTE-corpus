A COMMON ORIGIN FOR ICY SATELLITE EXTENSIONAL RIDGE-AND-TROUGH TERRAIN BY SLUGGISH LID CONVECTION.  Amy C. Barr and Noah P. Hammond, Department of Geological Sciences, Brown University, 324 Brook Street, Box 1846, Providence RI 02912, USA (amy_barr@brown.edu).  Introduction: Ridge and trough terrain is found in a variety of settings on outer solar system icy satellites. Examples include Ganymede's grooved terrain [1], Europa's bands [2,3], Miranda's coronae [4,5], and swaths of ridges and troughs in the northern plains of Enceladus [6].  Regardless of setting, the terrains are characterized by sub-parallel ridges and troughs with kilometer-scale spacing (see Table 1).  The fault spacing implies a shallow brittle/ductile depth and thus, a high thermal gradient at the time of deformation [e.g., 7].  Some of the terrains, such as Europa's bands and subdued grooves on Ganymede, are bounded by a sharp groove, and seem to represent sites of emplacement of fresh material from the subsurface [e.g., 8,9].  Other terrains, such as the coronae on Miranda and ridge systems on Enceladus appear to be sites of extension without complete lithospheric separation [4,6].  Although other satellites show evidence of tectonics (e.g., Tethys' Ithaca Chasma and Dione's wispy terrain), closely spaced subparallel ridges and troughs occur primarily on satellites that have experienced tidal flexing.   Despite occurring on satellites with different radii and mean densities, the wavelength of deformation, depth to the brittle/ductile transition (from which one can estimate heat flow), and deformation rates associated with the formation of these terrains are strikingly similar.  These conditions are not dissimilar to those in a convecting ice shell with a weak upper surface, proposed as a means of forming the Enceladus south polar terrain [10-13].   Here, we use numerical simulations of ice shell convection to show that similar rheological parameters can give rise to the heat flows and deformation rates inferred for the formation of several examples of extensional ridge and trough terrain on a number of satellites.  Our results suggest that sluggish lid convection may be the underlying driving force for the formation of a common tectonic landform on icy satellites.  Motivation: Solid-state convection has long been suggested to play a role in driving deformation on the icy satellites [e.g., 14].  However, the relationship between convection and resurfacing remains unclear. Because the viscosity of water ice depends strongly on temperature, fluid motions in the ice shells of the outer planet satellites are thought to be confined to a relatively thin layer at the base of the shell, beneath a thick "stagnant lid" of cold ice that is too stiff to participate in convection.  In the "stagnant lid" regime, convective stresses are too small to deform the near-surface ice, preventing resurfacing and limiting the convective heat flow to ~30-50 mW/m2 [10].  However, if the near-surface ice in the shells of Enceladus [10] or Ganymede [19] has a yield stress of tens to 100 kPa, convective plumes can reach close to the surface, supplying a large heat flux and ~mm/yr deformation rates; this style of convection is known as "sluggish lid" because the near-surface "lid" of cold ice is dragged along by the underlying convective flow. Table 1 summarizes geological and geophysical constraints on deformation wavelength, heat flux, and strain rate derived from photogeology of several different types of extensional ridge and trough terrains.  The similarity among the inferred conditions for formation of these terrains suggest that sluggish lid convection might be the common underlying driving force behind ridgeand-trough formation on all satellites.

Methods: We simulate convection using the finite element model CITCOM [20].  The vigor of convection is expressed by the Rayleigh number, Ra=œÅgŒ±ŒîTD3/Œ∫Œ∑1, with ice density œÅ=920 kg/m3, gravity g, coefficient of thermal expansion Œ±=1.56x10-4 (Tb/250 K) [21], temperature difference between the surface and base of the ice shell ŒîT=Tb-Ts, ice shell thickness D, thermal diffusivity Œ∫=1.47x10-6(250 K/Tb)2 [21], and Œ∑1 is the basal viscosity. Values for Ts, Tb, and g are varied depending on the satellite. We vary the ice shell thickness between ~10 and 100 km, consistent with ice shell thickness estimates for each of the satellites.  We use a temperature dependent Newtonian rheology for ice, Œ∑=Œ∑0exp(-Œ≥T), where Œ≥=Œ∏/ŒîT, and Œ∏=ln(ŒîŒ∑), where ŒîŒ∑ is the ratio between the viscosity at the surface of the ice shell and its base.  We use Œ∑1=6x1014 Pa s, close to the melting point viscosity of ice for a nominal grain size d=0.3 mm [10]. The simplest way of mimicking the effect of a low yield stress is to limit the viscosity of the near 2427.pdf

surface ice [10]; sluggish lid behavior occurs for ŒîŒ∑ < 104 to 105 [22].  We explore a range of ŒîŒ∑ using simulations performed in an 8x1 two-dimensional Cartesian domain with 1024 x 128 elements, with periodic boundary conditions [19]. After the simulation has reached a statistical steady state, we measure the width of the extensional regions, and the heat flow and strain rate in those regions. Successful simulations are those in which each of these quantities matches the values in Table 1.   Conclusions: Figure 1 illustrates values of Ra and ŒîŒ∑ for which convection creates heat flows, strain rates, and widths of extensional zones similar to those inferred for ridge and trough terrain formation on each satellite. We find that successful simulations occur for ice shells with modest Rayleigh numbers, 105 to 106 and ŒîŒ∑~103 to 104, thus, ridge and trough terrain can be formed in ice shells with relatively low-amplitude convection and modest levels of tidal heating.  An example of the flow field, heat flow, and strain rates in such an ice shell is shown in Figure 2.  Within this relatively narrow range of parameters, conditions are conducive to the formation of Europa's bands, Miranda's coronae, Ganymede's grooved terrain, and Enceladus' extensional provinces and SPT.   Figure 1. Locations of simulations in Ra-ŒîŒ∑ space (circles).  Colored circles show the locations where solid-state convection creates conditions similar to those implied for the formation of (pink) Europa's bands, (blue) Miranda's coronae, (green) Ganymede's grooved terrain, (yellow) extensional zones in Sarandib and CufaLahej planitia on Enceladus, and (gray) the Enceladus SPT. Discussion: Successful simulations are clustered around similar values of ŒîŒ∑, at which the effective yield stress of ice is close to the magnitudes of the daily tidal stresses on each satellite. A crude estimate of the effective yield stress implied by our simulations, ùúé!~ùúÇùúÄ~10 to 100 kPa, is factor of 10 to 100 lower than the laboratorydetermined yield stress for ice. Yet daily tidal stresses of this magnitude are known to control eruptions from Enceladus' SPT [23], and may control activity of Europa's putative polar eruptions [24].    Figure 2. Temperature (top), heat flow (bottom, black line), and strain rate (bottom, red line) in the ice shell of Europa or Ganymede, with Ra=105 and ŒîŒ∑=103.5 (pink/yellow/green point in Figure 1).  Strain rates and heat flows in extensional regions are consistent with the formation of Europa's bands and Ganymede's grooved terrain; a similar pattern (in a thicker ice shell) could create ridges and troughs in the northern plains of Enceladus. A number of mechanisms might explain the discrepancy between strong laboratory ice and the weak surfaces of icy satellites, analogous to the processes that reduce crustal yield strength on the Earth, permitting plate tectonics [25]. Tidal flexing and fatigue of surface ice during tidal resonance may increase the length and density of microcracks. Another possibility is that tidal dissipation may focus on the top of warm upwellings and progressively reduce the local elastic thickness, allowing convection to reach the surface.  Here, we have confined our numerical investigation to two dimensions, however, three-dimensional simulations are required to see if the planform matches that observed [e.g., 5].  Because the magnitude of daily tidal stresses and convective stresses are similar, it is likely that these stresses interact to determine the planform and location of ridge and trough terrain.    Surface weakening mechanisms and the control of planform by tides might be expected on any satellite that has experienced significant tidal flexing over its history.  This could explain why all tidally flexed icy bodies show evidence of ridge-and-trough terrain.     Acknowledgements: This work is supported by NASA OPR NNX12AL22G.
