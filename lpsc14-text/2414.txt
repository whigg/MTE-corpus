Introduction: Terrestrial impact craters constitute the most explicit evidence of our planet‚Äôs violent history, and also provide a unique setting in which the detailed effects of impact processes on geologic materials can be studied.  However, on Earth, craters are quickly destroyed through weathering, burial, and tectonic removal [1]. This leads to a strong deficiency in the number of craters. It is possible to match the Earth‚Äôs current impactor flux using estimates of crater densities old terrain, but such estimates are regional in nature and really only probe into the last ~450 Myr of geologic history [2]. As such, Earth‚Äôs ancient impact cratering history cannot be reconstructed through studies of crater density, and instead must be inferred from dynamical models and studies of neighboring objects. Here we attempt to determine the maximum number of surviving terrestrial craters by combining astronomical and dynamical estimates of impactor flux with the radiometrically determined age of the Earth‚Äôs crust.  This allows us to estimate the expected number of observable craters, based on an assumed bombardment history for the entire surface of the Earth, and demonstrates a systematic insensitivity between the terrestrial cratering record and ancient changes in the impactor flux. This method is independent of, and complementary to, canonical studies of the geologic cratering record. Methods: The surface of the Earth is predominantly composed of oceanic crust that, due to tectonic recycling, has a relatively short lifetime with an average age of 65 Mya [3].  Continental crust is considerably older, with a radiometrically determined average age of ~2 Gyr [4-5].  By combining detailed studies of these ages, we can estimate the probability that a crater of a given age will survive until today (Figure 1).  This estimate should be regarded as a maximum, as it is based solely on the age of the crust, and neglects weathering, burial, and other effects that may obscure or destroy a crater [1]. We concentrate on very large terrestrial craters, those with diameters larger than 85 km for two reasons.  First, the time required to destroy or obscure a crater beyond recognition is directly proportional to the size of the crater itself [1].  A crater with an initial diameter of ~90 km should survive for ~3 Gyr, a period similar to the age of the oldest terrestrial continental crust (Figure 1).  We focus on these large craters to minimize size dependent effects, which we do not take into account.  Additionally, craters of this size are expected to produce global layers of ejecta [6], which may be found in the geologic record regardless of the location or preservation state of the source crater.   Figure 1: The maximum probability that a crater will survive to present day is plotted as a function of when the impact occurs. The probability is equal to the fraction of the Earth‚Äôs crust that is of a given age [3-5].  This calculation assumes the thickness of the continental crust has been roughly constant in time, and that any given impact strikes a random point on the Earth.  To estimate the size of impactor necessary to create a crater larger than 85 km diameter, we use craterscaling relations [7].  For a typical scenario with impact velocity ùë£ = 20 km s-1 [8] and incidence angle ùúÉ = 45 degrees, an impactor of ~7.4 km diameter is required to form a crater of diameter 85 km on Earth.  Near earth object observations [9] suggest that the probability of impact by such a body is ~1.4√ó10!! yr1.  There is still some debate as to whether or not this value has been fairly constant over the last 3 Gyr [10], or if the impactor flux has been steadily declining from nearly double its present value ~2-3 Gya [11,8]. Results: Using both of the above scenarios (constant and steadily decreasing impactor fluxes), we can calculate the total number of expected craters younger than a given age.  For a constant impactor flux, we estimate there should be a total of  49 ¬± 7 impacts capable of creating craters 85+ km in diameter in the past 3.5 Gyr.  For the scenario of a steadily decreasing impactor flux [8] this number increases significantly to 113 ¬† ¬± 11.  Our error estimates are based on Poisson ( ùëÅ) statistics.   0 1 2 3 400.20.40.60.81Time of impact (Gyr ago)Maximimum probability of survival  oldest surviving oceanic crust2414.pdf

 Figure 2: The solid black curve is the maximum total number of craters younger than a given age that might survive until the current day assuming a constant impactor flux of 1.4√ó10!! yr-1. We create this curve by integrating the product of probability shown in Figure 1 and the constant impactor flux of 1.4√ó10!! yr-1 through time. The solid blue curve is the maximum total number of craters younger than a given age that may survive until the current day assuming a steadily decreasing flux [8]. We create this curve by integrating the product of probability shown in Figure 1 and the flux from [8] through time. The points on the solid blue and black curves are at integer values and the associated error bars are calculated assuming Poisson statistics (ie. ùëÅ). The red curve and the points on it represent the observed cumulative number of impacts younger than a given age based on the Earth Impact Database (http://www.passc.net/EarthImpactDatabase/).  We then convolve the above numbers with the probability of survival shown in Figure 1.  The result is an estimate of the number of craters greater than 85 km diameter expected to survive to today, globally (Figure 2).For the scenario of a constant impactor flux, only 8 ¬± 3 of the 49 ¬± 7 total craters are expected to exist today.  For a steadily decreasing flux, only 11 ¬± 3 of the 113 ¬± 11 are expected to survive.  Even though the decreasing flux scenario is expected to produce more than twice the number of expected craters as the constant flux scenario, curves describing the number of surviving craters are indistinguishable from one another at the 1-ùúé confidence interval.  This result shows that the current terrestrial cratering record is quite insensitive to ancient changes in the impactor flux rate.  This insensitivity, which we have quantified, is a result of well understood rapid tectonic removal and recycling of crust, which leads to a strong bias towards younger ages. To date, the impact cratering community has identified 6 terrestrial craters with diameters greater than 85 km.  This number lies within or near to the errors expected from our extremely conservative estimate of maximum number of surviving craters [Figure 2].  This suggests that we have now identified most, if not all, of the very large terrestrial craters with diameters 85 km and greater that remain on Earth today. Discussion: The original motivation behind this work stemmed from a desire for a quantitative understanding of the differences between the Earth‚Äôs distal ejecta layer record and its crater record.  Large enough impacts are capable of forming detectable global layers of millimeter scale previously molten droplets called spherules [12-13].  These layers, of which 23 have been identified, can serve as a proxy from which the size and velocity of the source impactor can be estimated [14].  Each of the 6 observed craters shown in Figure 2 has been associated with a spherule layer [1516].  The discrepancy between the number of large craters on Earth and the number of spherule layers found to date can be explained by the crater erasure quantified here, which does not apply to global ejecta layers. We can compare our estimates of maximum number of surviving smaller craters (<85 km) to the observed number, and find a large deficit in observed small craters. Assuming this deficit is not caused by observational biases, we may be able to estimate the rate at which smaller craters are destroyed by other processes, not considered here, and how this destruction rate depends on crater size.
