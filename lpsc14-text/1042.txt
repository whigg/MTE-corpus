STUDY OF THE ASTEROID 1998 QE2.  A. Q. Vodniza1 and M. R. Pereira2, 1University of Narino Observatory, Narino,  Colombia,  aquijanov@gmail.com,  2University  of  Narino  Observatory,  Narino,  Colombia, mariorojaspereira@yahoo.com.     Abstract: This big asteroid was at 5.8 millions of kilometers from the Earth on May 31 (2013) and it has a diameter of 2.7 km. The radar images obtained by JPL showed that the period of rotation around its axis is close to five hours. Hills. K (2013) reported that the period is of 5.281 +/- 0.002 hours. On June 4 the team of Goldstone-Arecibo found a period of 4.75 +/- 0.01 hours.  We also contributed  with the  light  and  phase curves to estimate the period by means of the telescope (with red filter). The radar imagery (JPL and Arecibo) revealed that 1998 QE2 has a moon, and we captured a mutual event (eclipse). From our Observatory, located in Pasto-Colombia, we  captured  several  pictures,  videos  and  astrometry data during several days. Our data was published by the Minor Planet Center (MPC) and also appears at the web  page  of  NEODyS.  The pictures  of  the  asteroid were  captured  with  the  following  equipment:  CGE PRO  1400  CELESTRON  (f/11  Schmidt-Cassegrain Telescope) and STL-1001 SBIG camera. We obtained the light curve of the body. Astrometry was carried out, and we calculated the orbital elements     Introduction: After having processed adequately all  the  photographies  (bias  reduction,  dark  frames correction and correction of flat frames), we employed the software “The Sky6” and the “CcdSoft-Version 5” in order to identify the stars appearing on the images, so we could have the coordinates of any standard star. It is necessary to use many reference stars so we can have a higher precision on determining the asteroid's coordinates. The asteroid is identified superposing the photos  and  designing  a  small  video  to  appreciate clearly enough its movement with regard to the fixed stars.     Summary  And  Conclusions: We  obtained  the following orbital parameters: eccentricity = 0.5692181, semi-major axis = 2.41104631 A.U, orbital inclination =  12.82771 deg,  longitude  of  the  ascending  node  = 250.16876 deg,  argument  of  perihelion  =  345.61328 deg,  mean  motion  =  0.26326658  deg/d,  perihelion distance  =  1.03863508  A.U,  aphelion  distance  = 3.78345755 A.U. The asteroid has an orbital period of 3.74 years  The parameters  were calculated based on 191  observations  (2013  May:  17-24)  with  mean residual = 0.162 arcseconds. A video  of  the  asteroid  from  our  Observatory  was published  on  the  main  page  of  the “SPACEWEATHER” web:http://www.spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&day=21&month=05&year=2013       Acknowledgements: The  autors  would  like  to thank  to:  Dr.  Alessondra  Springmann  (Arecibo Observatory),  Dr.  Petr  Pravec  (Czech  Republic),  Dr. Lance  Benner  (JPL),  Dr.  Carl  Hergenrother  (Target Asteroids  Team),  and  Dr.  Dolores  Hill  (Target Asteroids Team) for their special suggestions.1042.pdf
