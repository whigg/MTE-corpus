Introduction: The Mineralogy Mapper (MinMap) has been proposed in response to the Mars 2020 Announcement of Opportunity to undertake comprehensive investigations into (1) the mineral record of past habitability, (2) that record's context of geologic history, and (3) its biosignature preservation potential. This investigation could provide the essential information to select the suite of samples for caching.  MinMap is a compact, mast-mounted imaging spectrometer that operates at visible/short-wave infrared (VSWIR) wavelengths from 500-2560 nm. VSWIR imaging spectroscopy on Mars has been proven by OMEGA [1] and CRISM [2] to effectively detect minerals indicative of past water on Mars. OMEGA and CRISM [2,3] observations of mineralogy are critical in the selection of the 2020 landing site: having the same capability on the rover would ensure that materials identified from orbit are collected by the rover. MinMap minimizes the time needed to identify locations for contact science and sample caching. Because MinMap is an imaging spectrometer, no ground-in-the-loop targeting is required to find geologically interesting materials. This differs from a point spectrometer which requires the rover to return images in order to ensure that it targets rocks/outcrop rather than aeolian material. MinMap maps mineralogy of large areas rapidly (a 360° panorama in ~78 minutes). Its spatial sampling (10 cm at ~70 m) allows for identification of sampling sites from long range. Onboard generation of mineral indicator maps [4,5] shrinks the data volume for decisional data to ~5 Mbits per sol, making MinMap ideal for a low data volume mission. MinMap accelerates sample collection to help the Mars 2020 Mission achieve its objective to identify and cache 31 samples.  Developed jointly by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), MinMap combines the experience of both in VSWIR imaging spectroscopy. The JPL-built M3 (on Chandrayan-1) [6] and APL-built CRISM (on MRO) are the design basis for MinMap. Implementation risk is reduced by JPL and NASA investments in the Ultra Compact Imaging Spectrometer (UCIS, Fig. 1a) [7,8,9,10]. A MinMap prototype, UCIS has demonstrated required performance in terrestrial field campaigns (Fig. 1b). Onboard data reduction is achieved by implementing a simplified version of CRISM's data pipeline in an internal processor (Figs. 1c,1d).   Figure 1: The M3-based optomechanical design and focal plane, which have been prototyped and field-tested (a), provide highly uniform data that can be accurately calibrated using onboard measurements (b). Onboard real-time processing in CRISM-derived electronics process the data into lowvolume summary products which are downlinked to Earth (c). Hyperspectral data are stored in MinMap 128-Gb internal memory and highpriority regions are queried for downlink and detailed analysis (d). 2037.pdf

 Figure 2:  MinMap mast-mounted Sensor.  Instrument Description: MinMap hardware includes a mast-mounted Sensor (Fig. 2) consisting of an M3-based VSWIR imaging spectrometer (identical to UCIS), a scene selector, microcooler, and focal plane electronics. A CRISMbased Data Processing Unit (DPU) resides in the rover body. The fundamental measurement is a 30.2º × 30.2º hyperspectral image cube. The RSM (remote sensing mast) of the rover is used only for coarse FOV positioning for each cube; MinMap images each cube using internal scan capability. MinMap collects panoramic measurements, enhanced-SNR "targeted" measurements, and calibration measurements to compensate for atmospheric effects.  Onboard Calibration and Data Processing: Onboard implementation of the CRISM and M3 calibration pipeline equips MinMap to generate low-volume spectral "summary products" [4,5]. Downlinked daily, these guide mission operations planning and inform decisions about which windows of hyperspectral to downlink from DPU memory to achieve MinMap objectives. A rotating scene selector combines scene scanning, calibration and shutter functions (Figure 3). Four positions are available: Mars data collection and  three for calibration (closed, to measure instrument backgrounds; opal-glass diffuser, to provide incident signal flat-field levels; and neutral density filter, used monthly to monitor absolute calibration by looking at the Sun). Each image cube is processed to I/F* (atmospherically compensated I/F) and summary products in near-real time while the following image cube is being acquired. Diffuser observations are the radiometric reference, and also "divide out" pixel-to-pixel detector variations. The 30 most useful summary products are coded in macros, and 2 × 2 pixel-binned versions of the core set of 12 are downlinked by the end of sol even in the worst-case 15 Mb/day mission.
