Here, we document  the presence of huge boulders inside relatively recent pits on the western side of Arsia Mons on Mars that might have fell from the upper cliff.         Blocks observations:  Figure 1 shows the location where a particularly high concentration of blocks has been found. The elongated pit extends with NNW trend for about 20 km and it reaches a maximum width of about 4-5 km. This is actually part of a fracture system around the western flank of Arsia Mons, terminating to the south with the impressive fractures of Aganippe Fossae. Its depth reaches about  800 m (Fig. 1) so implying an average slope angle of about 12° for the western flank (in the cross section chosen here the eastern flank is steeper, amounting to about 36°).      Figure 1. Location of the investigated pit and westeast MOLA topographic profile  .    Figure 2. The blocks field at the bottom of the pit. The central block, magnified on the right, is indicated with an arrow in Fig. 1. Image HiRISE PSP_009541_1775. Most blocks appear in the center of a wind-generated depression (bottom image).   A blocks field with boulders of different size and surrounded by depressed circular areas appears in the magnified field of the arrow in Fig. 1. The lack of sediment around blocks is probably a consequence of regolith drifting around them by wind action (Figure 2). In the image, the largest block of the whole pit appears (this has been magnified on the right). This block has an elongated shape with large and small axes of 77 m and 42 m, respectively.  Interestingly, the block has its maximum axis parallel to the flank direction, which is consistent with the block rolling on the granular regolith from the upper plateau cliff to its final position. Although a preliminary statistics based on more blocks does not clearly exhibits a preferred block orientation (Fig. 3), the largest blocks do appear as oriented parallel to the pit axis.  Another uncertainty is relative to the the zone of detachment. Because the outcrops of basaltic rocks emerge over the regolith over a wide range of heights, there is no way to exactly know from which height the block detached. Assuming a fall from the top of the western flank, it follows that the block has travelled with a rolling friction coefficient of the order 0.21, which is consistent, albeit on the low side, with measured values for a granular medium [3]. Note that in contrast to sliding friction on a firm material, blocks here are likely to have rolled on poorly cohesive soft granular medium. Because dense blocks ploughs to greater depth  into the  medium, the rolling friction coefficient increases with the density of the block [3] and is likely smaller for low gravity field.  Thus, owing to the  lower gravity on Mars, it is likely that the rolling 2093.pdf

of blocks on the Martian regolith occurrs with smaller friction compared to Earth, which would explain the relatively low observed friction coefficient. The large block of Fig. 2 (as well as some others but not all of them) exhibits a track on its left which might perhaps be the pathway of the rolling block impressed on the regolith; alternatively, they could be ventifacts.    Another interesting information that could be derived from the block size distribution (Fig. 4) consists in a description of the rock mass subdivision. This seems interesting also because of the prevalent rolling motion of the blocks which could minimize successive breakage and subdivision after the initial detachment.    Figure 3. Blocks examined in more detail (red dots in the top figure) and their frequency distribution for the angle between their major axis and the line parallel to the valley axis.         Consequences and further work : Numerous landslides have been identified on Mars [4], many of them in Valles Marineris [5]. Such landslides derive from the extensive failures of perched wallslopes and are often similar, albeit at a different scale, to terrestrial landslides. In our  recent ongoing compilation of Martian landslides of all kinds [6], we  did not identify extensive  rock fall phenomena,  which is somehow surprising considering the commonness of such phenomena on  Earth. The rock falls described here thus represent a rather rare occurrence. The use of very high resolution images like HiRISE, necessary for identification of blocks of the order of 10-100 m certainly plays  a role in such identification, even though it is possible that such falls inside the Arsia Mons pitts are recent and that blocks are destined to rapid burial by aeolian deposits. It is also interesting to note that the region we have studied happens to be in the reach of the front terminus of a major rock glacier [7]. It is not impossible, but difficult to confirm, that some of the blocks found at the bottom of the pit was part of the rock glacier and not from outcrops internal to the pit.  We note another difference of these rock falls compared to those on Earth. While terrestrial blocks are often damaged or fragmented, the soft ground of regolith on Mars has probably buffered the blocks during rolling, thus ensuring their undamaged travel to the bottom of the pit. In addition, owing to the lower gravity field, fall velocities on Mars are 61% smaller compared to Earth for an equivalent sliding profile. For thse reasons, block size distribution (Fig. 4) is likely representative of the fracturing of the outcrops.    Figure 4. Frequency of major and minor block axes length  References: [1] Giani, G.P.
