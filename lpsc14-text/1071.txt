Introduction:  Impact gardening by continual meteoroid bombardment mixes local planetary regolith vertically and provides foreign material laterally, which informs provenance analysis. Experiments [1,2], and spectral observations [3] indicate that during ejecta emplacement, regolith mixing is most efficient for distal ejecta deposits (>3 crater radii), especially in crater rays, where it is mostly (up to 80%) re-worked local (secondary) material rather than foreign (primary) crater material excavated from the source crater. For the bulk of ejecta deposited within 3 crater radii, the amount of mixing between primary and secondary cratering is not as well understood [e.g., 2], and could contribute to the more extensive lateral sources of material observed spectrally in the lunar regolith [4,5,6]. Of specific interest here for aiding geomorphic, geochemical, and provenance interpretation is the degree of ejecta erosive efficiency (ratio of eroded mass/projectile mass) at various distances from the impact site and the ejecta's corresponding Froude (Fr) numbers, Fr = 3.22gr/v 2, which is the ratio between gravitational and inertial forces [e.g. 2,3]. Preliminary numerical investigations were of insufficient resolution and possessed some simplifications which limited their usefulness in quantifying the erosive efficiency of ejecta during its emplacement and run out [e.g. 7]. We therefore have constructed and begun initial experiments at APL of a catapult [8,9,10,11] which physically models a portion of ejecta curtain and its resulting depositional effects (Fig.1).  Fig. 1. Experimental setup with 2 kg gravel (ejecta simulant) loaded on the cocked catapult. Pans collect ejecta for mass distribution measurement. A sheet collects excess ejecta downrange of our area of interest of the continuous-discontinuous ejecta regime.  Here we report on 1) the velocity distribution along the curtain; 2) the mass distribution along the curtain; and 3) the change in grains' momentum during the transition from curtain to deposit. Experimental Setup:  For both velocity profile and mass measurement experiments we fitted the catapult plate with constraining vertical fins (visible in Fig. 1) in order to constrain the curtain's width to fit the catchment targets and to provide a sharp crosssectional view of the ejecta curtain. For velocity profile measurements we used 5 kg of gravel; for mass distribution measurements we used 2 kg. A high speed Vision Research Phantom camera (1200 fps) recorded the side view of ejecta in flight and during emplacement for both velocity and mass measurement experiments. A consumer-grade video camera (400 fps) looked uprange toward the catapult and provided views on gravel sliding on the catapult during firing (e.g. Fig. 3). We used the particle tracking MATLAB code PIVlab [12] to find bulk velocity & deceleration distributions (Fig. 2 middle and bottom) from high speed video frames. Preliminary Results:  1. Velocity distribution:  Fig. 2 shows a typical side view of an ejecta profile.   Fig. 2. Top: High-speed video still of the ejecta curtain & deposit moving left to right. Note the kink ~1/3 of the way up from incidental uneven loading of the gravel on the catapult plate. While not ideal, this may simulate the effects of stratigraphy in planetary targets. Middle: Ejecta profile. The curtain profile is the upper right branch. The "dynamic deposit"—which has been deposited but still has forward momentum—is the horizontal branch left of center. Arrows depict bouncing of ejecta and continued flow. Average curtain speed = 4.0 m/s; average dynamic deposit speed is 1.8 m/s. Curtain momentum loss = 55%; curtain translational kinetic energy loss = 79%. The angle between the curtain and target is 38.6˚. (Shot 130716_N01, frames 269-270.) Bottom: Curtain velocity profile. The outlier 1/3 of the way up corresponds with the curtain's kink. The general profile is reminiscent of terrestrial sediment gravity flows (i.e. turbidity currents).  2. Mass distribution:  During the launch of the catapult, the loaded gravel column slides along the catapult's plate resulting in a stretching of the gravel column and therefore the mass distribution. Depending on the launch speed, the column can stretch by ~40-80% (Fig. 3). Five ejecta catchment containers (bread pans) placed downrange along the direction of ejecta emplacement allowed for measuring the ejecta mass distribution at the moment of emplacement (Fig. 4). The pans collected the lower ~80% of the initial 2 kg ejecta curtain (Fig. 5).  Fig. 3. Still frames of catapult launch. Left: Pre-launch, cocked position. Right: Fired position. Gravel column stretches (here, 41%) from sliding.  3. Momentum Change:  Upon initial deposition on the wooden stage from the curtain, the bulk grain flow loses, on average, ~55% of its initial momentum and therefore ~80% of its translational kinetic energy. This transferred energy is therefore available to cause erosion and/or continued bouncing and sliding of the ejecta until coming to a rest. These results were calculated from data such as Fig. 2.  Fig. 4. Simulated 2 kg ejecta curtain (top) depositing into discrete catchment containers (bread pans) in bottom frame.   Fig. 5. The ejecta curtain loses mass to the deposit following a roughly linear relationship, at least for the proximal ejecta deposit. The non-linear final point may indicate transition from the continuous to discontinuous ejecta regime. Discussion, Conclusion, and Future Work:  The ejecta curtain's velocity distribution [e.g. 11] and angle to the surface are similar to natural ejecta curtains and so provide confidence to the analogy between our experimental setup and mobile ejecta in nature. Taken together with previous ejecta erosional investigations [11], we believe the catapult accurately simulates the transitional regime between the continuous to discontinuous ejecta deposits. Early results indicate a high potential for landscape erosion via ejecta emplacement and run out. Future work will involve measuring the maximum normal stress imparted to the target surface during ejecta deposition and run out; refined measurement of momentum and translational kinetic energy changes; and erosional efficiency on gravel targets and the ability to exhume versus bury material. These results will enable refined interpretation of natural ejectas, especially regarding ejecta's roll in regolith gardening, production, and the provenance of current and future lunar, asteroidal, and planetary samples.
