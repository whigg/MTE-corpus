Introduction: EH chondrites experienced gas-solid sulfidation reactions that resulted in the partial re-placement of ferromagnesian silicates by silica, niningerite, troilite, and oldhamite [1-5]. The strongest evidence for these reactions comes from a subset of EH3 ferromagnesian chondrules that contain assemblages of cristobalite, porous S-rich silica, niningerite, and troilite replacing olivine and pyroxene (Fig. 1) [4]. Thermodynamic analysis of the likely sulfidation reactions inferred from the mineralogy of the sulfidized chondrules points to their occurrence during transient heating events in a H-depleted, S- and dust-enriched environment [4,6,7], with the fS2 buffered by the Fe-FeS assemblage [8,9] and redox conditions on the order of log fO2 IW-6. Here we present observations of Fe-metal and chromite exsolving out of olivine was been partly replaced by pyroxene, silica, niningerite, and troilite. The phase relations among the Fe-metal, chromite, and olivine constrain the redox conditions of silicate sulfidation.   Methods: A partly sulfidized chondrule from EH3 Sahara 97072 was studied using petrographic microscopy. Chemical mapping and EDS analyses were performed with an FEI XL-30 FEG SEM. A TEM section was extracted from dusty olivine using a focused-ion beam (FIB) from an FEI NOVA dual-source SEM. TEM, STEM, EDS, EELS, and SAED were performed using standard JEOL 2010F, 2000, and 4000 transmission electron microscopes plus a JEOL ARM aberration-corrected microscope. EDS data were quantified using the Cliff-Lorimer thin-film approximation with theoretical k-factors. For analysis of phase equilibria we used the GRAINS code and its thermodynamic database [10]. All solid solutions were treated as ideal. Petrographic observations:  The partly sulfidized chondrule (Fig. 1) has sharp boundaries with the matrix. The outer two thirds of this chondrule, occurs as a sulfide-free, mantle consisting of subhedral enstatite grains and interstitial mesostasis of crystalline silica, albite, and albitic glass. The chondrule interior contains a large opaque dusty olivine megacryst (Figs. 1A, B) that has been partly replaced by pyroxene, niningerite, troilite, and porous silica.  Toward the chondrule center, the olivine contains sub-micron Fe-metal grains (Fig. 1C). The pyroxene that partly replaces the olivine contains even smaller Fe-metal grains within SiO2-enriched melt inclusions (not shown).TEM observations: The olivine, nearly pure end-member forsterite, contains euhedral-to-subhedral Fe metal blebs and picrochromite, nearly pure MgCr2O4, along the [100] olivine direction (Pnma setting) (Fig. 2A). Most Fe metal grains contain Cr. The picrochromite occurs as fine lamellae that apparently cross-cut metal grains, suggesting that the picrochromite exsolved first. HRTEM imaging indicates the picrochromite is associated with amorphous silica. Phase equilibria: To constrain conditions and determine the sequence of chromite and metal exsolution from olivine we considered reactions among the Cr, Fe, and Mg end-members of olivine (Cr0.005Fe0.005Mg0.99O4), the Cr and Fe end-members of metal (Cr0.01Fe0.99) and pure MgCr2O4 as a function of temperature and fO2. The results are plotted in Fig. 3 along with the phase boundary for the reaction of olivine sulfidation buffered by the Fe-FeS assemblage [4].  The upper limit of fS2, evaluated from the reaction Cr(ss) + 0.5 S2(g) = CrS(ss), suggests that the preservation of metallic Cr requires fS2 many orders of magnitude lower than the values buffered by the Fe-FeS assemblage, indicating physical isolation of the metal in solid olivine.Discussion: Figure 3 suggests that exsolution of both picrochromite and metal from olivine occurs at high temperatures but under different redox conditions. The exsolution of picrochromite suggests that the chondrule was annealed under oxidizing conditions, perhaps during the formation of the mantle. The subsequent interaction of the chondrule with a more reducing environment resulted in exsolution of Cr-bearing metal. Whether the exsolution of this metal that was sealed within the olivine and pyroxene was contemporaneous with the olivine sulfidation is difficult to assess with certainty. It is possible that the fO2 and fS2 were high enough to sulfidize olivine but not orthopyroxene (Fig. 3). Conclusions: The exsolution of picrochromite, and Fe metal, from olivine that has been partly replaced by pyroxene, niningerite and silica suggests that the chondrule experienced heating above 1700 K in an environment with variable redox conditions changing from log fO2  IW-2 to -7.
