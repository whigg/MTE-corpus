Introduction: The Australasian (AA) tektite strewn field covers more than 10% of the Earth’s surface [1]. This areal distribution, together with the size of individual tektites (up to ~25 kg) and total recovered mass, indicates that the AA “strewn field–forming event” produced several orders of magnitude more tektites than other tektite-forming events (i.e., Bosumtwi, Ries, Chesapeake Bay). Despite indications for the location of the impact site near the Indochina peninsula [2], the young age of ~0.8 Ma [3], and an estimated crater size between 20 and 100 km Ø [4,5], no AA tektite related impact structure has been identified so far.  Therefore, other scenarios, such as a low-altitude airburst of an intercepting comet, were suggested to have formed the AA tektites to explain the missing impact structure [6]. Wasson [6] referred to the absence of a projectile-related signature in the AA tektites as strong support for his scenario. In contrast to an impact cratering event, a low-altitude airburst does not involve direct contact between the projectile and the solid surface and does not provide the conditions to efficiently mix projectile and target materials.   So far, a projectile-related signature in tektites has only been unambiguously identified in few Ivory Coast specimens ejected from the Bosumtwi crater by rhenium-osmium and Cr isotope systematics [7,8]. We report the identification of a projectile-induced signature in AA tektites.   Methods: Portable X-ray fluorescence (P-XRF): Major and trace element contents without prior sample preparation were determined using a portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (P-XRF; Tracer Turbo SD, Bruker). The Ag-anode X-ray tube was operated at 40 kV and 22 µA. A Cu 75 µm/ Ti 25 µm /Al 200 µm primary filter was used to improve the peak-tobackground ratios and X-rays signals were collected with a 30 mm² silicon drift-detector. The concentrations were determined via external calibration using pressed wax-tablets prepared from international reference rock powders. The limits of quantification (LOQ) are systematically below the concentration range of the elements in the samples (e.g., LOQ for Cr = 10 µg/g; Ni = 5 µg/g, Rb = 0.5 µg/g; µg/g = ppm). A total of 90 samples from various collections were measured and these samples were returned to the collection in their original condition. A few samples were selected for further totally destructive analysis. NiS fire assay pre-concentration combined with ICPMS: Following the method of [10,11], a selection of samples was analyzed for their PGE and Au contents using a nickel sulfide fire assay pre-concentration technique combined with ICP-MS at Ghent University.  This combined approach allowed screening of valuable sample collections to select the most Ni- and Crrich specimens for the identification of a projectilerelated PGE signature, as siderophile elements are significantly more abundant in most meteorites compared to crustal rocks [9]. Numerical models of impact cratering: The 3D hydrocode SOVA [12] complemented by the ANEOS equation of state for geological materials [13] is used to model a high-velocity oblique impact. Tracer particles are used to quantify the amount of ejected material, its depth of origin, maximum shock compression, and its ejection velocity. Molten (shock compression > 60 GPa) materials ejected with velocities > 2 km/s are considered to be possible tektites.  Results from sample work: A first screening of the samples allowed to make the distinction between AA tektites with low Ni content of <50 µg/g (similar to the average composition of the continental crust [14]) and those enriched in Ni and Cr, with Ni concentrations between 100 and up to 340 µg/g.  To further characterize the source of the Ni- and Cr-rich component, PGE concentrations and ratios were determined. The Ni and Cr enrichments in the tektites are related to an increase in the PGE concentrations. The Cr versus Ir concentrations in the tektites fall within or close to the “mixing field” of terrestrial rocks and chondritic material (Fig. 1). The Cr/Ir trend follows a mixing trend between continental crust and chondrite-like material, but at the same time indicates unusually high Cr/Ir ratios. 2222.pdf

Fig. 1. Double-logarithmic plot of the Cr versus Ir concentrations. The Cr/Ir ratios found in the tektites are not within the range of terrestrial rocks (Earth), but are compatible with the admixture of extraterrestrial material to the continental crust. For a detailed description of this plot, see [9].  Discussion: The high Ni and Cr concentrations in AA tektites were first recognized 75 years ago [15] and subsequently confirmed in [16]. However, a terrestrial source was suggested in both publications. For example, [16] discarded a meteoritic origin, because the Ni/Cr ratios in chondrites vary between ~ 2 and 7 (see [17] and references therein), while the AA tektites display variable Ni/Cr ratios scattering around a ratio of 1 [16,18,19, and this work]. In these studies, PGE analysis was either not performed or the analyzed samples did not show clear PGE enrichments. However, the PGE abundances and element patterns determined for a restricted population of tektites with more than 150 ppm Ni in this study clearly allow the identification of an extraterrestrial component, and show that the highest projectile contaminations occur in the most Ni enriched samples.  Target/projectile mixing: Identification of a projectile component in the tektites attests to efficient targetprojectile mixing process during the AA tektite forming event. This strongly supports the hypothesis that the AA strewn field was formed as the result of a crater-forming event, not a “grazing” projectile. Resolving the target-projectile mixing process with numerical models is analytically changing, because at standard spatial resolution (20-30 cells per projectile radius in 3D), mixing is not revealed [5]. However, high-resolution models (500 cells per radius in 2D) show a growth of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities at the projectile/target boundary immediately after the impact, when both materials are still at high pressure (Fig. 2).   Conclusions: Target-projectile mixing processes were identified in the Ni-rich AA tektites and studied by high-resolution numerical models. Our results strongly argue that the AA tektite related crater was formed ~0.8 Ma ago. In addition, we show that the Ni concentrations in these tektites can be used as a proxy to trace the fate of the projectile using a nondestructive analytical technique.     Fig. 2. Numerical model of a 1-km-diameter projectile impact at 18 km/s and 30° to horizon. The color plate (low resolution model) shows the projectile (green) and the target (gray with colorful layers at various depths) without any mixing. The plate on the lower left is an enlarged image of a black rectangular at the projectile/target contact at much higher resolution. Shades of gray correspond to material densities. The green line represents the boundary between target/projectile materials. The two upper plates show this boundary at earlier time moments and the development of KHIs.
