ESTIMATING EROSION RATES ON EARTH FROM THE NUMBER OF IMPACTCRATERS. S. Hergarten1, S. Bonitz1, and T. Kenkmann1, 1Institut fu¨r Geo- und Umweltnaturwissenschaften, Albert-Ludwigs-Universita¨t Freiburg i. Br., GermanyIntroduction: The repository of impact craterson Earth is incomplete due to erosion. Therefore,very few regions on Earth are suitable for estimatingthe crater production rate directly from the numberof recognized craters, and even the perhaps mostelaborate approach of this type [1] is exposed to aconsiderable uncertainty. The alternative approachto estimate the crater production rate on Earthuses the well-known lunar crater production rate[2]. Rescaling this rate according to the differentescaping velocities of Earth and Moon and takinginto account the effects of the atmosphere results inhigher estimates of the production rate [3].In this paper we address the opposite question.Knowing that the crater record on Earth is affectedby erosion almost everywhere, we attempt to estimate erosion rates on a regional scale from theincompleteness of the crater inventory.Method: In order to arrive at a method thatcan easily be applied on a regional scale, we introduce the following simplifying assumptions: (i) Theconsidered region has been exposed to a constanterosion rate r over a long time, so that a longterm equilibrium between the production of newcraters and their consumption by erosion has beenachieved. (ii) A crater is recognized as long as thetotal erosion since its production does not exceedits depth H. In this sense, depth is defined asthe depth (relative to the original surface) downto which shock effects allow an unequivocal affirmation of the crater. We further assume that thisdepth only depends on the crater diameter D, sothat the crater production rate can be transferredfrom diameters to depths.In the following we derive an equation for the expected number Nd(D) of detectable craters with adiameter greater than or equal to D per unit areaunder a given erosion rate r. Due to our first assumption, the lifetime τ of a crater of diameter Disτ(D) =H(D)r(1)where H(D) is the depth corresponding to this diameter.Let N˙(D) be the crater production rate, i. e., thenumber of craters with a size greater than or equalto D per unit area and time. Deviating from theliterature we use N˙ instead of N in order to clarify that it is a rate (per area) and to distinguishit from Nv which is is a number (per area). Thecorresponding frequency density is −N˙ ′(D), wherethe prime denotes the derivative with respect to D.Then the number of detectable craters with a diameter greater than or equal to D per unit area isNd(D) =∞∫D−N˙ ′(u) τ(u) du (2)=1r∞∫D−N˙ ′(u)H(u) du = I(D)r(3)where the integralI(D) =∞∫D−N˙ ′(u)H(u) du (4)only depends on the minimum considered crater diameter D. According to Eq. 3, the expected numberof craters with a diameter greater than or equal toD in a given region of area A isnd = ANd(D) =AI(D)r. (5)The ratior =AI(D)n(6)is the maximum-likelihood estimate of the longterm erosion rate if n craters are found in the considered region.The error range of the estimated erosion rate isas important as the value itself. The uncertaintyarising from the statistical variation of the impactprocess can be quantified using confidence intervals.If n craters were found, a lower bound rmin can bedefined by the condition that more than n cratersshould occur at an erosion rate rmin with a givenprobability c, the so-called (one-sided) confidencelevel. In return, and upper bound rmax can bedefined by the condition that less than n cratersshould occur at rmax with the probability c.As the number of craters follows a Poisson distribution with an expected value given by Eq. 5, theprobability of finding k craters at an erosion rate rispk(r) =nkdk!e−nd =(AIr)kk!exp(−AIr)(7)1351.pdf

The confidence interval is then given by the conditions∞∑k=n+1pk(rmin) =n−1∑k=0pk(rmax) = c. (8)Application: Computing the integral given byEq. 4 requires a function N˙(D) for the crater production and a function H(D) for the crater depths.As the production function suggested by Bland andArtemieva [3] extends to smaller crater sizes andseems to be more reliable at intermediate cratersizes than the one suggested by Hughes [1], this oneis used in the following.Relatively little is known about H, the depth oferosion down to which a crater remains detectableby means of shock effects. For simple craters (D ≤3 km) we used a linear fit for the true crater depth [4]and assumed that shock features are present downto a depth of 0.07 times the true depth beneath theautochthonous crater floor in agreement with experimental results. For complex crater structures(D > 3 km) we approximated a linear trend betweenD andH from data of deeply eroded or drilledimpact structures such as Upheaval Dome, Siljan,Puchezh-Katunki, and the Vredefort Dome:H(D) ={0.307D D ≤ 3 km0.07D + 0.71 kmforD > 3 km(9)Figure 1 shows the result obtained by numerical integration where the tabulated values of N˙(D)from [3] were interpolated by piecewise power-lawfunctions.Using small values of the minimum crater diameter D taken into account increases the number ofTable 1: Maximum-likelihood estimates and 95 %confidence intervals (one-sided) for the erosion ratesin the three considered regionsRegion CP QC YCA [km2] 337000 1542056 720000n 2 9 1r [mmyr] 0.015 0.015 0.065rmin [mmyr] 0.005 0.009 0.014rmax [mmyr] 0.085 0.030 1.26craters and thus reduces the statistical errors. However, D must not be too small in order to ensurethat the inventory of the craters which have notbeen consumed by erosion is complete. We therefore use D = 1 km in the following. For this valuewe obtain I(D) = 9.0× 10−8 mmyr km2 .Results and Discussion: Table 1 gives the results of applying our method to three regions: TheColorado Plateau (CP), Quebec (QC), and the Yilgarn Craton (YC) in south western Australia.Due to the small number of craters, the errorranges are rather large and probably exceed the potential systematic errors arising from our choice ofthe functions N˙(D) and H(D). The relatively narrowest 95 % confidence interval (Quebec, 9 craters)amounts to about half a decade, while the widest(Yilgarn Craton, 1 crater) spans two decades.Reference values for long-term erosion rates areavailable for two of the three regions. For the Colorado Plateau, a rate of 0.028 mmyr was estimated [5],while values from 0.01 to 0.025 mmyr were obtained inthe crystalline terranes of south western Australia[6]. The value for the Colorado Plateau falls wellinto our 95 % confidence interval, while those of SWAustralia are at its lower edge.In summary, our approach provides a simplemethod to estimate long-term erosion rates on a regional scale from data which are already available.Potential sources of systematical errors beyondthose discussed above are sedimentation phases insedimentary rocks and a bias in the delineation ofthe region due to the knowledge on existing craters.References: Hughes, D.
