Introduction: The surface of Mercury is dominated by several types of plains deposits (as defined by early geological mappers [e.g., 1]): smooth, intermediate, and intercrater plains. Smooth plains are morphologically distinct from the other two plains units and are primarily volcanic in origin [e.g., 2-4]. Intercrater plains are characterized by a high areal density of impact craters for a given range of crater diameters and therefore a greater age, an abundance of secondary craters, and a hummocky texture. Intermediate plains have a density of impact craters between those of intercrater plains and smooth plains. As a result, intermediate plains have a wide range in morphology and crater size-frequency distribution. Typically, intermediate plains are densely cratered and are morphologically more similar to intercrater plains than to smooth plains. However, unlike the case for smooth plains, the origin of intercrater and intermediate plains is still not well determined. Two endmember hypotheses for ancient plains formation have been proposed: (1) formation from fluidized impact ejecta [e.g., 5, 6], and (2) formation as volcanic deposits [e.g., 7, 8]. Here we evaluate these two formation hypotheses to determine the extent to which volcanism was an important process early in Mercury's geologic history. Methods: To assess the origin of intercrater plains, we use MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) data to analyze the morphology, spectral properties, crater statistics, and topography of intercrater and intermediate plains mapped as such on the basis of Mariner 10 data [e.g., 1]. A 250 m/pixel Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS) mosaic provided the basis for morphologic analyses and determination of crater size-frequency distributions in 10 areas of detailed study (five areas of intercrater plains and five areas of intermediate plains). Spectral information for each study region was taken from MDIS color images [9]. In addition, stereophotogrammetric data from MDIS images [10, 11] were used for topographic analysis. From the data collected we then remapped a portion of the surface of Mercury that contains seven of the ten study regions (Fig. 1).  Results:  The higher resolution of the MESSENGER datasets compared with those of Mariner 10 enable a better characterization of the most ancient plains units on Mercury. The intercrater plains unit is densely cratered at diameters <10 km, producing a highly textured surface that yields ancient ages (preTolstojan and Tolstojan, >3.9 Ga [12]). There is no clear correlation with topography; intercrater plains cover high-standing plateaus and continue into topographic depressions. This result suggests either that the intercrater plains formation process must have been able to act over an elevation range of several kilometers (supporting an impact-related origin), or that plains formed generally flat-lying surfaces (supporting an origin either as fluidized ejecta or lava) but were subsequently uplifted, lowered, or tilted to varying degrees [e.g., 13, 14]. In the areas mapped, the intermediate plains units defined at Mariner 10 data resolution apFigure 1. Geologic map constructed using the unit identification criteria developed in this study. The region is located to the east of the Caloris impact basin. Study regions, numbered by terrain type, are identified by red (intercrater plains, ICP) and blue (intermediate plains, IP) squares that outline the images at right.

Black regions on the geologic map are Caloris interior plains.  pear to be a combination of older intercrater plains units and younger smooth plains deposits, rather than a morphologically distinctive unit.  Discussion: The improved resolution and coverage of MESSENGER MDIS data and our geologic map (Fig. 1) have permitted detailed analysis of the additive effect of secondary craters on smooth plains. Secondary crater fields are extensive and can heavily modify the surface proximal to the impact crater. Young volcanically emplaced smooth plains, such as the northern smooth plains [15], can quickly develop an intercrater plains-like texture within a small area from multiple near-contemporaneous impacts (Fig. 2). This evolution from a smooth to an intercrater plains morphology can occur with as few as two nearby younger impact craters. The overlap of secondary craters from craters Gaudí and Stieglitz (Fig. 2) created intercrater plains textures in the otherwise smooth northern plains. Smooth volcanic plains could have been emplaced throughout the early history of Mercury but later modified by proximal superposed impact craters. During the early history of Mercury, when cratering rates were relatively high [e.g., 16, 17], it would thus have been possible to convert a deposit of smooth volcanic plains to intercrater plains within a short time interval, rendering difficult the modern identification of ancient volcanic deposits.  Predicted extents of continuous and secondary ejecta deposits on Mercury [e.g., 18] indicate that the visible influence of ejecta deposits does not exceed two crater radii from the crater rim. Recent analysis of impact deposits on the Moon shows that the majority of smooth plains deposits of impact origin occur at ~2 to 4 basin radii from prominent basin rings [19]. Differences in surface gravitational acceleration, impact velocity, and target rheology between the Moon and Mercury, of course, affect cratering efficiency and ejecta emplacement. Mercury's higher gravitational acceleration reduces the spatial extent of ejecta deposits compared with those on the Moon [e.g., 18]. Therefore, basin ejecta deposits on Mercury are likely to pond in terrain closer to the basin rim than 2 4 basin radii. Comparison of the distribution of intercrater plains with basin locations indicates that these plains are more widely dispersed than would be predicted by this rule of thumb, so not all intercrater plains can be distal basin ejecta deposits.  Additionally, individual impact crater deposits are small and discontinuous, making it difficult to resurface large portions of the crust. If impact-produced smooth plains deposits did form on Mercury, then the deposits should be observed around young basins. Yet, these types of deposits are not readily seen. Instead, young basins tend to be surrounded by extensive and continuous smooth plains deposits [e.g., 4]. Comparison of intercrater plains units we investigated with the distribution of known impact basins therefore indicates that the formation of intercrater plains is likely to have been dominated by volcanic processes.  Conclusions: We find that intercrater plains on Mercury are a highly textured unit with an abundance of secondary craters, whereas the intermediate plains unit is composed of a combination of intercrater and smooth plains. We suggest that the term "intermediate plains" should no longer be used in the construction of geologic maps of the surface of Mercury, but instead, this unit should be subdivided into its constituent intercrater and smooth plains units. On the basis of the distribution of intercrater plains and stratigraphic relationships between secondary craters and smooth plains we argue that the majority of the intercrater plains were emplaced volcanically.
