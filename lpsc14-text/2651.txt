REPRODUCIBILITY OF ION PROBE OXYGEN ISOTOPE MEASUREMENTS IN STARDUSTCOMETARY SAMPLES R. C. Ogliore1, Z. Gainsforth2, G. R. Huss1, K. Nagashima1, A. J. Westphal2,1Hawai'i Institute of Geophysics and Planetology, University of Hawai'i at Ma¯noa, Honolulu, HI 96822, USA,2Space Sciences Laboratory, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.IntroductionThe accuracy of ion probe measurements can be reduced by various systematic errors caused by, for example, sample topography or conductivity, changes inthe primary beam or secondary ion optics, or variableelectron-multiplier efficiency. The magnitude of thesesystematic errors in ion probe measurements of oxygen isotopes can be large compared to the per-mil levelprecision needed to address cosmochemical questionsin the returned samples from comet Wild 2. For example, FeO-poor ferromagnesian Wild 2 particles cluster at∆17O = -2h which is lower than the -1.5h to +2.5hrange of FeO-rich particles [1], and a type II Stardustchondrule fragment showed slightly heavy O composition along the terrestrial fractionation line [2]. It istherefore necessary to prove that systematic errors in ionprobe measurements of small Stardust grains are smallcompared to the statistical error of the measurement andcan safely be ignored.Many types of systematic errors in ion probe analyses can be quantified by measurements of known andhomogenous isotope standards which are prepared andmounted analogous to the unknown. Repeated measurements of standards before and after the unknown can beused to estimate systematic errors caused by, for example, drifts in electron-multiplier efficiencies.Sample topography and location as well as differences in charging between sample and standard, on theother hand, produce unpredictable electric-field variations which can be significant [3] and cannot be quantified with measurements of the standard during the measurement session. To quantify these systematic errors,it is necessary to measure the same sample in more thanone measurement session. However, the small size ofStardust samples and difficult sample preparation makesthis challenging.With the UH Cameca ims 1280 ion probe, we remeasured the O isotopic composition of grains measured previously [4, 2] to investigate the contribution ofsystematic uncertainties between measurement sessionsseparated by years.MethodsWe have developed a reversible sample-preparationtechnique for small Stardust cometary particles inpotted butts for SIMS analysis [5]. This techniqueallows us to measure the same particle by SIMS morethan once at different depths. Our technique to measurefine-grained cometary material in the bulb of Stardusttracks [4] only consumes a small portion of the grains,so the remaining sample can be removed by FIB forreanalysis.The type II chondrule fragment Iris (23×10×15µm)from Stardust Track C2052,2,74 was measured for oxygen isotopes [2], microtomed, and remounted for SIMSanalysis. We measured the same olivine grains for Oisotopes using similar analytical conditions as the firstmeasurement: 25-30 pA Cs+ primary beam focused toa ∼2 µm spot, multicollection of O isotopes with 16Oon a Faraday cup and 17O, 18O on electron multipliers,∼5500 mass-resolving power for 17O− to minimize thecontribution of the 16OH− interference on 17O−. Wecorrected our measurement for any shift seen betweenthe center and ring in an analogously prepared mount ofSan Carlos olivine. The microtomed faces of Iris beforethe first and second isotope measurement is shown inFigure 1. It is unlikely that the olivine grains in Iris areisotopically zoned—the O isotopic composition of Irisolivine should be the same at all depths.Figure 1: Left: The exposed face of Iris in a pottedbutt before the first SIMS measurement of O isotopes.Ol=olivine, Cr=chromite, M=mesostasis, In=indium(embedding), E=epoxy (embedding). Right: Iris afterfurther microtoming, before the second SIMS measurement of O isotopes.Two Fe-rich ∼1-µm grains in the wall of StardustTrack C2052,2,74 were measured to have high ∆17Ocompositions [4]. We removed a slice of the compressedaerogel containing these particles and others by FIBand placed the slice on gold foil, exposing the particles for additional ion probe analysis (Figure 2). Weobtained isotope maps of three oxygen isotopes, 16OH,and 56Fe16O of cometary material in this FIB slice, us2651.pdf

TEM analysis of the FIB slice showed thesegrains to be mostly amorphous.ResultsOur previous O isotope measurement of an Iris olivinewas δ17O=4.6±2.3, δ18O=7.2±1.6 (2σ uncertainties).Analyses of other olivines in Iris showed that they allhave similar O composition. Our measurement of anolivine grain in the re-microtomed potted butt of Irisis δ17O=4.4±3.1, δ18O=6.3±2.4, consistent with thefirst measurement made 2.5 years prior (Figure 3). Uncertainties were slightly larger in our second measurement due to slightly worse reproducibility of the standard measurements.Our previous measurements of small grains from thebulb wall of track C2052,2,74 showed a wide range ofO isotopic compositions, with two grains showing highvalues of∆17O. Measurements of four particles in a removed FIB slice generally confirmed the results of ourfirst measurement, as shown in Figure 4.ConclusionsWe remeasured different faces of previously measuredStardust cometary grains in order to understand the contribution of systematic uncertainties that may arise indifferent measurement sessions. No significant systematic uncertainties were seen in the potted butt measurement of a large terminal fragment.

These results indicate that future measurements of Stardust samples prepared and measured in asimilar fashion are not likely to be significantly compromised by systematic uncertainties.References: [1] D.
