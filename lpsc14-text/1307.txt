Introduction: Signatures of deformation on the Martian surface are classified into various genetic types [1]. In the Thaumasia Planum (TP) of Mars, an E-W trending rift, ~200km long, between Melas Dorsa on the west and Lassell crater on the east has been interpreted as a combination of transpressive structure to the east and transtensive to the west [2] and also as a product of two deformation phases; a dextral strike-slip faulting during formation of N-S trending wrinkle ridges (WR) followed by extensional deformation with sinistral slip component. Transpressive structures are absent in the east. These opposing opinions invite further thoughts, may be simpler ones, in proposing explanation of evolution of the rift in conformity with the tectonic evolution of the Thaumasia region.            Figure 1:  MOLA elevation map of the area of study. E-W and N-S bars are lines of sections across WRs and across the rift respectively. Δh values are elevation offsets across the WRs due (E)ast or (W)est. Red dots are locations of branching of WRs Geology of the Area and Formation of Thaumasia Planum: The Tharsis region in the southern hemisphere of Mars is a museum of spectacular topographic features. The plana region shows a gradual eastward slope and consists of a series of arcuate WRs and linear fracture zones oblique to the ridges at high angles.  The TP is suggested to have been formed either by intrusion and extrusion of basaltic magma followed by compressional deformation [4] or by a concomitant rise of Tharsis along with formation WRs and rifts [5] in Late Noachian to Late Hesperian or by a late Noachian-early Hesperian thick-skinned tectonics followed by late Hesperian-Amazonian thin skinned tectonics [6], [7]. It is also proposed as a part of a gravity driven slide above a salt layer acting as the detachment fault [2]. These studies therefore, reflect that the TP has been initiated by intrusion or extrusion of basaltic magma which thereafter have been subjected to diastrophism dominantly by a stress regime, where the principal stress is horizontal. The rift in question: TP consists of a series of WRs, between the Valles Marineris on the north and the Thaumasia Highlands on the south, which are described as features formed by thrusts and related folds and the region may be considered as a fold-andthrust belt (FTB). The SE-ward convexity of the all the WRs in general can be regarded as a first order salient of the FTB which may be an expression of change in transport vectors, thickness and geometry of the formations of rocks in the foreland of the thrust belt, shape of the indenter if any or any combination of these [8], [9], [10], [11]. Within the TP, branching of WRs indicate presence of splays (Fig. 1). MOLA profiles  processed through J-Mars), [12] (Fig. 2a) show elevation offsets on the west of some WRs and on the east of others, indicating that some thrusts are dipping eastward while some are dipping westward [13], [14],. These facts suggest that the FTB formation cannot be explained by a simple SE-ward in-sequence thrusting while backthrusting and out-of-sequence thrusting must be taken into consideration c.f. [9].           Figure 2: (a) Profiles across the WRs in Figure 1. Colors of the profiles match with corresponding colors of section lines in Figure 1, (b) Profiles across the rift shown in Figure 1. Colors and numbers matched with the corresponding section lines in Figure 1. The TP consists a series of rifts cross-cutting the WRs. The competing explanations of the structural characteristics and development of the longest rift, mentioned in 'Introduction' are mostly based on plan view of the rift and its relations with WRs, also in plan. Close observations reveal that the number of WRs terminating at the rift on its north differs from that on its south which makes it difficult to identify the continuity of individual WRs across the rift. It is also difficult to decipher any active strike-slip along the rift as variable senses of apparent horizontal offsets of the WRs are seen along the rift (Fig. 1). Moreover, the difference in positions of elevation offsets of the WRs increases the difficulty to establish the continuity of the WRs across the rift and in turn to identify the horizontal separations along the rift (Fig. 2a). Crosssections drawn across the rift (Fig. 2b) shows shallow dip (5 to 10o) of the rift walls which cannot be used as reflections of any extensional or strike-slip faults as suggested earlier [3]. In this region of extensive thrust faulting the principal compressive stress must had been horizontal with an E-W trend which should not have either supported formation of E-W trending extensional faults requiring a vertical compressive stress or even E-W strike-slip which would require ENE or ESE trending horizontal compressive stress and vertical intermediate stress. Geometry of profiles of the WRs as well as the magnitudes of elevation offsets (Fig. 1, 2a) often differ on two sides of the rift indicating difference in fold geometry and in shortening along strike of the WRs [15], [16], [17]. Such variations along trends of thrust fault facilitate formation of lateral and oblique ramps which are often expressed as  transverse zones or tear faults (Fig. 3) (showing apparent strike-slip) across FTBs [18] and have several earth analogs (e.g. central Himalaya, [19]; Trailigill Transverse zone in Moine Thrust Belt, [20]). Presence of any pre-thrusting weak zone might have favoured and guided the formation of the tear fault [3].             Figure 3: Schematic diagram showing development of tear fault. Discussion: We propose that the E-W trending rift that apparently displaces several WRs in the TP is possibly an expression of a tear fault which was formed either due to variations in geometry of blind thrusts and related folds in the WRs and/or due to variations in shortening along the faults. The location of tear faulting might be guided by a pre-existing weak zone. Our model on the formation of such a rift by tearing assumes a single progressive stress regime operative for over millions of years through Late Noachian-Late Hesperian. Such a deformation resulted in the formation of the FTB of variable landform heights on either side of the tear fault as the two blocks move independently, but in the same direction.
