EXOPLANET HABITABILITY: EFFECTS OF PLANETESIMAL CARBON CHEMISTRY.   Torrence V. Johnson1, Olivier Mousis2, Jonathan I. Lunine3 and N.

The C/O ratio is particularly important in determining the refractory (silicate and metal) to volatile ice ratio in material condensed beyond the snow line [2, 3], . As a result, exoplanet systems for host stars with C/O greater than the solar value may have planetesimals with very little or no water ice [4].  In addition, for more carbon-rich stars (C/O >~0.8) refractory material in the inner part of the systems might be dominated by carbides rather than silicates [2,5].  We have estimated the composition of volatile and refractory material in extrasolar planetesimals using a set of stars with a wide range of measured C/O abundances [6-9].  The volatile ice content of planetesimals in these systems varies significantly with C/O, controlled primarily by the availability of O for H2O ice condensation. Systems with C/O less than the solar value (C/O = 0.55) should have very water ice rich planetesimals, while water ice mass fraction decreases rapidly with increasing C/O until only ices of CO and CO2 are left in significant proportions [10]. Effects of C/O and solid carbon phases:  Another significant factor for planetesimal composition is the amount of carbon that may be tied up in solid phases. Studies of astrophysical data for molecular clouds, accretion disks and constraints from solar system compositions suggest that a significant fraction (~0.4-0.70) of the carbon in accretion disks and the early solar nebula may be in refractory carbon-rich grains similar to the CHON particles identified in comets [11].  We investigate the composition of condensates for different stellar C/O values using the value of 0.55 for the fraction of C in CHON grains adopted by Pollack et al. (note that this in only coincidently the same number as the solar C/O ratio).  For an oxidizing nebula, with CO as the dominant carbon-bearing gas, Table 1 shows the planetesimal compositions for several stellar systems investigated in [10], where R/I/C indicates the relative mass fractions of "Rock" (silicate plus metal), "Ice" (water ice), and "Carbon" (CHON).   For the assumed fraction of C in CHON, both carbon and oxygen are removed from the gas phase and the condensates for super-solar C/O values will be water-poor mixtures of silicates and metal, carbon, and carbon-bearing volatile ices, depending on temperature.  For very carbon-rich systems, oxidizing conditions cannot be sustained beyond about C/O=1, due to the oxygen sequestered in solid silicates, oxides and CHON, for refractory C fractions within the Pollack et al. range of 0.4 - 0.7.

Thus one the key chemical ingredients for habitability may be in short supply in carbon-rich, oxygen-poor systems even if planets exist in the 'habitable zone', see Figure 2.  1438.pdf

   Figure 2: This artist's concept illustrates the fate of two different planets: the one on the left is similar to Earth, made up largely of silicate-based rocks with oceans coating its surface. The one on the right is rich in carbon -- and dry. Chances are low that life as we know it, which requires liquid water, would thrive under such barren conditions.
