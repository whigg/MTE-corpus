Introduction: Accurate knowledge of the coordinates of spacecraft and spacecraft impact craters is critical for placing scientific and engineering observations into their proper geologic and geophysical context as well as completing the historic record of past trips to the Moon.  From high-resolution Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) images (pixel scales of 0.25 to 1.5 m/pixel) we located hardware and craters of both past and current lunar missions. To date, we identified all successful robotic soft landers (Surveyor, Luna, Chang'e 3) except for the first two Soviet landers (Luna 9 and Luna 13), which are very small relative to the NAC pixel scale and have poorly-constrained landing coordinates. We also identified the two GRAIL impact sites, four Ranger and four Apollo Saturn-IVB impact sites, the Luna 23 crash site, and three rovers (Lunokhod 1 and 2, and Chang'e 3 Yutu). The locations of crewed Apollo Lunar Module (LM) descent stages, Lunar Roving Vehicles (LRV), and science instruments were also identified in NAC images. Historical Background: Prior identifications of anthropogenic targets were made from Apollo era photography, radio tracking, and laser ranging [1]. The latter method requires a laser reflector, of which five were placed on the Moon during the first era of lunar exploration (Apollos 11, 14, 15 and Lunokhods 1 and 2). The laser ranging results in the most accurate positional information (±3 cm in X, Y, and Z [2], although the conversion to the Mean Earth latitude/longitude reference frame is only defined to meter level accuracy [3]), and we use the five retroreflector sites as accuracy benchmarks for the LROC derived coordinates. Historic coordinates for many anthropogenic targets were summarized in [1] and were used as starting points for locating the landing and impact sites in NAC images. Davies and Colvin [4] refined estimates of Apollo equipment based on laser ranging at three of the six landing sites, radio tracking of ALSEP radio signals (interferometry) that gave the distances between the ALSEP central stations, and photogrammetry of surface photos to derive the relative and absolute positions of the LMs and other equipment. This work expands on previous efforts to locate anthropogenic sites in NAC images [5,6] with additional sites and an improved camera pointing model. Methods: The center of each piece of hardware (or impact crater) was manually located in each image in which it is visible, and the line and sample within the unprojected image are recorded. Each image was then initialized using the USGS Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers (ISIS) [7], attaching the appropriate spacecraft position and pointing information (NAIF SPICE [8]), using a spherical shapemodel with a radius based on the best available elevation for the object of interest (Table 1). The ISIS CamPt routine was used to compute the latitude and longitude from the line and sample of the object of interest. Where multiple objects appear in the same image, the image was re-initialized with a different radius for each object. The spacecraft position was provided by Spacecraft Position Kernels (SPKs) improved by LOLA cross-over analysis and the GRAIL gravity model, with an uncertainty of ±10 meters [9]. The camera pointing was provided by temperaturecorrected C-matrix Kernels (CKs) [10].   Figure 1. Point spread for the Surveyor 3 lander.  Yellow dot is derived location, red dots are projected locations from 40 individual images.  Background image is M175428601R.  The five retroreflector experiments landed on the Moon provide increased accuracy at some sites, as their relative positions are known from Earth-based laser ranging experiments to centimeter level accuracy, and their absolute positions are known to meter level accuracy [3]. For non-retroreflector objects at sites with a retroreflector in the same image, the process differs slightly to take advantage of the added infor mation of having a high-accuracy reference point [6]. At these locations, after image initialization, the camera pointing is adjusted using the DeltaCK routine of ISIS, which updates the cross-track and down-track components of the camera pointing to align the image with a known point. This process restricts the usable images at these sites to only those where the retroreflector is visible, and reduces the variation in calculated hardware positions by about a factor of 5 (Table 1). The coordinates for each object were averaged from almost all images of the objects for which LOLAcorrected SPKs exist. Excluded images are those with slew angles greater than 60° from nadir, and two images which give coordinates more than 50 m from the average (cause unknown).  The coordinates for the recent Chang'e 3 lander are a special case. Due to the recent arrival of that spacecraft, cross-over corrected SPKs are not currently available for images that contain the lander and rover, so we used post-landing images to identify the landing position in pre-landing images, and derived the coordinates from the "prior" images [11]. Discussion: For the retoreflector sites, the positions we calculated without controlling to the actual retroreflector position differ from the measured position [2,3] by at most 4.3 m (average 2.8 m), which is well within the standard deviation of the individual image coordinates at each site. Since the cluster of calculated points is similarly tight at all locations (Figure 1), not just those with retroreflectors, it is reasonable to assume that the absolute positional accuracy is similar at all locations, and not an artifact from the retroreflectors being used to calibrate the camera pointing [10]. The number of decimal places in Table 1 was chosen to give ~3 m accuracy at the equator. References: [1] Roncoli, R. (2005), JPL D-32296. [2] Murphy, T. W. et al. (2010), Icarus, 211, 11031108.
