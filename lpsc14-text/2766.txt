Introduction: Following their discovery by the Cassini spacecraft, mountain ridge belts on Titan have been reported to have a tectonic origin [1-5]. However, the cause of tectonism and the tectonic evolutionary history still remain unclear. In this study, (1) we analyzed the distribution and orientation of ridge belts to reveal their global tectonic pattern, and (2) we compared the location of the ridge belts to a new global topographic map [6] to explore the connections between elevation and tectonism and their implications for Titan’s tectonic history.    Global Structural Mapping: We mapped radarbright ridges as tectonic units and traced the strike of individual ridges across Titan using 350 m-resolution SAR images (Fig. 1a). Ridge orientations, which are length-weighted by dividing segments of constant orientation into 1 km intervals, are plotted in 30o latitude interval bands (Fig. 1b) and are found in both equatorial and polar regions to be east-west. Notably, in three latitude bands from 30o N to 60o S, rose diagrams highlight two dominant orientations (90o and 115o azimuth direction); other regions, including polar regions, only show one dominant orientation (90o azimuth direction), which suggests  ridges in equatorial regions have the same tectonic pattern. To examine the global ridge distribution, we used ridge density (RD) = Total mapped ridge length/SAR coverage areas (unit: 1 km/100 km2) (Figure 1b). The highest RD is  between 30o N and 60o S, which suggests that ridges tend to concentrate at the equator rather than the poles. A possible mechanism is global contraction, described in Beuthe (2010) [7], which allows thrust faults striking E-W to preferentially form in the equatorial region. Elevation Distribution: A new topographic map [6] allows us to examine the correlation between elevation and ridge belts (Fig. 2). We sorted the ridges into elevation bins of 100 m, ranging from -1500 m to 500 m, where the the zero elevation is the 2575 km radius sphere, and compared it with a histogram of Titan’s global topography [8] (Fig. 3). The distribution of  ridges is skewed toward higher elevations. The median elevation of ridges  is about 350 m higher than the median elevation on Titan. This suggests that ridge belts  preferentially lie at higher elevations. To investigate this correlation, we used a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (KS test) which serves as goodness-of-fit technique and tests whether two  onedimensional probability distributions differ [9]. Here,  the null hypothesis is that the elevations of Titan’s ridges have been drawn at random from the distribution function for Titan’s global topography. We tested two datasets: Titan’s topography and Titan’s ridge elevations. The test results are statistic D = 0.325, and p value = 0.02. Thus, the null hypothesis can be rejected with 95% confidence, confirming the conclusion that ridge belts lie at higher elevations. Implications for tectonic evolutionary history: Based on their global distribution and orientations,  ridge belts with a 90o azimuth direction are common globally, with an additional 115o orientation in equatorial regions. This implies that there may have been at least two tectonic events with different stress orientations in Titan’s history. The tectonic activities were more intense near equatorial regions. As for the observation that ridge belts preferentially lie at higher elevations, we explore several scenarios that could explain this correlation: (1) Scenario 1 - contraction: Contraction is capable of building ridges on higher elevation and thickening the lithosphere, which is consistent with the observation that most of Earth’s mountains lie in contractional regions with higher elevation. (2) Scenario 2 - cryovolcanism: A convective upwelling or plume is also capable of building ridges at higher elevation. However, topographic ridges related to upwelling plumes are typically extensional features, such as rifts, broad topographic rises, and radial fractures which have not been identified on Titan. In addition, convective upwelling might be related to partial melting. (3) Scenario 3 - fluvial erosion Fluvial erosion can create ridges between valleys as seen in the lowlands near Titan’s poles. However, pure fluvial erosion would not create  ridges with consistent linear E-W orientations as observed nor explain the location of ridges at higher elevations. In addition, fluvial erosion is not capable of eliminating the ridges [10]. (4) Scenario 4 - fluvial sedimentation  Fluvial sedimentation is cabaple of burying ridges in lowlands but  sedimentation would not create  ridges with consistent linear E-W orientations. (5) Scenario 5 - aeolian infill        The abundance of ridges at high elevation could be 2766.pdf

the result of burial of a global population by aeolian sediment in lower elevation basins. However, most sand seas lie in equatorial highlands.  Conclusions: Overall, the most reasonable interpretation is that contractional tectonism built the ridges and thickened the icy lithosphere causing regional uplift. Other interpretations, such as a upwelling plumes, cryovolcanic rises, fluvial erosion, and aeolian infill, fail to explain all of the observations. Thus, the combination of at least two global and regional tectonic events, likely contractional in nature, plus enhanced fluvial erosion and sedimentation near                                            the poles would contribute to shaping Titan’s tectonic landforms and surface morphology to what we see today.
