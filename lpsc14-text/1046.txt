A NEW PLANET-CLASS:CARBON-SILICATE PLANETS. P. Futó1 1  Department  of  Physical  Geography,University of West Hungary, Szombathely, Károlyi Gáspár tér, H-9700, Hungary (dvision@citromail.hu)Introduction: For  the  case  of  significant  amount  ofsolid C,it may present as a planet building material. Ifthe C/O ratio is below 0.8,Si is in a mineral as SiO4   orSiO2 .At the same time,if the C/O ratio is a higher valuethan  1,carbon-based  minerals  are  the  dominatedmantle-consisting compounds.  Carbon-silicate  planetsare thought to have formed in protoplanetary disks witha C/O ratio 0.8-1.The adequately large carbon-silicateplanets must have metallic cores which are distinct to asolid inner core and an outer core in melted state. Theirupper mantle built up from carbides and silicates. Thecrust  may  contain  silicates,silicon-  and  aluminiumoxides,carbides  and  a  diamond  layer  in  the  deeperzones (sub-crust).The  diagenic  silicates  may exist  various  state  in  theinterior of rocky planets. Thus,carbon substitution foroxygen could occur in complex silicates [1] in case ofthe carbon-rich enviroments at adequate pressure andhigh  temperature.  It  is  possible  that  the  siliconoxycarbides  (which  expressed  by  the  formula  ofSiOxC4-x) can be found in the lower crust and mantle ofcarbon-silicate planets.It  is  also  probably that  carbon is  the most abundantlight element would be a good candidate in the core ofthe carbon-silicate planets. Carbon is in plausible formsof iron carbides as example Fe3C.Fe7C3  [2]  and Fe2C[3]  have been predicted to be stable carbide phase ataround the central pressure of the Earth.Modeled  carbon-silicate  planet  with  Earth-likestructure:My model is built upon the hypothesis forthe  existence  of  the  carbon  planets,constituted  byKuchner and Seager [4].Here I present  a compositionof a  theoretical  low-mass exoplanet  has  formed in aprotoplanetary disc with a C/O ratio is between 0.8 and1.0,calculating C/O =0.9 ratio. The internal structure ofthis planet is modeled as being Earth-like with a greaterC-enrichment  in  its  chemical  composition.Additionally,this refers to a terrestrial planet composedof Fe/Mg silicates and Fe/Ni core,containing relativelyhigh  amounts  of  carbon-based  compounds.  Thecarbon-silicate planet is proposed to be a new type ofterrestrial planets with carbon-rich composition.The modeled planetary core mostly composed of ironalloyed  with 17  wt % nickel  and 3  wt % carbon indifferent  forms  of  iron  carbides  (Fe0.8 Ni0.17 C0.03)covered  by  the  lower  mantle  composed  of  siliconcarbide,silicate-perovskite  MgSiO3 and in the zone oflowermost  mantle:post-perovskite.SiC,TiC,  olivine[(Mg,Fe)2 SiO4]. Wadsleyite and ringwoodite are usedto model the mineral composition of the upper mantle.It  is  necessary  to  take  account  of  other  consistingmaterials  in  the  lower-crust  and  the  mantle  such  assilicon oxycarbides. Vinet equations of state [5,6] havebeen used for the structural modeling.Results:The carbon-silicate planet is calculated to have1.028  R total  radius  and  0.554  R core  radius  asillustrated in Figure.1.The carbon-based minerals andsilicon oxycarbides show lower density than the normalsilicates yielding a slightly larger total radius for thisplanet-type  as  opposed  to  a  silicate  planet  with  thesame  mass  and  internal  structure  ratios.  In  itsatmosphere  and   its  surface/subsurface  zones  themethane  content  is  relatively  high  because  atC/O>0.8,methane becomes more abundant than water[7].Taking into account  that  the detailed composition inthe spherical  shells is  not  known,1-3 % uncertaintiesappear in all interior structure models. For the case ofanalog models with complex composition such as thiscarbon-silicate  planet,the  estimated  uncertainties  canbe higher value:2-5 %.Figure  1.  A  model  is  shown  to  represent  thecomposition for the carbon-silicate planet with radiusparameters  of  its  interior  structure in units of  Earthradius.Summary:In  this  study,I  propose  a  new planet-classcalled  carbon-silicate  planets  for  carbon-richterrestrial-type  planetary  bodies  which  have  massesbetween 0-10 M  .According to our hope,the preciseinstruments  wil  be  capable  to  identify  low-masscarbon-rich exoplanets in the future.References: [1] Sen  S.,Widgeon  S.J.,et  al.
