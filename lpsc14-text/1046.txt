 A NEW PLANET-CLASS:CARBON-SILICATE PLANETS. P. Futó1 1  Department  of  Physical  Geography, University of West Hungary, Szombathely, Károlyi Gáspár tér, H-9700, Hungary (dvision@citromail.hu) Introduction: For  the  case  of  significant  amount  of solid C,it may present as a planet building material. If the C/O ratio is below 0.8,Si is in a mineral as SiO4   or SiO2 .At the same time,if the C/O ratio is a higher value than  1,carbon-based  minerals  are  the  dominated mantle-consisting compounds.  Carbon-silicate  planets are thought to have formed in protoplanetary disks with a C/O ratio 0.8-1.The adequately large carbon-silicate planets must have metallic cores which are distinct to a solid inner core and an outer core in melted state. Their upper mantle built up from carbides and silicates. The crust  may  contain  silicates,silicon-  and  aluminiumoxides,carbides  and  a  diamond  layer  in  the  deeper zones (sub-crust). The  diagenic  silicates  may exist  various  state  in  the interior of rocky planets. Thus,carbon substitution for oxygen could occur in complex silicates [1] in case of the carbon-rich enviroments at adequate pressure and high  temperature.  It  is  possible  that  the  silicon oxycarbides  (which  expressed  by  the  formula  of SiOxC4-x) can be found in the lower crust and mantle of carbon-silicate planets. It  is  also  probably that  carbon is  the most abundant light element would be a good candidate in the core of the carbon-silicate planets. Carbon is in plausible forms of iron carbides as example Fe3C.Fe7C3  [2]  and Fe2C [3]  have been predicted to be stable carbide phase at around the central pressure of the Earth. Modeled  carbon-silicate  planet  with  Earth-like structure:My model is built upon the hypothesis for the  existence  of  the  carbon  planets,constituted  by Kuchner and Seager [4].Here I present  a composition of a  theoretical  low-mass exoplanet  has  formed in a protoplanetary disc with a C/O ratio is between 0.8 and 1.0,calculating C/O =0.9 ratio. The internal structure of this planet is modeled as being Earth-like with a greater C-enrichment  in  its  chemical  composition. Additionally,this refers to a terrestrial planet composed of Fe/Mg silicates and Fe/Ni core,containing relatively high  amounts  of  carbon-based  compounds.  The carbon-silicate planet is proposed to be a new type of terrestrial planets with carbon-rich composition. The modeled planetary core mostly composed of iron alloyed  with 17  wt % nickel  and 3  wt % carbon in different  forms  of  iron  carbides  (Fe0.8 Ni0.17 C0.03) covered  by  the  lower  mantle  composed  of  siliconcarbide,silicate-perovskite  MgSiO3 and in the zone of lowermost  mantle:post-perovskite.SiC,TiC,  olivine [(Mg,Fe)2 SiO4]. Wadsleyite and ringwoodite are used to model the mineral composition of the upper mantle. It  is  necessary  to  take  account  of  other  consisting materials  in  the  lower-crust  and  the  mantle  such  as silicon oxycarbides. Vinet equations of state [5,6] have been used for the structural modeling. Results:The carbon-silicate planet is calculated to have 1.028  R total  radius  and  0.554  R core  radius  as illustrated in Figure.1.The carbon-based minerals and silicon oxycarbides show lower density than the normal silicates yielding a slightly larger total radius for this planet-type  as  opposed  to  a  silicate  planet  with  the same  mass  and  internal  structure  ratios.  In  its atmosphere  and   its  surface/subsurface  zones  the methane  content  is  relatively  high  because  at C/O>0.8,methane becomes more abundant than water [7]. Taking into account  that  the detailed composition in the spherical  shells is  not  known,1-3 % uncertainties appear in all interior structure models. For the case of analog models with complex composition such as this carbon-silicate  planet,the  estimated  uncertainties  can be higher value:2-5 %. Figure  1.  A  model  is  shown  to  represent  the composition for the carbon-silicate planet with radius parameters  of  its  interior  structure in units of  Earthradius. Summary:In  this  study,I  propose  a  new planet-class called  carbon-silicate  planets  for  carbon-rich terrestrial-type  planetary  bodies  which  have  masses between 0-10 M  .According to our hope,the precise instruments  wil  be  capable  to  identify  low-mass carbon-rich exoplanets in the future.
