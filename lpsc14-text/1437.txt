They are important in that they represent lithologies that are older and, in some cases, experienced different parent body histories than their host meteorites. They are either exotic components or originated from different regions of their meteorite parent bodies. In CR chondrites, for example, dark inclusions have been interpreted to be lithologies from the CR parent body as suggested by their oxygen isotope compositions, which are similar to those of CR whole rock and matrix [1,2]. Many dark inclusions have petrologic characteristics that are markedly different from their host chondrites or any of the known chondrite groups, suggesting that they represent asteroids currently unsampled in the meteorite record. The widespread occurrence of these xenoliths in CV, CR, CH and other chondrites as well as in HED meteorites [e.g., 1-5], suggests that they are important components of asteroid regoliths. Thus, DIs can expand the range of known primitive materials and inform us about the nature of asteroidal regoliths. Here we revisit a DI from the Bencubbin CB chondrite. This DI was previously referred to as a carbonaceous chondrite clast with highly deformed chondrules [6-11], although it does not resemble any other known chondrite [11]. Our goal is to better characterize this DI, understand its relationship to known chondrites, and determine if it expands the range of known materials from the asteroid belt. We are particularly interested in its structural features, which appear to resemble “flame” structures in sedimentary rocks, and what it can reveal about asteroidal regolith processes. Results: The DI studied measures 7 x 3mm in thin section. It consists of highly elongated inclusions with a clear preferred orientation (Fig. 1). The inclusions have aspect ratios of ~5:1 [6]. These inclusions were previously referred to as lenses or augen and interpreted to be deformed chondrules [8].  Unusual for a suite of chondrules in a carbonaceous chondrite, they all have essentially identical porphyritic textures consisting of zoned olivine (Fo77-62) phenocrysts and minor low-Ca pyroxene (En72.2) surrounded by a feldspathic glassy mesostasis (Fig. 1). No other chondrule types or Ca-, Al- rich inclusions (CAIs) were found in the DI. TEM studies showed that the olivine phenocrysts have high densities of unrecovered dislocations, interpreted to result from shock [6]. Additionally, some olivine phenocrysts have numerous sub-micron-sized blebs of FeS oriented along crystallographic planes suggesting in situ sulfidation of the Fe in the olivine. The inclusions in the DI are surrounded by a fine-grained (1-2 µm) olivine-sulfide-rich matrix with minor amounts of FeNi metal. Amorphous Fe-oxide material and poorly crystalline silicates with relict layered structures were described in the matrix but no hydrous phyllosilicates were reported [6]. Broad beam electron probe bulk analyses indicate that the inclusions in the DI are all compositionally identical. Thus based on texture, mineralogy and bulk composition, all of the inclusions that constitute the Bencubbin DI are identical and if the Bencubbin DI is a chondrite, it is a chondrite composed of one type of chondrule. Refractory and volatile element abundances of the whole DI were interpreted to be chondritic and intermediate between CO and CM [9] and the oxygen isotopic composition of the whole DI is similar to CM and CR chondrites [12]. Discussion: The bulk composition of the Bencubbin DI suggests that it is chondritic and similar to CM and CO [9]. Its oxygen isotopes are similar to CM and CR [12]. However, it contains only one type of inclusion - chondrules with porphyritic olivine texture - and no other chondrule types or refractory inclusions. Lack of refractory inclusions is unusual for a C chondrite. Also, the porphyritic olivine inclusions are all identical to each other with similar size phenocrysts. Again this differs from C or any type of chondrite, in which each chondrule varies from the next in both texture and grain size. The Bencubbin DI is, therefore, unlike any chondritic material previously described and represents a new type of primitive material. The DI is highly deformed. It has a deformation structure that is reminiscent of flame structures in sedimentary rocks (Fig. 1). Sedimentary structures, such as cross bedding, have been observed in DIs from the Vigarano CV chondrite [3,13]. The cross bedding in one Vigarano DI was interpreted to form from seismic shaking in a regolith environment similar to the ponds described on Asteroid 433 Eros [e.g., 14,15]. 1437.pdf

Flame structures result from deformation in unlithified sediments. The weight of an overlying bed forces an underlying bed to push up through the overlying bed, producing interfingering flame-like protuberances. This generally results when both strata are saturated with water. Flame structures are also interpreted to result when higher-density sand sinks into lowerdensity underlying finer mud, causing the lower density layer to rise upward due to the density inversion (i.e. Rayleigh-Taylor instability) [e.g., 16]. Flame structure can also be the result of shearing due to liquefaction induced by seismic activity [17]. The flame structures in the DI cannot be exactly analogous to terrestrial examples because the DI is from a relatively dry, airless body, so the main mechanism responsible for the structure is likely to be impact-related. We present two hypotheses to explain the structure in the Bencubbin DI. Hypothesis 1: The DI was initially a chondrite with round spherical chondrules surrounded by matrix. Uniaxial impact deformation of the DI resulted in the elongated structures currently observed in the DI and produced the foliation, as shown in Fig. 1. However, the unusual characteristics of this chondrite and its chondrules indicate it must have initially been a new type of primitive material unlike anything in the current meteorite record. Hypothesis 2: The inclusions and matrix in the Bencubbin DI were each layers in a primitive asteroidal regolith. Seismic shaking (possibly in an asteroid pond-like environment) due to impact, may have caused the finer grained overlying regolith to percolate downward into the coarser inclusions. This may have eventually resulted in the mixing of the “chondrules” and “matrix” and forming the interfingering “flame-like” structures preserved in the DI. Further impacts produced further deformation, shearing and foliation. In this scenario, the inclusions (or flames) are not chondrules but instead are remnants of a layer from the parent body regolith. Thus the Bencubbin DI is a new type of primitive material that may preserve evidence of impact-induced sedimentary processes in a primitive asteroid regolith.
