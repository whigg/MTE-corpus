Introduction:  Metallographic cooling rates of many differentiated meteorites have been questioned as they appear totally inconsistent with popular formation models. For example, if IVA irons had cooled in a conventional metallic core beneath a silicate mantle they would have indistinguishable cooling rates. However, cooling rates of IVA irons vary by a factor of ~50 [1] and have been questioned by Wasson and Hoppe [2]. If IIIAB irons cooled in a mantled core with main group pallasites at the core-mantle boundary [3], they would have cooled at very similar rates, contrary to their metallographic cooling rates. Mesosiderites which formed by impact mixing of crustal rocks with metallic Fe-Ni at the surface of their parent asteroid should have cooled quickly. As a result, their metallographic cooling rates, which are the lowest known [4], have also been questioned [5]. Ion probe measurements of Ni/Co ratios at kamacite-taenite interfaces of two IVA irons were used to argue that IVA irons had relatively uniform cooling rates and that metallographic cooling rates were flawed [2]. Here we use electron probe measurements at kamacite-taenite interfaces [6,7] in IVA and IIIAB irons, pallasites and mesosiderites to show that metallographic cooling rates are robust. We argue that conventional ideas about the origins of differentiated meteorites must therefore be modified to include catastrophic effects of very early impacts on differentiated asteroids.        Methods and results:  We studied thick sections of 38 meteorites with well developed Widmanstätten patterns: 13 and 14 iron meteorites from groups IVA and IIIAB, respectively, four group IAB complex irons, and seven stony-iron meteorites including six main group pallasites and one mesosiderite. Quantitative x-ray measurements in kamacite and taenite were carried out using a Cameca SX-50 electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA) operated at 15 kV with a beam current of 40 nA.  The x-ray source size was 0.5 to 1.0 m in diameter. Fe, Ni, Co, and P were measured using wavelength-dispersive spectrometers (WDS) and the xray data were reduced to chemical composition using the PAP phi(z) calculation procedure.  For the measurement of Co, the intensity around the CoK peak was carefully measured in order to obtain the continuum background. We measured the x-ray intensity of Fe, Ni, Co, and P along a line perpendicular to the kamacite-taenite interface in 1 m steps.  For each traverse, we obtained the Ni and Co content of the taenite and kamacite next to the kamacite-taenite interface, from the analysis point with the maximum Ni and minimum Co concentration in taenite (Ni Coand the minimum Ni and maximum Co content in kamacite (NiCo. These measurements were also used to calculate the double ratio Rof Wasson and Hoppe [2].      Values of the maximum Ni content in taenite, Ni, vary from 30.1 to 52.5 wt.% as the metallographic cooling rates decrease about 4 orders of magnitude, >5,000 °C/Myr to ~0.3 °C /Myr (Fig. 1).   Fig. 1. Interface concentrations of Ni in taenite (Ni as measured with the EPMA in three groups of iron meteorites, main-group pallasites, and mesosiderites vs. metallographic cooling  rate [7].         EPMA measurements of Ni, correlate well with metallographic cooling rate (Fig. 1) and can therefore be used to provide estimates of relative cooling rates.  These data are consistent with those of Short and Goldstein [6] who measured Niand Ni in 22 iron and stony iron meteorites using an EPMA operated at 20 keV with a larger x-ray emission region of ~2 m in diameter. The ratios Co/Co and   R(Co/Ni)/(Co/Ni)also correlate with cooling rate, except at low cooling rates.        Discussion:      IVA irons. Our measurements of Ni and Co concentrations at the kamacite-taenite interface in 13 group IVA irons provide robust support for large cooling rate variations. Four parameters, NiNiNi, Co/Co, and their product, Rshow that cooling rates decrease with increasing bulk Ni in group IVA. Using the temperature dependence of the Ni diffusion rate in  we infer from the range of Ni values in IVA that cooling rates decrease by a factor of 100. The other three parameters give factors that are an order of magnitude lower but have larger uncertainties. We therefore emphatically reject the conclusion of Wasson and Hoppe [2] that interface concentrations of Ni and Co in group IVA irons are in any way in conflict with the 60-fold variation in cooling rate [1, 8, 9]. The cooling rates of IVA irons and their correlation with bulk Ni can be understood if they formed in a metallic Fe-Ni body of radius 150±50 km that was initially molten and cooled with <1 km of silicate on the surface following a hitand-run impact [10].      IIIAB irons. The three parameters that provided the best evidence for systematic cooling rate variations with bulk Ni in group IVA are not correlated significantly with bulk Ni in IIIAB. This is entirely consistent with the much smaller variation of metallographic cooling rate in IIIAB compared to IVA (factors of 6 and 60, respectively) and our precision, as group IVA irons with bulk Ni concentrations of >8.4% Ni, which also have a six-fold variation in their cooling rates, do not show significant variations in their NiNiNi/Ni and Co/Co Our data for IIIAB irons show that they cooled significantly faster than the main-group pallasites and could not have been derived from a single body that was only recently destroyed [11]. We infer that the parent bodies of IIIAB irons and main group pallasites were disassembled by early grazing impacts with larger bodies [12].       Mesosiderites: Our data on the kamacite-taenite interface compositions provide four parameters, NiNiNi/Ni Co/Cothat show that mesosiderites cooled slower than any other meteorite. The metallographic cooling rate of 0.2-0.5 °C/Myr is consistent with that derived by Bogard and Garrison [13] from their Ar-Ar age determinations of ~0.2 °C/Myr.  We infer that mesosiderites formed very early when basalts were crystallizing by a low velocity head-on impact of a near-naked molten core, and that they cooled slowly under many km of regolith on a Vesta-sized body.       Summary: Our kamacite-taenite interface compositions provide additional support for the metallographic cooling rates, like the cloudy taenite particle sizes (Fig. 2) and tetrataenite widths [7, 9].     Fig. 2  Cloudy zone particle size vs measured metallographic cooling rate of four groups of iron meteorites, main-group pallasites, H chondrites, and mesosiderites.       Stony-iron meteorites and irons with silicate inclusions cooled slower than irons derived from cores because early hit-and-run impacts destroyed all fully differentiated asteroids except Vesta. Impacts that separated core and mantle material generated irons that cooled quickly like IIIAB and IVA irons. Other impacts that mixed metal and silicate together generated meteorites that cooled slowly.      References:  [1] Yang J. et al. (2007) Nature 446, 888. [2] Wasson J. T. and Hoppe P.
