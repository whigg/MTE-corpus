Introduction: The observed leading-trailing hemisphere asymmetry in impact crater density on Ganymede is far weaker than that predicted by crater bombardment models. We explore polar wander of a floating ice shell as a possible explanation. Due to the latitude dependence of absorbed solar radiation, the surface temperature at Ganymede's poles is much less than that at the equator. We calculate the resulting ice thickness variations, assuming a conductive, elastic floating ice shell in equilibrium with interior radiogenic heat production. We find pole-equator thickness differences of up to 15 km at 4 Ga, and greater at later times. Through effects on the principal moments of inertia, such thickness variations may cause the shell to become unstable with respect to the rotation axis. We find that the degree-2 thickness variations are sufficient to destabilize Ganymede's ancient shell for any reasonable values of the relevant parameters. Similar arguments apply to Callisto. The Conundrum:  Dynamical calculations show that cratering by heliocentric (sun-orbiting) bodies occurs preferentially on the leading hemisphere of a synchronously orbiting satellite and at overall higher velocities [1,2]. Thus, the apex (the center of the leading hemisphere) should show a substantially higher crater density than the antapex (the center of the trailing hemisphere): for Ganymede, ~15-40 times higher. The observed crater density at Ganymede's apex of motion is, however, at most only ~4 times that at the antapex (for bright terrain) [2]. Several explanations have been proposed: 1) the surface may be saturated or nearly saturated with craters; 2) a large fraction of the craters may have been made by planetocentric debris or some other unknown source, rather than heliocentric comets or asteroids [3]; 3) the satellite may have had its tidal axes exchange as a result of the momentum impulse from a very large impact [4]; or 4) the ice shell may have rotated nonsynchronously during geologic time [2]. In this work, we explore a form of nonsynchronous rotation: polar wander due to insolationdriven thickness variations in the ice shell [5,6,7]. Stability of a Cooling Ice Shell:  Surface temperature is a strong function of latitude on Ganymede, and can be easily calculated under the assumption of radiative balance [6]. The variation of surface temperature with latitude today and at 4 Ga are shown in Fig. 1, assuming a Bond albedo of 0.35 [8] and a faint young  Figure 1.

Assuming a purely conductive ice shell, we calculate the ice shell thickness assuming a pure water ocean below and steady state heat flow due to the decay of U, Th, and 40K. The calculated pole-to-equator ice shell thickness contrast is substantial throughout Ganymede's history, varying from 16 km to a theoretical maximum of 72 km. Shell thickness maxima are even more sharply peaked at the poles than in the europan case [6], because we do not include any counteracting (polar) tidal heating. Such thickness variations, especially for lower heat flows, are almost certainly overestimated (due, e.g., to convective heat transport in thicker shells), but Fig. 1 illustrates the potential magnitude of the driving phenomenon. We focus here on early-time, thinner shells, the epoch in which the majority of preserved impacts on Ganymede occurred. We explore the effect of the shell thickness variations on the moment-of-inertia tensor. Rotational stability requires that the maximum moment-of-inertia be aligned parallel to the rotation axis, so because Iyy > Ixx (due to the tidal distortion of Ganymede by Jupiter), Ganymede's ice shell will be unstable due to excess polar ice when and if ΔI  =  Iyy - Izz  >  0, where Izz , Ixx and Iyy are the principal moments about the rotation, tidal, and intermediate axes.   To clarify: simply adding excess mass to the base of a rigid ice shell at its rotation poles, in effect replacing denser oceanic water below, enhances the rotational stability of the shell. Isostatic adjustment causes the thicker, polar shell to rise, however, which causes  the shell to become top heavy at the poles and potentially attitude unstable [6]. And if we were simply adding excess mass to the poles of an otherwise strengthless shell or mantle (in the manner of Goldreich and Toomre's famous beetles [9]), we would expect the "beetles" (2 in this case) to ultimately end up on the tidal, a-axis, which could be interesting from a tectonic perspective but irrelevant to the apex-antapex cratering question. Ganymede's ice shell possesses a finite rigidity, however, which means it already should have a measure of attitude stability in its spin-locked tidal state. Adding excess mass at the poles will not necessarily undo that, but if enough excess mass is added, say, by an approach to thermal equilibrium (Fig. 1), then Iyy - Izz will switch sign from negative to positive before Ixx - Izz, and a dynamic exchange of the bodyfixed b- and c-axes (90° rotation about the tidal axis, an example of inertial interchange true polar wander [9]), will instead be favored. Results:  The moments of the ice shell are determined by the degree-2 mass distribution, so we first determine t20, the second zonal coefficient of the shell thickness t (4.2 and 19 km for the two cases illustrated in Fig. 1). For a shell of finite strength, the ice load applied to the bottom will be partially compensated by upwarping of the shell, generating in-phase, positive surface topography. The gravity coefficient resulting from the opposing contributions of these two degree-2 shell thickness variations, and which contributes the moment of inertia difference driving polar wander, is straightforward to calculate [7,10,11]:      € C20 t = 3Δρ t20 5ρ a 11+ (Δρ /ρc )Cc Cc − 1− bc a⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ 4⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎤ ⎦ ⎥      , where ρc is the ice shell density, Δρ the ocean-shell density difference, and € ρ  the mean density of the satellite; a is satellite radius, bc is the average shell thickness (t00), and Cc is the compensation state for a bottom-loaded shell [11]. It can be shown that Cc is close enough to unity that € C20 t  > 0 always for Ganymede, which is required if polar wander is to occur at all. Now, reorientation of the ice shell is resisted by the existing elastic or "fossil" bulge, which is maintained by the rotational and tidal potentials [7,12]. In this case inertial interchange is only favored if, following [13] and subsequent work,             € C20 t > 13 γ pot (k2 f − k2 s )         , where γpot = n2a3/GM, n and M are the satellite's mean motion and mass, and G is the gravitational constant; € k2 f  is the fluid tidal Love number at degree 2 and € k2 s  is the secular version, calculated with a surface elastic lithosphere but after such time that internal stresses (including those in Ganymede's rocky mantle) have re-  Figure 2. ΔI is plotted as a function of E for two values of t20 and bc = 20 km (4 Ga). Different shell/lithosphere thickness ratios are indicated. Positive ΔI values indicate inertial interchange (polar wander) of the c- and b-axes of the body (directions of spin and orbital motion, respectively) is dynamically favored. laxed. For calculations of € k2 s  we use the approach of [14] as coded for Ganymede in the study of [15].  In Fig. 2 we plot ΔI/Ma2 for values of t20 and bc from Fig. 1 for 4 Ga, as a function of lithospheric Young's modulus E. Positive values of ΔI are attitude unstable. Lithosphere thickness (de) is obviously important; we assume bc/de ~10, following [7], but estimate values as low as 3. Figure 2 clearly demonstrates that the shell will be unstable for all reasonable values of the parameters E and de. In particular, for conductive ice shells 4 Gyr ago, t20 needs to fall below 1 km (less than a quarter of the nominal value from Fig. 1) in order for ΔI to go negative (stable). Implications for Cratering:  Repeated 90° episodes of polar wander, or continual drift of Ganymede's icy shell with respect to its rotation axis [e.g., 7], can result in apex-antapex exchange or exchanges, and hence reduction or elimination of the apex-antapex cratering asymmetry. The story for Callisto is similar. Acknowledgement: This work supported by PGG. References: [1] Shoemaker E.M. and Wolfe R.F. (1982) Satellites of Jupiter, UA Press, 227-339. [2] Zahnle K. et al.
