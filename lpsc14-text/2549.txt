WARMING THE FROZEN HEART OF ENCELADUS.  J. H. Roberts1, 1Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, 11100 Johns Hopkins Rd., Laurel, MD 20723, James.Roberts@jhuapl.edu  Introduction: Enceladus is perhaps best known for its young south polar terrain [1], observed by the Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) on Cassini to emit several GW of heat [2] as well as plumes of vapor and ice [3]. The source of this energy is believed to be tidal dissipation. However, the CIRS measurements [2] far exceed the long-term level of dissipation that is sustainable by orbital dynamics [4]. Moreover, models of the internal dynamics suggest that heat is removed from the interior faster than it can be produced, resulting in the geologically rapid freezing of any global subsurface ocean [5,6], although a regional sea may be longer-lived [7]. Tidal dissipation in the ice shell is severely restricted if it is mechanically coupled to the rigid silicate core. In such a scenario, if the ocean freezes entirely, tidal heating is predicted to drop precipitously.  Here, I consider an alternative interior structure for Enceladus in which the core of Enceladus is fragmented, and relatively weak [8]. I investigate the thermal evolution of Enceladus when the core rheology is partially controlled by interstitial ice, and revisit the assumption that a subsurface ocean is required in order to sustain significant dissipation of tidal energy.  Core Consolidation: Enceladus is most likely differentiated due to long-lived radioactive heating [9], although the size and density of the core are not well known. Unless Enceladus formed within 1.6 My of CAI formation, there will be insufficient 26Al to melt the silicates [9-10]. Furthermore, the central pressure on Enceladus is only ≈20 MPa, well below the compressive strength of most rocks. In this case the core will not be a monolith (Figure 1a,b) but a rubble pile with pore space filled by ice or water (Figure 1c,d).  Here, I consider interior models consistent with the observed radius and bulk density of Enceladus [9] between the following two end members: 1) a competent core of radius Rc=183 km (Figure 1a), and 2) a rubblepile core with 30% porosity filled by water ice with Rc=206 km (Figure 1c). (Higher values of porosity imply a lack of contact between rock fragments, which is incompatible with a differentiated body.) I assume a silicate density ρs=2.71 g cm-3 consistent with the grain density of CM chondrites, a plausible source of the silicate component [10]. I assume the ice shell is pure water with a mean density of ρi=0.925 g cm-3. Tidal Heating:  I compute the tidal dissipation in the interiors using the propagator-matrix code TiRADE [5] for a spherically symmetric body with an arbitrary number of visco-elastic layers [11]. The rigidity µ ranges from 1 to 4 GPa for ice, and 70 to 100 GPa for rock. Viscosity η is 1020 Pa s for rock, and 1014 Pa s for ice near the melting point [8]. The mechanical properties of the core vary between those of rock for the monolithic and those of ice for the most unconsolidated end member, under the assumption that such a high degree of interstitial ice will dominate the deformation as the rock fragments slide past each other with minimal contact. I find that the tidal dissipation increases by a factor of ~20 between the end member cases. Once the porosity reaches ~20%, the core becomes sufficiently weak that dissipation in the core becomes significant. At 30% porosity, 1.7 GW are dissipated in the interior, the bulk of it in the core itself. Figure 2 shows radial profiles of the volumetric heating rates for cores with varying amounts of icefilled pore space.   Layered Convection: I model convection in the ice shell and silicate core of Enceladus using the finiteelement code Citcom in 2D-axisymmetric geometry [12]. In contrast to typical studies of mantle convection which use the core-mantle boundary (or base of the ice shell) as the bottom boundary condition, I model the thermal evolution of the entire sphere, apart from a Figure 1: Model interiors of Enceladus. a, Monolithic, rocky core overlain by an ice shell. b, a liquid subsurface ocean may exist beneath the ice shell. c, an unconsolidated "rubble-pile", rocky core overlain by an ice shell. Pore space in the core is filled with ice. d, rubble-pile core with pore space filled by water. Core fragments are not necessarily regular as seen here. 2549.pdf

small central region to avoid a numerical singularity at the origin. As in the tidal heating models, the size and density of the core are functions of the ice-filled porosity. The viscosity in each layer is temperaturedependent [13-14] and referenced to the viscosities used in the initial tidal heating models [8].  Radioactive heating [5] is restricted to the silicate-bearing core. The surface temperature is 75 K, and there is no heat flux through the (very small) bottom boundary. I ran a set of preliminary convection models for the range of core sizes and densities, took from these the horizontally-averaged viscosity structures. I then computed the corresponding tidal heating distribution and repeated the convection models with the tidal heating. If the core is disaggregated with ice-filled pores, tidal heating can be significant, but only if the interior starts out warm and tidal heating is strong from the beginning. An example of the convection results is shown in Figure 3. The model that starts warm experiences greater heating and convective activity is possible in the warmest inner regions.  Discussion: Significant tidal dissipation can occur in a completely frozen Enceladus if the silicate core is unconsolidated, and lubricated by interstitial ice, and if the interior starts out warm and tidal heating is strong from the beginning. If this is not the case, radioactive heating will be insufficient to prevent the interior from cooling. The colder ice is less dissipative, and tidal heating becomes less able to reverse the cooling trend. The heating rates obtained for the more unconsolidated cases are broadly consistent with the long-term sustainable level of tidal dissipation [5]. Although this level is short of the observed infrared flux [2], the models here apply to the rate of heat production rather than the observable rate of heat loss. Heat may be produced at a lower rate and released episodically [e.g., 15] without violating constraints of orbital mechanics. While the existence of a subsurface ocean is not a requirement for continued tidal dissipation, the ability of a frozen Enceladus to dissipate heat may permit the formation of such an ocean at later times. Because the viscosity, temperature, and tidal heating rates, are coupled, the next step is to fully integrate the tidal heating and convection models so that the heating can be updated in real time.
