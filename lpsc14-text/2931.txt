Introduction: We illustrate evidence that 1) suggests a pervasive hydration of poleward-facing slopes in the Moon’s upper latitudes in excess of hydration on equator-facing slopes and 2) identify the lowlatitude extent of sloped surface hydration using epithermal neutron count-rate measurements from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter’s Lunar Exploration Neutron Detector (LEND) and Lunar Prospector Neutron Spectrometer (LPNS) [1-3]. We use coregistered slope and illumination data derived from the Lunar Observing Laser Altimeter (LOLA) to determine the corresponding average illumination and epithermal neutron count rates as a function of each pixel’s slope-azimuth angle (angular deviation of the slope-aspect angle from the poleward-facing direction) [4-5]. Evidence from LEND’s Collimated Sensor for Epithermal Neutrons (CSETN) and Sensor for Epithermal Neutrons (SETN) and LPNS suggest the hydration of poleward facing slopes begins near ±60° latitude. We look at differences between regionally opposing equator and poleward-facing slopes and find evidence that hydrogen concentrations increase with latitude towards the poles, reaching for CSETN approximately ~1.1±0.3%, LPNS = 0.6±0.1% of the lunar induced mean signal near the south pole. Conditionally, those concentrations increase to ~2-3% for CSETN when analyses are limited to regions of greater slope, spatially larger topographic scale and smaller mapping kernel. Background: Recent reanalysis of near-infrared observations from Chandraayan-1’s Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) using a temperature correction method have minimized the sensitivity of those measurements to temperature variation at the Moon’s upper latitudes [6-7]. Their improved hydrogen estimates suggest that above ±60° latitude, persistent and increasing concentrations of hydrogen approaching 1000’s of ppm H are resident on the surface.      LPNS, and more recently LEND observations found a broad suppression in epithermal neutron emission rates at both lunar poles that have been considered evidence for polar accumulations of hydrogen [3,8]. The suppression of epithermal neutron rates begins near ±70° latitude. The persistent lack of illumination and cryogenic conditions in polar cold-traps may provide conditions sufficient for long-term concentrations of surface H [9], yet only ~1% of this band lies in permanent shadow. Accumulated observations from LEND indicate only a few permanently shadowed regions (PSR)’s maintain enhanced concentrations of hydrogen [8]. We hypothesize that the broad polar suppression of epithermal neutrons is due to localized trapping of hydrogen on common poleward-facing slopes where local-minimum temperatures and illumination conditions may provide trapping conditions at spatial scale perhaps down to a meter. In a system where hydrogen is suggested to be actively exchanged [10], localized traps may conditionally maintain hydrogen concentrations greater than in nearby regions of higher illumination and warmer temperature [6].  Methods: South polar LEND and LPNS epithermal maps (45°–90° S) were prepared from calibrated observations and normalized: mn = (m - µm) / µm, where m is the count-rate map, and µm is the mean of m, in units of % suppression from the map mean. Prior to normalizing, spacecraft-induced contributions to the signal were removed by subtraction, yielding a 1.7 cps average in the map m. Illumination models (65°–90° S) derived from LOLA were interpolated to 1 km/pixel sampling of the epithermal maps. Mapping was performed using a 25 km-wide mapping kernel consistent with the full-width fullmax (FWFM) of the CSETN collimator field-ofview. We averaged the maps as a function of each pixel’s slope azimuth-angle derived from the LOLA terrain models. Slope-azimuth angle is defined as the angular deviation of the slope aspect from the poleward-facing direction. We perform azimuth-angle analysis in a 10° latitude-band starting at -50±5° latitude, 180°–360° longitude and shift the analysis band in latitude by 0.5° increments over the pole and through the opposing hemisphere at 0°–180° longitude. At each step we record the illumination and epithermal rates as a function of slope-azimuth angle in the range between [pole-ward-facing and equatorfacing slopes] thereby producing an image.  Results: Figures 1a-d (left) illustrate illumination and epithermal neutron % suppression as a function of slope-azimuth angle. Diagonal color banding in the images indicate differences between poleward and equatorfacing slopes.  This effect is best ob2931.pdf

served in the Visible Illumination image and to a lesser extent in the epithermal images.  Plot profiles suggests positive differences consistently begin near Identically prepared figures and plots for the LEND, LPNS and SETN show a smaller lag than illumination. Epithermal plots show the % suppression of PF and EF rates as a function of latitude. These profiles suggest differences between EF and PF plots begin near ±60° latitude and symmetrically increase to the poles [7]. Maximum differences are [1.1±0.3%, 0.6±0.1%, 0.3±0.2%] respectively. 1% is consistent with a ~25ppm H difference. Conditions of high slope >10°, Smaller mapping with a 15km kernel and a limition of the analysis to features of larger topographic scale increases CSETN and LPNS polar differences to [>2%, 1.4%] respectively.     Conclusions: We suggest there exists a broad hydration of poleward-facing slopes occurring at multiple-scales, inferring perhaps to the level of meterscale in latitudes above ±60°, that is consistent with [7]. Both LEND and LPNS results suggest poleward slope concentrations of hydrogen appear to be increased approaching the poles and may exceed a 2% difference between PF and EF slopes though at this time we cannot rule out the possibility of a temperature contribution to the effect. We also review contributing factors that influenced these analysis and North pole results.  References: [1] Vondrak et al. (2010) Sp. Sci. Rev., 150(722) [2] Mitrofanov et al.(2010) Sp. Sci.
