SPECTRAL NATURE OF CO2 ADSORPTION ONTO CARBONACOUS CHONDRITE METEORITES.  Genesis Berlanga1, Charles A. Hibbitts1, Driss Takir2 1Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (genesis.berlanga@jhuapl.edu), 2Ithaca College   Introduction:  We continue to investigate the adsorption of CO2 by carbonaceous meteorites expanding upon our preliminary work [1]. Because CO2 has been detected in surfaces too warm for CO2 to exist, it has been postulated to be held by structural trapping, physisorption, or chemisorption [2]. By investigating the adsorption of CO2 onto carbonaceous chondrite meteorite material, material thought to reflect regions of the primordial solar nebula that did not undergo significant heating (>200 C) [6], the goal is to understand the efficacy of a different mechanism for delivering CO2 into the inner solar system. Also, understanding the presence of CO2 on meteorites may provide insight for potential adsorption processes in non-ice materials on the icy and the irregular satellites orbiting Jupiter and Saturn. Procedures:  Our procedures remain very similar to our preliminary work [5]. The meteorites are powdered and held vertically in a copper holder, retained in place via a 1 mm thick MgF2 window. Reflectance spectra are measured with reference to a powdered MgF2 standard, also mounted vertically just below the sample holder and also retained with a MgF2 window. A 1/8" stainless steel gas line enables reagent grade CO2 to be dosed directly into the sample holder and directly onto the sample while under vacuum and cryogenic conditions. The copper sample holder is mounted on the end of a cryostat and can be heated to ~400 C (673 K) via a tungsten filament heater, and cooled with liquid nitrogen through conduction by the cryostat to ~ -123 C (150 K) and lower. Background reference and sample reflectance measurements were acquired by raising and lowering the cryostat within the chamber [3][11].  A correction factor is applied to the background in the 3-μm region, due to the presence of a small amount of adsorbed water in the powdered MgF2 standard.  The correction factor is calculated by referencing the MgF2 reflectance to that of a diffuse gold standard. A gold standard is not used otherwise because of its poor performance at visible wavelengths not show here.  Reflectance spectra are obtained in a fixed configuration, biconical reflectance (i = 15°, e = 45°), using a nitrogen purged Bruker Vertex 70 FTIR spectrometer at an 8 cm-1 resolution. After placing the sample in the sample holder and mounting that onto the end of the cryostat, the chamber is sealed and evacuated to high vacuum (~10-8 - 10-8 torr). The sample and holder are maintained under vacuum at room temperature (23 C /  Figure 1: Reflectance spectra for CM and CI meteorites several hours after dosing with CO2 at 150K. All samples were previously desiccated under vacuum at ~370K.  297 K) overnight (16 hours). Chamber pressures reached 10-8 torr by the end of this initial desiccation process.  Results:  Twelve carbonaceous chondrite meteorites were analyzed, eleven were of the Mighei-like CM group, one was Ivuna of the CI group. (Table 1).  Nine of these meteorites adsorbed CO2 for 7-16 hours at which point, the experiments were terminated due to scheduling and logistical reasons. It is likely that CO2 remained adsorbed for several more hours. Takir et al. [4] classified these meteorites into three spectral groups based on the position of the 3-μm OH band center. Comparing his classifications to the characteristics of the adsorbed CO2 suggests a relationship between the meteorite class and propensity for CO2 adsorption. (Table 1) Ivuna, being the only CI, is unique from all the other meteorites and exhibits spectra indicative of serpentine (lizardite and chrysotile).

 Table 1: Takir et al. meteorite classifications based on aqueous alteration. Ivuna, Murchison, and Murray are unclassified. Our results roughly match the Takir et al. 3- μm bands. A rough relationship between OH and CO2 band depth may be drawn. Larger OH band depths generally correlate with greater CO2 adsorptions. This may imply carbon dioxide complexing with OH and H2O molecules to a strongly adsorbed carboxyl group. There are exceptions to this that we continue to investigate.  Carbon dioxide band minima positions split the meteorites into five groups centered at 4.278 μm, 4.264 μm, 4.275, 4.268 μm, with the remaining four meteorites centered at the median wavelength of 4.271 μm. (Figure 2) Increased Mineral Alteration Indices (Fe3+/Si) and Fe3+ in the serpentine compositions of the meteorites generally correlate with less CO2 adsorption. These results better quantify previous CO2 adsorption experiments on clays and other materials [1][2][5][7]. The band position of adsorbed CO2 is shifted from that of CO2 ice. However, all of the meteorites that adsorbed CO2 exhibit different absorption sites, i.e. CO2 band positions, than those produced by CO2 adsorbed onto clays [2].  CO2 adsorbed onto meteorites show a predominant 4.27 μm band at -123 C (150 K) instead of at the 4.22 μm band for the calciumrich clays [3]. Additional meteorite spectral characteristics include a weak CO2 band at 4.27 μm before, during, and after desiccation and baking of MAC 02606. This may be atmospheric CO2 structurally trapped or strongly chemisorbed as CO3—as this could account for the band near 4 μm [8]. No CO2 ice formation is evident in any of the spectra we obtained. There is no evidence of a doublet that would be expected from CO2 gas [5].  All meteorites exhibit an OH band at 3 μm, and Bells and LAP 03783 exhibit organic features at ~3.5 μm. MAC 02606 and Ivuna show spectral evidence of carbonates at ~4 μm. Conclusions:  Measurements of IR reflectance properties associated with CO2 adsorbed onto carbonaceous meteorites under vacuum at -123 C (150 K) exhibit an infrared band whose position and width are abundance-dependent and demonstrate compositional dependencies. CO2 adsorption may depend on OH band position and meteorite class (according to the classes established by Takir et al.). Futher analyses of additional carbonaceous chondrite meteorites will help determine the use of CO2 adsorbance as an indicator for meteorite composition.
