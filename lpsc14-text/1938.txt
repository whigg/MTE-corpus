Introduction:  During the collapse of large impact craters the target rock temporarily undergoes an extraordinary drop in yield strength relative to static rock strength measurements , which leads to the formation of a collapsed rim and a central peak/peak ring in complex craters [e.g., 1]. While current numerical models of crater collapse reproduce the broad-scale morphology of complex craters, most models fail to accurately replicate the discrete, localized deformation inherent in the formation of these features [1]. Several physical explanations for the inferred dynamic weakening in impacts have been proposed [1], including acoustic fluidization [2]. Developed by Jay Melosh in 1979, this model proposes dynamic weakening of rock by the action of acoustic vibrations. These vibrations cause pressure fluctuations above and below the ambient overburden pressure. When the pressure is reduced, a temporary weakening occurs. Averaging the effect of pressure fluctuations over time and space, these vibrations cause the rock material to behave as a viscous fluid [2], with an effective viscosity that decreases with increasing vibrational energy.  Collins and Melosh [3] applied the Melosh model of acoustic fluidization in numerical simulations of large rock avalanches. Despite the success of their model, there has been little attempt to implement the full Melosh model into crater collapse simulations. The block oscillation model [4] is a well-known variation of the Melosh model, with a similar physical premise. It is widely used in impact simulations [e.g. 5]. The block model and the Melosh model predict similar rheological behavior for acoustically fluidized debris [7]. Here we present a comparison between the block and Melosh models for a suite of hydrocode simulations of crater formation at different scales. Acoustic Fluidization: In the Melosh model, the evolution and generation of acoustic energy (per unit volume),  , is described via a non-linear, ordinary differential equation:                        ̇    (1)  The derivative on the left-hand side is the Lagrangian derivative. The first term on the right-hand side is the scattering term, where   is the scattering diffusivity with units of a length times a velocity [6]. It contains the Laplacian operator and thus acts to diffuse acoustic energy. The second term on the right-hand side describes the dissipation of acoustic energy into heat, and is governed by the wavelength of acoustic vibrations,  , the quality factor,  , and the compressional wave speed of the rock mass,   . The product    is especially important in determining the rate at which acoustic energy is dissipated and converted to heat. Generation of acoustic energy is governed by the last term on the right-hand side. The regeneration efficiency parameter,  , which holds a value between unity and zero, dictates how much distortional energy per unit time (    ̇  ) in the shearing rock mass is converted into new acoustic energy. It is this (re)generation term that converts shockwave energy into acoustic energy and that may facilitate localized dynamic weakening in the latter stages of crater formation.  The block model (as implemented in iSALE) effectively solves the acoustic energy evolution equation (1) with     and    , and so does not permit regeneration of acoustic energy (localized or otherwise). In this case, the initial acoustic energy field is calculated from the peak particle velocity in the shock wave and its subsequent evolution is dictated entirely by the dissipation term in Eq. 1. Method: The Melosh model was successfully implemented into the iSALE hydrocode [8,9] by incorporating Eq. (1) into the time loop and by adding an additional strength model, as described in [2],  [3] and [6]. To compare the block and Melosh models of acoustic fluidization, a suite of impact scenarios were performed with different impactor sizes (144 m; 1.44 km and 14.4 km), but with the same impactor and target material (granite), impact velocity (12 km/s) and target gravity (9.81 m/s 2). An ANEOS-derived equation of state table and standard rock strength parameters for granite [8] were used in all simulations. The block model simulations used typical parameters from recent work [e.g., 5]. In the Melosh model the vibrational wavelength   was assumed to be a constant fraction of the impactor radius,  , which varied between      and      . This assumption is also used in the iSALE implementation of the block model as block size is assumed to be proportional to impactor size. A small value of   (or block size) leads to both a lower viscosity of fluidized debris and a larger dissipation term, and thus acoustic energy is dissipated more quickly for a small impactor.   was varied from 10 - 400, in accordance with the values suggested by [3] and [7]. The regeneration efficiency parameter   was   maintained at 0.1, while the scattering diffusivity,  , was kept constant at 10 3 m 2/s, based on values used in the study of large rock avalanches [3]. Model Comparison: Figure 1 shows the evolution of the vibrational velocity field, vvib (the square-root of the specific acoustic energy), in the largest impact scenario (~14 km impactor) for the block model (left) and the Melosh model for an example set of model parameters that results in a similar crater morphology (right).  The first time slice is during the excavation stage of crater formation. The broad, spatial characteristics  of the acoustic vibration field between the two models at this point are relatively similar. Both show a deep zone of intense vibrations (vvib > 50 m/s). The striking difference, however, is the regions of highly localized vibrations exhibited by the Melosh model. The second and third time slices  show two stages of crater modification. During this time there are important differences between the two models. In the block model, as the vibrations decay, the zone of intense vibrations shrinks in size, particularly in the lateral direction. Complete collapse of the crater requires long-lived vibrations, which are only present in the crater centre. No localization of vibrational energy is observed. In this model, peak-ring formation results as the outwardly collapsing central uplift over-thrusts onto the top of the collapsed crater rim.  In contrast, the Melosh model parameters in the simulation depicted in Fig. 1 result in more rapid dissipation of the initial acoustic energy. In this case, complete collapse of the crater is facilitated by the regeneration of acoustic energy, which prolongs collapse at shallow depths and is more pronounced in both the crater centre and the rim area, as well as along localized zones. Hence, deformation of the target rocks in the Melosh model tends to be more localized and confined to shallower depths than that predicted by the block model. In the Melosh model, peak-ring formation results from the collision of the inwardly collapsing rim and the outwardly collapsing central uplift. After 600s, the final (peak-ring) crater is formed, and almost all vibrations have ceased in both models . Conclusions: We have successfully implemented the Melosh model of acoustic fluidization [2] in the iSALE hydrocode and compared its predictions with those of the widely-used block model [4]. For impact simulations that result in qualitatively the same final crater morphology the Melosh model predicts shallower, more localized deformation and a subtly different mode of peak-ring formation.
