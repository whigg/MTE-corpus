This analysis can be interesting to different observers. In contrast to the previous papers (e.g., [2-6]) on sky brightness, we analyzed data from other telescopes and used χ2 optimization for analysis of observations.Observations analyzed: In our studies we analyzed observations made by the following telescopes:1.3 m OGLE - The Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment - Las Campanas, Chile.2 m FTS - Faulkes Telescope South - Siding Springs, Australia.2 m FTN - Faulkes Telescope North - Haleakela, Hawaii.2 m LT - Liverpool Telescope - La Palma, Canary Islands.For studies of sky brightness for FTS, FTN, and LT, we considered those microlensing events observed in 2011 for which the minimum number of light curve data points is greater than 15: FTS - 39 events; FTN 19 events, LT -  20 events. For OGLE we considered 20 events (110251-110270). Seeing: Our studies of seeing (FWHM in arcsec) are presented in Table 1 and Fig. 1. Table 1 contains the values of s0, s1, and σ obtained by χ2 optimization of the straight line fit for seeing s vs airmass a≈sec(z) (where z is the zenith distance): s=s0+s1(a-1) (χ2=Σ[(sjs1(aj-1)-s0)/σs]2, where σs2 is variance, the sum is for considered values of sj at airmass aj). Typical values of seeing for FTN were almost twice less than those for other three telescopes considered. For the three telescopes, typical values of seeing were about the same at airmass a=1, but at a=2 for OGLE they were smaller than those for FTS and LT. Sky brightness vs. airmass: The used sky model was based mainly on [2]. For this model, the value of Isky(0) (I magnitude of sky brightness per square arcsecin zenith) was chosen in such a way that the sum of squares of differences between observational and model sky brightness magnitudes was minimum at this value of Isky(0) in the case when the Moon is below the horizon. The coefficients bo and b1o presented in Table2 were based on χ2 optimization of the straight line fit (b=b1o(a-1)+bo, χ2=∑[(bj-b1o(aj-1)-bo)/σb]2, σb2 is variance, a is airmass, bj is observational brightness at airmass aj) for observations made at the Moon below the horizon. The values Isky(0), bo and b1o are presented for an extinction coefficient extmag=0.05 (for extmag equal to 0 and 0.1, values of Isky(0) differed by less than 0.3%). Isky(0) was 18.1 mag arcsec-2 for OGLE, and it was greater for the other three telescopes considered. Table 1.

Seeing (in arcsec) vs. airmass. FTS observations of 39 events. A thick straight line is based on χ2optimization (y=so+s1(a-1), so=1.334, s1=0.519). Thinner straight lines are y=so+s1(a-1)±σ (σ=0.367). Nonstraight lines show mean and median values (the line for the mean value is thicker).     Using χ2 optimization of the straight line fit b=b1(a-1)+boi and considering one value of b1 for all events and different values of boi for different events,  we calculated the length of the interval Δb=max{boi}min{boi} of values of boi. The values of boi characterizezenith sky brightness near different events. For observations made at the Moon below the horizon, Δb≈1 mag. An example of the plot of sky brightness vs. airmass, including lines b=b1(a-1)+boi, can be found on http://presentations.copernicus.org/EPSC2013331_presentation.pdf.  For different considered positions of the Moon and the Sun, the maximum values of b0i (less bright sky) are almost the same as those for the Moon below the horizon. The difference in min{b0i} (more bright sky) can be up to 1.5 mag for the different positions. The values of b1 are presented in Table 2 for four restrictions onpositions of the Moon and the Sun. Most of observations were made for airmass a≤3. The variation in sky brightness at 1≤a≤3 does not exceed 2b1. For most 1390.pdf

values of b1 presented in Table 2, 2b1<0.5 mag. The values in Table 2 are presented for thruput             thruput=0.324. The values of sky brightness obtained at two different values of thruput differed by 2.5log10(thruput2/thruput1), which is equal to 0.24 at 0.324/0.26=1.246 (bo is greater for a greater thruput).Table 2.

Analysis of observations shows that brightness of the sky can vary by up to 5-6 mag in the case of the bright Moon and the Sun close to the horizon. Such bright regions of the sky are not well simulated by the considered sky model, but often it is better not to observe such bright regions.           Fig. 3. Sky brightness residuals (mag) vs. airmassfor the model with different boi for FTS observations of 39 events in the case of all positions of the Moon and the Sun. Sky brightness residuals: Most of sky brightness residuals relative to the best fit model for each event (observations minus χ2 optimization which is different for different events) are in a small range (-0.4 to 0.4 mag) even for all Moon and Sun positions; for the Moon below the horizon there are many values in the range [-0.2, 0.2]. Maximum values of sky brightness residuals for observations made at solar elevationθSun<-18o and for the Moon below the horizon usually are smaller by a factor of several than those for all observations (compare Figs. 3-4).The influence of θSun on sky brightness began to play a role at θSun>-14o, and was considerable at   θSun>-7o. For example (see Fig. 5), if we consider only FTS observations with the Moon below the horizon, then sky brightness residual sbr can be up to -3 mag at   -8o<θSun<-7o, sbr>-1 mag at θSun<-8o, and sbr>-0.4 mag at θSun<-14o.
