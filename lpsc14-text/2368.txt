(Email: yang.liu@jpl.nasa.gov)  Introduction:  Meteorite NWA 7034 and its pairings (NWA 7475, 7533, 7906, 7907, 8114) represent a unique type of martian meteorites, which differs from the well-known SNC’s in mineralogy and stable and radiogenic isotope geochemistry [1-2].  This martian type is a polymict breccia that contains Na- and K-rich feldspars [1-2], old zircons (4.428 Ga, [2]), and has mineral components that yield Amazonian ages [1-4].  Moreover, the bulk analysis of NWA 7034 also suggested that this sample is water rich (up to 6000 ppm) with isotope compositions reflecting a martian surface reservoir of variable D/H and oxygen isotope values [1,5].  Here, we investigated a thin section (1B,4) of NWA 7034 to examine the host phase(s) for water abundances and hydrogen isotope compositions. Methods: A thin section (1B,4) was examined using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (FEI NanoLab, Zeiss 1550 SEM).  Mineral compositions were determined using a JEOL JXA-8200 at Caltech.  The distribution of H and D in alteration products (red boxes in Fig 1-3) were examined using a Cameca NanoSIMS 50L at Caltech.  Terrestrial apatites were used as standards and to correct for instrumental mass fractionation.  Results:  Petrography: Our section contains impact melt, rock, and mineral clasts.  The impact melt contains pyroxene laths of large aspect ratios.  Rock fragments are largely basaltic, consisting of pyroxene and plagioclase, spherules, and crypto-crystalline clasts.  The sample also contains numerous mineral fragments.  Oxides and sulfides are surrounded by alteration rims.  A very distinct clast is largely composed of Na-rich plagioclase and K-rich feldspar with a thin layer of augite and oxide sandwiched by the feldspars. Mineral chemistry: The mineral compositions in section 1B,4 are similar to those reported in [1,5].  However, in detail, pyroxenes display both normal (e.g., Fig. 1) and reversed zoning (e.g., Fig. 2).  Pyroxene fragments often contain exsolution lamellae of hypersthene and augite compositions.   Weathering: Weathering features are widely dispersed in the sample, in the form of weathering rinds around sulfide and oxides, around pyroxenes, near or inside spherules (Fig. 1-3).  The analysis of the weathering rim of pyroxene renders a mixture between clay and oxides.  Figure 1.  A bi-mineralic clast displaying alteration around the pyroxene grain.

Cts: counts; SE: secondary electron image.  Hydrogen isotope distribution:  The D/H values reported here are preliminary, because we have standardized diverse silicates and oxides against an apatite standard; based on previous work, we suspect that accurate standardization to account for matrix effects will likely change the reported values by 10’s of per mil.  NanoSIMS mapping of the selected areas showed that (1) alteration veins in apatite grain and silicates display D/H values indistinguishable from the terrestrial range (-47 ± 12 ‰ to -123 ± 8 ‰, not shown in the images).  These observations are consistent with the D/H of low-T released water in Agee et al. [1] that was shown to be martian in origin based on Oisotopes.  .  We observe that these veins cross-cut apatite or are interstitial between pyroxene and feldspar, which could suggest weathering on Earth or Mars; (2) the hydrated oxides appear to retain enriched D with up to +995 ± 61 ‰ (Fig. 4), but most data (+680 ± 28 ‰ to +780 ± 61 ‰) are similar to the small amount water released at ~650 °C by step-heating methods (Agee et al. [1]). (3) Cracks and holes in the sample with high C and H counts, and negative δD are consistent with the expected terrestrial contamination, possibly introduced by epoxy or sample preparation.    Discussion: The preliminary data highlight that D/H distribution in the section is heterogeneous with values comparable to water released by the step heating [1].  Although the alteration products with an elevated D value are likely martian in origin, it is difficult to determine a martian or terrestrial origin for the alteration products that have a low D value.  The differences in hydrogen isotope compositions between the secondary products in NWA 7034 and that of soil from MSL [5] could be a result of isotope exchange on Earth or a variable H-isotope composition in altered martian surface materials.
