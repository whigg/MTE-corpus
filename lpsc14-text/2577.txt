ARE-EVALUATION OF CHONDRULE FORMATION IN LARGE-SCALE SHOCKS.M. A. Morris1and S. J. Desch2. 1Center for Meteorite Studies, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287. 2School ofEarth and Space Exploration, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287. (melissa.a.morris@asu.edu).Introduction:Chondrules are signiﬁcant indicators of processesoccuring in the early solar nebula. However, themethod of their formation is a continuing sourceof debate. There are a number of constraints onchondrule formation provided by careful chemicaland isotopic analysis, as well as experiments undertaken in order to reproduce chondrules in the lab.Any proposed formation method must meet thiswide range of constraints. Shocks in the solar nebula remain the most promising chondrule-formingmechanism, due to their ability to meet the majority of constraints, especially those on the thermalhistories experienced by chondrules [1]. The typeof nebular shock has also been hotly debated, buthas largely been narrowed down to two: large-scaleshocks, such as those due to disk instabilities andbow shocks around large protoplanets [2,3]. Recentwork [4] has shown that bow shocks around largeprotoplanets, while still a likely candidate for sometypes of chondrules, are not ideal for producing themajority (those with porphyritic textures). Hence,we feel it necessary to re-evaluate chondrule formation in large-scale shocks.The large-scale shock model of [2] met most ofthe constraints on chondrule formation, especiallytheir thermal histories, with the exception of excess "pre-heating". Solids will be pre-heated aheadof the shock (in the pre-shock region; Figure 1),due to the propagation of a radiation front (knownas a Marshak wave) originating in the hot, postshock region [2]. Pre-heating of chondrules ≥ 1300K is constrained to under 30 minutes, in order toprevent isotopic fractionation of sulfur [5]. In themodel of [2], the solids were pre-heated to temperatures exceeding 1300 K for over 4 hours. It hasbeen demonstrated that the inclusion of a population of smaller particles will eliminate this problem[6], due to an increase in opacity in the pre-shockregion that does not aﬀect the cooling rates of chondrules in the post-shock region. Here we examinethis problem in more detail and discuss the ramiﬁcations.Methods:We use the shock code of [2], modiﬁed to include a population of intermediate-sized particles.The mass fraction of solids in the nebula is assumedto be 0.05, a concentration ten times that proposedby [7]. Submicron-sized dust makes up ∼ 25% ofthe solids. Of the remaining 75% of solids, 2/3are large (300 μm) chondrule precursors, and 1/3are particles of intermediate-size. The dust, considered coupled to the gas, evaporates completely andnearly instantaneously at 1500 K [2]. Chondrulesand intermediate-sized particles evaporate at identical, energy-limited rates when their temperaturesexceed their liquidus temperature of ∼ 1820 K. Vapor evaporated from the chondrule precursors andintermediate-sized particles is added back to thegas. We have performed parameter studies withintermediate particle sizes of radius a = 10, 15, 20,and 30μm to determine the eﬀects on the thermalhistories of chondrules.Figure 1: Thermal histories of chondrules. The dashedcurve indicates those predicted by the shock model of Morris& Desch (2010), as compared to those inferred from experimental constraints (solid curve).Results and Discussion:We ﬁnd that peak temperatures and cooling ratesof chondrules are largely unaﬀected by the inclusionof intermediate-sized particles of all radii considered(Table 1). Cooling rates through the crystallizationtemperature range are raised only slightly over thecanonical case of [2]. However, with the inclusionof particles of radius a = 10μm, the time spent atT > 1300 K before the shock is reduced to < 30minutes, meeting the constraint on isotopic fractionation of sulfur [5]. The inclusion of a population of particles with radii a = 15, 20, and 30μm,shorten the time at high temperature, but do noteliminate excess pre-heating. Our calculations showthat 10μm-sized particles will largely evaporate inthe shock, with only large particles remaining for2577.pdf

incorporation into chondrite parent bodies, alongwith nearby nebular dust.Figure 2: The black curve indicates chondrule thermal histories as predicted by the shock model of Morris & Desch(2010), with the inlusion of particles with radius 10μm, ascompared to those inferred from experimental constraints(red curve).Conclusion:The introduction of a population of intermediatesized particles of radius a = 10μm into the shockmodel of chondrule formation of [2] results in thermal histories that meet all thermal constraints (Figure 2). Such a population of particles, at 25% of thetotal solids mass, is not seen in meteorites. This implies that if they existed in the solar nebula, theywere mostly lost, either by destruction in chondruleforming shocks, or by coagulation into larger particles. Their existence, if established by the needto match constraints on chondrule formation, couldinform models of particle growth.The sole constraint not met by the large-scaleshock model is the high partial pressure of Fe metal,Na, and S in chondrule-forming environments inferred by [8-11]. Passage of a shock through a verydense clump of chondrule precursors, with concentrations higher than thought possible, may producethe required vapor, but this has not yet been modeled. Alternative models, including models of chondrule formation in impacts [12,13] or impact/shockcombinations [14], have been proposed to accountfor isotopic constraints, deformed and compoundchondrules, and chondrule clasts [10,15]. However,these models have not been quantitatively tested,and as such, have not demonstrated that they canexplain high partial pressures of Na (and Fe metaland S) either. The large-scale shock model remainsthe most promising mechanism for the formation ofmost chondrules.References: [1] Desch, S. J., Morris, M. A.,Connolly, H. C., Jr., & Boss, A.
