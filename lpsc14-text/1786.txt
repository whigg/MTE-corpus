Establishing a fine-scale chronology of early solar system evolution, therefore, requires the determination of highly precise ages for meteorites and their components. The necessary time resolution is in principle provided by Pb-Pb chronometry and by short-lived chronometers such as the 26Al-26Mg and 182Hf-182W systems. However, the precise chronological interpretation of the isotopic data is not always straightforward, and can be hampered by (i) mass-independent isotope variations in the elements of interest [e.g., 1-3] and (ii) a heterogeneous distribution of some shortlived radionuclides (especially 26Al) [e.g., 4].  In a previous study we have shown that the interpretation of Hf-W data for CAI is complicated by the presence of nucleosynthetic W isotope anomalies [1]. To explore the extent and nature of nucleosynthetic W isotope variations in CAI, and to better quantify the initial Hf and W isotope compositions of the solar system, we obtained Hf-W data for several fine- and coarse-grained CAI from different CV3 chondrites. The improved initial 182Hf/180Hf is then used to compare Hf-W and Al-Mg ages between angrites and CAI, with the ultimate goal to assess the level of 26Al heterogeneity in the early solar system.  Methods: After digesting the CAI samples in HFHNO3-HClO4, W was separated using two anion exchange chromatography steps modified after [5]. Tungsten isotope compositions were measured on a ThermoScientific® Neptune Plus MC-ICPMS at the University of Münster. The data are reported as εiW (i.e., 0.01 % deviations from terrestrial values) and for two normalizations, denoted '6/3' for normalization to 186W/183W and '6/4' for normalization to 186W/184W. Results: The fine-grained CAI exhibit variable ε183W (6/4) with excesses of up to +5.3, indicating a deficit in s-process (or an excess in r-process) W nuclides in some of the samples. In contrast, all of the coarse-grained (mostly type B) inclusions show nearterrestrial ε183W (6/4), indicating that nucleosynthetic W isotope heterogeneity is largely absent in these samples. Moreover, the investigated CAI exhibit variable ε182W (6/4), while the ε182W (6/3) values of the same samples show a smaller range. This difference results from the presence of nucleosynthetic W isotope anomalies in some of the CAI, which have a much larger effect on 186W/184W-normalized than on 186W/183W-normalized ratios (Fig. 1).  0 2 4 6-4-2024CAI - bulk dataslope = 1.41±0.06ε182Wi = −3.47±0.12 (95% conf.)MSWD = 0.37ε182Wi (6/4)ε183W (6/4)Fine-grained CAI:Coarse-grained CAI:Allende (this study)Allende 'A-ZH-5' [1,6]Allende (this study)NWA 6717 / 6870 (this study)-4 -3 -2 -1 0 1-4.5-4-3.5-3-2.5-2CAI - bulk dataslope = −0.11±0.05ε182Wi = −3.47±0.08 (95% conf.)MSWD = 0.76ε182Wi (6/3)ε184W (6/3)(b)(a) Fig. 1: Tungsten isotope systematics of bulk CAI normalized to (a) 186W/184W, and (b) to 186W/183W after iteratively correcting the measured ε182W of each CAI for 182Hf decay using their measured 180Hf/184W.  Effect of nucleosynthetic W isotope anomalies on Hf-W systematics: The fine-grained CAI investigated here display a sufficiently large range in Hf/W to permit determining a precise bulk CAI isochron. However, the ε182W values of the CAI first must be corrected for nucleosynthetic anomalies, which requires knowledge of the relative effects of such anomalies on ε182W and ε183W (or ε184W). This information is provided by the slope of ε182W vs. ε183W (or ε184W) correlation lines. After an iteration to correct the measured ε182W of each individual CAI for radiogenic contributions from 182Hf decay, the studied fine-grained CAI define a precise correlation between initial ε182W and ε183W (Fig. 1), providing a direct empirical means to correct the ε182W of any CAI for nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies using their measured ε183W. Hf-W isochron for bulk CAI: After the iterative correction for nucleosynthetic W isotope heterogeneity, a well-defined Hf-W isochron for bulk CAI is obtained.

data provide an initial 182Hf/180Hf of (1.02±0.05)×10-4 and ε182Wi (6/3) = −3.48±0.11 (Fig. 2). Both values are in good agreement with a previous determination based on internal Hf-W isochrons for type B CAI [1,6], but the nominal initial 182Hf/180Hf obtained for CAI here is slightly higher than that obtained previously. Based on Al-Mg chronometry it was argued that re-melted, coarse-grained CAI may have formed up to ~0.2 Ma later than primitive, unmelted CAI [7]. Although such a brief time interval cannot be resolved using Hf-W chronometry, it would be consistent with the slight (but not resolved) difference between the initial 182Hf/180Hf of the bulk CAI isochron and that of an internal isochron for type B CAI [1,6]. The initial 182Hf/180Hf of the solar system, therefore, is best determined by the bulk CAI isochron obtained in the present study.  Further evidence that the bulk CAI isochron provides the initial 182Hf/180Hf at the time of CAI formation comes from the Hf-W isochron itself, which yields an absolute Hf-W age for CAI of 4567.9±0.8 Ma when anchored to the angrite D'Orbigny [2,5]. This absolute Hf-W age is in good agreement with PbPb ages of CAI [8,9], indicating that the bulk CAI isochron reflects the time of Hf/W fractionation during CAI formation.  0 1 2 3 4-4-3-2-1012180Hf/184WCAI - Bulk isochron182Hf/180Hfi = (1.02±0.05) x 10-4ε182Wi = −3.48±0.11 (95% conf.)MSWD = 0.77NWA6717NWA6870A-ZH-5ε182W (6/3) nuc. corr.Fine-grained CAI:Coarse-grained CAI:Allende (this study)Allende 'A-ZH-5' [1,6]Allende (this study)NWA 6717 / 6870 (this study) Fig. 2: Hf-W isochron for bulk CAI after an iterative correction of ε182W for nucleosynthetic W isotope variability. Evidence for 26Al homogeneity: The use of extinct short-lived chronometers like 26Al-26Mg and 182Hf-182W relies on the assumption that the parent nuclides were homogeneously distributed in the early solar system. However, it has been suggested that variable 26Al/27Al in meteorites and meteorite components reflect a heterogeneous distribution of 26Al and not different formation times. For instance, [4] proposed that the angrite parent body derived from a reservoir with initial 26Al/27Al of (1.61±0.32)×10-5 at the time of CAI formation. Relative to this value the Al-Mg age for the angrites D'Orbigny and Sahara 99555 would be 3.5±0.2 Ma. This is inconsistent with the Hf-W age of these two angrites [5] of 4.8±0.6 Ma relative to the initial 182Hf/180Hf of CAI inferred in the present study (Fig. 3). Thus, our new Hf-W data do not support the heterogeneous distribution of 26Al inferred by [4]. Instead, the Hf-W age of the angrites is in excellent agreement with their Al-Mg ages of 4.7±0.2 Ma [10] or 5.0±0.1 Ma [11] relative to the canonical initial 26Al/27Al of CAI [12] (Fig. 3). This provides powerful evidence that 26Al (and 182Hf) were homogeneously distributed in the inner solar system, at least in the region were CAI and angrites formed.  Fig. 3 also shows Pb-Pb formation intervals for angrites, calculated relative to two different Pb-Pb ages of CAI, both of which have been calculated using measured U isotope compositions [8,9]. These two PbPb ages for CAI differ by ~0.6 Myr,  somewhat hindering the precise determination of Pb-Pb formations intervals of angrites relative to CAI. This makes it difficult to use Pb-Pb ages for assessing the level of 26Al heterogeneity by age comparison. Fig. 3 shows that the Hf-W data seem more consistent with the older Pb-Pb age of CAI, but the Hf-W ages do not have the required precision to unambiguously distinguish between the two different Pb-Pb ages for CAI. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6ΔtCAI (Myr)Pb-PbAl-MgHf-WD'Orbigny5Sahara 995555D'Orbigny+Sahara5D'Orbigny2D'Orbigny2Sahara 995554Sahara 995554D'Orbigny10D'Orbigny11Sahara 9955510Sahara 9955511D'Orbigny+Sahara10D'Orbigny+Sahara11Rel. to (26Al/27Al)i = (5.23±0.13)×10-5 [12]Rel. to (26Al/27Al)i = (1.61±0.32)×10-5 [4]Rel. to 4567.94±0.31 Ma for CAI [9]Rel. to 4567.32±0.16 Mafor CAI [8]D'Orbigny10D'Orbigny11Sahara 9955510Sahara 9955511D'Orbigny+Sahara10D'Orbigny+Sahara11 Fig. 3: Hf-W, Al-Mg, and (U isotope variability-corrected) Pb-Pb ages of angrites relative to CAI formation.
