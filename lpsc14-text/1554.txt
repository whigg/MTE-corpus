 COASTAL GEOMORPHOLOGY AT ENDEAVOUR CRATER:  OBSERVATIONS BY THE OPPORTUNITY ROVER.  T. J. Parker1 and B. G. Bills1, and the MER Science Team, 1Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, (timothy.j.parker@jpl.nasa.gov, bruce.bills@jpl.nasa.gov)   Introduction:  The Endeavour rim mountains are bounded by an apron of reworked surfaces and sediment onlaps resembling terrestrial lakeshores that are tilted into the crater. Observations:  Opportunity is currently investigating Murray Ridge, north Solander Point, the third inselberg of the 22-km Endeavour Crater rim in Maridiani Planum to be visited by the rover.  The rim and interior of of the crater is partly obscured by the familiar sulfate sandstones and mudstones of Meridiani Planum.  The contact between the plains and the rim inselbergs is defined by an apron, typically about 1520 meters in width and elevated slightly above the surrounding plains.  In monoscopic orbiter images, this bench suggests a horizontal surface at the base of the inselbergs.  However, digital elevation models made from stereo orbiter images show these aprons define approximate planar surfaces sloping downward into the crater interior by several degrees.   The bench is best exposed along the west and east rim mountains.  From orbit, it exhibits four principal elements.  From the plains, upslope, they are:  1, a basal scarp up to a few tens of centimeters high; 2, a margin of bright outcrop that appears to either onlap or protrude from beneath 3, a smooth darker slope extending from the bright outcrop up to 4, a low escarpment or "berm" at the base of the rougher-looking surface of the Endeavour rim and a few meters upslope from the basal scarp.   Cape York (Fig 1) was the first of the west rim mountains visited by Opportunity, followed by Sutherland Pt./Nobbys Head and currently Solander Pt. Opportunity has imaged the bench at several locations around these inselbergs with the navigation and panorama cameras (navcam and pancam).   From the ground, the basal scarp does appear to be an erosional feature, as does the berm separating the bench or apron from the Endeavour rim surfaces.  The bright outcrop margin (the "Grasberg unit") is the most prominent of several successive onlaps of thinly-laminated sulfate sediments onto the crater rim inselbergs.  Coastal Interpretation:  Morphologically and stratigraphically, these onlaps are strikingly similar to terrestrial beachrock, but are sulfate rather than carbonate (Figs 2-4).  If the bench, berms and onlaps were once horizontal surfaces, then a mechanism must be found to explain the tilt of both the plains margin and the inselbergs inward toward the crater interior (Fig 5).  The crater seems to be too small a feature for a tectonic mechanism.  Perhaps sediment dewatering and compaction over time could have caused the tilt at the rim if the sediment were thicker or deposited more rapidly inside the crater interior than outside.

Note Same stratigraphic relationships as in Figure 2, which is 2.4km north of this site. Figure 4:  Terrestrial "beachrock" analogs.  Upper left, Pyramid Lake, Nevada.  Upper right, Normanby Island, Queensland.  Lower Left, Salar de Uvuni, Bolivia.  Lower right, southern Arabian Gulf.  All but the Bolivian example are composed of carbonate cements.  The Bolivian example is salt.                       Figure 5:  Pancam mosaic of Solander Pt, viewed from Botany Bay (looking south).  Top frame shows rover on tilted Botany Bay surface.  Center frame rotated so far horizon is "true level."  Bottom frame rotated so Grasberg Bench is horizontal.  Note that Grasberg bench disappears beneath the plains where it intersects the Botany Bay surface on the left, suggesting burial, but rises above the Burns Fm on the right. These relationships suggest that subsidence into the crater was occuring while the Burns Fm was still being deposited, and that rotation of the rim was also involved (to elevate the bench above Burns on the right).  Scene width ~45°.
