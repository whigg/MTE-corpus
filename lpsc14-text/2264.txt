Introduction: Lunar pyroclastic glasses have been identified remotely from telescopic and orbital data sets, as well as in Apollo samples. They provide important clues concerning the lunar volcanic history of the Moon, especially the history of volatiles within the lunar interior. Important questions remain about their timing in relation to effusive mare basalts, their distribution relative to impact basins, and their importance as potential resources for future missions to the Moon. With the availability of several new datasets, there is now an opportunity to re-examine these deposits on a global scale to gain new insight into the role of explosive volcanism in lunar volcanic history.  Dark mantle deposits (DMDs) were produced in explosive volcanic eruptions and are identified based upon their relatively low albedos, surface smoothness, mantling relationship to underlying terrain, and spectral absorption bands due to the presence of ironbearing volcanic glasses [1-6]. DMDs may be composed of glasses and/or crystallized beads, depending upon the optical density of the plume and time within the plume. Cooling times may have either been sufficiently long for crystals of ilmenite to form in the beads as they erupted, or the beads quenched into glasses due to rapid transport or low optical densities in the plume. CO2 and H2O are believed to be the dominant gas species driving explosive lunar volcanic eruptions [7-11]. Lunar pyroclastic glasses exhibit a broad absorption centered around 1 µm and generally display weak absorptions near 2 µm, but can be differentiated from olivine based on a more symmetrical absorption extending beyond 1 µm [12]. Additionally, the interdistance between the 1 and 2 µm bands minimum is shorter for the glasses than in pyroxenes or olivine [13]. Laboratory measurements of orange, green and black lunar glass beads also display distinct differences in their spectral properties at ultra-violet to visible wavelengths due to variations in titanium and iron contents and crystallization state [14]. Gaddis et al. [15] noted the diverse compositions of >100 DMDs and divided the very large deposits into three classes: Class 1 is dominated spectrally by black crystallized beads that are iron- and titanium-rich (Taurus Littrow, Sinus Aestuum, Vaporum, and Rima Bode); Class 2 have pyroclastic material dominated by Fe2+-bearing glasses with perhaps lower Ti contents (Aristarchus, Harbinger, and Humorum); Class 3 may be Ti-rich and likely consist of a mixture of Fe2+bearing orange glasses and black beads that have a higher glass-to-bead ratio (Sulpicius Gallus). In this investigation, we analyzed higher spatial and spectral resolution images taken at multiple illuminations to better refine the extent of regional DMDs, characterize their UV to near-infrared spectral properties, explore the geologic setting of each deposit, identify and characterize plausible source vents, and understand the eruption(s) that emplaced each DMD. Observations:  We used several data sets, including: LRO Narrow Angle Cameras (NAC) and LRO Wide Angle Camera (WAC) [16]; M3 calibrated reflectance [17-19]; Kaguya Terrain Camera (TC) and Multispectral Imager (MI) data from the Japanese Space Agency's (JAXA) SELENE (also called 'Kaguya') mission [20]. The TC images provide superb high- and low-sun data for morphologic studies and excellent context images for analyses of the LROC data.  Figure 1 illustrates the M3 and TC coverage across three of the regional DMDs: Rima Bode, Sinus Aestuum SE, and Sinus Aestuum SW. The TC mosaic composed of images taken at low-sun (evening) illumination is useful for emphasizing topography, especially for distinguishing DMDs on elevated highland surfaces relative to lower-lying dark mare flows. The integration of multiple data sets for characterizing the DMDs and mapping their extent is illustrated by the examples shown in Figure 2. M3 86-band reflectance measurements provide an excellent data set to characterize the mineralogy of DMDs relative to surrounding materials and interpret their geologic context because the DMDs are readily visible due to their low albedo and strong or broad ferrous absorption relative to surrounding deposits, especially feldspathic materials. We are currently working with M3 spectra to identify and characterize minerals on regional DMD deposits and surrounding materials, which may include components such as olivine, pyroxene, Fe-rich glass and spinel. Starting with the Rima Bode and Sinus Aestuum regions, our goals are to search for previously unrecognized vents, map deposit distributions, assess mineralogy, and characterize regional stratigraphy to help understand why the spinels, identified in Sinus Aestuum [21-24], are not observed more broadly among other compositionally similar DMDs, including those at Mare Vaporum, Sulpicius Gallus, and Taurus Littrow.
