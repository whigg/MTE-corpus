Introduction:  Layers of ice and dust widely considered to contain a record of recent climate cover the north polar region of Mars [1,2]. Layers are exposed primarily within walls of the extensive spiral troughs [3]. However, various interpretations of NPLD development exist because these exposures are the only means for accessing the stratigraphy that is largely hidden in the subsurface [4,5]. Layers exposed in the spiral troughs are affected by local processes both during and after deposition [4,6]. Specifically, the interaction between trough morphology and winds determines how and where ice and dust accumulate. Therefore, a better understanding of trough processes should result in a better understanding of the development of the NPLD. Radar sounding from the Shallow Radar (SHARAD) instrument on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has allowed observations of the NLPD subsurface [7] and has proved valuable for determining the evolution of the NPLD [8-10], including the detection of migrating spiral troughs [11]. Here we present the first comprehensive survey of troughs and related features using SHARAD and present a delineated map based on trough characteristics. Methods: SHARAD has been operating since late 2006 [7]. The instrument is a radar sounder that sends a chirped, 80 µs pulse from 15 to 25 MHz and records reflected energy versus time. Reflections are the result of contrasts in the real part of the permittivity, ε. Within water ice, SHARAD has a theoretical vertical resolution of ~8.4 m [7]. After processing on Earth, SHARAD resolves targets down to 0.3 - 1 km along track and 3-6 km cross track [7]. Since reaching Mars, approximately 2,200 observations of the NPLD have been collected, providing a very tight spatial coverage of the NPLD. We utilize synthetic radargrams along with repeated and crossing observations to separate surface clutter and ambiguous interpretations from scientifically interesting subsurface reflections. Spiral troughs: Spiral troughs exhibit an abundance of common characteristics and regional variations that are likely the result of local processes. The common characteristics include several features described in the initial trough surveys: high side exposed layering where internal deposits are exposed during erosion; low side banded terrain where recent deposits overly previous accumulation; high side slopes that have larger local slope than low sides; albedo variations that tie to the surface exposure, and migration paths [3,6]. Regional differences based on deviations from the standard trough include relative time of formation, migration direction, presence of topographic undulations and / or central promontories, complete burial, and the ratio of migration to accumulation. These variations in trough surface morphologies and subsurface stratigraphy help to divide the NPLD into eight regions (Fig. 1) with unique characteristics. Conclusions: All NPLD troughs are fundamentally similar and contain classical features while exhibiting rich regional diversity. Regional variations include surface slope, wavelengths, trough depths, trough age, presence of topographic undulations, and trough bottoms that reach bedrock. To better classify this diversity, we have divided the NPLD into eight regions that separate troughs based on these observations (Fig. 1). The troughs are not static features, and they evolve both independently based on local processes and as a group when considered by region. Some of the changes the troughs have undergone include increase in numFig. 1: Eight Regions of the NPLD based on trough morphology and stratigraphy. Region 1 exhibits classical troughs, including minor topographic undulations [3,6]. Region 2 and 3 contain many central promontories on the trough high side and tend to be deeper than those in Region 1. Regions 3 and 7 contain many topographic undulations exhibited in the stratigraphic record. Regions 0, 4, and 7a are difficult or impossible to observe with radar but exhibit both classical and non-classical traits. Region 5 corresponds to the eastern extent of Gemina Scopuli. The troughs here formed much higher stratigraphically than troughs in other regions. Region 6 has no surface troughs but exhibits buried troughs that perviously migrated southward, contrary to migration in other regions. Orange shaded area represents extent of Region 5 erosion preceding Generation 2 trough formation.    ber, burial, change in wavelength, evolution from compound to simple, or merging. The troughs formed at different times, and contain distinct generations. Generation 1 troughs reside in Regions 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 (Fig. 2a).  Radar evidence supports a gradual increase in number and longitudinal extent of Generation 1 troughs during deposition of more than 500 m, starting about 1000 m beneath the current surface. Generation 2 troughs are found in Regions 5 and 7a, corresponding to Gemini Scopuli. Region 5 trough onset was relatively rapid after a large erosional event (Figs. 1, 2c). Three common processes are sufficient to explain all of the features and varieties discussed in this paper: transport by wind, insolation, and deposition [11].  These processes are present in every region of the NPLD, but they are not uniform. Variability within these processes can account for all regional variability detected. No evidence is available to support interpretations of other processes hypothesized to influence trough evolution. Troughs in each region evolved independently based on the known processes, but initial conditions were also important for variability. For example, trough wavelength has an inverse relationship to regional initiation slope, and latitude affects the amount of insolation received. Furthermore, Region 5 and 7a troughs formed on an eroded slope,  in contrast to those in other regions. Several other physical properties are important to trough evolution: trough strike, albedo, high and low side slopes, depth, and wind patterns. These properties force the three processes associated with evolution, and there is feedback between the properties and processes.
