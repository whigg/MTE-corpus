Here we present our first results and plans to help interpret the LIBS hydrogen signal acquired in soils. Objectives: Our objectives are to calibrate the H line signal intensity with the water content for soils and to establish its relationship with chemistry, mineralogy and physical properties such as grain size. Indeed, the hydrogen LIBS signal measured by ChemCam was found to vary much as a function of target type ; and soils not only exhibit the largest hydrogen signal, but also the largest variability ([1]; [2]). We aim here at obtaining an independent calibration of the LIBS signal, to better address 1) the difference of spatial scales (ChemCam constitutes a submillimiter probe) and 2) the multiple factors that can account for the variability of the hydrogen LIBS signal, including the variability of the water content itself. In the case of fine-grained soils, it is also important to better understand the hydrogen signal stemming from the volatile-rich amorphous phase detected by CheMin [3] in the < 150 m sieved fraction of the soil samples scooped from the Rocknest sand shadow. This amorphous phase contains 5 to 9 wt% of water-equivalent hydrogen, and represent 30 to 50 wt% of the < 150 m sieved fraction. Its H content may therefore vary significantly at the LIBS scale, unless its carrier is intimately mixed with non-hydrated phases. Finally, we aim at better constraining the variability of the H signal (or absence) with time, such as the possible day/night exchange of water vapor between the regolith and the atmosphere. For these purposes, we designed a preliminary experiment using JSC Mars 1 soil simulant to characterize the variation of the H line signal as a function of the amount of adsorbed water and as a function of grain size. Experimental Setup: JSC Mars 1 is a magnetic and VNIR spectral analog for martian soils [4]. It exhibits similarities not only in chemistry but also mineralogy: it is rich in x-ray amorphous phases allophane and ferrihydrite) which may be similar to the soils at Rocknest [3]. The loss on ignition (weight loss after heating 2 hours in air up to 900°C) is 21.8 wt.% [5] which is consistent with a strong volatile component. It contains a wide distribution of grain sizes below 1 mm. The soils were sieved in 5 different grain size fractions, vacuumdried at 100°C for 12 hours and left to ambiant humidity in aluminium scoops to gradually increase their water content. Thus the experiment was performed under ambient clean room pressure of 1 bar. Samples are described in table 1. To acquire LIBS spectra, the ChemCam EQM (Engineering Qualification Model), operated at 5°C,  was used. A 45° mirror directed the laser beam vertically onto the sample and thus adapted our facility to the analysis of soils. For each estimation of the H line intensity we acquired 5 observation points linearly spaced on the sample with each 50 LIBS spectra acquired at 3Hz (figure 2). On the last point passive spectra were acquired in order to subtract this background from the active spectra. Five series of such measurements were performed on each sample, respectively 2 hours, then 5 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours after the end of the drying process. The adsorption of water into the dried samples was monitored using a micro weight scale. We measured the weight for each series of shots with a precision of +/- 0.01 g.    Figure 1 : 2nd single point mean LIBS spectra showing H line on the third series of sample A. The line is broader as compared to martian spectra due to ambiant pressure. Dashed line represent the fit of the local continuum.  Data reduction: We calculated H line SBR (Signal over Background Ratio) using a process similar to [2]. After dark removal, the H line net peak area of the mean spectra is integrated over the 652 to 666 nm wavelengths region. The SBR is then computed using a fit of the baseline continuum (figure 1).

in figure 3 represent the standard deviation of the SBR over the 5 points acquired on each sample.     Figure 2 : Samples D (<40µm) and E (80-125µm) after the LIBS shots.  Results: Under ambient atmosphere, the adsorption of water is fast with a weight gain approaching equilibrium with ambient humidity only 12 hours after the drying process. When plotting SBR as a function of mass of water adsorbed we observe points distributed along a positive low-slope fit line that is similar from one sample to the other, as well as a high intercept related to the initial amount of hydrogen contained in the samples. Such preliminary results are found table 1 and figure 3. The intercept value results from the presence of OH hydroxyls in JSC Mars 1 (such as contained in allophane and ferrihydrite). We observe an SBR intercept value between 0.15 and 0.20 but an SBR value at equilibration of approaximately 0.25 except for sample D with a value of 0.6. Hence the potential nonlinearity of H signal and the initial amount of water should be investigated. Heterogeneity of the sample or of its water distribution could lead to variability of H line signal. Here we observe that its strength is correlated with water content.

Water gained is given as relative weight compared to the mass of dried samples.  Perspectives: These are preliminary results and other methods for data processing should be tested such as normalization, variations of passive spectra and single shot analysis. Also, the samples were dried using a simple process ; gradual dehydroxilation of the samples is necessary to better understand the initial H signal. Figure 4 shows the setup required to repeat the experiment under martian atmophere simulant and which results should help interpret data acquiered in martian soils. It would be also interesting to test this calibration process on several types of targets and determine ChemCam detection limit for water on several target types.
