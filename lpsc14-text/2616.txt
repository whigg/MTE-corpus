Introduction: Meteorites provide a range of "returned" samples from small bodies, Mars and the moon, that are otherwise difficult to obtain for laboratory analysis as geological specimens [1]. Studies of meteoritic samples provide information about materials and processes that were present in our solar system's protoplanetary disk [2] as well as on the formation of planetessimals and planetary bodies [3]. Modal mineralogy can also provide useful information regarding the physical properties of the parent bodies, important in predicting impact dynamics and collisional lifetimes of asteroids. Bulk density can be calculated using the modified Archimedian method [4] in a non-destructive manner. Combining this with a non-invasive method to determine grain density would provide density and porosity calculations with minimal contamination [5]. Four meteorites of various compositions and characteristics have been chosen for this study. Ozona, a highly weathered H6 chondrite [6], Gao-Guenie, an H5 chondrite [6, 7], Grimbsy, an H4-5 chondrite [8, 9] and NWA 5480 a coarse-grained olivine diogenite [10]. Methods: SEM/EDX examination was carried out with a LEO 440 SEM located at Surface Science Western, The University of Western Ontario. Crystal structural information was acquired in situ using a Bruker D8 Discover Micro-X-ray Diffractometer (Bruker-AXS, Inc., Madison, WI) at the University of Western Ontario [11]. Two laboratory micro-CT scanners were used in this study, chosen based on specimen size. Both a GE eXplore Locus (80 kVp and 0.45 mA) and GE eXplore speCZT (110 kVp and 40 mA) were utilized at the Robarts Research Institute at The University of Western Ontario. An instrumental beam hardening correction [12] was preformed prior to 3D image reconstruction.  Results: A CT slice along the surface of Ozona (Figure 1) shows the 2 phases (low and high) that are distinguishable by radiodensity in the CT volumes. Isosurfacing resulted in a total volume of 12768.52 mm3 for the sample, and a <1% volume/volume (v/v) content for the highdensity phase. Calculated volumes and volumetric percentages are summarized in Table 1.

This technique resulted in an estimated metallic content of 14.6% v/v from a total of 5341 points. A CT slice along the surface (Figure 2c), displays the two phases (metallic and nonmetallic) that are distinguishable by radiodensity in the CT volumes.

  resulted in a 14% v/v metallic content. Calculated volumes and volumetric percentages are shown in Table 2.  Table 2: Volumetric Analysis of Gao-Guenie Each of the three Grimsby samples provided high-resolution SEM backscattered electron (BSE) images as well as EDX elemental X-ray maps. In the CT volume there are two phases (low and high) that are uniquely distinguishable by radiodensity (Figure 3). Isosurfacing resulted in volumes and percentages as shown in Table 3. The low intensity phases correspond by EDX with silicates and the high with Fe-sulphide and FeNi metal; the olivine and pyroxene could not, however, be distinguished in these CT images.

Note that CT distinguishes between olivine and pyroxene. Diffraction patterns were collected at 10 locations on NWA 5480 (Figure 4a) summarized in Table 4. A CT slice along the surface (Figure 4b) shows the three phases (low, medium and high) that are distinguishable by radiodensity in the CT volumes. CT calculated volumes and volumetric percentages are shown in Table 5.  Table 4: NWA 5480 mineral Phases by µXRD  Table 5: Volumetric Analysis of NWA 5480 Discussion: Laboratory medical CT imaging can provide relatively high resolution 3D information on the distribution of density within meteorites. Following beam hardening correction, samples in the 10g range can provide reasonable estimates of "high" versus "medium" and "low" volumetric fractions of the whole volume. Medical CT imaging cannot reliably distinguish between sulphide and metal phases (both saturate) or often between silicates except in cases where the sample is coarse grained (e.g. NWA 5480). Simple, rapid volumetric analysis of meteorite samples is nevertheless possible (after suitable beam hardening correction) with even standard laboratory medical CT scanners.  References: [1] R.
