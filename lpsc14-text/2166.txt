Introduction:  Calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) are the oldest solids formed in our Solar System [1]. The mineralogy, petrology, bulk chemical and isotopic (O, Mg, Si) compositions of CAIs indicate that they formed in an16O-rich gas of approximately solar composition in a high-temperature nebular region (ambient temperature above ~1300 K) and a total pressure < 10−4 bar, most likely near the protoSun, as a result of evaporation/condensation and aggregation processes [2]. Subsequently, some CAIs experienced melting and evaporation. Although a duration of the CAI-forming epoch is not known yet, high-precision Al-Mg isotope measurements of CAIs from CV carbonaceous chondrites suggest that the CV CAI precursors formed by evaporation/condensation within a short period of time (< 0.01 Myr); the CAI melting events appear to have lasted for ~ 0.3 Myr [3−5]. The nature of the CAI melting events is not understood. Here, we describe bowlshaped coarse-grained igneous CAIs from the CV chondrite North West Africa (NWA) 3118 and NWA 5950. We infer that these CAIs were plastically deformed during a rapid transport through a low gaspressure environment while being molten. We suggest that these and possibly most igneous CAIs were melted by powerful shock waves generated by x-ray flares near the protoSun [6]. Results and Discussion: During our systematic search for large CAIs (suitable for U-Pb isotope dating) using x-ray microtomography, we discovered several bowl-shaped CAIs in CV chondrites NWA 3118 and NWA 5950. The bowl shape of the inclusions was confirmed by their subsequent sectioning (Fig. 1). These CAIs are 1N, 3N [7], 4N and X. Here we describe two of them, 1N and X. CAI 1N from NWA 3118 is a CTA/Type B inclusion composed of melilite and Al,Ti-diopside poikilitically enclosing spinel grains, and rare perovskite grains (Figs. 1a-e). It is surrounded by a sequence of the Wark-Lovering rim layers composed of spinel±hibonite, gehlenitic melilite, and Al,Ti-diopside. The mineralogy and WL rim thickness on the convex and concave sides of the CAI vary (Figs. 1d,e): on the convex side, the rim is thinner and has more gehleniticic melilite than on the concave side (Åk9±5 vs Åk13±5., respectively). Al-Mg isotope compositions of melilite, Al,Ti-diopside and spinel define an internal Al-Mg isochron with an initial 26Al/27Al  ratio of (4.64±0.09)×10−5 and MSWD of  1.5 [8]. CAI X from NWA 5950 is a Type B inclusion composed of melilite, anorthite, Al,Ti-diopside, spinel, and rare grains of perovskite and Fe,Ni-metal (Fig. 1f). The CAI is surrounded by the WL rim composed of hibonite±spinel, melilite, and Al,Ti-diopside. The mineralogy and WL rim thickness on the convex and concave sides of the CAI vary (Fig. 2). On the convex side, the rim contains less spinel, more hibonite and more gehlenitic melilite than the rim on the concave side (Åk7±2. vs Åk30±2, respectively). Spinel is heterogeneously distributed within the inclusion: the convex part contains fewer spinel than the concave part; in addition, there is a layer of coarse spinel grains parallel to the WL rim layers around the convex part (Fig. 1f).  Recently, Lorenz et al. [9] proposed a model of aerodynamic deformation of igneous CAIs. According to this model, the CAIs were plastically deformed during a rapid transport through a low pressure nebular gas (Fig. 3). The high surface tension of alumosilicate melts imposes a limit on the minimum velocity of a melted sphere to be aerodynamically deformed: a spherical melt droplet can be deformed to a disk shape if its velocity is high enough to overcome surface tension and viscosity of the melt. Using the minimal and maximal values of surface tension of alumosilicate melt, 0.3 and 0.6 J m2, respectively, for a 1 cm sphere moving through a gas at a total pressure of 10-4, 10-5, or 10-6 bar, the minimum velocity allowing the aerodynamic deformation would be ~6 and 8.5, 19.5 and 27, and 60 and 85 km s-1, respectively. Our calculations indicate that a distance over which the molten CAI droplet becomes plastically deformed to a bowl-shaped object twice larger in diameter than the original sphere (as observed in CAIs studied), is much shorter than the CAI stopping distance: e.g., for a 1 cm melt sphere moving through gas at total pressure of 10-4 bar at 8.5 km s−1, these distances are ~0.7 and 2×104 km, respectively. These results indicate that molten CAIs were deformed shortly after an accelerating event. After melting, acceleration and deformation of bowl-shaped CAIs, they must have quickly cooled down to a temperature at which the increased viscosity terminated the deformation and prevented restoration of the spherical shape of CAIs due to surface tension. We infer that the bowl-shaped CAIs must have been melted during high2166.pdf

ly-energetic transient heating events, possibly by shock waves, in their formation region. We suggest that the shock waves near the protoSun could have been produced by x-ray flares, capable of generating shock waves up to 100 km s-1 [6]. According to this model, the refractory layers of the Wark-Lovering rims composed of hibonite, spinel, perovskite, and gehlenitic melilite, resulted from evaporation of the host CAIs during their shock wave heating. The outermost layers  composed of Al-diopside and forsterite formed by subsequent condensation. No age difference between the WL rim formation and crystallization of the host CAIs is expected. This could be tested by in situ Al-Mg isotope measurements of the WL rims and host CAIs. This work was supported by the Program 22 RAS. References: [1] Connelly J. N. et al.
