Kramer2, 1Rice University, Department of Physics, Houston, TX, 2Lunar and Planetary Institute, Houston,TX, (johnson@lpi.usra.edu), (kramer@lpi.usra.edu).Introduction:  The purpose of this project is to determine the occurrence and attributes of secondarycraters from a single primary crater with limited analytical complications from influences that would alterthe surface after the impact event, such as subsequentimpact cratering and atmospheric weathering. To dothis, we searched for craters who have an incrediblylow or complete lack of craters within the crater bowl.Such a lack of craters would be evidence that the crateris recent enough to not have had time to accumulateany subsequent primary impacts and allows us to beconfident that any craters we observe on the crater'sejecta blanket are exclusively the secondary craterscreated when these impacts occurred. The lessonslearned from this study could provide valuable information to improve our understanding of the impact cratering process [1] and dating of planetary surfaces using crater size frequency techniques [2, 3, 4]. At thetime of writing this abstract, we completed analysis oftwo lunar craters:Linné.  A 2.4 km diameter crater in west MareSerenitatis, located at 27.7°N 11.8°E. Linné has a relatively high albedo ejecta blanket compared to the surrounding mare basalts. There are numerous large boulders in the ejecta blanket, with many around 15 to 20meters in length. One of the prominent features in theejecta layer of Linné is the unusual rippling pattern inits proximal and extended ejecta blanket.Eimmart A.  A crater on the rim of Eimmart, whichis a crater on the rim of Mare Crisium. It is located at24.1°N and 65.65°E. It is roughly 7.3 km in diameter.Eimmart A is flanked to the west by the wall and edgeof Eimmart and to the east by the basalt rock of MareCrisium.Despite the plethora of secondary craters observable in both of the craters' continuous ejecta blankets,the crater bowls lack any resolvable impact craters.Secondary impacts would be expected to occur withinthe perimeter of the transient crater, and during theearly stages of modification. However, slumping andcollapse of the crater walls would continue long afterthe return of the ejected material, and thus destroy anyevidence of such secondaries.Data and Methodology:  Analysis used data fromLunar Reconnaissance Orbiter's (LRO) Narrow AngleCamera (NAC). Mosaiced images and DEMs were cre ated with USGS Integrated Software for Imager andSpectrometers (ISIS) and NASA Ames Stereo Pipeline(ASP). The horizontal spatial resolution of the LinneNAC mosaic is 0.5 meter/pixel, and the DEM is 2 meters/pixel. The NAC image for Eimmart A has a horizontal resolution of 1 meter/pixel, the DEM is 5 meters/pixel. The Environment for Visualizing Images(ENVI) was used to determine the precise area of themapped ejecta blanket.Each crater's ejecta blanket was mapped out to ~1crater diameter from the rim. The specific boundarywas based on a combination of the DEM and on morphology. For quantitive analysis, a circle with a diameter of 3 crater radii was centered on the crater. This cir cle was divided into 8 equal pie-slice sections. A circlecontaining the crater bowl and subtracted from each 8sections makes up a 9th section. For each section wemapped easily recognized craters, which all turned outto be >12x the resolution of the NAC mosaic. This wasdone to evaluate the uniformity of secondary craterdensity around the primary crater and ensure that theselection of the focus region would be representative ofthe region. No craters were observed in the 9 th section(bowl) of either crater.A circle of diameter = 1000 pixels was selected fordetailed analysis from approximately midway betweenthe crater rim and perimeter of the continuous ejectaFigure 1: (Right) NAC mosaic of the analyzed primaryimpact craters, Linne (a) and Eimmart A (b).

blanket and that had a representative secondary craterdensity (Fig. 1). Every resolvable crater within this circle was counted and binned by size, where each binrepresented a range of 4 pixels (Fig. 1).Results:  For both studied craters, the binned cratercounts show the distribution curve expected for a standard particle size distribution, with the exception of thesmallest bin size. We calculated an expected crater sizefrequency for the smallest bin size using the midpointdiameter for each bin. Tables 1 and 2 show the resultsfor Linné and Eimmart A, respectively, of the binnedcraters counted from the representative region, themodeled count for the smallest bin, and the values extrapolated for the entire continuous ejecta blanket. Figure 2 shows the plot of the curves.Conclusion:  We attribute the deviation of thesmallest bin size from the expected distribution to because the size range is too close to the spatial resolution of the data set. We do not believe the deviation ofthe first bin reflects a lower limit to the size of sec ondary craters created [e.g., 5] or that survive the debris surge [e.g., 6] from a primary impact for two reasons: 1) the distribution of particle sizes in crater ejectais expected to increase asymptotically with decreasinggrain size, and 2) if there was such a limit, we wouldexpect to see the curve turn over at some point whenlooking at smaller bin size. The results from Linné donot show such a downturn despite having much betterspatial resolution (both absolutely and proportionally)than Eimmart A. Instead, the count increases with decreasing bin size, until the smallest bin size, suggestingthe apparentdownturn is aconsequenceof data resolution.Interestingly, despitethe evidencethat virtuallya l l c r a t e r sc o u n t e d a tLinné a n dEim ma r t Aare their respective secondaries, theindividualcraters exhibited varyinggrades of apparent degradation, that is,s o m e r i m shaving prominent crests, while others being very subdued. We assume this reflects difference in time between formation, albeit on a severely limited period oftime. That the more subdued craters landed early andwere partly covered by fine particle debris, while themore prominent secondary craters landed later. However, we recognize that this hypothesis contradictswhat is understood about ballistic trajectories of impactrater ejecta.We were surprised to find almost 106 secondary impact craters that could be resolved in orbital remotesensing data from LRO NAC for these simple lunarcraters. In addition, the observed variations in cratermorphology, that would typically be attributed todegradation by resurfacing over time, may explain apparent inconsistencies in models that use crater sizefrequency distributions. Although these secondaries arevery small impact craters, our instruments are improving our ability to observe them and making it increasingly difficult to ignore them. The results from thisstudy has specific relevance for calculations meant toadjust crater counting results to account for secondaries counted as part of a surface dating analysis.
