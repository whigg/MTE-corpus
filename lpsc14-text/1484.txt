Determining the Age and Physical Properties of Martian Lobate Debris Aprons using High-resolution Topography, SHARAD Observations, and Numerical Ice Flow Modeling: A case study at Euripus Mons Reid Parsons1,John W. Holt2, 1Fitchburg State University, (rparson4@fitchburgstate.edu) 2Institute for Geophysics, University ofTexas at AustinIntroduction: Martian lobate debris aprons (LDAs)provide evidence of a past hydrologic cycle that was capable of redistributing large quantities of water ice fromthe poles to the mid-latitudes likely driven by obliquityinduced changes in insolation [1]. LDAs are massiveice deposits, ≥ 300 m thick [2,3] protected by a 10s ofmeters thick [4] regolith layer that are preserved in several regions in the northern (e.g. Protonilus/DeuteronilusMensae) and southern (e.g. East of Hellas and SouthernArgyre) mid-latitudes on Mars.Figure 1: Topography and imagery of Euripus Mons and theice flow model setup. a) Google Mars visible imagery of Euripus Mons (gray images are CTX) overlain by HRSC topography contours (200 m interval). Thick black dashed and dottedlines denote the ice flow drainage basins for the northern andsouthern LDAs; the blue and green lines indicate HRSC topographic profiles used for comparison with our ice flow model.A SHARAD radar track used to check the basal slope predictedfrom the model is given by the thick, solid black line. b) LDAtopographic profile (blue line, left axis) for the northern Euripus LDA. The thick solid line, and the right axis give the flowwidth measured perpendicular to the blue topographic profile.The dashed lines give the basal slopes of 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5◦. Theshaded regions indicate the zone of precipitation and domain ofthe model that is compared to the HRSC topography. Note theice volume under the observed HRSC topography depends onthe assumed basal slope and requires that the total volume ofice to change for each of the three simulations.By combining observations of LDA topography derived from HRSC images, basal topography constrainedby SHARAD, and numerical simulations of ice flow, wecan place limits on the formation timescale and the rheologic properties of the ice by comparing the topography generated from ice flow simulations with the observed topography of LDAs. We focus on a location tothe East of Hellas Basin, Euripus Mons, where a number of SHARAD observations have constrained the basalslopeIn this paper, we focus on the model analysis of theNorthern Euripus LDA. Given the proximity of the northern and southern LDAs found at Euripus (Fig. 1a), it isreasonable to assume that they share the same ice composition and age - future analysis of adjacent deposits willtest this idea.Observations: Euripus Mons is a 4 km mountain located east of Hellas Basin surrounded by a 20 km wideapron of coallesced LDA deposits. Figure 1a providesvisual imagery of our study site shown in Google Earth.The gray CTX images capture ice flow features such ascompression folds and longitudinal ridges indicative ofviscous ice flow. Topographic contours derived fromHRSC image 2345 0000 are overlain with an intervalof 200 m basin. The high resolution (75 m per pixel)HRSC topography in combination with the flow featuresobserved in CTX help us to delineate the ice drainagecatchment shown by the thick, black dashed and dottedlines in Fig.1a.A SHARAD radar ground track is shown in Fig. 1aand the elevation of the reflected signal is given by thesmall black dots in Fig.1 b - providing an additional constraint on the model.Numerical Approach and Assumptions: Our glacialflow model simulates changes in ice thickness as iceflows outward over a flat or sloping surface in 1-D with aresolution of 75 m while accounting for influences fromice grain size, temperature, dust fraction, and the magnitude of the applied differential stress in driving viscous deformation. This model incorporates data from recent ice deformation experiments which show a changein the the rheology of ice at different applied stresses,ice grain sizes, and temperatures (these are variables inour model) [5]. Although the ice grain size is relativelyunconstrained in LDAs, the lower stress (due to lowergravity) and also lower temperatures (< 255 K) on Marsindicate that the appropriate ice flow is different for Marsthan Earth [5]. For more details regarding the model see[6,7].Numerical Simulation: Two observations are usedas inputs into the numerical model: (1) An HRSC topographic profile of the LDA and the upland region thatrepresents the ice drainage catchment, and (2) the geometry of the ice drainage catchment.The model uses the observed LDA profile and anassumed basal slope (0.5, 1.0, or 1.5◦ for the LDA onnorthern Euripus Mons) to determine the total model ice1484.pdf

2volume to be used in a given simulation by subtractingthe basal slope from the LDA surface. The model domain consists of 500 discrete elements and starts out icefree, gradually accumulating ice at a rate of 5 mm/yr over82 model cells (6150 m) on the headward scarp (Fig. 1b)during the beginning of the simulation until the total icevolume (specific to the assumed basal slope) is reached.After precipitation ceases, ice is conserved (no ablation)- making our timescale estimates biased toward largervalues because we are simulating ice flow with the minimum ice volume. As an accumulated ice deposit flowsdownslope, the numerical model accounts for flow divergence/convergence due to changes in flow width whichbased on the geometry of the ice drainage catchment(Fig. 1a,b). No flow is allowed in or out of the domain,and the horizontal velocity at the base of the ice is set tozero (no basal sliding).Comparing the model to observations: A sequenceof model-generated topographic profiles (Z ′(x, t)) takenduring different times are compared with the obseverdtopographic profile (Z(x)) in order to calculate the misfit and determine model-predicted age for the LDA giventhe specified ice rheology. The misfit, or "Standard Error" (Ste) isSte =1l√√√√ l∑i=0(Z ′i − Zi)2 (1)where i denotes an element in the array of HRSC elevation profile values and l is the total number of elements.Ice with a grain size of 5 mm and a temperature of 205 K,flowing over a 0.5◦, 1.0◦, or 1.5◦ sloping surface produces the misfit error progression shown in Fig. 2a.Figure 2: Comparison of model results to the HRSC topographic profile. a) Calculated misfit (Ste) between the observedand simulated topographic profile as flow progresses for a basalslope of 0.5◦ (dotted line), 1.0◦ (dashed line), and 1.5◦ (solidline). The lowest Ste value for each case is indicated in the legend. b) Comparison of best-fits for each basal slope case. Thethick line is an HRSC topographic profile (blue line in Fig. 1a).Ice flowing over the shallower sloping surface produces a best-fit match at an earlier time than the steeperslopes due to the larger overall ice volume (see Fig.1b)resulting in a thicker ice deposit with a higher rate offlow. Flow over a 1◦ basal slope produces the bestfit with the observations after 155 Myrs of flow usingan ice grain size of 5 mm and a temperature of 205 K.The model-generated best-fit topographic profiles for thethree basal slope cases are plotted together with theHRSC observations in Fig.2b to provide a visual indication of the degree of fit. The model-predicted basalslope of 1◦ is confirmed by SHARAD data which clusteraround a surface sloping at that value (Fig. 1b).The ice rheology versus LDA age trade-off: Ourmodel, together with observations from SHARAD canbetter constrain the basal slope of LDA deposits. Themodel can place additional constraints on either the ageof the LDA (if we assume an ice rheology) or the rheology (if we assume an age). This trade-off is depicted inFig.3 where the age of the northern Euripus LDA is plotted (as contours) as a function of ice temperature (y-axis)and ice grain size (x-axis). The black squares indicatelocations of this parameter space where we've conductednumerical simulations to compare with northern Euripusand the associated number gives the flow timescale, inMyrs, when the simulation produces the best-fit with theobserved topographic profile. The contours were produced by multiplying the model's ice viscosity by a factor which reproduced the ages given by the three simulations shown. LDA ages constrained by crater counts(principally Dueteronilus Mensae) give ages between 40and 500 Myrs [8, 9], and are indicated by the shaded region in Fig.3.Further numerical simulations tailored to specificlocations will provide more insight into whether thesame ice viscosity will produce the same best-fit flowtimescales for LDAs in different locations. This workwill (1) place tight constraints on the subsurface topography below LDAs, (2) help to determine whether differences exist in the model-predicted rheology or age ofLDAs among a local group or between different regions.Figure 3: Calculated flow timescales (numbers next to boxesin millions of years) to produce the best match with the observations for different ice rheologies used in our ice flow simulations over a 1.0◦ sloping surface. Calibrating those timescalesto the viscosity used in our numerical model gives the gray contour lines for different ice grain sizes (x-axis) and ice temperatures (y-axis).References: [1] Laskar, J., et al.
