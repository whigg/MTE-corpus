It can be seen as one of theremaining examples of the intermediate stages ofplanetary accretion, which additionally is substantiallydifferent from most asteroids. Studies of such protoplanetary objects like Ceres and Vesta provide insightinto the history of the formation of Earth and otherrocky planets. One of Ceres' remarkable properties isthe relatively low average bulk density of 2077±36 kgm-3 (see [1]). Assuming a nearly chondritic composition, this low value can be explained either by a relatively high average porosity[2], or by the presence of alow density phase [3,4]. Based on numerical modelling[3,4], it has been proposed that this low densityphase, which may have been represented initially bywater ice or by hydrated silicates, differentiated fromthe silicates forming an icy mantle overlying a rockycore. However, the shape and the moment of inertia ofCeres seem to be consistent with both a porous and adifferentiated structure. In the first case Ceres wouldbe just a large version of a common asteroid. In thesecond case, however, this body could exhibit properties characteristic for a planet rather than an asteroid:presence of a core, mantle and crust, as well as a liquidocean in the past and maybe still a thin basal oceantoday. This issue is still under debate, but will be resolved (at least partially), once Dawn orbits Ceres.We study the thermal evolution of a Ceres-likebody via numerical modeling in order to draw conclusions about the thermal metamorphism of the interiorand its present-day state. In particular, we investigatethe evolution of the interior assuming an initially porous structure. Our model is suited to prioritise between the two possible structures mentioned above andto constrain the present-day state of Ceres' interior.Model: We adopted the numerical model from [5],which computes the thermal and structural evolution ofplanetesimals, including compaction of the initiallyporous primordial material.Our calculations start with a homogeneous coldbody which has a uniform average porosity of 50 %.Following [2], we assume a CI carbonaceouschondritic composition with the associated amount ofshort- and long-lived radioactive elements. This porousbody is larger than Ceres because of the high initialporosity value upon accretion. Upon heating, the compaction of the initially porous material is modeled via acreep law (see Eqn. (1)). Assuming a certain instanceof formation t0 relative to the formation of the calciumaluminium-rich inclusions (CAIs), the main goal is tocheck, whether at the end of a simulation (corresponding to the present day) the body would match the radius of Ceres and whether it would have an average porosity of 10 %, which matches the average density of2100 kg m-3.The heat conduction equation is solved in radialsymmetry, where parameters depend on the composition. Furthermore, the bulk thermal conductivity andthe heat source density are functions of porosity, andthe specific heat capacity changes with the temperature. Assuming an initial porosity of 50 % and the intrinsic geometry which is described by the simple cubic packing of spherical grains, the model computesporosity loss as a temperature and pressure dependentprocess:31log(1 ) e , (1)n E RTBbt  with porosity ϕ, time t, a constant B ≈ 4.0×10-5, initialgrain size b, effective stress σ1, constant n ≈ 3/2, activation energy E, gas constant R and temperature T.The creep activation energy E is adjusted upon thecompaction of the single minerals in a CI carbonaceous chondritic composition according to their volume fractions.Results: Figure 1 shows the average porosity asfunction of the formation time t0 in a Ceres-like body.Formation times of up to 60 Ma relative to the CAIshave been considered. Even for t0 = 60 Ma, the averageporosity falls far below 10 %. Locally, it is reduced tozero except in an outer shell with the thickness of up to60 km. In this shell the porosity varies between zero inthe compacted region and 50 % at the surface. For t0 >8 Ma, the loss of porosity is mainly due to the heatingby the long-lived nuclides. These results are somewhatpredetermined by the choice of the initial porosity:smaller initial value of 40 % leads to smaller final average porosities.The main factor which determines the degree ofcompaction of Ceres is the amount of the heating experienced during the evolution. The interior temperatures and the peak temperature vary with the formationtime. In all simulations the water ice melting temperature was exceeded. This means that if the water hadbeen present in the free state, liquid water must haveformed, making hydration of the silicate minerals2055.pdf

Fig. 1. Present average porosity predicted for different formation times of Ceres assuming heating by short- or / and long-livednuclides. Here, instantaneous accretion is used as an approximationof the continuous runaway accretion. However, the accreting material in the form of smaller planetesimals could be already pre-heatedand pre-compacted. This could have increased the effectiveness ofcompaction of the early Ceres. Thus, the final average porositiesobtained from our calculations serve possibly as an overestimate ofthe actual one.possible. For t0 < 10 Ma, peak central temperature of500 K was exceeded, allowing for the melting of hydrated silicates and also dehydration, followed possibly by the water-rock differentiation. For even earlierformation, the solidus temperature of the iron phase of1213 K (for t0 ≤ 3 Ma) and even that of the silicatephase of 1425 K (t0 ≤ 2 Ma) were exceeded. Production of iron and silicate melts could result in the differentiation of an iron core and silicate mantle below thewater ocean.Since in the late-forming cases no iron or silicatemelt is produced, in those simulations where a substantial part of Ceres is porous, no differentiation can beexpected at all. On the other hand, formation withinthe first few million years after the CAIs would mostprobably result in a layered structure with varying degree of differentiation, but the compaction would bealmost complete.Conclusions: Our results imply that even for ahigh initial porosity of 50 % and late formation timesof up to 60 Ma after the CAIs, Ceres ultimately compacts due to hot pressing down to an average porosityof approximately 6 %. This argues against the suggestion that the low density of Ceres can be explained bya porous structure[2]. A preliminary study by [6] confirms this result. However, a more systematic studywhich would consider the variation of the bulk densitywithin the error bar of ±36 kg and additionally continuous accretion is needed (similar to the one performed in [7]) to exclude this case completely. Thefinal confirmation will probably be provided by Dawn.If so, a low-density phase (water ice or hydratedsilicates) should be introduced. The interior temperatures calculated in our simulations allow production ofliquid water around the centre of Ceres for any formation time and even production of iron and silicate meltsfor an early formation. However, this is not sufficientto conclude a differentiated structure. Self-consistentnumerical modelling of the differentiation processes(water-rock and metal-silicate) is needed in order toconstrain the sizes of the single layers. Thereby, relevant processes like amorphous to crystalline ice transition, melting of ice, hydrothermal convection, hydration and dehydration of silicates, differentiation of iceand silicates, silicate and iron melting, which wouldmost certainly influence the differentiation, must beconsidered.Taken together, Ceres seems to be an ice-rich bodywhich which may have an at least partially differentiated structure with a rocky core and an ice mantle.Thus, it should be placed among the bodies whereplanetary processes operated significantly, alteringprimive interior and possibly surface composion andcharacteristics, by contrast to most Main belt members,which appear to consist of (relatively) primitive material.Acknowledgement: This work was supported bythe Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) PriorityProgramme 1385 "The First 10 Million Years of theSolar System - a Planetary Materials Approach" andby the Helmholtz Association through the researchalliance "Planetary Evolution and Life".[1] Thomas, C.
