Introduction: The Hayabusa spacecraft was launched in May 2003 to rendezvous with Apollo-type NEA (25143) Itokawa and bring back a sample to the Earth. The spacecraft arrived at the asteroid in September 2005 and spent three months collecting science data in a station-keeping heliocentric orbit. The spacecraft instrument package included the Asteroid Multiband Imaging Camera (AMICA), the Near Infrared Spectrometer (NIRS), the X-ray Spectrometer (XRS), the Lidar altimeter (LIDAR), the surface hopper (MINERVA) and sample collection and return systems.  NIRS is a 64-channel grating infrared point spectrometer (0.76-2.25 µm) with a spectral resolution of 24 nm. The field of view is 0.1 x 0.1 degrees and it has a spatial resolution of 17 x 17 meters at a distance of 10 km. During operations, NIRS made onedimensional latitudinal scans with the target point fixed on Itokawa [1]. The original objective of NIRS was to map the surface composition and distribution of minerals at tens of meters spatial scales. NIRS wavelength range (0.76-2.25 µm) complements that of AMICA (0.38-1.0 µm). While NIRS wavelength range spans 0.76-2.25 µm, in reality the usable range is 0.852.1 µm due to cutoff in detector sensitivity at the lower and higher wavelength ends of the spectrum.  Ground-based observations [2] and analysis of samples returned by the Hayabusa spacecraft [3] have confirmed the LL chondrite composition of Itokawa. While laboratory calibrations to extract olivine and pyroxene compositions from near-IR reflectance spectra (0.7-2.5 !m) of S-type asteroids currently exist [4], detailed analysis of NIRS data could not be accomplished till now due to its limited wavelength range (0.85-2.1 µm). The NIRS data has only been analyzed using simple 'curve matching' technique to link the surface composition of Itokawa to LL chondrites [5]. Our goal is to derive a set of calibration equations in order to extract olivine and pyroxene compositions from NIRS data and map their distribution across the surface of Itokawa.  Methodology: The laboratory data set we used is from [4] and consists of near-IR spectra of 38 samples of H, L and LL chondrites currently archived on the RELAB database. The RELAB spectra (0.32-2.5 !m) were resampled to NIRS wavelength (0.76-2.25 !m). Then, spectral band parameters were extracted after normalizing the spectra at 1.5!m and by dividing its convex hull in order to remove the continuum [7]. We used laboratory XRD measurements of fayalite (olivine) and ferrosilite (pyroxene) mineral compositions (mol.%) from [4] for all 38 samples. By plotting the measured Fs and Fa values as a function of Band I center (Figure 1 and 2) we show a clear correlation between the two parameters that can be best described by two polynomial fits (Eq. 1 and 2).   Fa = -790.3 x (Band I Center)2 + 1649.7 x (Band I Center) - 830.3 (Eq. 1)  Fs = -521.7 x (Band I Center)2 + 1094.8 x (Band I Center) - 549.1 (Eq. 2) The correlation coefficient (R2) is 0.93 for fayalite and 0.92 for ferrosilite (Figures 3 and 4).  Note that temperature corrections should be made to the Band I center calculated from spacecraft data before applications of Eq. 1 and 2 [6]. We tested these equations on 10 randomly selected spectra of ordinary chondrites with laboratory measured Fa and Fs values. The 1-" uncertainty between the measured and the spectrally derived Fa and Fs values we obtained is 1.6 and 1.4 mol. %, respectively for equations 1 and 2.  Future work: We are currently developing a photometric model to correct the NIRS data archived on the PDS Small Bodies node for the effect of illumination conditions. Following this, we intend to apply Eq. 1 and 2 to the NIRS data set to be able to map the fayalite and ferrosilite distribution and identify any subtle compositional variations on Itokawa.
