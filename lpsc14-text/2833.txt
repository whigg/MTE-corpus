 INSIGHTS INTO THE PRISTINITY OF UNBRECCIATED EUCRITES Jasmeet K. Dhaliwal and James M. D. Day, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UCSD, 9500 Gilman Dr., La Jolla, CA 92093, USA (correspondence: jasmeetd@ucsd.edu).  Introduction: The unbrecciated eucrites are a subset of the HED (howardite-eucrite-diogenite) suite of meteorites, which are linked through oxygen isotopes [1] and thought to originate from one or more asteroids in the Vestoid family [2, 3]; this does not, however, preclude an origin from other non-Vesta asteroids [4]. Unbrecciated eucrites are particularly promising for understanding metal-silicate differentiation and magmatic evolution on the HED parent body(ies) because they are often considered to be free from postcrystallization disturbances (i.e., impact contamination). Prior petrologic and geochemical studies, however, have suggested that some unbrecciated eucrites show evidence for impact modification and so may not represent pristine cumulate and basaltic melts from their parent body(ies) (e.g. [5-8]).  In this preliminary petrologic study, we investigate signatures of brecciation, metamorphism or alteration in the following unbrecciated eucrites: ALH 81001, 15; QUE 97014, 13; BTN 00300, 17; GRA 98098, 13; PCA 82502, 94, CMS 04049, 27. Methods: Petrography and mapping of polished thin sections was performed using a Nikon Eclipse petrographic microscope housed at the Scripps Isotope Geochemistry Laboratory (SIGL). Trace-element abundances of bulk samples are being obtained using Paar-Bomb digestion and an iCAPq C ICP-MS.   Petrographic Descriptions: ALHA 81001, 15 is a fine-grained (~0.1 mm) rock and exhibits a vitrophyric and quenched texture with evidence for shock and brecciation, and small, approximately evenlydistributed opaques throughout the sample (Figure 1). Our findings are qualitatively consistent with earlier studies [7-9] suggesting that this eucrite may, in fact, be an impact melt. It is unclear whether it was subject to anatexsis, or also witnessed impact contamination. BTN 00300, 17 is a coarse-grained (~0.2 mm) stone, with a largely uniform cumulate texture, but shows unique and unusual zoning in the pyroxenes that may be indicative of shock. The opaques are largely clusters, often occurring in secondary or granoblastic textures suggesting that they may be associated with later metamorphism or addition. Thaisen & Taylor [10] described BTN 00300, 26 and reported that the sample had not undergone sufficient shock to transform the plagioclase to maskelynite; the sample examined here also lacks indicators of impact melting. QUE 97014, 13 exhibits a grain-supported cumulate network of mostly irregular olivine and plagioclase crystals, with significant areas of presumed Fe-   Figure 1: (upper left) BTN 00300, 17  reflected light image showing occurrence of opaques within granoblastic texture.

Although there are few opaques within the sample, they largely occur adjacent to fine-grained (~0.02 mm) granoblastic regions that are distributed, relatively homogenously, throughout the sample.   GRA 98098, 13 is particularly unusual, as it shows variable texture and a bimodal distribution of grainsizes (~0.05 mm - 0.2 mm), with granoblastic regions indicative of metamorphism.  In addition, the texture of the opaques suggests that they are late-stage, rather than representative of the indigenous bulk rock composition. The plagioclase grains also display highly variable birefringence and zoning, suggesting shock. Both Mittlefehldt & Lee [11] and Bogard & Garrison [6] consider this eucrite to be recrystallized, and Sarafian et al. [12] suggests later metamorphism resulted from either infiltration by a high temperature fluid or from a residual melt.   PCA 82502, 94 is a fine-grained basalt (~0.02 mm), with fractures running throughout the sample.  There are micron-sized opaques within the sample, but they seem more evenly distributed and are largely free of clustering. The Ar-Ar ages suggest resetting by Antarctic weathering versus late bombardment [6].  This sample seems to be the least impact-modified of this suite of unbrecciated eucrites that we have studied. Additionally, it has the lightest zinc isotope ratio (δ66Zn = 7.75 ‰; [13]); if the petrogenesis and pristinity of this eucrite can be established, it may prove central to understanding volatile depletion on planetary bodies. CMS 04049, 27 has been previously reported on [14] and is unusual because of the presence of a large mesostasis region and high sulfide content within the sample. The mesostasis region has been interpreted as either a primary texture resulting from immiscibility and slow-cooling, or the result of secondary melting from thermal metamorphism during impact [14].  This initial petrography will benefit from concurrent geochemical analyses that may shed greater light on the thermal history of this sample. Discussion: As some of the oldest cumulate and basaltic melts in the solar system [15, 16], eucrites are important in understanding the differentiation histories of planetary bodies.  This preliminary petrographic analysis of six unbrecciated eucrites highlights the complicated thermal histories of the samples. Beginning with petrography, we seek to reexamine the unbrecciated eucrites in order to identify a subset of pristine eucrites, free from impact contamination; this is analogous to the pristinity criteria that have been established for lunar rocks [17, 18].   Petrographic indicators of possible impact processing include brecciation, granoblastic regions, vitrophyric texture, and shock.  A thorough understanding of primary and granoblastic textures, the location of siderophile-rich (i.e. metals, sulfides) and volatile-rich (i.e. apatites) phases within them, and mineral zoning and alteration is integral to understanding the crystallization histories of the unbrecciated eucrites. For samples that display signatures of thermal metamorphism, we seek to identify whether these occur through processes indigenous to the HED parent body(ies) or have been subject to impact alteration and/or contamination.   Petrography is an important first step in recognizing pristine eucrite samples.  Alongside geochemical data (e.g. low Ni/Co ratios in FeNi metals), petrographic indicators of pristinity will be invaluable for the interpretation of geochemical signatures, such as siderophile [8] and volatile [12, 13] element abundances, and whether they represent un-altered eucrite compositions, or later impact additions (e.g., [19]).  The identification of a subset of pristine unbrecciated eucrites  that will unequivocally represent primary geochemical signatures may be central in understanding the petrogenesis of the eucrites and the magmatic evolution of their parent body(ies).
