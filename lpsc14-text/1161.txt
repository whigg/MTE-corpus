The impacts that formed these basins delivered a large amount of heat to the planetary interior, modified the pattern of mantle convection [3,4], and suppressed core cooling [5,6], potentially contributing to the cessation of dynamo activity [7,8].  Heating from the largest impacts can be felt at the core-mantle boundary (CMB) or below.  Here, we investigate the thermal evolution of Mars in response to heating by a basin-forming impact, using coupled models of mantle convection and parameterized core cooling. The core temperature stratifies after impact heating, largely erasing lateral variations [5,6]. We exploit this symmetry and couple a 1-D parameterization of core cooling to 2-D axisymmetric mantle convection models. This allows us to more accurately model the thermal evolution of both core and mantle simultaneously, when the core is not necessarily adiabatic and convecting [9]. A by-product is a better estimate of the time scale for restoration of postimpact core dynamo activity. The history of the dynamo is crucial for understanding atmospheric evolution, and habitability of the surface. The disappearance of the magnetic field exposes the early atmosphere to solar wind activity, and therefore has implications for climate evolution, and the initiation of life.   Core-Mantle Coupling: The chief difficulty in coupling core and mantle models is that the vast differences in material properties of solid mantle rock and core fluid, and of the relevant timescales. Most studies consider either the core or the mantle alone and treat the other layer as a boundary condition. Here, we investigate the heating by a large impact that instantaneously changes the temperature structure in the interior, and the thermal coupling of the core and mantle while both are simultaneously cooling. We model mantle convection using the finite element code Citcom in 2D axisymmetric geometry [14], appropriate for a single vertical impact scenario. At the time of an impact we introduce a temperature perturbation resulting from shock heating into the core and mantle [10-12]. We ignore the melt and restrict the mantle  temperature to the solidus [4]. Because lateral mixing and stratification of the core occurs very quickly compared to mantle dynamics [5], we assume the core temperature varies only radially. At a given timestep, we fix the mantle temperature and solve the 1D enthalpy equation in the core and lower thermal boundary layer (TBL) of the mantle over a time corresponding to a mantle timestep. We then update the temperature at the CMB and TBL, and let the mantle convection progress for another timestep. We continue this iteration until the core temperature becomes almost adiabatic and the entire core is convecting. Mantle convection then proceeds while the cooling core retains an adiabatic temperature. Results: The impact heating penetrates deeply into the interior, heating the mantle and the outer core. The core stratifies quickly, such that there is an extremely hot, thin layer at the top of the core, underlain by more modest temperature increases in the deeper core. The impact-heated mantle is buoyant and develops into an upwelling, which quickly spreads into a warm layer beneath the stagnant lid. This warm layer serves as a "thermal blanket", insulating the interior [8], but decays as the heat is eventually conducted through the lithosphere on a timescale of several My. Snapshots of the temperature structure of the interior are shown in Figure 1 immediately before and up to 900 My after the vertical impact of a 1000-km diameter rocky projectile at 10 km/s. Upon stratification of the core, the temperature just below the CMB may exceed 3000K. This hot layer insulates the interior, and the stratification renders the core stable to convection. The top of the core cools into the mantle, and the lower mantle material is swept into the large hemispheric upwelling. The thermal blanket at the top of the core disappears after only a few tens of My. Further core cooling results in formation of a convecting zone at the top of the core (Figure 2) that propagates downwards as the thermal gradient becomes adiabatic at greater depths. The magnetic Reynolds number (Rm) of the convecting outer core exceeds the threshold value for the resumption of dynamo activity (Rm â‰¥ 10) after about 140 My (Figure 3), when the outer 300 km of the core is convecting. However, the core does not become fully convective again until several hundred My later. Conclusions: Our results suggest that a large basinforming impact results in stable stratification of the core, insulating the inner core and halting core convection. The shock heating from such an impact forms a hemispheric upwelling beneath the impact site. The hot core creates a low-viscosity channel at the base of the mantle, which funnels the heat from the core into the 1161.pdf

hemispheric upwelling, and causes the mantle to return to a pre-impact state relatively quickly (tens of My). The core does not become fully convective again for several hundred My. Any pre-existing core dynamo activity will be crippled for around 100 Myr. An initially subcritical or weakly supercritical dynamo will be likely terminated permanently. The core-mantle coupling procedure presented here provides a self-consistent model of heat transfer between the core and mantle. Comparisons to previous models that assume a spherically-symmetric mantle with a fixed temperature at the top of the boundary layer suggest that such an approximation slightly underestimates the timescale required for full restoration of core convection. The full coupling can also resolve meso-scale convective structures in the lower mantle, not previously possible.  Our results are consistent with electron reflectometry observations [2] that show a lack of remanent magnetism in the younger of the Noachian giant impact basins [1], and the idea that the global magnetic field disappeared at the end of this sequence of basinforming impacts [3, 4].
