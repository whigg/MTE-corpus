Introduction: Mafic minerals are key components when trying to understand the geological history of planetary bodies like the Moon. Indeed, their presence in igneous rocks is directly related to mantle processes and crystallization conditions. In this respect, systematic detection of olivine and pyroxenes and characterization of their compositions provides important insights into planetary thermal and chemical evolution. Because of the Fe2+ electronic transition effect, hyperspectral remote sensing in the visible/near-infrared is a powerful tool to achieve this objective. Indeed, olivine and pyroxenes have characteristic absorption features in the 1 and 2 µm domains [1,2]. While several techniques aid in deconvolving absorption bands in terms of mineralogy, we employ the Modified Gaussian Model (MGM, [3]). The MGM can be used to estimate quantitatively both the modal composition of a rock and the chemical compositions of its component minerals. An improved MGM approach dedicated to the processing of large planetary datasets has been developed recently [4]. It has been validated on Martian data, from both the OMEGA and CRISM instruments [5,6].  In an first attempt to test this approach's suitability for data collected by the Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) instrument, we mapped the Stevinus crater region [7]. Following those positive results on pyroxenes-rich rocks, we here propose to test this approach on a more mineralogically complex area, which includes significant olivine abundances. We therefore focused the present study on the Copernicus area. Dataset: The Chandrayaan-1 M3 instrument is a high-resolution visible to near infrared (0.43-3.0 µm) imaging spectrometer [8]. We used data acquired at ~140 m/pixel with 85 channels. M3 data were radiometrically calibrated, corrected for thermal emission, and photometrically corrected (PDS level 2). A mosaic composed of several M3 strips was created and processed. The mosaic is located near the crater Copernicus (~9N, 20W) where optically immature material is exposed. Method: The MGM is designed to deconvolve absorption bands in reflectance spectra. Spectra are deconvolved into a series of Gaussian functions and a spectral continuum modelled by a polynomial shape. The optimized Gaussian functions (characterized by band center, width and strength) permit the quantification of mineralogical absorption bands diagnostic of mafic mineral abundance and composition, generally characterizing the predominant mafic minerals for each pixel (input spectrum) in the scene. An automated procedure involving different numbers of gaussians, depending on the potential complexity of the mixture, has been implemented based on the original MGM approach [4]. The starting values for the continuum and the Gaussian strengths and widths are chosen during a spectral shape smoothing analysis, which determines the relevant local maxima of the spectrum. Relative coefficients applied to each Gaussian parameters are estimated based on [9,10]. The uncertainties are set large enough to give a large degree of freedom for the parameters. Based on laboratory spectroscopic studies addressing separately pyroxene mixtures and the olivine suite [2,3,9,10], the produced mathematical solutions are then sorted in order to keep only those that are consistent with known properties of pyroxene and olivine spectra. The resulting band parameters (center, strength, width) are finally used to interpret the spectrum in terms of modal abundances and chemical compositions.   Results for Copernicus crater region: Figure 1 shows the results of our adapted MGM approach on the Copernicus mosaic. M3 data are affected by instrumental artifacts (e.g., vertical stripes). A portion of the mosaic has also been replaced by images with a lower quality which explains the gap in the map around 19°10'W. Nevertheless, the quality of M3 level 2 calibration is good enough to map the regional mineralogy. Much of the Copernicus area can be characterized with an initial configuration dedicated to clinopyroxene or orthopyroxene alone. Ejecta in the southern area of the image nevertheless required an initial configuration dedicated to a mixture of two pyroxenes. Such combination could be explained by the presence of rocks coming from different depths, i.e. with different compositions, or by the presence of mare basalt that have been mixed during the impact event itself. As observed in other areas, this points toward local compositional variations. Such variations are also evidenced by looking at the position of pyroxenes band centers (Fig.1 bottom right). One type of orthopyroxene is found, with a low Ca and Fe content, while two types of higher-Ca pyroxene seem to exist. In our mapping, we also detect  the local impact melt heterogeneity found by Dhingra et al. [11] (black arrow in Fig. 1). In particular places, a configuration dedicated to olivine is required. Olivine-rich outcrops can be found in the central peak and locally in the wall of the crater (as noted in [12,13]). The wavelengths of the band centers (Fig 1, bottom left) would suggest a Mg-rich olivine. Conclusion: The adapted MGM approach used in this study still shows very good results when applied to M3 data. Pyroxene-rich and olivine-rich outcrops are detected in the observed regions, and variations in mineral composition are also observed. This is of particular interest to better constrain lunar petrology using impact craters central peaks that excavate material from depth (e.g. [14]). References: [1] Burns R. G.
