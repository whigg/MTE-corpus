Introduction:  Formation of chondrules marked one of the key steps in the solar system accretion, but reliable determination of their ages requires resolving complex Pb isotope systematics. Variations in composition and texture among the chondrules present in any single chondrite indicate that these chondrule populations formed in multiple events over a period of time, hence accurate age determination with any isotopic method has to rely on analysis of individual chondrules. For U-Pb dating, this means that, considering the typical sizes of chondrules, we have to analyze picogram quantities of radiogenic Pb in the presence of comparable quantities of one or more non-radiogenic Pb components. The best results can be achieved if we can separate pure, or nearly pure, radiogenic Pb, but reducing of multi-component mixture to a twocomponent mixture could also produce a data set suitable for a meaningful isochron regression [1-3]. Separation of Pb isotope components is usually accomplished by sequential leaching in acids such as HBr, HCl, HNO3, HF and varying their concentration, temperature, and duration of treatment [3, 4] in an attempt to individually dissolve minerals that carry different components of Pb. Here we further explore the potential of multi-step dissolution for Pb-isotopic dating of individual chondrules. We present Pb-isotopic data for several fractions from a large chondrule A25-2 from Allende CV chondrite (referred to as megachondrule hereafter) prepared to explore the effects of the sample size and the details of step dissolution procedure on precision and accuracy of the age. We have also analyzed an individual chondrule from the L3.05 chondrite QUE 97008.  Materials and methods:  The chondrule A25-2 was extracted from a piece of the Allende meteorite from the University of Alberta collection. It is not round like most chondrules, but has an irregular shape and is unusually large (>10 mm in the longer dimension). However its texture closely resembles barredolivine chondrules (Fig. 1). The chondrule consists of ~74% FeO-rich olivine (Fa73−75), ~12% Al-rich pyroxene (Fs20−27Wo13−21, Al2O3 ~5−10 wt%), ~14% mesostasis (feldspathic glass and cpx crystallites), and ~0.2% Cr-spinel (Cr2O3 ~39−42 wt%). We have studied seven fractions of crushed megachondrule material (between 2 and 12 mg) in three analytical batches. The first batch (A31) of four fractions was analyzed using leaching procedure similar to what we used previously [1, 5]. The second batch (A66) consisted of three small fractions of 2-4 mg that were gradually dissolved in eight leaching steps resembling the procedures of [3, 4].   Fig. 1. X-ray combined map (Mg in red, Ca in green, Al in blue) of a part of the Allende mega-chondrule.  In the third batch (A68) we analyzed two 10-12 mg fractions using the same sequence of HBr, HCl and HNO3 leaching steps (L1-L6) as in A66, but the first HF leaching step is split into four steps using increasing concentration of HF between 0.04M and 1M.  One chondrule, extracted from the L3.0 chondrite using ultrasonic dental scaler,  was broken into halves. One half of 3.8 mg, and a 1.5 mg fragment of matrix, were analyzed as batch A61 using the same step leaching procedure as the mega-chondrule batch A66. The methods of chemical separation and Pb isotopic analyses are similar to those of [5], but Pb isotopic analyses were performed on a Triton Plus TIMS using a secondary electron multiplier in a peak jumping mode. Total procedure blanks varied between 0.6-1.4 pg Pb between the leaching steps and sample batches. Results: The Pb isotopic data for the Allende mega-chondrule are compiled in the Fig.2. The ages  derived from isochron regressions shown on this and following plots are calculated assuming a 238U/235U ratio of 137.747±0.017, an average value from Allende fragment and chondrule analyses in [5]. The data indicate that Pb present in the megachondrule is a mixture of at least three components: radiogenic Pb, initial Pb of primordial composition, and a component with isotopic composition that resembles average modern terrestrial crustal composition and was probably introduced during sample handling.

The data from the following HF leaching steps form a single linear array (Fig. 3) that passes through the point of  Fig.3.

The precision of the age is relatively low due to limited spread of data points and the absence of analyses with highly radiogenic Pb (the highest blankcorrected 206Pb/204Pb measured for the mega-chondrule is 61.7). If a few data points that plot marginally below the tie line between the most radiogenic Pb and primordial Pb are removed (following a procedure similar to used in [3]), the remaining points define a more precise isochrons shown on Fig. 4:   Fig. 4. The best estimate of the mega-chondrule age.  In contrast to the Allende mega-chondrule, the chondrule from QUE 97008 yielded highly radiogenic Pb with 206Pb/204Pb between 280 and 840 in the HF leaching  steps. The model dates of these points are between 4560.2 Ma and 4565.6 Ma, but the isochron is poorly constrained because some of the earlier leachates plot above the tie line between radiogenic Pb and primordial Pb, suggesting open system behavior. Discussion: Our data show that multi-step acid leaching can indeed efficiently eliminate Pb introduced by sample handling, and allow dating even for the samples that contain "stubborn" initial Pb that cannot be removed by leaching. If a high quality ion multiplier is used for analysis, and procedure blanks are below ~1 pg, then precision of the dates of 2-4 mg or larger chondrules is controlled more by geochemical factors (limited separation of radiogenic and initial Pb, open system behavior) than by analytical factors.  Efficiency of separation between initial and radiogenic Pb that can be achieved by leaching varies greatly between the chondrules, as has been shown previously [3, 4]. More efficient leaching, or separation procedures based on other principles (e.g. selective vaporization) can be designed if we understand what minerals host various Pb components. This understanding can be gained from ion microprobe mapping of Pb and U distribution, and from chemical composition of step leachates. Both studies are in progress.
