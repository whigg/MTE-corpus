One of the characteristics of this instrument is its small footprint (from 350 to 550 microns depending on distance [3]), and its high resolution camera called the Remote Microscopic Imager (RMI). ChemCam works in different modes, including rasters (5×5 or 3×3 points), line scans (1×5, 1×10 or 1×20 points), and also single-point analysis. At each point analysis,  30 shots are usually fired, but if the aim of the study is a depth profile, it can fire 600 or more shots at the same point. ChemCam is frequently programmed for at least two different observations per sol. An additional useful capability of this instrument is to perform "Blind Targeting", which allows targeting of a location on the surface even when no supporting images of the new site have yet been received on the ground. Blind targeting : The blind targeting mode allows us to analyze targets after drives, without specifically selecting targets from survey images. This is very useful on long drives, where the rover moves every sol, and images of the after-drive location, normally used for ChemCam targeting, are frequently not received on the ground until the rover has moved again. The mast is pointed to -42° and the observation is taken at the right-side of the rover. This ensures a good LIBS performance with a target at a distance of ∼3 m. The rover orientation must meet certain requirements on its roll and tilt, which are checked on board. An RMI image is taken before and after LIBS for geological context; passive  spectra are also performed before and after LIBS [4,5]. A MastCam image is usually also taken for context. Observations : The first blind target acquisition was performed on sol 318, with only 1 single-point analysis. After the sequences were validated, blind targets have been executed on a regular basis. Between sol 318 and 360, a total of 10 observations were made. During this time, only single point analyses were performed, with 30 shots each. More complex analyses (blind line scans) started from sol 386. Figure 1 shows the several investigated types of soils during blind mode up to sol 360. Results : The first 3 blind observations were performed at Glenelg, on sols 318, 328 and 330. Another observation was performed on sol 340, and then we sampled four more blind targets from sol 350 to 360, localized in the Hummocky Plains. Based on the returned RMI images, only soils were analyzed up to sol 360. Looking in details to the images, fine-grained soils comprise  60 % of the analyses, whereas surface pebbles (solid materials) are analyzed 40 % of the time.   Figure 1: Images of the point analyses of representative types of soils encountered up to sol 360. Images are taken after LIBS.  Images are :a) CR0_427140059PRC_F0080000CCAM15022L2 , b) CR0_425721017PRC_F0060804CCAM15022L1, c) CR0_426783836PRC_F0070270CCAM15022L2, d) CR0_426606875PRC_F0070136CCAM15022L1.    We investigated the soil targets in order to look for buried coarse grains, which can be invisible in the images. The technique used is the one presented in [6,7], using the shot-to-shot total intensity of the spectra variation, and the qualitative Independent Component Analysis (ICA) tool for the variation in the elemental component shot to shot. Overall, 43% of the soil locations analyzed by ChemCam revealed the 1278.pdf

presence of coarse grains, 86 % of which were not visible on the images. Looking only at the blind targets, those buried coarse grains are found 67 % of the time. In this study we focused also on the fine particles, which are here defined as particles smaller than 300 to 500 microns (smaller than the laser beam size).   Among the surface pebbles and buried coarse grains analyzed in soils up to sol 360, 31% of them show a felsic composition, 18 % of them show a mafic composition, and a majority of them (51 %) have an intermediate composition (figure 2). Buried coarse grains and pebbles observed in blind targets show mostly an intermediate composition, and two of them are felsic. No mafic coarse grains have been sampled by the blind mode. The intermediate composition corresponds to a basaltic one. The felsic pebbles and coarse grains could have the same origin as the felsic rocks observed at Bradbury landing site. Those rocks and pebbles seem to be from the Gale crater walls, and they could have been carried inside the crater by the Peace Vallis alluvial fan [8]. The basaltic coarse grains and pebbles do not have a clear origin. They show a composition different from the local rocks, and from all the rocks observed so far at Gale.   All the fine particles observed up to sol 360, including those analyzed from blind targets (in red), show a basaltic composition centered between the plagioclase and mafic endmembers and are relatively homogeneous (figure 3). Nevertheless, some of them show a higher Al/Si ratio, which is also explained by edge effects when the laser samples both fines and a felsic buried coarse grain [6].    Figure 2: ICA plot representing Na component versus Si component. Points with a stronger correlation with both components correspond to the felsic cluster, whereas those with a low correlation for both components are in the mafic cluster.   Figure 3: Al/Si vs (Fe+Mg)/Si for all the fines (molar ratios) observed up to sol 360 in all the analyzed soils. Red points correspond to	  the fine particles observed in blind targets only.  Discussion The blind target observations performed by ChemCam are rich in information. For now, most of the observations have been made in soils. They can be linked to the transportation of the grains. These soil observations are important also in order to better understand fine-grained particles, which have recorded details of long-term weathering processes on Mars. It is interesting to compare those observations with laboratory data for future investigations.   After sol 360, the blind targeting became more sophisticated, consisting of observations with up to 20 points. We expect to analyze more different kinds of targets, such as soils and rocks in the same observation. It is important to  build statistics on rock and clast compositions along the rover traverse in an unbiased way (choosing rock targets with the help of Navcam images can indeed induce a bias towards a specific type of rocks). In the near future we expect blind targeting to be partially replaced by autonomous targeting using smart software on board the rover. The AEGIS package currently in testing will allow immediate smart targeting based on on-board analyses of Navcam images [9].  References: [1] Wiens R. et al., Space Science Reviews 170 (2012) .
