Nantes, 9Bear Fight Center Abstract's Abstract Cassini/VIMS T85 observations of Titan's north pole show significant specular return from parts of Punga Mare consistent with 6◦-slope waves. Abstract Observations of Titan's north pole from the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) aboard the Cassini spacecraft have previously seen specular reflections of the Sun at the specular point on the moon's surface [1, 2, 3, 4]. We show the T85 (2012 July 24) observation in Figure 1. Figure 1: Cassini/VIMS image CM 1721848119 1, acquired on the T85 flyby 2012 July 24 from a range of ∼ 30000 km. This image has colors mapped with 5 µm as red, 2.8 µm as green, and 2.0 µm as blue. The nature of the brightest specular return, from Kivu Lacus, is discussed in [4]. Low-incidence, low-emission angle observations of Titan's north polar regions on T93/T94 (2013 July 26 and 2013 September 12 repsectively) provide new insight into the specular reflection from T85. Figure 3 shows a north-polar orthographic projection of T94 (upper-left) with T85 (upper-right and lower-left) along with an outline showing the locations of surface liquid (lower-right). First, note that all of the illuminated lakes and seas in the T85 observation are brighter than their surroundings due to specular reflections of the (somewhat) bright Titan sky at 5 µm. Four distinct pixels within Punga Mare, indicated by blue arrows in Figure 2, show unusally high flux confirmed to be specular in nature by the full spectrum. We develop a model to interpret these four points as wavy seas reflecting the Sun away from the specular point due to their slopes. Although we cannot rule out mudflats covered in a liquid layer as the source of these slopes, our best-fit value indicates slopes of 6◦±1◦ (Figure 3). If the roughness is indeed due to waves, then the implied winds are 0.76 ± 0.09 m/s and the waves themselves should be 2+2−1 cm in height (Figure 4. If correct this discovery represents the first seasurface waves known outside of Earth. That they have previously been undetected and are now evident is consistent with the Lorenz et al. [5] hypothesis that winds had previously been low due to seasonal cycles but are picking up as northern spring develops. References [1] K. Stephan, et al. (2010) Geophys. Res.
