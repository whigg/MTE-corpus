Nantes, 9Bear Fight CenterAbstract's AbstractCassini/VIMS T85 observations of Titan's north poleshow significant specular return from parts of PungaMare consistent with 6◦-slope waves.AbstractObservations of Titan's north pole from the Visualand Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) aboard theCassini spacecraft have previously seen specular reflections of the Sun at the specular point on the moon's surface [1, 2, 3, 4]. We show the T85 (2012 July 24) observation in Figure 1.Figure 1: Cassini/VIMS image CM 1721848119 1, acquired onthe T85 flyby 2012 July 24 from a range of ∼ 30000 km. This imagehas colors mapped with 5 µm as red, 2.8 µm as green, and 2.0 µm asblue. The nature of the brightest specular return, from Kivu Lacus, isdiscussed in [4].Low-incidence, low-emission angle observations ofTitan's north polar regions on T93/T94 (2013 July 26and 2013 September 12 repsectively) provide new insightinto the specular reflection from T85. Figure 3 shows anorth-polar orthographic projection of T94 (upper-left)with T85 (upper-right and lower-left) along with an outline showing the locations of surface liquid (lower-right).First, note that all of the illuminated lakes and seas inthe T85 observation are brighter than their surroundingsdue to specular reflections of the (somewhat) bright Titan sky at 5 µm. Four distinct pixels within Punga Mare,indicated by blue arrows in Figure 2, show unusally highflux confirmed to be specular in nature by the full spectrum.We develop a model to interpret these four pointsas wavy seas reflecting the Sun away from the specularpoint due to their slopes. Although we cannot rule outmudflats covered in a liquid layer as the source of theseslopes, our best-fit value indicates slopes of 6◦±1◦ (Figure 3). If the roughness is indeed due to waves, then theimplied winds are 0.76 ± 0.09 m/s and the waves themselves should be 2+2−1 cm in height (Figure 4.If correct this discovery represents the first seasurface waves known outside of Earth. That they havepreviously been undetected and are now evident is consistent with the Lorenz et al. [5] hypothesis that windshad previously been low due to seasonal cycles but arepicking up as northern spring develops.References[1] K. Stephan, et al. (2010) Geophys. Res.
