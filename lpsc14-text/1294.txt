Introduction: Graben-fissure systems are suites of structural surface lineaments caused by magmatic and/or tectonic processes (e.g. [1, 2]), and here we focus on graben-fissure systems that exhibit a partial (fanning) or full radiating pattern. The geometry of these systems suggests they are underlain by dyke swarms fed laterally from a central magmatic source [1], and examples with a radius >300 km are inferred to be generated by a mantle plume [2]. This effort is part of the Global Dyke Swarm Project [3], which aims to produce a global map of graben-fissure systems on Venus with a focus on those related to magmatic activity.    We mapped in detail graben-fissure systems located within the northwestern part of the Galindo region of Venus (approximately 112.6º-120ºW and 3.4º-9.8ºS; area  570,000 km 2) (Fig. 1) using SAR images from the Magellan mission at the highest available resolution (75 m/pixel). The most prominent feature in our study area is Dhorani Corona [4], associated with our mapped graben-fissure System 2.     Mapping: The Galindo Quadrangle (90º-120ºW, 0º25ºS) has been mapped at the reconnaissance level (at 1:5M and 1:10M scale) by Chapman [4] and Ivanov and Head [5], respectively, and these maps identified the most prominent sets of graben. As a result of detailed lineament mapping in our study area (Fig. 1) 15 systems were identified, with 1 system having a full radiating pattern (System 2), 4 systems forming a fanning pattern (partial radiating pattern) (Systems 1, 7, 8, and 11), and 8 smaller systems that were linear or too small to discern a pattern (Figs. 1 & 2; Table 1); 4 of these systems had not been identified in previous mapping efforts [1,4,5]. The majority are partially flooded by younger basalts. Many of these systems are densely overlapping, especially within the northern portion of the Dhorani Corona.    Cryptic centres: It has been shown previously that the majority of fanning/radiating graben-fissure systems converge on known magmatic centres (volcanoes or corona)[1, 2], but some have no observed tectonomagmatic edifice at their convergence point [2] and as such can be termed a "cryptic" magmatic centre (potentially explained by an underlying magma chamber that did not generate a major surface construct). In the present map area, one centre (associated with System 2) corresponds to Dhorani Corana and the four other identified centres (systems 1, 7, 8 and 11) are "cryptic".     Cross-cutting relationships: With many of the graben-fissure systems being so densely distributed within the study area, it is possible to explore their crosscutting relationships. Through the evaluation of multiple points of intersection between two systems at a time, we can assess the relative age of their associated magmatic centres (Fig. 3). The presence of lobate lava flows, partial flooding, and topographic-high inliers also contribute to the understanding of the regional relative chronology.     System 8, located west from System 2 (associated with Dhorani Corona), is consistently cross-cut by System 2, suggesting that System 8 is older than System 2. Systems 13, 14 and 15 are flooded with a thin layer of lobate flows with trends [4,5] suggesting that the source of flooding (at least in part) came from System 2, and that System 2 is younger than these systems. However, System 14 cross-cuts System 2, and is therefore younger. The cross-cutting relationship between Systems 13 and 15 is not clear, as both are partially obscured by thin volcanic flooding. The interpreted age relationships are summarized in Fig. 3.    Concluding remarks:  Detailed mapping and careful examination of the geometry of graben-fissure systems is an effective approach for identifying cryptic magmatic centres, and those with the largest radiating systems inferred to be mantle plume related [2]. Our study identified 4 new cryptic centres in part of the Galindo region alone (Systems 1, 7, 8 and 11). This further supports the idea from detailed graben-fissure mapping elsewhere (e.g., [2]) that the number of mantle plumes on Venus (based on visible edifices) has been greatly underestimated. Relative magmatic ages can be determined from cross-cutting relationships between different graben-fissure sytems. In addition, four of the centres (associated with Systems 1, 2, 7 and 11), lie along a SE-NW line. A hotspot track is unlikely since the age order is not systematic (cf. Figs. 2 & 3), so we provisionally suggest this alignment is due to magma ascent along a trans-lithospheric break (buried by younger flows?), as observed on Earth [e.g, 6].
