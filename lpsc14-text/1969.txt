Introduction: Ar-Ar ages of HED meteorites [1, 2] show a bimodal distribution with an increased probability of ages at ~ 4.5 Ga for unbrecciated and cumulate eucrites, and at 3.4 - 4.1 Ga for brecciated eucrites and samples with shock effects. Impact melts within howardites measured by [3] yield Ar-Ar ages between 3.6 - 4.1 Ga and are interpreted as marking the onset of a dynamically distinct bombardment period ~ 4.0 Ga ago. Cratering records produced by Dawn for Vesta [4,5] however, indicate the Rheasilvia and Veneneia crater-forming impacts occurred much later, at 1.0 and 2.1 Ga, respectively. These dates have been challenged [6] and until now, such young ages have not been measured within an HED.  Here, we report ages from different lithologies and single feldspars from the howardite Kapoeta. Our ArAr ages for unbrecciated mafic clasts and glass/melt samples show a distribution similar to those previously reported. In addition, we report younger ages (< 1.5 Ga) of single feldspar grains mined from within breccias, ages that may reflect resetting associated with the Rheasilvia cratering event.  Analytical procedure: A thick slab of Kapoeta (4788), provided by the Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., was split and quarried after being polished and mapped using Raman and EPMA techniques. Unbrecciated mafic clasts, glassy vein materials, breccia clasts and single feldspar grains were hand-picked and dated as in [7]. Results: The plateau ages of all samples measured here and in [8] are given in Table 1; sample locations, ages and types are shown in Figure 1. Three granular mafic clasts (hexagons in fig. 1) were sampled and analyzed multiple times yielding ages between 4.2 and 4.5 Ga, consistent with [1] and [2]. The mafic clasts, MC001 and MC003 (areas 1 and 2 in fig. 1), were broken into 3 chips each. Although both clasts are eucritic with subophitic feldspar, the weighted average ages for the two are distinctly different: 4.47±0.05 Ga and 4.34±0.01 Ga, respectively. Two feldspars from MC102 (area 6) gave younger ages ~ 4.28±0.11. Apparent ages of single feldspars from breccias (dashed ellipses in fig. 1), omitting the grains of MC102, form a bimodal distribution with weighted averages of 4.46±0.03 and 0.98±0.10 Ga. Three chips of glass/melt, sample G002 (area 8), yield apparent ages ranging from 3.06±0.19 to 3.99±0.04 Ga, showing a somewhat broader age range than shown by the impact melt measurements of [3], 3.6 - 4.1 Ga. Our most precise plateau diagrams for a bulk sample and single feldspar grain are shown in figures 2a and 2b, respectively. Discussion: The old ages of the mafic clasts are unsurprising [1]. More interesting are the distinct ages of MC001 and MC003, which indicate separate magmatic events, or different thermal histories. The ages of the grains from MC102 (area 6), ~ 4.28±0.11 Ga, are too imprecise to relate directly to the ages of the other mafic clasts. However, this clast is coarser grained than the others and perhaps cooled more slowly. As well, it is spatially closer to the pervasive glass veins that cross-cut the AMNH4788 slab making it more susceptible to resetting. It may be that proximity to the veins correlates to the amount of resetting in feldspars. The oldest discrete feldspar ages (BR103_C, BR103_F, Fsp004_25) come from breccias that are the most removed from vein material (areas 4 and 5) - at least in the dimensions we are able to see. Loss of K during disturbance also may be important. For example, the ages of Fsp004 (area 4) vary despite being pieces of a single grain. Calculations using 39 Ar for the three grains' [K] (wt%) give 0.02, 0.04 and 0.004 from old est to youngest. If the grain is heterogeneous, it seems likely that the energy of a disturbance would not be equally distributed through this sample size (~1.5 mm 2).  The younger feldspars have been found in areas that are proximal to glass veins (areas 3, 7 and 10). Three grains from BR004 (area3) get younger traversing from area 2 toward a glass vein in the two dimensions we can see. The bulk breccia samples, BR002_1, BR002_2 (area 9) are older than the feldspars quarried from it, indicating that the apparent age of the bulk samples represent a mixture in which the young feldspars are only one component. Bulk breccia BR003 (area 11) has similar ages and is also proximal to vein material. The glassy vein material G002 (area 8) is filled with relict grains of varying composition including feldspars of different sizes. The apparent ages therefore are of mixtures and do not give the date of the melting event. Interestingly, our smallest glassy sample, G002_D, the one with the fewest relicts is the youngest. The date of the glass-forming event must be younger than 3.0 Ga since entrained grains exist prior to the melt.  Conclusions: The youngest feldspar ages (0.631.25 Ga) straddle a crater count age (~1 Ga) of the huge Rheasilvia basin of southern Vesta and may have been reset either at that time or later, during launch. Ages of 3 glass veins (3.1 - 3.9 Ga) with modally variable feldspathic relicts may define a mixing line between the Rheasilvia event at 1 Ga and the typical HED ages of 4.5-3.8 Ga seen in many bulk samples. In any case, the range of ages seen in glasses must reflect the mass of relict phases entrained in the melt. The melt veins may cause contact metamorphism in adjacent breccia. Ages of relict free impact glasses in HEDs may provide detailed chronology of the late impact history of Vesta.   References: [1] Bogard, D.D. (2011) Chem. Erde 71, 207-266. [2] Kennedy, T. et al.
