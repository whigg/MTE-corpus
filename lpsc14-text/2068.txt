THE IMPORTANCE OF NANOPHASE ALUMINOSILICATES AT MAWRTH VALLIS.  J. L. Bishop1 and E. B. Rampe2, 1SETI Institute & NASA-ARC (189 Bernardo Ave, Mountain View, jbishop@seti.org), 2NASA-JSC (Mail Code KR, Houston, TX 77058).This study builds off previous detections of allophane in the Mawrth Vallis region [1,2] and includes coordinated CRISM-TES analyses of additional nanophase (np) aluminosilicates with variable Fe abundances and mixtures of allophane and other components. Allophane is present in many places in the upper phyllosilicate profile that contains high Al and Si. Similar np materials such as hisingerite (containing Fe in place of some Al) are a better match for the lower phyllosilicate unit dominated by nontronite.Introduction:  Allophane and imogolite are np aluminosilicates commonly detected in well-drained soils derived from volcanic ash containing feldspar and pyroxene [e.g. 3]. Continued weathering of allophanerich and imogolite-rich soils can produce kaolinite/halloysite or montmorillonite [4], both of which have been observed at Mawrth Vallis [5]. The spectral and hydration properties of allophane and imogolite were investigated recently and shifts were observed in the NIR band centers with variable Al/Si/Fe [6, 7]. Fe-rich allophane has a broad shoulder on the 2.2 µm band [6] and was recently identified at Coprates Chasma [8]. CheMin on MSL has recently discovered that 20-30 wt.% of the soil at Rocknest is composed of amorphous phases such as allophane, hisingerite (Fe-rich cousin of allophane) or glass [9,10]. This indicates that these amorphous/np aluminosilicates could be present in other locations than Mawrth Vallis. Thus, understanding the orbital detections of these np aluminosilicate phases at Mawrth Vallis where they are common could have important implications for aqueous alteration across the surface of Mars.NIR Spectral Properties of Al/Si/Fe-OH species:  OH stretching and bending vibrations produce distinctive bands near 1.4 and 2.2 µm for AlOH and SiOH bonds in aluminosilicates and near 1.4 and 2.3 µm for FeOH and MgOH bonds. Additional H2O bands are observed near 1.9 and 3 µm for hydrated minerals. Spectra of allophane include a doublet at 1.38 and 1.40 µm due to the OH stretching overtone, a broad H2O band near 1.92 µm, and an OH combination (stretch+bend) band near 2.19 µm (Fig. 1, [6]). Imogolite spectra have similar features at 1.92 and 2.19 µm, but the OH overtone occurs at 1.37 and 1.39 µm (Fig. 1, [6]). In contrast,  spectra of Al-smectites and opal have an H2O combination band at 1.91 µm and an OH combination band at 2.21 µm. The latter is extended towards longer wavelengths for opal spectra. A hisingerite sample is being characterized for another study [11]. Spectra of hisingerite include a broad band near 2.29 µm with a shoulder towards shorter wavelengths (Fig. 2). The 1.92 µm H2O band is also broad, similar to spectra of allophane and imogolite.CRISM Spectra of Al/Si Unit at Mawrth Vallis: CRISM spectra of the upper clay unit at Mawrth Vallis exhibit variations in the 1.9 and 2.2 µm bands indicating the presence of multiple minerals/phases [e.g. 2]. Many spectra are consistent with allophane or imogolite (Fig. 1). This Al/Si-rich unit is regionally variable Figure 1.

and includes hydrated silica (opal, altered glass),  Alsmectite, kaolinite/halloysite, allophane/imogolite and related Al/Si phases [2]. Allophane is spectrally dominant in some locations.CRISM Spectra of  Fe-rich Unit at Mawrth Vallis: CRISM spectra of the lower nontronite-bearing unit often include a broader band near 2.3 !m and/or a shoulder towards shorter wavelengths. This could be explained by mixing with a variety of phases, but it is also consistent with the presence of hisingerite (Fig. 2).Mid-IR  Spectral  Properties  of  Al/Si/Fe-OH species:  Allophane and imogolite spectra exhibit an H2O bending doublet near 6.0-6.2 !m and several SiO-Al vibrations in the mid-IR region [1,6]. Bands occur in allophane spectra at ~1030 and 940 cm-1 (9.7 and 10.6 !m), 610 cm-1 (16.4 !m) and 545, 420 and 335 cm-1 (~18,  24, and 30 !m), and in imogolite spectra at ~1030 and 930 cm-1 (9.7 and 10.8 !m), 595 cm-1(16.8 !m) and 495, 415, and 335 cm-1 (~20,  24, and 30 !m). These features are readily distinguishable from bands in the spectra of montmorillonite (near 1140, 1065, 525 and 430 cm-1) and opal (~1250,  1115, and 480 cm-1).  Hisingerite spectra include broad bands near 1030 cm-1 (9.7 !m) and 450 cm-1 (~22 !m) [11],  in contrast to nontronite spectra that have bands near 1130, 1045, 500, 425 cm-1 (~8.8, 9.6, 20, and 24 !m)[6].TES Spectra of Mawrth Vallis:  Models of TES data in phyllosilicate-rich regions at Mawrth Vallis identify ~10-25 vol.% allophane and imogolite and the incorporation of these species in the spectral library improves the fit.  TES models also identify montmorillonite, silica, and zeolite in significant abundances (>20 vol.%) in these areas (Table 1), further suggesting that there are a variety of secondary aluminosilicates in the upper units of Mawrth Vallis. Nontronite is generally not selected in model fits. It is hoped that ongoing modeling including hisingerite will improve the fits for the Fe-phyllosilicate unit at Mawrth Vallis. As hisingerite has a single broad band near 450 cm-1 this is more consistent with the observed spectral shape than the doublet found here in nontronite spectra.Summary and Applications to Mars: The presence of allophane, imogolite and hisingerite in the clay-rich units at Mawrth Vallis is consistent with young soils derived from volcanic material. Variable mixing of these amorphous/nanophase aluminosilicates with opal, montmorillonite, and kaolinite/halloysite within the upper Al/Si-rich phyllosilicate unit suggests regionally different aqueous environments. Mixtures of allophane or hisingerite with nontronite appear to be consistent with spectra of the lower Fe/Mg-rich phyllosilicate unit and are under continued investigation. Modeling of TES data indicates ~50-75% hydrated aluminosilicates are present in the bright units and ~50-60% in the intermediate units. Modeling of darker units includes lower phyllosilicate abundance and higher zeolite,  imogolite and silica abundance indicating a different alteration environment.Acknowledgements:  Thanks are due to the MRO/CRISM and MGS/TES teams for acquiring the data and funding from MDAP is much appreciated.References: [1] Rampe et al., (2012) Geology 40, 995.
