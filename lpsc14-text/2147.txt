Modeling Venusian resurfacing mechanisms: Progressive surface volcanism versus catastrophic mantle overturn, and a comparison to observed Venus topography, geoid, and thermal emissivity anomalies.  Aaron C. Prunty1 (pruntya@vt.edu) and Scott D. King1 (sdk@vt.edu), 1Department of Geosciences, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24061.  Introduction:  Surface observations of Venus, in particular topography, crater population distributions, and volcanic features, suggest a relatively recent global resurfacing event approximately 750 Ma [1-4].  While there are several variations and modifications, two end-member hypotheses have been proposed to explain the observed surface age of Venus: widespread, progressive surface volcanism and catastrophic overturning of the lithosphere [1, 4, 5-12].  Progressive surface volcanism, assumed to originate from deep mantle plumes [13], implies an instability at the core-mantle boundary.  Convective mantle overturn, on the other hand, implies a lithospheric instability.  The two endmember mechanisms therefore yield starkly different thermal evolutions of the planet [10, 14].  Utilization of observed long-wavelength topography, global geoid, and thermal emissivity anomalies coupled with insight from numerical modeling provides a means to compare predictions from modeling the two end-member mechanisms. Method:  We perform high-resolution 3D spherical convection calculations using CitcomS.  We model the catastrophic resurfacing mechanism in the stagnant lid regime following the method of van Heck and Tackley [15] using temperature-dependent rheology and lithospheric yielding to produce stagnant-lid convection with self-generating punctuated lithospheric instablilities in a spherical shell geometry.  We consider both degree-1 mantle overturn as well as shorter-wavelenth multiple instability cases.  We run the convection calculation for at least 500 Myr model time after the overturn event and analyze the geoid, topography, and heatflow once the calculation has settled down into a quasi-steady planform. Results:  We will explore both progressive and catastrophic resurfacing mechanisms to infer the thermal evolution of Venus, although our initial focus is on catastrophic resurfacing calculations.  Specifically, we address the conditions necessary for overturning the lithosphere.  Our initial results show that catastrophic resurfacing can occur at Rayleigh numbers of the order of 105 with a yield stress of the order of 20-400 MPa, consistent with the results of van Heck and Tackley [15].  We will systematically increase the Rayleigh number in order to map out the behavior of mantle overturn as a function of Rayleigh number and yield stress.  We will also assess the role of phase transformations and depth-increasing viscosity.  Additionally, we aim to determine under what conditions resurfacing occurs as a single, global event and as several smallerscale regional events closely spaced in time.  We further analyze whether these two cases can be distinguished using the model geoid, topography, and heatflow after the overturn events by examining if, and how long, the signature of cold 'subducted' material in the deep mantle remains observable in the geoid, topography and heatflow.  Furthermore, we will determine whether we can generate stable plume structures consistent with known surface topography, geoid, and thermal emissivity data, as well as estimate the amount of melt produced by global resurfacing events.  Finally, we will determine whether volcanic resurfacing and lithospheric overturn can coexist in tandem or are in fact mutually exlusive mechanisms. References:  [1] Strom R. G. et al.
