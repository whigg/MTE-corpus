Introduction:  Enon was discovered in 1883 in Springfield, Ohio, and it is currently classified as an anomalous stony-iron meteorite. The purpose of this study is to understand Enon's formation history and to determine if the meteorite can be genetically linked to any other known meteorite group. Classifying Enon is particularly difficult because texturally Enon appears to have an affinity with achondritic meteorites, but its silicate mineral compositions strongly suggest that it is related to chondrites [1]. Past research has outlined Enon's similarities in mineralogy, texture, and oxygen isotope composition to other meteorite groups (e.g.[2,3] ) (Figure 1). Enon's brecciated texture is similar to that of mesosiderites (achondrites) and IAB iron meteorites [2,4]. Enon's silicate mineralogy varies dramatically from what is expected for mesosiderites and has mineral compositions similar to ordinary chondrites and IAB iron meteorites [2,4,5,6,7]. Furthermore, despite the differences in mineral chemistry, research has shown that Enon's oxygen isotope composition is similar to that of mesosiderites and the HEDs [1,3] For the above reasons, the data obtained for Enon in this study will be compared to ordinary chondrites, mesosiderites, and IAB iron meteorites to determine if Enon could be related to any of these meteorite groups.  Methodology:  A one-inch round thick-section of Enon was provided by the Smithosnian Insitution's NMNH.  Back-scattered electron (BSE) and x-ray images were obtained using the FEI NovaSEM 600 scanning electron microscope in the Mineral Sciences department at NMNH. Data for the elements Ca, Mg, Al, Si, Fe, Cr, S, Ni, Ti, Na, K, Mn, Co, and Cu were collected to produce mineral maps of the thick-section (Figure 2).   Mineral chemistry was measured using the Cameca SX 50 electron microprobe analyzer at the University of Oklahoma Electron Microprobe Laboratory. The electron microprobe analytical conditions were 20kV, 20nA beam current, and 2 micron beam size for all analyses.  Dr. Richard Greenwood at the Open University performed oxygen isotope analyses for Enon. Fifty milligrams of olivine from Enon was powdered for analysis, and infrared laser-assisted fluorination was used to collect the oxygen isotope measurements from the powder [8]. Enon's two-pyroxene closure temperature was calculated using QUILF [9]. These calculations were run at a pressure of 1 bar, which is a reasonable estimate for an asteroid-sized body [10,11].  The two-pyroxene closure temperatures calculated by QUILF were used in the oxygen fugacity calculations. Examples of the methodology used in these calculations can be found in [10,11]. The quartz-ironfayalite (QIF) system could not be used in calculating oxygen fugacity because there is not enough chromite in the sample to collect chemistry data for olivine/chromite pairs. Therefore, Enon's oxygen fugacity was calculated using only the QIFs system.  Results: The sample of Enon used in this study contains nearly equal parts silicate, Fe-Ni metal, and troilite (Figure 2). Minerals present also include high- and low-Ca pyroxene, Na-plagioclase, whitlockite, chromite, olivine, and schriebersite.  Measured silicate compositions are homogenous throughout the sample, with averages as follows: plagioclase Ab79An15Or6, high-Ca pyroxene Wo44En52Fs4, low-Ca pyroxene Wo2En88Fs10, olivine Fo93Fa7. The kamacite has an average Fe content of 92.1 wt% Fe and 7.2 wt% Ni.  Taenite grains within the sample have a higher-Ni rim with a Ni content ranging from 25.0-32.9 wt% and Fe from 67.0-74.9%. In comparison, the lower-Ni taenite cores have a Ni content of 17.0-25.1% and Fe of 73.883.1%.

The oxygen isotope measurements yielded a δ17O% value of 1.56 and a δ18O% value of 3.41. This differs slightly from the δ17O%composition of 1.66 and significantly from the δ18O% composition of 3.88 listed for Enon in older research [3,12,13] It is likely that this composition has changed because in the last decade there have been significant advances in oxygen isotope analyses. Pyroxene closure temperatures ranged from 879975 0C, and the ƒO2 caluclated using the QIFs system and the teo-pyroxene temperature is IW-2. Comparing Enon to other meteorite groups: Enon has a brecciated texture which is achondritic and similar to what is described for mesosiderites and IAB irons [2,4]. The sample of Enon analyzed in this study has nearly equal parts Fe-Ni metal, FeS, and silicates (Fig. 7). The silicate inclusions are encapuslated in an Fe-Ni/FeS matrix.  However, Enon's silicate compositions are chondritic, showing similarities to both ordinary chondrites and IAB irons.  The oxygen isotope composition measured in this study deviates from previous analyses [3,12,13], but still lies on the edge of the field defined by the HEDs and mesosiderites. Most interestingly perhaps, is the new oxygen fugacity data collected by this study, a calculation that has not yet been performed for Enon.  This value of IW-2 is similar to that of the acapulcoite and lodranite clan, like Enon, samples from both acapulcoites and lodranites contain micrometer-size metal/sulfide veins, and centimeter-size veins has been documented in the acapulcoite Monument Draw [14]. Acapulocoites and lodranites have mineral assemblages similar to that of ordinary chondrites although their chemistries and oxygen fugacity compositions differ. This study would suggest that Enon be classified  as an anomalous primitive achondrite, not a stony iron as previously suggested Thermal History:. Enon appears to record the earliest stage of igneous differentiation of its parent body. The average two-pyroxene closure temperatures are similar to that of the Fe, Ni-FeS eutectic temperature, which lies at ~9500C [15]. It has been proposed that melting at the eutectic may form veins due to overpressure [16] and Enon does contains micrometer-size FeNi/FeS veins, which can be found both around and cross-cutting silicate grains. The Fe-Ni/FeS veins cross-cutting the silicate inclusions suggest that the silicates were solid during the migration of the FeNi/FeS melt. This indicates that the temperature never reached the silicate melting point, which is supported by Enon's two-pyroxene closure temperatures. However, the homogeneity of the silicate compositions in Enon does suggest that solid-state recrystallization occurred due to thermal metamorphism. References:  [1] Kallemeyn G.W. and Wasson J.T.
