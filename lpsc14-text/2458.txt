LABORATORY SIMULATIONS OF THE TRANSPORT CAPACITY OF WATER AND BRINES UNDER MARTIAN CONDITIONS.  S. J. Conway1, M. Gourronc2 and M. Patel1, 1Department of Physical Sciences, Open University, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA UK (susan.conway@open.ac.uk), 2LPGN, CNRS/Univ. Nantes, 44322 Nantes, France.  Introduction:  Gullies and recurring slope lineae (RSL) are both features that have been attributed to the action of liquid water on the surface of Mars [1-2]. However, the low average temperatures and pressures on Mars are not conducive to the survival of liquid water at the surface. Hence any meltwater, or water from an aquifer must be subjected to boiling and freezing (i.e. metastable [3]). Recurring slope lineae and gullies have both shown activity in the last few decades of observation [1,4], however it is under debate as to whether this activity is related to water [e.g. 4]. Brines, such as ferric or magnesium sulphate are thought to be common on Mars [5], and lower the freezing point of water, so these could provide a solution to the apparently contradictory observations. However, the behaviour of brines flowing over sediment under martian conditions has not been investigated . The effect of their physical and chemical properties on a sedimentrich flow on Mars is thus unknown. Hence, in this study we investigate the behaviour of flowing water and brines over sediment under current martian conditions.    Figure1: View of the interior of the Mars Chamber at the Open University with a sediment-bed installed.  Approach:  Our set-up and procedure are similar to Conway et al. [6] and is summarised below. A 2 m long, 1 m diameter cylindrical low pressure chamber was used to perform the experiments (Fig. 1). The test bed was a 1 m long, 0.1 m deep, and 0.50 m wide rectangular metal tray. A ~5 cm deep layer of dry unconsolidated fine sand was placed in this tray before the experiments. The whole test bed was set at angle of 14Â°. All the experiments used deionised and degassed water. The water was introduced onto the substrate surface from an internal reservoir using a pump and the flow rate was kept constant at ~0.08 litres per second for all experiments. For low temperature experiments the sediment substrate was chilled using a liquid nitrogen-filled cold plate in contact with the entire base of the tray. The pressure in the chamber was actively controlled using a vacuum pump and was maintained at ~ 7 mbar for the Mars simulation experiments. The temperature of the sediment was monitored via six thermocouples. A laser scanning device (David laserscanner) was used to create an elevation model of the surface after the experiments to enable estimation of the volume of sediment transported (Fig. 2).  Three experiment types were performed: (1) ambient terrestrial conditions (2) low pressure and ambient temperature and (3) low pressure and low temperature. We used three different solutions: 0, 10 and 25% magnesium sulphate. Preliminary results:  There were clear differences in behaviour between the salt solutions and the pure water (Figs. 2 & 3), namely: . The brine flows eroded (and thus transported) more material than the water flows, and this effect was exaggerated under martian conditions (Fig. 3). . The brine flows were wider and had smaller levees than the water flow under low pressure, but the inverse under terrestrial pressure. . The brines percolated less into the substrate than the water flow (Fig. 2). . Brines have final deposits with characteristic albedo changes particularly at low temperature, which endure post-desiccation.  Discussion and conclusions:  For a given volume of fluid, brine flows erode more than their pure-water counterparts; this effect is exaggerated at low pressure and further enhanced when the bed of the flow is freezing. Our initial interpretation is that this is a result of a combination of the brines' greater stability at low pressure and their higher viscosity. Brine flows have certain morphological properties that could be detected in remote-sensing images (greater width:length under freezing conditions, albedo changes) to verify (or not) their activity on the martian surface.
