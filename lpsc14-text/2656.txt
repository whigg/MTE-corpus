Introduction: Ca,Al-rich inclusions (CAIs) with fractionation and unidentified nuclear effects (FUN) are characterized by large and variable mass-dependent fractionations in Mg, Si, and O, and isotopic anomalies in Mg, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Zn, Sr, Nd, and Sm as well as low and variable initial 26 Al/ 27 Al ratios [( 26 Al/ 27 Al)0] [110]. The origin of FUN CAIs has been explained by: (i) condensation of their precursors from isotopicallyanomalous gaseous reservoirs followed by melting either after nearly complete decay of 26 Al [3] or prior to injection and homogenization of 26 Al in the solar nebula [11], or (ii) condensation of CAI precursors followed by subsequent aggregation with isotopically-anomalous materials and melting during injection and admixing of 26 Al in the protoplanetary disk [12]. Earlier measurements on FUN CAIs were usually made on macroscopic samples [19]. We have previously studied FUN CAIs on a micro scale for oxygen [13] and Al-Mg isotope systematics [14]. Here we report further on ion probe analyses of individual Al,Ti-diopside and hibonite grains for Ca and Ti isotopic compositions of these FUN CAIs. Methods: Ca and Ti isotopes were measured in Al,Ti-diopside grains from 6 FUN CAIs, BG82DH8 (hereafter DH8), C1, CG14, EK1-4-1, STP-1, and TE, and in hibonite grains from 2 FUN CAIs, Axtell 2271 (hereafter Axtell) and HAL, using the UH Cameca ims1280. Analytical technique was similar to that of [15]. An 16 O− primary beam of ~500−600 pA was focused to ~10 μm. A mass resolving power of ~11,000 was set to separate 48 Ca + signal from 48 Ti + and to resolve hydride interferences. Ca and Ti isotopes were measured in a single cycle by a magnet peak jumping for 40 Ca +, 42 Ca +, 43 Ca +, 87 Sr 2+ , 44 Ca +, 46 Ca +& 46 Ti +, 47 Ti +, 48 Ti +, 48 Ca +, 49 Ti +, 50 Ti +& 50 V+ &50 Cr +, 51 V+ , 52 Cr +, and 53 Cr +. 40 Ca + was measured with a Faraday cup; other isotopes were measured with an electron multiplier. 87 Sr 2+ was monitored to estimate 88 Sr 2+ interference for 44 Ca +, but it was negligible in our samples (< 0.05‰). 46 Ti + has an unresolvable 46 Ca + interference that was corrected by calculating 46 Ca + from 42 Ca +/ 44 Ca + using an exponential fractionation law and the terrestrial isotope abundances for Ca [6]. 51 V+ , 52 Cr +, and 53 Cr + were measured to correct for unresolved isobaric interferences of 50 V+ and 50 Cr + on 50 Ti +. An exponential fractionation law was applied to calculate 50 Cr + from 53 Cr +/ 52 Cr +, assuming terrestrial isotope abundances for Cr [8]. 50 V+ was calculated from the measured 51 V+ assuming the terrestrial 50 V+ /51 V+ ratio [16]. After interference corrections, Ca and Ti isotopes were normalized to 40 Ca/ 44 Ca = 47.153 [6] and 49 Ti/ 47 Ti  = 0.74977 as derived from [4], and then both the instrumental and intrinsic mass fractionations were corrected with an exponential law [15]. The normalized and mass fractionation corrected ratios are reported as permil deviation (δnotation) from the terrestrial values for Ca [6] and Ti [4]. The intrinsic mass fractionations of Ca (FCa; ‰/amu) and Ti (FTi; ‰/amu) were estimated by comparing the uncorrected measured ratios ( 40 Ca/ 44 Ca, 46 Ti/ 47 Ti) for standards and unknowns.  Results and Discussion: Instrumental mass fractionation of Ca isotopes in all standards are ~0.0 (‰/amu), whereas those of Ti are −11.0±0.2 (2σm), −11.1±0.7, −12.8±0.8, and −17.6±0.6 in Ti-pyroxene, Cr-doped Tipyroxene, Madagascar hibonite, and rutile, respectively. Large and variable instrumental mass fractionations of Ti in standards make it necessary to evaluate the fractionation law used with care. As discussed in the previous works [e.g., 15], an exponential law describes the instrumental mass fractionation better than a linear law or a power law. However, normalizing Ti isotope ratios by 46 Ti/ 48 Ti resulted in significant offsets of δ 49 Ti and δ 50 Ti values from zero and wide variations among standards measured (Fig. 1a). This may possibly be due to extrapolation from 46 Ti and 48 Ti. In contrast, normalization by 49 Ti/ 47 Ti provides more self consistent results (Fig. 1b). The cause of these shifts is not known. We applied an exponential law with normalization to 49 Ti/ 47 Ti to the unknown samples. Previously reported Ti isotopic compositions of FUN CAIs [4,7,9] and hibonite grains from CM chondrites [11,15,17,18] were recalculated by normalization to 49 Ti/ 47 Ti for comparison. Ca and Ti isotopic compositions in 8 FUN CAIs are given in Table 1. Except for TE, FUN CAIs have isotopic anomalies in 48 Ca and 50 Ti. Except for HAL, the anomalies are coupled, i.e., always both positive or negative; HAL shows different signs of anomaly in δ 48 Ca and δ 50 Ti. The Ca and Ti isotopic compositions of FUN CAIs measured agree well with previously reported TIMS data for C1, DH8 [9], EK1-4-1 [4,6], and TE [5,7]. δ 48 Ca (−7.2±3.0‰) of HAL from our study is slightly more negative than values reported by [3], but is, within our errors, not significant. The FCa of HAL (7.4±1.3‰/amu) is in good agreement with [3]. Figure 2 shows that FUN CAIs (except TE), like isotopically anomalous hibonite crystals from CM chondrites [11,15,17,18], have Ca and Ti isotopic anomalies and low and variable ( 26 Al/ 27 Al)0 [12,14,15]. The magni tude of Ca and Ti isotope anomalies of FUN CAIs is smaller than those of CM hibonites. Most CAIs with the canonical ( 26 Al/ 27 Al)0 have isotopically normal compositions of Ca and Ti. These observations together with a decoupling of 182 Hf and 26 Al in STP-1 [12] may indicate that FUN CAIs formed during admixing and homogenization of 26 Al and stable-isotope anomalies in the solar nebula. If the precursors of FUN CAIs and isotopically anomalous hibonites formed by gas-solid condensation in the solar nebula, at least 3 gaseous reservoirs are required to explain their 48 Ca and 50 Ti anomalies (Fig. 3). However, it is doubtful how distinct gaseous reservoirs could coexist at high temperature near the proto-Sun, possible formation region of CAIs. We infer that stableisotope anomalies of FUN CAIs were inherited from isotopically anomalous solids heterogeneously distributed in the solar nebula. We propose the following scenario for the origin of FUN CAIs: (i) condensation of CAI precursors from a gas of approximately solar composition, as indicated by 16 O-rich compositions of most FUN CAIs and Group II REE patterns of some of them [12,19], (ii) aggregation of these precursors with isotopically anomalous solids -  still unidentified carriers of stable-isotope anomalies, and (iii) melting and partial evaporation of these isotopically diverse aggregates at low total pressure resulting in mass-dependent fractionation effects in Mg, Si, and O [1,2,20]. Some FUN CAIs appear to have experienced subsequent melting and O-isotope exchange in an 16 Opoor gaseous reservoir, as indicated by a range of Δ 17 O values of their anorthite, pyroxene and melilite [13].
