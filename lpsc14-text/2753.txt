Introduction: Here, we use microbeam analysis to explore how impact-induced processes may have affected sub-µm materials in CR2 GRA 06100. Although the effect of shock on fine-grained crystalline solids has been studied [e.g. 2], how impacts affect the mineralogy of CR matrix, which contains abundant amorphous materials, is unknown. Unusual features observed in opaques in GRA 06100 have been attributed shock metamorphism followed by hydrothermal alteration by ﬂuids released during impact [1]. No comparable record of impact is observed in chondrules. Here, we use FE-EPMA and FE-SEM to study the matrix and overcome field-of-view limitations of FIB/TEM. Results:  Regions of matrix were selected based on their average chemical composition, measured in calibrated X-ray maps. These different regions were examined by FE-SEM to establish porosity, grain distribution, size, and morphology. Eight distinct regions of matrix were chosen and FIB sections were extracted from each (Fig. 1). Mineral assemblages (Table 1) were determined using EDS, SAED patterns and HRTEM.

Texturally, GRA 06100 matrix consists of submicron, diffuse masses that have compositions ranging from low-total, Mg, Al-bearing, saponite to ferrosilite under a 10µm EPMA beam. However, FIB/TEM images clearly show that these compositional variations cannot be attributed solely to the presence of hydrous versus anhydrous silicates.   Fig. 1.

nanophase Fa and Fs, non-stoichiometric ferromagnesiosilica grains, as well as amorphous silicates and phyllosilicates with variable amounts of Al. SiO2 is polysynthetically twinned, with lamellae ≈ II (0001) (Fig. 2a,b). Phases formed under different temperatures and redox conditions are directly juxtaposed or embedded within each other. For example, taenite rimmed with an amorphous hisingerite (Fe3+2Si2O5(OH)4·2H2O) is embedded in fayalitic olivine (Fig. 2 c,d) and Fe-Ni oxides are included within Fe-silicides, which coexist with phyllosilicates.

Discussion: GRA 06100 matrix is drastically different from other CR2 chondrites, which are assemblages of phyllosilicates, amorphous silicates, Fesulfides, and lesser amounts of Fe-oxides and carbonates [3,4]. Although serpentine and amorphous silicates have been identified in matrix, nonstoichiometric ferromagnesiosilica grains are more common (Fig. 3). Nanophase Fe-sulfides are absent from all regions studied. In fact, none of the phases here contain significant amounts of S. This is consistent with EMPA data, which shows that S is strongly depleted from GRA 06100 matrix compared with other CR2s and with CCs in general. If the matrix of GRA 06100 originally resembled matrices of CR3 chondrites, secondary processes must have resulted in the replacement by the assortment of minerals reported here. This is consistent with prior studies showing a paucity of presolar silicates and oxides in GRA 06100 matrix with respect to unshocked CRs [5]. Presolar grains are thought to be lost via secondary processes.  Lab-created samples resembling the matrices of CR3 chondrites (magnesiosilica smokes doped with metallic Fe nanoparticles) have been thermally annealed at 1000K for several hours [6]. Such experiments resulted in formation of amorphous particles spanning the Si-Mg-Fe diagram, fayalite, and ferrosilite. Although this assemblage did not result in the formation of non-stoichiometric ferromagnesiosilica grains reported here, it is possible that a higher T event or post-event self-annealing may have resulted in the formation of these materials. Furthermore, it is also possible that fayalitic olivine and ferrosilite formed by annealing of phyllosilicates and amorphous silicates.  High-T processing of pre-existing amorphous silicates in matrix is consistent with shock metamorphic features recorded by the opaque component of GRA 06100 [1]. In addition, planar deformation of SiO2 such as the one shown in Fig. 2a,b is generally attributed to impact processes [e.g. 7]. Coexisting phases that are clearly out of equilibrium with each other also support the possibility of a brief high-T event.  The large T heterogeneity recorded by GRA 06100 matrix minerals at the mm- µm scale has been explained by low-velocity impacts modeled by [8]. These numerical simulations also explain the mobilization of S from the matrix observed in GRA 06100.  Conclusion: We suggest that the mineral assemblage in GRA 06100 was generated by impact metamorphism with preservation of considerably thermodynamic disequilbrium.
