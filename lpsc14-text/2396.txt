Crisium is an elongate, 450- by 550km-wide Nectarian [1] impact basin on the lunar nearside that hosts expansive mare basalt deposits. Like other lunar maria [e.g., 2], tectonic deformation in Crisium is characterized by abundant wrinkle ridges [3], landforms interpreted as folds over faults that may be blind or surface breaking [4]. These ridges have been ascribed to subsidence of the mare deposits [5], although on Mercury a portion of the strain accommodated by wrinkle ridges may be due to global contraction resulting from interior cooling [6], a process that the Moon began to experience ~3.6 Ga [3]. The recent availability of high-resolution topographic and gravity field data for the Moon allows for the tectonics of lunar maria to be investigated anew. Here we combine Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) [7] Digital Terrain Model (DTM) data (118 m/px) and gravity field data (to spherical harmonic degree and order 660; spatial block size 8.3 km) from the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission [8]. We (i) remap the tectonics of Mare Crisium, (ii) use elastic dislocation models to determine the depths to which prominent basincircumferential faults penetrate, and (iii) compare the distributions of faults with that of the Crisium mascon.

 Photogeological Mapping. The basin interior is replete with wrinkle ridges, consistent with previous observations [3]; we document more than 170 (Fig. 1). The most prominent such structures follow the basin outline and verge toward the interior (most notably from 30°-180° and 260°-330° azimuth, measured clockwise from north), along the inner boundary of a circumferential, elevated "bench." Artificially illuminated DTM hillshade maps, for solar azimuth angles of 0° and 180°, reveal ~eastwest-orientated structures that are not readily visible in photogeological data. We identify 10 partially buried craters within Crisium, but we note a further five (the largest of which is ~95 km in diameter) that are demarcated by wrinkle ridges but have no other surface manifestation. The DTM also reveals subtle ridge-like changes in relief across the mare that are virtually impossible to detect otherwise. We interpret these 13 ridges, ~30-100 km in length, as additional shortening structures that have no surficial faulted component. Elastic Modeling. We used the open-access elastic dislocation program COULOMB [9] to match solutions for surface displacements to topographic profiles, taken from the LROC DTM, across the most prominent ridges in Crisium. By varying the dip, penetration depth, and direction and amount of displacement of a model fault, derived surface displacements were compared with five profiles taken across the large circumferential ridges within Crisium, and each model was modified until a satisfactory match was found. This approach is applicable to the Moon because, with virtually no erosion, topographic relief across a fault is essentially equal to the vertical displacements on that structure. A sufficiently accurate match between model results and observations allows the geometric parameters of the lunar fault (e.g., cumulative displacement, fault dip angle, and penetration depth) to be determined reliably.  We find that the large, basin-concentric ridges within Crisium have accumulated substantial lateral shortening (e.g., >1 km for Dorsum Oppel, Fig. 2), and that their underlying faults have planar to listric geometries. Intriguingly, despite variations in fault dip and architecture, these structures all penetrate ~20 km into the lunar crust, far below the base of the mare deposits. Gravity Data. GRAIL Bouguer gravity anomaly data indicate that Crisium's mascon occupies almost the entire interior, with gravity values of 100 mGal at the perimeter rising to ~500 mGal inward of 0.7-0.8 of the basin radius. Further, as noted earlier [10], the large ridges that follow the inner edge of the "bench" within the basin are collocated with the boundary of the highest values of the Bouguer anomaly (Fig. 3).                 Crustal thickness [11] within Crisium varies from ~20 km at the basin perimeter to ~0-4 km inward of the prominent ridges. Given our elastic modeling results, then, it appears that Crisium's mascon is structurally bound by shallow- and outward-dipping thrusts. Outlook. Extending this analysis to other maria with "bench"-like features (e.g., Nectaris and Serenitatis) will help determine the extent to which deep-seated tectonic deformation, a process not previously recognized for the Moon, has operated on that body.
