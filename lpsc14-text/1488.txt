Introduction. With its subsurface water ocean and relatively young icy surface Europa is generally considered a prime candidate in the search for present-day habitable environments in our solar system. The existence of water vapor plumes on the Jupiter's moon Europa has long been speculated. Spectral images taken by Hubble's Space Telescpe Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) taken in 2012 revealed first signs of active water vapor plumes at Europa's south pole (Fig. 1) [1]. We report our discovery of the south polar water vapor plumes and present new STIS observations of Europa's aurora from 2014.  Technique. Observations of electron impact excited auroral emission provide an excellent opportunity to investigate the atmosphere and to search for water vapor plumes [2]. The electron excited neutral hydrogen and oxygen in Europa's environment can be observed in the UV [3] through emission at HI 121.6 nm (Lyman-α), OI 130.4 nm and OI 135.6 nm. Because electron impact on H2O yields Lyman-α and OI 130.4 nm but relatively little OI 135.6 nm [4], enhanced emission at Lyman-α and OI 130.4 nm are diagnostic for H2O abundance.  Plume detection at Lyman-α and OI130.4 nm. The 2012 STIS images show that Europa's global oxygen aurora is generally correlated to the orientation of the local Jovian magnetic field. In addition to these time-variable oxygen emissions the December 2012 STIS images include statistically significant and coincident surpluses in the hydrogen Lyman-α and oxygen 130.4 nm emission lines (Fig. 1). These surpluses are found persistently in the same area above the antiJovian south polar limb over the ~7 hours of observation, indicating an atmospheric rather than plasma inhomogeneity. The relative brightnesses of the H and O emissions are indicative of electron impact dissociative excitation of H2O and suggest two ~200 km high water vapor plumes with column densities of ~1020 m-2 [1].  Temporal variability of plume activity. The plumes were detected only in December 2012 when Europa was around the apocenter of its orbit. During the November 2012 visit and previous STIS observations from October 1999 Europa was close to pericenter and no plume signal was observed [1]. Model calculations for stresses experienced by the mapped surface fractures in the south polar region agree with this observed plume variability, which is similar to the observed variability at Enceladus [5]. Tensile stresses in polar regions are stronger around apocenter, presumably driving the opening of faults and subsequent escape of water vapor from the subsurface.   New HST/STIS observations in 2014. The plume discovery and the predicted time-variability need confirmation and will lead to various follow-up observations [6]. Early in 2014 HST/STIS will obtain new spectral aurora images, when Europa is close to apocenter, similar to the December 2012 observations. Using these new images we plan to verify the proposed orbital variabability pattern, which is based on the predicted tidal surface stress variations. We also plan to further constrain plume densities  and extensions.     Fig. 1. Water vapor plume detection in STIS images: The coincident OI 130.4 nm and HI 121.6 (Lyman-α) emission surpluses observed at Europa's south pole (A, C) are diagnostic for water vapor. The best-fit model (B, D) suggests two ~200 km high plumes on the antiJovian southern hemisphere [6].  References: [1] Roth, L., et al. (2014), Science, in press. [2] Saur, J., et al.
