Introduction:  Saturn's moon Iapetus is characterized by a drastic hemispheric brightness dichotomy and an equatorial ridge system [1,8].  The ridge, which has been reported to be as high as 20 km [1], may have formed by endogenic forces, such as tectonic and convective processes [2-4], or debris infall from an ancient ring system [5,6]. Here, we use high resolution topographic data to conduct an extensive topographic and geologic anaylsis of the ridge. Our results suggest that the ridge has a dominant morphology, and extends further out into the adjacent plains than previously thought [3]. We argue that the lack of evidence of tectonic features along the ridge system suggests the ridge was not formed by tectonic processes.  Although prior work ruled out exogenic hypotheses [3], our analysis suggests that an exogenic origin may be possible. Background: Cassini ISS images of Iapetus reveal an equatorial ridge system extending over 110° in longitude [1]. The ridge has been extensively modified by impacts, attesting to its old age. No significant feature pre-dating the ridge system has been discovered [1]. The fact that the ridge lies essentially on the equator may suggest an origin connected to either the moon's overall shape or changes in Iapetus' spin state [1].  It has been proposed that despinning is enough to cause complex tectonic patterns on solid planetary bodies [1]; however, the tectonic features predicted by this model have not been observed [1,2]. Alternatively, the ridge may be debris from an orbiting ring [5], formed by an energetic impact that launched a disk of material and changed the satellite's spin period, giving rise to the equatorial bulge [6].  Past characterization of the ridge [e.g., 3] has been limited by the number and quality of digital elevation maps (DEMs) available. Here we use a total of 8 new topographic images generated from Cassini data and Voyager data [7] to observe how the ridge slopes and morphology vary along the length of the ridge.  Exogenic theories propose that the ridge should have a slope close to the angle of repose, and a single prominent peak [3].  The morphology should be essentially uniform as a function of longitude [3].  Endogenic theories do not constrain ridge slopes, and permit more compex morphologies.  Characterizing the ridge slopes and morphology could be used both as evidence of exogenic or endogenic origin.  Methods:  Here, we analyze eight ISS images (Table 1) with corresponding DEMs of the ridge system within Iapetus' dark terrain. These images range in size and resolution, which allows us to study the ridge on both a local and global scale. The USGS program ISIS was used to take a total of 506 topographic profiles across all eight images.

Cassini ISS images used in our study.  We find that the ridge topography can be divided into four parts - Northern and Southern faces and flanks. We calculate the slope angle of each section using least squares fitting with its corresponding standard error of the means found to a 95% confidence limit. Prior studies suggest that the majority of the ridge has a trapezoidal shape [3].  Here, we find a range of morphologies in addition to those observed before. We classify each topographic profile, based on the shape of the peak, into one of six morphological categories:  1. Triangular; distinct point at its peak 2. Trapezoidal; flat/flat-like top, similar to a plateau 3. Crowned; main triangular peak and at least 2 smaller peaks on either side 4. Twinned; two main peaks side by side 5. Dissmilar; at least 3 peaks of different sizes and shapes 6. Saddle; one triangular peak and one smaller trapezoidal peak. Results:  Slopes and Morphology.  The triangular peak is the dominant morphology, accounting for 33% of all of the profiles with a distinguishable morphology (Fig. 1). The average slope of the northern face is ~15°, whereas the southern face is ~16°, similar to previous results [3]. The trapezoidal peak morphology is the second most frequent (21% of profiles), and the slopes of the faces are close to the values obtained for 1450.pdf

triangular peaks.  Saddle peaks occur in 17% of the profiles and also have slopes similar to that for triangular peaks.  This may indicate that trapezoidal and saddle peaks represent degraded triangular peaks.      We suggest that twinned, crowned, and dissimilar peaks form by impact modification of an intially triangular peak.  These other categories are not as frequent as triangular and trapezoidal peaks and have extremely shallow slopes, > 10˚. We also observe that the "plains" adjacent to the ridge still has a significant slope. This may indicate the ridge system extends further out than previoulsy thought, possibly built upon a pre-existing uplift or bulge, and/or may be more massive than originally estimated. There seems to be no sharp boundary between the faces of the ridge and the plains, similar to the dissimilar regional slopes of either side of terrestrial mountain ranges. Angle of Repose.  About 10% of the profiles are much larger than the angle of repose for ice, ~25-35° [e.g., 3].  This could be related to the pile-up of ring debris [5,6], in which case, later degredation could cause the slopes to decrease.  Ridge Mass.  Assuming that the entire ridge formed with a triangular peak morphology with faces of slope ~15˚ and an average height of 7 km, we can estimate of the mass of the ring, ~8 x 1017 kg, assuming ρ=1000 kg/m3, roughly the mean density of Iapetus.  This is similar to estimates from previous work (~1017 to ~1018 kg) [2, 5, 6]; however, assuming that the ridge formed as a symmetrical triangular peak with the steepest slope found (~38°), and maximum observed height (~16 km), we get an estimate of 1.6x1018 kg.   Unusual Features. We observed a 60 km wide, 6 km deep trough perpendicular to the ridge, which resembles a pre-existing graben.  However, it cannot be confidently distinguished from a crater due to its highly degraded state. Other than several landslides that terminate in crater floors, there were no obvious tectonic features adjacent to the ridge.  Conclusions: Prior work suggests either an exogenic [5,6] or endogenic origin [2-4] for the ridge. Using high resolution topographic data, we conduct an extensive topographic and geologic survey of the ridge. Previous work has proposed that the ridge does not have a consistent morphology and that its shape is too varied to have formed by debris infall [2-4, 6]. Yet, we find a dominant ridge morphology (triangular peak), as well as a significant slope in the plains, suggesting that the ridge may be wider than previously thought. We also find that the slopes on the ridge faces are greater than the angle of repose in ~10% of the topographic profiles. This is significant because it may point to ridge formation by debris infall, allowing us to rule back in an exogenic origin.  Though we can not rule out an endogenic process purely based on our topographic analysis, the lack of observed tectonic features strongly argues against this.
