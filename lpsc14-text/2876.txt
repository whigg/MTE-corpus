Introduction: Orbital spectral observations of the Martian surface indicate uneven occurrences of aqueous minerals in geological formations of different ages. Secondary minerals seen in the Noachian terrains are dominated by phyllosilicates, while the Hesperian formations are characterized by massive deposits of layered sulfates seen in the Valles Marineris trough system, related depressions, and other places [1-4]. The initial interpretation of these data suggested deposition of phyllosilicates from Noachian alkaline solutions and formation of sulfates from acidic fluids related to volcanism in the Hesperian epoch [1]. Fe-Mg phyllosilicates (smectites, chlorites) are the most abundant clay minerals on Mars [2-4]. Typically, Fe-Mg phyllosilicates are located at lower stratigraphic layers than Al-rich clays such as montmorillonite and kaolinite. As an example, in the Mawrth Vallis region, minerals are observed within the following stratified sequence of layered rocks (from the top): silica and kaolinite, montmorillonite-like Al-rich clays, a Fe2+ phyllosilicate, Mg/Fe smectites, and sulfates [5-8]. Sulfates are also seen in the middle part of the stratigraphic sequence. The composition and occurrence of phyllosilicates and salts could be used to constrain ancient aqueous environments. This requires understanding of effects of solution chemistry, pH, Eh, temperature, and duration of processes on composition of precipitated minerals. In addition to terrestrial analogs and laboratory data, the formation and fate of secondary minerals could be evaluated with numerical physical-chemical models. We have modeled rock alteration by percolating aqueous solutions to constrain origins of observed minerals. Fig. 1.

These models consider solubilities of solids and gases in aqueous solution and constrain conditions of mineral saturation. Additional procedures quantify pH-dependent rates of mineral dissolution coupled with chemical equilibria in solution [9] and percolation of fluids. With these models, formation and compositional evolution of secondary minerals could be linked to a specific stage and/or setting of water-rock interaction.  The models tie the composition and pH of solution with the mineralogical assemblage, which may contain secondary phases together with unaltered minerals. Our models demonstrate sequential formation of phyllosilicates (kaolinite then smectites), lowsolubility salts (gypsum), and salt-bearing solutions through neutralization of initial acidic fluids interacting with martian basalt (Figs. 1-3).  Modeling of percolation of acidic fluids through basalts predicts formation of the vertical sequence of dominated minerals (from the top): amorphous silica - kaolinite and/or montmorillonite - a ferrous chlorite - Fe-Mg smectites. Zeolites and Fe2+-chlorites occur with smectites, and Fe2+ chlorite-bearing rocks form between layers rich in montmorillonite and smectites. This series reflects leaching of elements and neutralization of fluids with depth, and is similar to the succession observed in the Mawrth Vallis region [5-8] and several other areas, including walls of the Valles Marineris canyon system. The minerals observed in the upper part of some Martian profiles (silica and ferric phases, Fig. 2) agree with an open-system alteration in acidic conditions. The results show that phyllosilicates form together with sulfates, and clay-sulfate assemblages (except kaolinite-rich or jarosite-rich cases) do not indicate acidic environments. Smectite-sulfate assemblages form in contact with neutralized fluids at depth. Much high-solubility salts (Mg and Na sulfate and chlorides) remained in neutralized solution. These results suggest that alteration solutions rich in high-solubility salts 2876.pdf

However, formation of a 100 m weathering profile requires tremendous volumes of neutral or slightly acidic (CO2-saturated) fluids and does not look feasible. These models do not produce abundant salts and are inconsistent with observations. These results may indicate formation of Noachian phyllosilicates by initially acidic solutions [c.f., 9].  Discussion: The modeled formation of phyllosilicates together with salts imply formation of abundant salts in the Noachian epoch (see also [9,10]). These rock alteration models are consistent with the detection of Noachian sulfate-phyllosilicate assemblages [e.g., 11,12] and possible chloride deposits [13]. Several vol. % of sulfates could be present in Noachian clay-rich formations but may not be detected with orbital methods. A formation of interior layered sulfate deposits through acidic alteration of silicate rocks in the Hesperian epoch [1] should have led to formation of vast phyllosilicate and/or silica deposits, which are not observed.  We advocate for a scenario that includes aqueous alteration of mafic rocks by transient fluids generated by Noachian impacts related to the Late Heavy Bombardment. Acidic fluids generated by impacts [9] were neutralized through alteration of rocks followed by precipitation of phyllosilicates and low-solubility Ca sulfates. Neutralized fluids rich in high-solubility Mg and Na sulfates and chlorides have accumulated in ground waters. Subsequent freezing of subsurface fluids led to deposition of these salts in the pore space and accumulation of subfreezing brines in the megaregolith. Some cold chloride-rich brines could have released to the surface, consistent with observations [13]. A Hesperian remobilization of highsolubility sulfates and chlorides could have been caused by melting of crustal ice related to an enhanced heat flow, and by basaltic magmatism and volcanism. Subsurface drainage of neutral and reduced (Fe2+bearing) fluids into depressions (e.g., Valles Marineris and other chasmata) was followed by the formation and evaporation of sulfate-rich lakes. Oxidation of Fe2+ ions by atmospheric O2 in canyon lakes led to deposition of ferric oxides/hydroxides in somewhat acidic and salt-rich environments. This scenario does not exclude a near-surface formation of sulfates and opaline silica by transient acidic aerosols and rains, and other fluids related to volcanic and impact events in the Hesperian and Amazonian epochs.
