(e-mail: yogita@zedat.fu-berlin.de, hbecker@zedat.fu-berlin.de)  Introduction: Highly Siderophile Element (HSE, which include Re, Au and platinum group elements) show different abundances and sometimes different ratios in bulk rocks of chondrites from different classes [1, 2, 3]. Also, different chondrite classes show        distinguishable 187Re/188Os and radiogenic 187Os/188Os [4]. Because chondrites are composed of different components like chondrules, Fe-Ni metal, fine-grained matrix and sometimes CAIs [5], the origin of HSE fractionations displayed by bulk rocks can only be understood by study of the components. In early work on components of unequilibrated   ordinary chondrites it was proposed that fractionations of noble metals occurred during the loss of metal from L and LL chondrites [6]. Recent HSE work on      magnetic and non-magnetic components from the H chondrites Ochansk and Dhajala [7] shows that     different metal phases in these chondrites, display large differences in abundances and HSE ratios,    notably Re/Os and Pd/Ir. These fractionations could reflect solid metal-liquid metal partition processes or different volatilities of these elements in the nebular formation region of the metals. It is still unclear, which of these processes were responsible. The existence of such fractionated components in siderophile element depleted ordinary chondrites of the L and LL groups is also unclear. Here, we present new HSE and chalcogen element (S, Se and Te) data of components of two unequilibrated L chondrites. The chalcogen element data provide additional constraints on the role of   volatile element fractionation in comparison to other element fractionation processes.   Sample preparation and analytical techniques:  Gram-size pieces of the little altered L-type ordinary chondrites QUE-97008 (L3.05, find) and Ceniceros (L3.4, fall) were broken into fragments in an agate mortar. Clearly visible chondrules were physically separated from broken fragments by using plastic tweezers. Remaining material was gently crushed and separated into different size fractions. QUE 97008 was separated into size fractions <80 µm, 80-150 µm, 150200 µm, 200-250 µm and >250 µm. Ceniceros      components were divided into size fractions <50 µm, 50-200 µm and >200µm. All size fractions were    divided into magnetic (M), slightly magnetic (SM) and nonmagnetic (NM). The isotope dilution method, combined with        internal standardization of Rh and Au abundances was used to obtain precise concentration data, following established techniques [3, 8]. Spike-sample mixtures were dissolved and equilibrated in a mixture of 1ml conc. HCl + 2 ml conc. HNO3, at 100 bars, and 320 ºC for 16 hours using a high-pressure asher. Isotopic ratios were measured on the Element XR ICPMS at FU Berlin, except Os isotopic ratio measurements, which were carried out on a Thermo FinniganTM Triton TIMS at FU Berlin.  Results and Discussion: In CI chondrite normalized diagrams (Fig. 1), all magnetic components are     enriched (2-10 x CI chondrites) in HSE and show CI like relative abundances of Os, Ir, Ru, Pt and Rh and Pd. In some magnetic (M) components Au is slightly enriched with respect to Pd. Nonmagnetic components (NM) are depleted in Pd, but are also enriched in Au. Because Au and Pd behave similarly during solid metal-liquid metal partitioning [9] the decoupled behavior of Pd and Au is difficult to reconcile with such a partitioning process. We consider it more   plausible that differences in condensation temperatures and/or multiple condensation and phase separation events in the solar nebula were responsible for these fractionations. Re is often fractionated relative to Os and Ir. Magnetic components from both meteorites show higher 187Os/188Os as compared to other        components and CI chondrites (Fig.2), similar to magnetic components from H chondrites [7].  Most Ceniceros components (except chondrules and M< 50µm) plot to the left of the IIIA iron meteorite isochron (Fig. 2), which explains the deviation of the bulk meteorite reported by [4]. Components of   Ceniceros show the effects of linear mixing between NM and weakly magnetic components on the low 187Re/188Os side with magnetic components at high 187Re/188Os. In case of QUE 97008, components show random deviations from the reference isochron likely due to the redistribution of Re during later disturbances, possibly in connection with terrestrial weathering.   Te is depleted in all components as compared to all other analyzed elements (except Ceniceros M <50 µm, which shows CI chondrites like Se/Te). The          decoupling of Te from Se, S and the HSE in most components leads to the following implications: i) In L chondrites Te has different geochemical affinities and condensation temperatures than Se and S. ii) Depletion of Te in most components suggests that Te is more volatile than S in the environment where L chondrites form. iii) In Ceniceros Se/Te decreases from         nonmagnetic to magnetic components, whereas Se/S is virtually constant.

because of mixing of chemically distinct metal phases in the NM and magnetic components. In magnetic components Se/Te is close to the value in CI        chondrites, whereas the NM components show the strong depletion of Te. The latter must be indigenous to the metal that hosts the HSE in these components. In contrast, QUE-97008 components show overall similar Se/Te (Se/Te > CI), but variable Se/S in NM components. The latter may have been caused either by phase separation, or secondary processes such as aqueous alteration or terrestrial weathering where S is more mobile than Se. The depletion of Te in all components of QUE 97008 can be explained by loss of Te from the precursors of these components. Because Te is more depleted than the HSE as well as Se and S, the cause of depletion must be volatility. The CI chondrite like Se/Te of magnetic fractions from Ceniceros and the enrichment in Au (Figs. 1, 3) indicate a complicated multi-stage condensation history of these fractions.
