A REVISED, RATED AND DATED INVENTORY OF VERY LARGE CANDIDATE IMPACT BASINS ON MARS  L. M. Mannoia, Astronomy Program, University of Maryland, College Park MD 20742, lmannoia@terpmail.umd.edu and H.V. Frey, Planetary Geodynamics Lab, Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD 20771, Herbert.V.Frey@nasa.gov   Summary:  Evidence for very large (D> ~1000 km) impact basins on Mars was re-evalauted using MOLA topography, model crustal thickness data, and large scale geology. Ratings based on topographic and crustal thickness signatures resulted in 31 candidates. N(250) and N(300) crater retention ages (CRAs) were determined for these using a refined and rated inventory of visible and buried craters. Effects of basin overlap were examined but did not change the CRAs within their errors. The CRAs are narrowly grouped, implying a relatively brief but intense period of large size bombardment. Introduction: Figure 1 shows the 31 revised and rated large impact basins (D>~1000km) diameter on Mars used in this study.This is updatsed from an earlier study [1] which published preliminary N(300) Crater Retention Ages (CRAs) and Absolute Model Ages (AMA) for 20 very large impact basins on Mars based on superimposed candidate craters > 300 km diameter recognized as Quasi-Circular Depressions (QCDs) in MOLA data and Circular Thin Areas (CTAs) in early model crustal thickness data [2]. In 2012 [5] we reevaluated that inventory of basins and others added to it [3] using more recent crustal thickness information [4], the same MOLA data, and large scale geologic unit information [5].                                  New in this work is a rating system for the basins, based on the strength and character of the QCD and CTA signature. Topographic Expression and Crustsal Thickness Expression Scores on a scale of 1-5 were added for a Summary Score (range 1-10, higher numbers indicate stronger signatures and more believable candidates). Here we eliminated all candidate basins with a Summary Score < 3, though some of these might indeed be very modified impact basins. Figure 1 shows the distribution of the 31 very large candidate basins used in this study. Thicker solid or dashed circles indicate higher summary scores. The thickest ring is assumed to be the basin diameter used for finding CRAs. Some basin centers and/or diameters have been shifted from the 2012 study; this necessitates the recalculation of basin ages.  Calculating N(250) and N(300) ages. Previously only N(300) ages were determined due to a limit proposed for the resolution of the MarsCrust3 model [4]. But we find many very strong CTAs that correspond reasonably well with strong QCDs that are < 300 km in diameter. In this work we also calculate N(250) CRAs and compare them with the newly determined N(300) ages. The counting area of basins > 1000 km diameter was expanded to 1.2 times the plotted basin diameter (to account for a likely rim thickness, as we tend to draw the diameter at the inner edge of basin rims, where visible). All superimposed craters (QCDs and CTAs) with over 50% of their area inside the enlarged basin diameter were then counted and rated, using a sheme like that for the large basins. Dividing these counts by the counting area yields the N(250) or N(300) CRA. Figure 2 shows the CRAs for two cases: first including all possible superimposed craters (summary score > 1) and then eliminating the weaker candidate superimposed craters (summary score > 3).

 REVISED, RATED AND DATED MARS BASINS:  L. M. Mannoia and H. V. Frey  Accounting for Basin Overlap. Some of the large basins have significant overlap with other basins (e.g., Figure 3). For these areas, we experimented with blocking out both the overlapping areas and the superimposed craters in those areas, then re-calculated the N(250) and N(300) ages. Though the ages did change somewhat, there was no significant difference compared with the errors (which tended to increase in the overlap-corrected cases (see Figure 3).                         Figure 3. 1.2 D rings for large basins near 5N, 15W. (Top) The very large Ares Basin is overlapped by 4 other basins, all of which have N(300) CRAs less than Ares. Because later formation of these could have removed some craters that were originally superimposed on Ares, we removed the overlapped areas (Bottom, indicated in gray), and the craters in those areas. Recalculating the N(300) CRA for Ares actually resulted in a lower age, but not within the errors.  Similar studies for other overlapping basins (see Figure 1) also revealed small changes in the CRAs that did not exceed the errors on the original age determinations. Figure 4 shows plots of overlap corrected N(250) and N(300 CRAs versus the originally determined, whole-basin CRAs. Even though we expected that correcting for overlap of superimposed younger basins would generally raise the CRAs, the opposite is true: most ages that change become slightly younger (but within the errors of the original CRAs). This is consistent with the CRAs being tightly grouped (Figure 2), suggesting that most formed in a relatively brief time, and the likelihood that most superimposed craters counted formed after that brief period of intense bombardment.            Figure 4. Overlap-corrected N(300) and N(250) CRAs plotted against the original whole-basin CRAs. Most points plot roughly along a straight line because most basin ages do not change (overlap only affects a few basins). Most that do change tend to become slightly younger, but this change is generally within the errors on the basin CRA.   Discussion. The revised inventory based on MOLA topography, a more recent model crustal thickness model [4], and large scale geology has 31 basins with D> ~1000 km if we include only those with summary scores > 3. Two of these have diameters slightly less than 1000 km. N(250) and N(300)  crater retention ages are relatively narrowly grouped, and the N(300) ages tend to be slightly lower than previously found for a smaller number of basins [1]. The older ages previously found were likely the result of including spurious CTAs from an older crustal thickness model [2] which are not apparent in the newer model.  Summary:  Evidence for very large (D> ~1000 km) impact basins on Mars was re-evaluated using MOLA topography, model crustal thickness data, and large scale geology. Ratings based on topographic and crustal thickness signatures resulted in 31 candidates. N(250) and N(300) crater retention ages (CRAs) were determined for these using a refined and rated inventory of visible and buried craters. Effects of basin overlap were examined but did not change the CRAs within their errors. The CRAs are narrowly grouped, implying a relatively brief but intense period of large size bombardment.
