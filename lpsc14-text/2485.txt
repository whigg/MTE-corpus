Introduction: OSIRIS-REx aims to recover and characterize material from B-type asteroid (101955) Bennu, a carbonaceous asteroid rich in minimally altered organic  material. As noted by [1]. very young K/Ar ages of carbonaceous chondrites, the guiding meteoritic analogs for the mission show evidence for recent thermal disturbances (Fig. 1). The 40K/40Ar ages also contrast sharply with much older Mn/Cr ages [6,7]. [1] argued that the implied losses of radiogenic 40Ar took place close to meteoroid perihelion, perhaps during the most recent period of cosmic-ray irradiation, i.e., during the last 1 Ma for most CI, C2, and CM chondrites. It would be interesting to know when these losses took place as conditions leading to the loss of Ar could have affected organic matter as well [8,9]. While K/Ar ages are useful in providing some age information, 40Ar/39Ar ages are generally superior, partly because the 40Ar/39Ar methodology provides information about the relative distributions of 40K and 40Ar, and hence on the timing of thermal events that postdate formation [10]. Even so, in a literature search, we found published 40Ar/39Ar data in only one study of a CI or CM chondrite [11]. The results confirmed a low total fusion (K/Ar) age but were disappointing because the 40Ar/39Ar age spectrum is highly disturbed no pleateau age could be determined. Independently, D. Bogard (pers. comm.) analyzed a few carbonaceous chondrites, but was not convinced that the results dated any discrete event. The petrology of the CIs, C2s, and CMs may account for these non results. Their matrix, ~50% by mass, consists of fine grained phyllosilicates and poorly characterized phases. Due to the fine grain size of the matrix, this material is susceptible to 39ArK and 37ArCa recoil, thus  40Ar/39Ar laboratories normally avoid such materials.  We decided to reexamine the 40Ar/39Ar systematics of sub-mg samples of two primitive C chondrites, Murchison (MR) (CM2) and Tagish Lake (TL) (C2-ung) meteorites, using an ultra low-blank (< 40Ar=1.1x10-16; 39Ar=3.8x10-18; 38Ar=1.1x10-18; 37Ar=2.3x10-17; 36Ar=3.8x10-18 moles) laser-heating extraction system with the hope that the use of samples smaller than those typically analyzed might produce simpler data sets. As noted, few such studies exist for CI and CM chondrites and although plausible, the inference that young K/Ar ages reflect solar-heating has not been proven. The identification of major re-setting events from 40Ar/39Ar results could indicate the time(s) at which organic materials underwent thermal alteration.  Experimental Methods: Bulk (matrix) samples of MR and TL meteorites (230 and 621 µg, respectively) were were encapsulated in Cd foil and irradiated for 78 hours at the USGS TRIGA nuclear reactor. Ar measurements were done at Rutger University. Samples were incrementally heated using CO2 laser. Ar isotopes were analyzed with a MAP215-50 mass spectrometer. [12] Results: Both the MR and TL samples meet the plateau criteria in which three or more consecutive steps are analytically indistinguishable at the α-95% confidence level and comprise 50% or more of the released 39ArK (Fig. 2). As  far as we know these are the first plateau ages for CI/CM chondrites. The release spectrum for MR is has a plateau age of 3.05 ±0.05 Ga consisting of 97.8% of the 39ArK released. The high temperture steps are significantly younger but account for less than 3% of the total 39ArK Figure 1. K/Ar ages of carbonaceous meteorites [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

released. The isotopic data indicate an isochron age of 3.04 ±0.07 Ga and a trapped component with a 40Ar/36Ar ratio of 0.2 ± 0.2. The MSWD (Mean Weighted Standard Deviation) is 0.7; a value less than 2 indicates that the dispersion in the data can be accounted for by the measurement errors. Exclusion of step 'A', which is an outlier in the isochon plot (Fig. 3) yields an age of 3.24 ±0.12 Ga and a corresponding 40Ar/36Ar ratio (intercept) of 0.05 ±0.18 for the trapped component.  Although the step-heating release spectrum (Fig. 2) for TL is significantly more disturbed than the one for MR, it defines a plateau age of  2.19 ±0.03 Ga that comprises 70% of the 39ArK released.  The data indicate an isochron age of 2.51 ±0.03 Ga with an 40Ar/36Ar ratio of -0.3 ±0.1 for the trapped component. The MSWD of 12 indicates excessive dispersion in the data set (Fig. 3). However, excluding a single step "A" an age of 2.20 ±0.04 Ga and a corresponding 40Ar/36Ar ratio of of 0.03 ±0.08 for the trapped component and a MSWD of 1.1.   Our measured total Ar concentration (Table 1) for the MR matrix is within the reported range [3, 11]. However, our measured Ar concentration for TL matrix is about 3-6 times lower than the values reported for the carbonate rich lithology [13].  While our measured Ca+ concentrations for both MR and TL matrix samples are  within the range of reported values [11, 14] our measured K+ concentrations  are noticably lower (Table 2).  Discussion and Conclusions:  The large dispersion in the Ar and K+ concentrations would be an expected characteristic of a breccia. Data for Paris meteorite (described as a 'breccia') show comparable variations in K+ [5]. In addition, the Paris meteorite data show that K is concentrated in serpentinized material, found in both the chondrules and matrix. We postulate that the radogenic 40Ar is also associated with these same sites.  While the fine grain nature of the phyllosilicates may make this material susceptible to heating losses, the plateau ages and the well defined isochron ages both the MR and TL samples indicate the K and Ar within the MR and TL matrix is more or less homogeneously distributed and the samples do not show any significant evidence of recent solar heating/degasing as an explanation for the reported young K-Ar ages. We can not eliminate the complete reseting of the Ar clock by an older solar heating event. However, if this is the case, then the plateau ages, taken at face value imply a long residence time for Earth-crossing orbits. A third interpretation of the ages is that MR and TL represent cometary debris that arrived and has remained in the inner solar system since it's plateau or isohcron age. Solar warming set off alteration and the release of accumulated radiogenic 40Ar. When alteration ended, the accumulation of 40Ar re-commenced.  References: [1] Mazor et al. 1970, GCA, 34, 257.
