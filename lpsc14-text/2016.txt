Introduction:  Ureilites are know to have high concentrations of trapped noble gases, and their host phases are thought to be carbonaceous materials such as amorphous carbon, graphite and diamond [e.g., 1-4]. The origin and trapping mechanism of the trapped noble gases in ureilites, however, are still under discussion. As a part of noble gas study on 13 ureilites from Antarctica [5], we present isotopic compositions of trappted noble gases.   Samples and experimental procedure: Noble gases were measured for bulk samples from 13 different ureilites as shown in Table 1. For two ureilites, GRA95205 and GRA98032, two chips from each meteorite were measured. A noble gas mass spectrometer, modified-VG5400/MS-3, at the University of Tokyo was used for noble gas analysis. Fifteen bulk samples weighing ca. 30-50 mg were installed in a sample holder connected to a noble gas extraction furnace, and then preheated at 150C overnight in ultra high vacuum condition to remove atmospheric noble gas contamination. Noble gases were extracted by heating each sample in the furnace at 1800C for 30 min, and then purified with two Ti-Zr getters kept at the temperature of 800C and SAES-getters (NP-10). The purified noble gases were separeated from eath other before introducing each noble gas (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe) into the mass spectrometer.   Results and discussion:  Light noble gases. Based on the light noble gas compositions obtained in this work, three different pairs have been identified [5]; 1) ALH82106, ALH82130, and ALH84136, 2) EET87517 and EET87720, and 3) GRA95205 and GRA98032. Cosmic-ray exposure ages for the ureilites are presented in [5]. Although cosmogenic Ne is dominant in the samples, only one ureilite, GRO95575, shows relatively high 20Ne/22Ne ratio of 4.3 and indicates a presence of trapped Ne with 20Ne/22Ne ratio in a rage from 10 to 11. The ratio agrees with the value of trapped Ne for ureilites, e.g., 20Ne/22Ne = 10.5 and 21Ne/22Ne = 0.032 [1] and 20Ne/22Ne = 10.7 (for 0.03  21Ne/22Ne  0.05) [2].  Ar isotopic ratios.  Low 40Ar/36Artrap ratios, 0.055.0, are observed for the ureilites. Because of the high concentrations of trapped 36Ar in the range from 6  10-8 ccSTP/g (MET�1083) to 1.34  10-5 ccSTP/g (GRO95575), subtraction of cosmogenic Ar from the measured 36Ar concentrations result in minor corrections in the  40Ar/36Artrap ratios.  A plot of 40Ar/36Artrap against 1/36Artrap (Fig. 1) shows that 40Ar/36Ar ratio originally trapped in ureiltes was very low, in agreement with the reported low 40Ar/36Ar ratios for ureilites; 40Ar/36Ar = (2.9 ± 1.7)  10-4 was reported for Dyalpur [2]. The apparent increase in 40Ar/36Ar with lower concentration of trapped 36Ar could be an incresing contamination of atmospheric Ar to the samples.                        Abundance ratios of Ar, Kr and Xe.  Ratios of 36Artrap/132Xe are plotted against 84Kr/132Xe in Fig. 2, where the abundance ratios for Q-gas, a main trapped component in chondrites especially in carboneceous chondrites, are shown. Positive correlation among the abundance ratios is in good agreement with the reported correlation [e.g., 2, 3], although the spread for our data is narrower and extends to lower plotted area compared with those in [2, 3]. The positive correlation is explained as a selective loss of lighter noble gases Ar and Kr than Xe, resulted in low Ar/Xe and Kr/Xe ratios [2, 3]. The very low 84Kr/132Xe ratios, < 0.2, observed for the paired ureilites, ALH82106, ALH82130 and ALH84136,  might have been caused by intensive degassing.  Fig. 1.

Isotopic compositions of Xe and 132Xe concentrations for the ureilites are presented in Table 1. Although the isotopic ratios are similar to those of Q-Xe, small differences in some isotope ratios are observed. Fig. 3 shows a plot of 130Xe/132Xe vs. 136Xe/132Xe, where addition of HL-Xe and fissiogenic Xe from 244Pu to Q-Xe is indicated. Data points seem to plot between Q-Xe and solar wind (SW)-Xe. Contribution from HL-Xe or fission-Xe to the trapped Xe is not observed, because of the abundant trapped Q-like Xe in the samples. The data points seem to plot along a mass fractionaton trend from SWXe, which may be consistent with the loss of lighter noble gases as indicated in Fig. 2.
