Introduction:  Binaries are already known to exist in the Outer Main Belt, Hilda, and Trojan (OMB+) populations and appear to fall into two main categories. The first are objects like 624 Hektor, 121 Hermione, 107 Camilla, and 87 Sylvia which contain elongated/bilobed primaries with small satellites, a rapidly rotating primary, and densities greater than 1000 kg/m3 [1-4]. On the other hand, 617 Patroclus, 17365, and 29314 have have similar-sized components, are synchronously locked (or in contact), and have densities below 1000 kg/m3[5-6]. These two classes of binaries may reflect different formation mechanisms (collision vs. primordial), differences in the origin of the planetesimals and/or their subsequent dynamical and collisional evolution. As a test, we have conducted a search for other possible binary systems in the OMB+. Observations:  Observations were obtained with the Wide Field Camera 3 on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) using four filters, the F336W, F438W, F555W and F814W (approximating U, B, V, and I bands). Four exposures were obtained for each filter in a standard sub-pixel box dither pattern centered on the UVIS2-C1K1C subarray. Binary Search Results:  We targeted eight objects with periods of 56-540 hours that, if tidally locked binaries with the orbital period equal to the observed lightcurve period (like Patroclus), would have separations resolvable using HST. Observations were completed in June 2013 and none of the objects show clear evidence of being binary. (PSF-fitting is required to rule out partially resolved systems.) A negative result for eight slow rotators places only weak constraints on the binary fraction of this population subset. However, when combined with other published searches of Trojans [7], regardless of rotation period, it appears that the binary fraction in the OMB+ population is lower than among similar sized objects in the Kuiper Belt. Colors and Classification: Spectral classes have been estimated from for four of the eight targets from Sloan colors [8], most are SMASSII X class as expected. Using  HST B, V, and I colors we will be able to assign approximate classifications to the remaining objects in our sample. References: [1] Marchis, F. et al. (2006) IAUC 8732; Marchis, F. et al.

Targeted Trojan, Hilda and OMB asteroids with Trot > 56 hours are listed here. D is the effective diameter for a single object determined from measured albedos (or estimated using an assumed albedo of 5%). The maximum angular separation of a hypothetical binary, q, is computed assuming a tidally evolved equal mass binary with ρ = 900 kg/m3. Actual separation would depend on orbital phase and orientation of the orbit plane. The lack of detection of any companions in the search suggests they are not prevalent among slow rotators.   1703.pdf
