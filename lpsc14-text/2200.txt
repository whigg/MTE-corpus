Introduction: The geochemical and petrographic characterization of paired meteorites Northwest Africa (NWA) 7034/7533/7475 indicates that these are the first polymict regolith breccias from Mars [e.g., 1,2], compositionally similar to the data collected by NASA's orbiter and lander missions [e.g., 3,4]. Throughout NWA 7533, relative siderophile element abundances occur in chondritic ratios and reach levels equivalent to 5% nominal CI chondrite, comparable to the highest levels found in lunar breccias [2,5,6]. The interpretation of several generations of impact melt emplacement could indicate the presence of multiple meteoritic components [7]. The relative abundances of highly siderophile elements (HSE, including Re, Os, Ir, Ru, Pt, Pd), in combination with the 187Os/188Os isotope ratios, can assist in the characterization of the dominant impactor signatures, as most meteorites are enriched in these elements compared to planetary surfaces [e.g., 8,9] and have unique chemical fingerprints. Determination of the chemical nature of the projectiles preserved in Martian regolith and comparison to the HSE signals preserved in the asteroidal, lunar, and terrestrial impact records may help to elucidate the origin of the extraterrestrial materials (potentially contributing important volumes of water, volatiles, and organic material) delivered to the inner Solar System since planet formation.  Samples and methods:  In total, 11 aliquots of 777 mg were selected from three fragments of NWA 7034 (weighing 0.63, 0.60, and 0.48 g) and ground in a dedicated alumina mortar, after cleaning cut surfaces with SiC. After extraction and purification, Os was analyzed by negative TIMS using a Thermo Finnigan Triton in static multicollection mode. All other HSE abundances were determined by isotope dilution ICPMS using a Finnigan Element 2 [10].  Results: In agreement with HSE data reported for NWA 7533 [2], all characterized NWA 7034 samples exhibit relatively flat, unfractionated CI-normalized HSE patterns with inter-element ratios close to those reported for various types of chondrites (Fig. 1). The abundances for most HSE are equivalent to the admixture of ~5 wt% of nominal CI chondrite. However, two aliquots of fragment 2 are characterized by superchondritic Os/HSE ratios (Fig. 1, 2), and interpreted to reflect the presence of Os nuggets. A previous study has identified 200-700 nm Os-Ir-rich particles in pyrite grains of NWA 7533 [15].  Fig. 1. Concentrations determined for Re, Os, and Pt plotted against Ir contents. Grey squares (uncertainty of 5% RSD) represent LA-ICP-MS data for NWA 7533 reported by [2]. Calculated uncertainties (2σmean) are 4% for Re, 0.1% for Os, 5% for Pt, and 1% for Ir by isotope dilution. Chondritic ranges are calculated from a compilation of data [11-14]. Orange diamonds, blue squares, and green triangles represent NWA 7034 fragment 1, 2, and 3, respectively.  Scatter away from the expected linear trends between chondritic impactors and low HSE-bearing Martian crust (Fig. 1) indicates complex mixing between 2200.pdf

  multiple, heterogeneously distributed HSE-bearing components, superimposed by fractionation of particular HSE during formation and evolution of the breccia. A plot of 187Os/188Os versus 187Re/188Os also suggests recent open-system behavior of Re (Fig. 3). Still, most HSE patterns preserved in NWA 7034 are characterized by a relative enrichment of Os-Ir compared to RuPt. This feature, combined with 187Os/188Os ratios that cluster around ~0.125-0.126 (Fig. 2, 3), suggests that the impactors recorded in NWA 7034 had largely carbonaceous chondritic (CC), rather than ordinary chondritic (OC) or enstatite chondritic (EC), compositions. The observed HSE pattern can not be explained by equilibrium partitioning between metal and silicate during planetary core formation as the high partition coefficients of Os and Ir [18] would not preserve chondritic HSE patterns. Magmatic processing is also precluded as the resulting signatures would be highly fractionated with Pd>Pt>Ru>Ir=Os<<Re. If the excess in Ni of Martian highland rocks results from melting of an oxidized upper mantle [19], the HSE abundances determined here argue that the oxidized mantle would need to have been characterized by chondritic HSE/Ni ratios, which is highly unlikely after planetary differentiation.  Fig. 2. 187Os/188Os ratios versus Os concentrations for all characterized NWA 7034 samples. Symbols as in Fig. 1.  Of the Os-rich particles recorded in fragment 2, aliquot 2-1 is characterized by a low 187Os/188Os ratio (0.11708 ± 0.00004). Assuming the Os in this nugget followed the chondrite evolution model up until the moment of fractionation and applying the measured Re concentration of 2.3 ng/g, this 187Os/188Os ratio translates to an apparent age of ~1.9 Ga. This is likely an upper limit, as the Re/Ir and Re/Os in combination with the other HSE ratios advocate for late Re addition to this sample. This age is close to a lower U-Pb concordia intercept age of ~1.7 Ga reported for NWA 7533 [2] and the Rb-Sr age of ~2.1 Ga determined for NWA 7034 [1].

Shown for reference are the Group IIIA iron meteorite isochron of 4558 Ma [17] and theoretical 1.7 and 2.1 Ga isochrons. Symbols as in Fig. 1.  Conclusions: Impactor traces of roughly CC composition dominate the HSE budget of the Martian regolith at the locale represented by NWA 7034 and 7533. A fraction of NWA 7034 characterized by a subchondritic 187Os/188Os and an anomalously high Os content compared to the other HSE, suggests an event between 1.4 and 1.9 Ga ago that strongly fractionated Os from Re and the other HSE. Possible scenarios encompass condensation from an impact vapor cloud, differentiation of an impact melt sheet or Re loss during weathering on Mars. This event is concurrent to major disturbances of the U-Pb and Rb-Sr systems, interpreted as the closure time of the breccia [1-2].  References: [1] Agee C. B. et al. (2013) Science, 339, 780-785.
