Introduction: Lobate scarps are curvilinear tectonic features on the surface of Mercury that are interpreted as thrust faults intersecting the surface [1-3]. They are considered to have formed as the planet contracted [2] due to thermal contraction, tidal despinning or a combination of the two [4].  In some places these scarps are found at the edges of flooded impact basins, where compression has resulted in tectonic activation of the boundary between fill and original crater surface as indicated in Fig.6 of [3]. One example of such a basin is b37 [5],  which also displays clear superposition of three craters and the reactivated edge of the basin fill - the lobate scarp [3] which can be seen in Fig. 1. The sequence of events is: (1) creation of impact basin b37 (430 km diameter),  (2) volcanic fill of b37, (3) creation of basin b37b       (140 km diameter), (4) volcanic fill of b37b, (5) creation of a 30 km crater in the SE of b37b, and finally (6) compression of the surface resulted in the creation of  the westward-directed lobate scarp at the edge of basin  b37's volcanic fill.  The technique of buffered crater counting has been used to date possible fluvial features on Mars [6]. Here we us it, together with the classical crater counts of surface units (eg [7]), in order to estimate the relative timing of the events detailed above. Method: Using sinusoidally projected MDIS images in ArcGIS we carried out crater counts using the Cratertools software tool [8] on the areas of volcanic fill in craters b37 and b37b. Count areas are delineated in Fig.1 and include only surfaces we judge not to have been obscured by subsequent impact ejecta.  We applied the buffered crater count method set  out in [6] to the reactivated edge of the b37 volcanic fill, shown as a blue line on Fig.1. We then plotted the data using Craterstats [7] to establish relative ages of the two plains units and the lobate scarp and compared this to the sequence of events detailed above.

Results: Cumulative crater counts are plotted in  Fig. 2.  Fig. 2 Cumulative crater count plots of b37, b37b  and the lobate scarp on the western edge of b37. Colour-coding the same as in Fig. 1. Chronology and Production Functions as [7].  The plots for the b37 and b37b plains with craters of diameter greater than approximately 1.5 km indicate that b37 volcanic fill is the older of the two, as expected from superposition in the images. The kink that occurs in the b37 dataset is likely to be due to resurfacing. The lobate scarp deforms the b37b plains unit, therefore is younger and is expected to plot to the left of b37 and b37b in Fig. 2. However, the lobate scarp data define a trend indistinguishable (within error) from the b37b data, showing that the scarp was activated within less than 0.1 Ga of the b37b infilling event. In contrast, we find an age difference of 0.2 to 0.3 Ga between the b37 infilling event and b37b and the scarp. Conclusions:  - Emplacement of the two volcanic units and lobate scarp formation occurred over a relatively short timescale. In particular, the lobate scarp and b37b volcanic fill plot at the same age (within the method error). - These results demonstrate the value of the buffered counting method for dating linear tectonic features on Mercury. Further work: The next step is to analyse the effect of secondary craters on these results, before progressing to new sites. Further examples of flooded basins with tectonized edges have been identified [3] and relative age plots of these lobate scarps will reveal whether this type of compressional deformation occurred throughout Mercury's history or localised to a certain time period(s). Calculating absolute ages would allow comparison with other key events in Mercury's history. This may be helpful in establishing whether the lobate scarps are indicative of tidal despinning and whether the various styles of tectonization represent different stages of a progressive deformation model, as suggested in [3].
