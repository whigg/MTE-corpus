Introduction: During a survey of the S-type asteroids, (354) Eleonora was identified as anomalous with a 1 m absorption feature ~2.5 times stronger than any S-asteroid of comparable size [1]. Subsequent investigation revealed significant differences in the 1 m absorption feature between the spectra from the large CCD surveys (SMASS-I [2], SMASS-II [3] & S3OS2 [4]) and other spectral data sets for this asteroid [5-9]. There were also significant spectral differences between the SMASS-I, SMASS-II & S3OS2 spectra of Eleonora (Fig. 1). These differences could potentially arise from spectral variations across the asteroid surface, from observational phase angle differences, from surface temperature differences, from viewing geometry for a nonspherical body, from the use of standard stars with deviated to different degrees from a true solar standard, or due to erroneous data. Figure 1: Comparison of the normalized SMASS-I, SMASS-II and S3OS2 CCD spectra of 354 Eleonora. The data sets have been offset for clarity. IRTF Observations: In June 2011, 226 nearinfrared (NIR, ~0.76 – 2.5 m) spectra of Eleonora were obtained using the SpeX instrument on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) at Mauna Kea Observatory. The goal was to better understand the anomalously strong 1 m absorption feature for this S-type asteroid, the nature and history of Eleonora, its relationships to other asteroids and to the meteorites, and the relationship of S- and A-type asteroids. This NIR data was also used to test the possible scenarios for the spectral diversity of the CCD data sets.  Analysis: Analysis of the suite of Eleonora spectral data eliminated the following options as the source of the differences in the 1 m absorption feature within the CCD data sets and between the CCD data sets and the other spectral data: (1) rotational spectral variations; (2) variation in surface composition with latitude; (3) observation phase; (4) surface temperature variations with differing heliocentric distance in the asteroid’s elliptical orbit; (5) spectral effects of viewing geometry for a nonspherical body; and (6) differences in spectral standard stars.  Variations among the CCD Data Sets: We conclude that none of the CCD spectra of (354) Eleonora are reliable (Figure 2) since none of them match the new NIR spectrum within the limits of their spectral coverage. This is a robust conclusion since the new NIR spectrum is consistent with virtually all other Eleonora spectra, including the ECAS [11] and 24-filter spectra [10]. The three CCD spectra would imply significantly different – and generally unreliable – indications of surface mineralogy. An effort needs to be made to determine whether “bad” CCD spectra are rare with the case of (354) Eleonora being an uncommon occurrence or whether there is a broader problem with the CCD asteroid survey data sets, and if so, how to identify the “bad” spectra.

While CCD Survey spectra show apparently irreconcilable differences, the near-infrared spectra of (354) Eleonora obtained by previous observers [5-9] show only minor differences, primarily in the overall spectral slope, most of which can be attributed to slight differences in the standard stars used to calibrate the data. The new NIR spectra were consistent with the six sets of NIR spectra obtained previously for Eleonora.  Spectral Variations: The new NIR data set exhibit a relatively subtle variation of approximately 10% in spectral slope between ~0.8 m and ~1.6 m during the rotation period of the asteroid (Figure 3). These variations do not explain the differences between the Eleonora spectra in the CCD survey data sets. No significant change is observed longwards of ~1.6 m. Despite the significant slope change shortward of ~1.6 m, the band depth measured below a linear continuum is virtually unchanged, ~22% for the spectrum with the shallowest slope (red points on Figure 3) versus ~19% for the spectrum with the steepest slope (blue points on Figure 3). There is a slight shift in the band center with minimum and maximum values of 1.059 m and 1.066 m, respectively. Although there is a weak overall trend, there is considerable scatter among the band center values derived for different rotational phases. This might be the result of a variable olivine composition, but at the present time we do not claim to have identified any variation in silicate mineralogy across the surface of (354) Eleonora. Figure 3: The new IRTF-SpeX spectra of (354) Eleonora with the minimum and maximum slopes across the 1 m olivine absorption feature. Mineralogically diagnostic spectral parameters extracted from the new NIR data are most consistent with a surface assemblage of fine-grained intimately mixed olivine (~60-70%, ~Fo7011) and low nickel (<~7-8% Ni) NiFe metal. The NiFe phase suppresses the albedo and the band intensity compared to pure olivine assemblages (Figure 4). The Fo estimate is consistent with one previous estimate (Fo665 – [12])), but not with another (~Fo90 – [7]). The surface assemblage appears to contain a small component (~8-10%) of igneous pyroxene (weakly constrained at ~Fs50Wo10). The parent lithology of the surface regolith may be similar to a pallasite assemblage, although none of the three known types of pallasites are good mineralogical matches. Although they lack any significant NiFe metal, the silicate mineralogy of the brachinites is generally similar to that inferred for Eleonora.
