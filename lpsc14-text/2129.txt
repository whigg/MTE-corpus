OMEGA/MARS EXPRESS OBSERVATIONS OVER CURIOSITY AT GALE CRATER, B. Gondet, J. Audouard, J.-P. Bibring, batiment 121, 91405 Orsay Campus, France, gondet@ias.u-psud.fr  Introduction: Following the spectacular landing of Curiosity within Gale crater, OMEGA, the hyperspectral VIS/NIR imager on board the ESA Mars Express orbital mission, has acquired, whenever the MEx orbit allowed, image-cubes of the Curiosity’s area (more that 60 observations), at a variety of spatial sampling and local times, in nadir and limb modes (table 1).  In this paper, we focus on tree types of information directly retrieved from the OMEGA data sets [1]: i) the spectral characterization in the range (0.35 to 1.0 µm), which enables a remote compositional analysis, to be compared with the in situ ChemCam and MAHLI relevant measurements [2,3], and ii) the surface temperature, extending to a variety of local times the thermal inertia maps produced by the THEMIS/Odyssey instrument (at fixed local time) to which they will compared, as well as with REM/MSL measurements [4]; iii) limbs campaign, just initiated, designed to constrain the mechanism of the formation of clouds, by identifying the nucleation sites [5,6].

Observations cover a wide range of seasons (Ls) and local times (thus Sun elevation angles, SEA), and were acquired from a variety of altitudes (expressed in kms).  Spectral diversity: OMEGA spectra over Gale crater exhibit variations both spatially and as a function of local time and season. As examples, seasonal variations over MSL are plotted in Figure 1, and slope berween .5µm and .8µm  plotted in Figure 2, highlights the period of dust storms.

 Figure 2: spectral slope between .5µm and .8µm vs time. Red circle corresponds to the dust storm period. Thermal properties:  From sol 1 to 269, 5 OMEGA/REMS GTS coobservations were acquired. Fig. 3 show the correlations of surface temperatures measured.  Figure 3: red: OMEGA derived at 5 µm; black: REMS derived from the 8-14 µm spectral region.  OMEGA temperatures were coupled with a thermal model to infer Thermal Inertia  [4]. Since we consider the surface as homogeneous during the inversion, we obtain apparent thermal inertia that varies with time of day and season as a function of the heterogeneity of the surface.The thermal behavior of Gale crater is different from an homogeneous surface: apparent thermal inertia can vary by several hundred of J.m-2.K-1.s-1/2 during the day (Fig. 4). Mean value at MSL location =395 J.m-2.K-1.s-1/2: agreement between THEMIS-derived [7] and OMEGA-derived thermal inertia.   Figure 5: Dust coating could explain morning heating and afternoon cooling but then night time low temperatures are poorly reproduced: very low apparent thermal inertia at night.  Limbs observations:  With limbs observations, OMEGA observed dust detached layer at 70 kms (Fig. 5). From the associated spectrum we have derived a particule size: .2 to .4 µm..  Figure 5: left: OMEGA profile @.5 µm right: associated spectrum  In a recent limb observations (Fig. 6) we detected H2O clouds , thanks to its 3.2 µm diagnostic band.   Fig. 6: H2O clouds imaged by OMEGA over Curiosity; the dashed line corresponds to the surface.   Conclusion: The agreement between orbital and in-situ temperatures is remarkable. In the coming months, OMEGA/MEx will continue acquiring both day and night spectral images of Gale Crater, so as to enable a thorough monitoring of the variation over time of the properties of this site.
