Introduction: Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) model predictions of s-process isotopic abundances suffer from uncertainties in neutron capture cross sections (i.e., Maxwellian Averaged Cross Sections, MACSs) of the corresponding nuclei. The MACSs of all stable Zr isotopes and the long-lived isotope 93Zr have recently been better-determined at the n-TOF facility at CERN [1−6]. By adopting the updated Zr MACSs in an AGB model by [7], Lugaro et al. [8] compared the model predictions with measured Zr isotopic compositions of presolar SiC [9−11], and concluded that all the model predictions failed to explain the grain data with δ(92Zr/94Zr) > −50‰. They therefore suggested smaller 92Zr MACS values to explain the mismatch. Formation of the major neutron source 13C, also suffers from uncertainties in stellar model calculations, which results in uncertainties in AGB nucleosynthesis model predictions of s-process isotope abundances. We recently reported the dependence of δ(138Ba/136Ba) on the 13C pocket structure adopted in Torino AGB models because of the extremely small neutron capture MACS of 138Ba [12]. Following that Ba isotope study, we now investigate the dependence of Zr isotope abundances on both 13C profile and 13C pocket mass. Grain Data & AGB Models: We compare presolar SiC grain data from [9, 11, 13] with Torino model predictions for Zr isotopes. The earliest grains analyzed in [9] were not measured for C or Si and therefore could not be classified.  However, grains with s-process Zr signature (> 90% SiCs are mainstream) are included to increase the grain database for comparison with the model predictions. The details of Torino postprocessing AGB model were laid out some time ago [14] and have been recently updated [15]. The parameters for various 13C pockets discussed here have been discussed previously [12]. In brief, we consider two different 13C pocket structures: Three-zone (an exponentially decreasing 13C profile that is divided into three different zones in the model) and Zone-II (a flat 13C profile that is a single zone in the model). For each structure, the 13C pocket mass and the 13C mass fraction (i.e., 13C efficiency in the literature, which is referred as a case) are the two parameters to define a 13C pocket. For example, the ST (standard) case is the 13C mass fraction at which solar s-process is best reproduced at half-solar metallicity. In order to match the grain data, we consider the 2 M , 0.5 Z  Torino AGB model with a range of 13C efficiencies (D3-U2, e.g., D3 and U2 represent the 13C mass fraction in the ST cases is divided by three and multiplied by two, respectively). Results: Three-zone and Zone-II model predictions during AGB carbon-rich phase, denoted as symbols along AGB trajectory lines, are compared to SiC grains [9, 11] in Fig. 1. This is because SiC is expected to only condense when C > O based on thermodynamic calculations [16]. The Three-zone model is shown as open symbols in order to be distinguished from the Zone-II model shown as filled symbols. Consistent with the conclusion from Ba isotopes [12], Three-zone model predictions cannot reach the grains with δ(92Zr/94Zr) > −50‰ despite the reasonably good agreement with the grain data for δ(90,91Zr/94Zr). By adopting a Zone-II 13C pocket instead of the Threezone, the Torino AGB model immediately predicts a wider range of δ(90,91,92Zr/94Zr) values. Good agreement with the grain data still remains for δ(90,91Zr/94Zr) and more importantly, better agreement with δ(92Zr/94Zr) (grains with higher values are matched) is achieved. Therefore, the mismatch with the grains for δ(92Zr/94Zr) noticed earlier [8] can be solved by using the Zone-II 13C pocket in AGB models with the current n-TOF Zr MACSs. Discussions: In s-process nucleosynthesis, neutron capture cross sections (σ) of most of the nuclei having neutron numbers between magic numbers likely follow a 1/v (where v is the relative neutron velocity) behavior. Their MACS values, defined as <σv>/vT (vT: mean thermal velocity), are therefore proportional to 1/vT and relatively insensitive to conditions of both the major neutron source 13C operating at 8 keV and the minor neutron source 22Ne operating at 23 keV. 92Zr is an exception as its MACS deviates from the 1/vT rule by 30% from 8 keV to 23 keV, while 94Zr strictly follows this rule [3, 4]. Thus, 92Zr/94Zr can be used to constrain the 13C neutron source. A similar constraint is provided by 138Ba/136Ba [3]. The neutron-magic 138Ba has an extremely small MACS and its production is determined by the major 13C neutron source. In contrast, the MACS of 136Ba is a factor of ten higher and deviates from 1/vT from 8 keV to 23 keV. Its final production therefore depends on both neutron sources. Thus, in addition to  δ(138Ba/136Ba), δ(92Zr/94Zr) can also be used to trace 13C pocket structure and 13C pocket mass in AGB stars.  We systematically investigated the difference between Three-zone and Zone-II models by varying the 13C pocket mass parameter. The range of pocket mass for each 13C pocket structure is shown in Fig. 2. We can see that all the Zone-II models predict higher δ(92Zr/94Zr) values than all the Three-zone models in Fig. 2. Moreover, we found δ(92Zr/94Zr) values in both Three-zone and Zone-II calculations increase with decreasing 13C pocket mass as shown in Fig. 2. This trend results from the higher production of 94Zr with increasing 13C pocket mass because of its smaller MACS with respect to 92Zr.

The grain data are plotted with 2σ uncertainties. The dotted lines represent solar Zr isotopic composition. In addition to uncertainties in 13C pocket, we also evaluated the effect of 1σ uncertainties in 92,94Zr MACS values on AGB model predictions of δ(92Zr/94Zr) values. We found that by adopting the lower limit of 92Zr MACS and the upper limit of 94Zr MACS, Three-zone model predictions shown in Fig. 1 can be shifted by +100‰ in the y-axis to better agree with the grain data. MACSs of 92,94Zr with smaller uncertainties are urgently needed to confirm the necessity of Zone-II models. Conclusions: The better agreement of mainstream SiC grain data with Zone-II model predictions for Zr isotope abundances strongly supports our previous proposal of a smaller Zone-II 13C pocket to also explain δ(138Ba/136Ba) < −400‰ in some of the acid-cleaned mainstream grains from an independent study [12]. Possible physical mechanisms that could flatten the 13C distribution in the pocket include stellar rotation and magnetic field. Although Zone-II models can explain the whole range of δ(138Ba/136Ba) values [3], we cannot exclude the possibility of different 13C pockets existing in the parent stars because only the ones with δ(138Ba/136Ba) < −400‰ requires the Zone-II 13C pocket. What percentage of the parent AGB stars having Zone-II 13C pockets therefore remains an open question. As different 13C mass fractions in the Zone-II models are required to explain δ(92Zr/94Zr) > −50‰ (D3, D2 & D1.5) and δ(138Ba/136Ba) < −400‰ (ST), we plan to measure correlated Zr and Ba isotopic ratios in acidcleaned mainstream grains to better constrain the 13C pocket structure and the 13C pocket mass of the parent stars of mainstream grains in the future.
