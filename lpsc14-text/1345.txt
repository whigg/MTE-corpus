Introduction:  The potential water ice in the permanently shadowed regions over the lunar poles not only provides important clues concerning significant questions about the Moon, but also is regarded as one of the most valuable resources in the solar system. Radar can identify water ice because as a low dielectric loss medium, water ice could produce coherent backscatter opposition effect under certain conditions. Because of ambiguities caused by other geologic targets, explanations of the radar echo from the lunar polar regions remained as a controversy for nearly 20 years [1, 2]. Since 2008, two miniature radio frequency radars (Mini-RF) on Chandrayaan-1 and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), have imaged the lunar surface with the main purpose of detecting polarimetric signature of water ice [3, 4].  Analysis of the initial Mini-RF data found that abundant anomalous craters over the polar regions possess elevated circular polarization ratios (CPRs) in their interiors, but not exterior to their rims [3, 4]. Almost all these anomalous craters are in permanently shadowed regions, and their CPR characteristics are different from those of fresh craters. Based on the correlation with Lunar Prospector neutron data and thermal conditions, these anomalous craters were interpreted as potential sites for water ice deposits [4].  Since radar CPR depends on a wide range of geophysical parameters [5], mechanism for the elevated CPR should be analyzed before a confident conclusion for the existence of water ice can be obtained. In this study, we first conducted an exhaustive search for the polar anomalous craters in Mini-RF images and then  −180˚ −15 0˚ −1 20 ˚−9 0˚ −60˚ −30˚ 0˚ 30˚ 60 ˚90 ˚120˚ 150˚ −180˚ −150˚ −120˚ −9 0˚ −6 0˚ −30 ˚0˚ 30˚ 60˚ 90 ˚12 0˚ 150 ˚−180˚ −120˚ −60˚ 0˚ 60˚ 120˚ 180˚ −60˚ −30˚ 0˚ 30˚ 60˚ Anomalous craters Fresh craters −180˚ −15 0˚ −1 20 ˚−9 0˚ −60˚ −30˚ 0˚ 30˚ 60 ˚90 ˚120˚ 150˚ −180˚ −150˚ −120˚ −9 0˚ −6 0˚ −30 ˚0˚ 30˚ 60˚ 90 ˚12 0˚ 150 ˚ Figure 1.

Our results indicate that the elevated CPRs in the interior of anomalous craters are most probably caused by surface and subsurface rocks, instead of water ice as pointed out in previous studies [4].  Results and Analysis: We conducted an exhaustive search in the LRO Mini-RF CPR images and found 84 and 34 anomalous craters over the north and south polar regions (Fig. 1). In addition, a large number of anomalous craters were also found over the nonpolar regions. For anomalous craters, CPR in the interior region is about ~0.25 larger than that in the exterior region. As a comparison, CPR in the interior region of young fresh craters is roughly the same as that of the exterior region. Considering the lunar surface properties and Mini-RF radar configurations, three potential key factors for the elevated CPR in the interior regions of anomalous craters are surface slope, surface roughness, and surface and subsurface rocks [5]. Though CPR depends also on dielectric constant and regolith thickness, the small differences in these two parameters between the interior and exterior regions of anomalous craters can not explain the elevated CPR values.  High-resolution lunar surface topography data show that the slope of the crater wall for a typical bowl-shaped crater generally varies from 20° to 40°, and this can give rise to a change of ~10°-40° in local incidence angle. As a result, this causes a CPR difference of ~0.1-0.2 between crater walls that tilt towards and away from the radar. Nevertheless, the slope of crater wall cannot explain the high value of the elevated CPR in the interior of anomalous craters.  (a) (b) (c) (d) 12 3 Figure 2.

A schematic diagram of radar scattering from a lunar surface that consists of a normal surface without meterscale rocks and a rocky surface.  Mini-RF CPR from lunar surface is also strongly modulated by surface roughness at scale on the order of centimeter to decimeter [5]. Since surface roughness at these scales are difficult to obtain directly, wavelength scale roughness is extrapolated based on large scale roughness obtained from Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter by assuming that lunar surface is monofractal [6]. Wavelength scale roughness is estimated to be about 5°-25°, and this cannot produce a CPR value as high as those in the interior of anomalous craters [5]. Therefore, surface roughness is most probably not the key factor for the enhanced CPR in the interior of anomalous craters. Examinations in high-resolution optical images from Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) show that there are abundant surface rocks within the interior region of anomalous craters, whereas no rocks outside of the crater rim (Fig. 2). In contrast, fresh craters possess rocks both inside and outside of the crater rims. An exhaustive search shows that except for a few polar anomalous craters without LROC images, almost all the other anomalous craters have surface rocks in their interior regions. A direct comparison between CPR and LROC images indicates that surface rocks at meter scales are most probably the major factor for the enhanced CPR values in the interior of anomalous craters, regardless of their locations.  Two-component Mixed Model and Its Predictions: To study the effect of surface rock, a twocomponent mixed model is proposed to simulate lunar surface CPR (Fig. 3). The first component is single scattering from a normal surface without rocks, and the second is double scattering from meter-scale rocks either perched on the lunar surface or buried in the regolith. Single scattering CPR is obtained directly from Mini-RF observations of a normal lunar surface, and CPR from surface rocks at meter scales is modeled as double-bounce scattering from a dihedral structure [7]. In our study, abundance of surface rocks is obtained by counting the number of blocks in LROC images, and subsurface rock abundance is assumed to be equal to that of surface rocks by means of Rosiwal's law.

CPR difference between the interior and exterior regions versus the difference of rock abundance from model prediction (black line) and observations (dots).   the interior and exterior regions of a crater can be expressed as ΔCPR ≈ 2Δfsµcd                        (1) where Δfs is the difference of rock abundance, and µcd is the double scattering CPR.   Fig. 4 shows the comparison between model prediction (black line) and observations (dots) for eight typical craters. As can be seen, there is a strong correlation between ΔCPR and Δfs, which matches very well with model prediction. The strong correlation between ΔCPR and Δfs indicates that meter-scale rocks are the key factor for the elevated CPR in the interior of anomalous craters, instead of ice deposits as pointed out in previous studies [3, 4].  Conclusions and Future Work: In this study, we mapped all the anomalous craters over the lunar polar regions in Mini-RF CPR images. In addition, anomalous craters were found to be widespread over nonpolar regions as well. Statistical results show that there is almost no apparent difference in CPR between the polar and nonpolar anomalous craters, nor between the polar and nonpolar fresh craters. The elevated CPR in the interior regions of anomalous craters cannot be solely caused by dielectric constant, regolith thickness, surface roughness, and the slope of crater wall. In fact, the enhanced CPR is most probably caused by meterscale rocks either perched on the lunar surface or buried in the regolith, suggesting that ice deposits, if present, are not the only physical agent causing the enhanced CPR. We are now analyzing the polarimetric signal of Mini-RF echoes to see if there is any unique signature for the anomalous craters.   References: [1] Nozette S. et al. (1996) Science, 274, 1495-1498.
