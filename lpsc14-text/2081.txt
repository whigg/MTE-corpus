LOBATE DEBRIS APRONS AND ICE-RICH FLOW FEATURES IN EASTERN HELLAS, MARS: MAPPING USING THEMIS IR AND CTX DATA.  F. C. Chuang, D. A. Crown, D. C. Berman and E. C. S. Joseph, Planetary Science Institute, 1700 E. Ft. Lowell Road, Suite 106, Tucson, AZ 85719 (chuang@psi.edu).  Introduction: Lobate debris aprons (LDA), concentric crater fill (CCF), and lineated valley fill (LVF) are a suite of features on Mars that were first identified in early Mariner orbital images and later studied in more detail from Viking Orbiter images [18]. These features are present in the northern and southern mid-latitudes of Mars [e.g., 4,9,10] and are often associated with fretted terrain [11-14]. The softened appearance has been attributed to viscous flow of ice-rich materials. However, it is unclear if the source of the water ice was via condensation in sediment pore space, buried snowpack deposits mixed with rock and sediment, or freezing of water-saturated ground. LDAs exhibit similarities to several types of terrestrial cold-climate landforms [2,5,15] including rock glaciers [16-17], interconnected valley glaciers [18-23], debris-covered glaciers, as well as protalus lobes and ramparts [5,15]. Modeling results from the Shallow Radar instrument on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) have supported a debris-covered glacier interpretation for LDAs in which hundreds of meters-thick ice is sequestered below a ≤ 50 m thick debris cover [24-26]. Eastern Hellas: In the southern hemisphere, eastern Hellas has long been recognized as a regional concentration for LDAs [10,27-28]. From previous studies using Viking Orbiter, Mars Orbiter Camera, and Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) visible images, LDAs were generally observed in an area between 30°-50° S and 90°-115° E [10]. With the availability of 100 m/pixel global THEMIS daytime IR data, we are currently mapping LDAs and other icerich flow features (such as CCFs, LVFs) in the southern hemisphere. Early results indicate that LDAs occur in greater numbers than previously recognized [30]. With the increased coverage of 5-6 m Context Camera (CTX) images in eastern Hellas, we can improve our THEMIS IR results by 1) confirming that newly mapped features are LDAs, 2) refining the extent of LDA margins, 3) identifying LDAs that were not recognized in THEMIS data, 4) examining LDA surface textures and their variability in detail, and 5) assessing the spatial relationships of adjacent apron lobes. In addition, CTX images are useful for identifying and mapping other ice-rich flow features observed in proximity to LDAs that may be related to mid-latitude mantling deposits. LDA Characteristics: In eastern Hellas, LDAs are prominent landforms with curvilinear margins and extend downslope from high-relief source regions such as impact crater walls (interior and exterior), massifs (single and multiple), trough or valley walls, and escarpments. In plan view, LDAs generally have spatulate forms [15]. Most LDAs have thick raised margins up to several hundred meters above the ground surface [31]. Other features indicative of LDAs include divergence around and re-convergence below large obstacles, overlapping lobes, and surface flow lineations perpendicular [3,5,12] or parallel to the apparent flow direction. Mapping: The mapping of LDAs and other icerich flow features was performed digitally using ArcGIS for Desktop 10.2 software. Within ArcGIS, THEMIS IR data were used initially to identify features and map their margins at ~1:180,0001:250,000 scale. Only features larger than 1 km2 were mapped. Subsequent analyses of available CTX images were used to refine and improve the mapping. In our study, an LDA can be a single lobate feature, a collection of coalesced lobate features that form one larger feature, or many separate lobate features that share a common source. Throughout the mapping process, we used the following guidelines: a) both surface textures and features, as well as low sun shade were used as guides for mapping LDA boundaries, b) non-related features within an LDA (e.g., mounds, hills, crater rims, crater ejecta) were excluded from the mapped area, c) where LDA features have both a remnant frontal lobe (i.e., topographically high toe) and a recessed area behind the lobe, both were mapped together as a single complex, d) if the margin of one deposit overlaps another deposit, they were mapped separately, and e) where multiple features appear to coalesce, we mapped the LDA as a single complex. Results: The mapping of LDAs using THEMIS IR was significantly improved and with the increased detail of surface features and textures using CTX, our mapping was then further improved. This approach led to the recognition of new LDAs, refinement of existing LDA margins, as well as identification of other ice-rich flow features (Figure 1). A total of 1,128 individual flow features were mapped in an expanded region between 30°-50° S and 80°-150° E, a 2.8x increase compared to the area in [10]. Crater interior is the most common and widespread source feature (667, 59.1%) followed by single massif (224, 19.8%), valley interior (103, 9.1%), multiple massif (65, 5.8%), crater exterior (34, 3.0%), and escarpment (25, 2.2%). The surface area for individual flow features ranges between 1.16230.5 km2, with an average of 134±392 km2.  2081.pdf

Future Work: Efforts are underway to map LDAs and other ice-rich flow features in the southern hemisphere focusing on the mid-latitudes between 30°50° S [28,29], which includes the eastern Hellas LDAs. Among the objectives of this mapping investigation are 1) systematic documentation of ice-rich flow features to assess their distribution across the Martian surface and 2) identification of other potential regional concentrations. This mapping effort is currently using THEMIS IR as the primary map base as it provides nearly gap-free global coverage with clear improvements in spatial resolution and image quality relative to previous mapping using Viking Orbiter. However, the results of our current study of eastern Hellas indicate that CTX images are needed to confirm the presence of LDAs and provide key information on surface textures to distinguish LDAs from other icerich flow features related to mid-latitude mantling deposits.
