Abstract:  We present early results from hypervelocity (1–20 km/sec) impacts of thousands of individual micron-sized dust grains into foil and meteoritic targets. This work will allow us to study the sub-µm ejecta distribution in impacts that create dusty rings and the zodiacal cloud. Overview: Our goal is to study the physics of hypervelocity impacts by small dust grains into solid targets. These impacts are important in the production of dusty planetary rings and meteoritic (zodiacal) dust [1,2]. For rings, the majority of visible dust in rings such as Saturn’s G and D rings is believed to be from micron-sized impacts, yet virtually no experimental studies have been performed at these size scales. There are no experimental constraints on either the dust ejecta yield or the size distribution of the ejecta.  Hypervelocity dust source: We are using the new dust accelerator at the Institute for Modeling Plasmas, Atmospheres, and Cosmic DusT (IMPACT)1 which provides a steady source of hypervelocity grains which can be studied in impact experiments. The beam can produce tens of thousands of impacts/day, compared to 1-3 impacts/day (of larger projectiles) at gas-gun facilities such as the Ames Vertical Gun Range (AVGR) which have been used for most previous impact experiments [3,4].  The IMPACT accelerator [5] works by charging individual Fe grains and passing them through a 3 MV potential. Masses range from 10-18–10-10 g (diameters 0.05–3 µm), and velocities range from 1–20 km/sec. The beam control system measures a particle’s velocity and mass as it is accelerated, and a particle selector optionally allows individual grains to be removed from the beam. Particles impact the experiment in a vacuum chamber at the end of the 15 meter beamline. Before particle down-selection, the beam produces grains at a rate of ~ 1/sec, spread over a beam diameter of ~ 1 cm. Targets: In Phase I of this experiment (reported here), we are measuring the effect of impacts into targets that have been well-studied at larger sizes [6] in order to calibrate our detectors for the relevant size and velocity ranges. We have chosen suspended Au foils as our primary targets, due to the well-studied nature of                                                                     1 Formerly Colorado Center for Lunar Dust and Atmospheric Studies (CCLDAS). metal foils. We used vapor deposition to make Au films of thickness 0.1–0.5 µm onto thin carbon TEM substrates (~3 nm thick). These are supported by a 3 mm diameter 400-mesh copper grid (London #LF400). This process results in foils which are thinner and have far fewer defects than rolled Au foils. While the foils are our main targets, the Cu structure of the grids themselves provides a secondary target useful for calibration and comparison with previous results. The Cu has effectively infinite thickness (20 µm). As an additional target we have used a polished 1 cm3 sample of meteorite NWA 869. Our sample contains comparable fraction of Si-rich and Ni-rich regions, and is representative of the source material for planetary rings. Results: We have exposed roughly 20 samples to the particle beam and recorded roughly 10,000 individual impacts at a typical impact velocity of 3 km/sec. We are currently studying the impact sites using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Our preliminary findings are:  • For the Au foil targets, nearly all particles penetrate the 0.1 µm foil (Figure 1). Roughly half of the particles penetrate the 0.5 µm foil. The diameters of the holes punched in the foil are slightly larger than the particle diameters. • For the 20 µm Cu metal targets, the majority of impactors are embedded in the target completely (Figure 2). • In meteoritic target, the majority of micron-sized impactors at few km/sec speeds are implanted into the target. In the ~20% that are not implanted, small craters are made but with a crater volume that does not exceed the particle volume, and with little to no ejecta (Figure 3). We see similar behavior in both the Si-rich and Ni-rich portions.  Future work: Phase I will continue as we analyze the results of our impacts and understand the relationship between particle size and velocity, target composition, and hole diameter.  In Phase II we will measure the ejecta from hypervelocity impacts. Particles will be shot into the meteoritic targets, and thin foils will be placed adjacent to the beamline to detect the ejecta from the primary target. We will focus on higher velocity particles (10–50 1690.pdf
