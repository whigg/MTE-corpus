Introduction:  Brecciation and impact-induced fracturing lower the bulk density of the target beneath an impact crater [1, 2]. For simple craters, most of the porous material is in the form of a breccia lens located beneath the crater floor, whereas for complex craters models suggest that fracturing accounts for most of the observed increase in porosity [1]. The effect this lowdensity material has on the cratering process is not well understood, but it has been suggested to be a significant factor in the basic morphology of complex craters [e.g., 3]. Therefore, understanding the extent of subsurface fracturing associated with the cratering process is crucial in crater modeling and in using crater morphology as a tool for investigating planetary surfaces. Previous investigations have primarily been limited to terrestrial impact craters, because geophysical data for extraterrestrial bodies have been insufficient to support such studies. The Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission [4] has afforded an unprecedented view of lunar gravity and has enabled the investigation of craters with diameters as small as ~25 km. We use the GRAIL data to separate the effects of mantle uplift and subsurface fracturing and brecciation, thereby constraining the dependence of fracturing and brecciation on crater diameter (D). GRAIL Gravity Model: We use two gravity field models, each assembled from GRAIL Primary and Extended Mission data and modeled to spherical harmonic degree and order 900: GRGM900B, developed at the Goddard Space Flight Center [5], and JGGRAIL_900C9A, developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory [6]. From these fields, we remove the gravitational contribution that originates from surface topography to form the Bouguer anomaly. Our Bouguer correction uses the principal-axis referenced Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) topography solution [7] and a uniform bulk crustal density of 2560 kg m-3 [8]. We expand each field to degree and order 580 (corresponding to a 10-km wavelength) and apply a cosine taper between degrees 550 and 580 to minimize high-frequency ringing. In addition, we apply a highpass filter to degree l <7 in order to remove longwavelength variations in the field. Gravity Anomaly of Complex Lunar Impact Craters: We consider only complex craters, which we define as those with diameters between 27 km (the upper limit of the transition from simple to complex lunar craters [9]) and 184 km (determined [10, J.M. Soderblom et al., in prep.] as the diameter at which mantle uplift associated with basin formation is apparent in gravity [cf. 11, 12]). For our analysis, we use the set of ~5000 craters identified from LOLA topography [13] (excluding those in South Pole-Aitken basin, which exhibit a unique trend in gravity anomaly vs. D). We define the Bouguer anomaly associated with a crater as the mean Bouguer anomaly measured interior to the crater's topographic rim. To isolate the gravity signature of the crater from regional variations in the gravity field (beyond those removed by filtering), we subtract from our measurements the mean Bouguer anomaly measured within an annulus surrounding the crater extending between the outer flank of the rim [cf. 14] to 2D. We also exclude all craters that are located in regions of high variability in Bouguer gravity (identified from the standard deviation of the gravity field within the surrounding annulus).  Figure 1.

We plot the residual Bouguer anomaly for the craters of this study as a function of D in Fig. 1. The magnitude of lunar crater gravity anomalies correlates inversely with D, up to ~100-150 km. The magnitudes of the gravity anomalies for craters between 131 and 184 km appear independent of D. Pore collapse: The depth of fracturing associated with the formation of an impact crater is suggested to scale with D [1]. At depth, however, pore collapse will occur as the result of viscous flow at high temperature [8] and/or overburden pressure within the lithosphere [1]. Porosity from fractures of craters sufficiently large to reach to this depth will, therefore, be truncated. Terrestrial craters > ~20-30 km in diameter exhibit relatively constant negative gravity anomalies, consistent with the closure of pore space at depth [1]. We use a Bayesian statistics model [15] to determine if our data exhibit a change in the relation between crater diameter and gravity anomaly that is consistent with the effects of overburden pressure (i.e., a two-slope model). We consider two models: one in which the slope at higher diameter is free and one in which it is fixed at zero. We find that both models are decisively preferred to a one-slope model, and both models fit the data equally well (this is due, in part, to the fact that the slope at high D is defined by relatively few craters). We select the model with the fixed zero slope for larger craters, which is more consistent with expectations from the underlying physics. With a nonlinear least-squares fit, we determine that the break in slope of the data shown in Fig. 1 occurs at a D of ~131 km, with a 95% confidence interval of 100 to 149 km (determined from bootstrapping statistics). Mass deficit: To quantify the fracturing and brecciation associated with the formation of a lunar impact crater, we estimate the mass deficit, ∆M, of the porous material relative to the surrounding bedrock by fitting the observed gravity anomalies with a two-dimensional gravity field of a lens-shaped volume. Because we average the gravity anomaly across the entire crater, ∆M is well constrained regardless of the shape and density of this volume of material [cf. Gauss's law]. We assume that the lens of low-density material has diameter D [cf. 1-2,16] and fit for a range of thicknesses. We plot ∆M as a function of D for the craters of this study in Fig. 2. Craters that form in heavily fractured crust will result in a smaller net change in porosity. This effect likely accounts for at least some, if not most, of the vertical dispersion of the data. We assume that the craters that exhibit the greatest gravity anomalies best represent the fracturing and brecciation associated with the formation of a lunar impact crater. We consider these craters as those in the 90th percentile of ∆M.  Figure 2. Modeled mass deficit (∆M) of the craters of this study. Craters exhibiting the greatest ∆M follow a ∆M ~ D2.6±0.1 relation (cyan line). Five terrestrial craters [16, and references therein] are represented by red stars. Because the data are shown on a logarithmic scale, only those with mass deficits (i.e., negative Bouguer anomalies) are shown.  These craters follow a D2.6±0.1 relationship (cyan line in Fig. 2). Note that the uncertainty in this value is not a formal uncertainty, but rather an estimate derived by considering a wide range of input parameters in the model. The exponent is lower than in the D3 relationship identified by previous investigations of both terrestrial and lunar impact craters [1,16]. Those studies, however, were limited to fewer craters and poorer quality gravity data. If the diameter of the porous material scales linearly with D, our results indicate that either the thickness of the porous zone does not scale linearly with D or the average porosity of the fractured and brecciated material scales inversely with D to some power [cf. 2].
