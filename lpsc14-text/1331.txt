THE EVIDENCE FOR SOLAR COSMIC RAY PRODUCED NEON IN SHERGOTTITES, ACAPULCOITES/LODRANITES, AND ANGRITES REVISITED.  R. Wieler1, L. Huber1, I. Leya2, R. Trappitsch3. 1Earth Sciences, ETH Zürich, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland. wieler@erdw.ethz.ch. 2Space Research and Planetary Sciences, University of Bern, CH-3001 Bern, Switzerland. 3Dept. of the Geophysical Sciences and Chicago Center for Cosmochemistry, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA   A sizeable fraction of the shergottites contain cosmogenic Ne with 21Ne/22Ne ratios lower than the lowest values expected for GCR-Ne produced by Galactic Cosmic Rays [1-3]. Garrison et al. [1] interpreted this as evidence for the presence of SCR-Ne, produced by Solar Cosmic Rays, which has a 21Ne/22Ne ratio lower than GCR-Ne (~0.58-0.66 [4,5] vs. ~0.8-0.95, resp. [6]). To find SCR-Ne in many shergottites is rather surprising, since there is very little evidence for this component in the many hundred chondrites investigated [e.g. 1], which is explained by the fact that the outermost few cm (the penetration depth of SCR) are mostly lost upon atmospheric entry. Remarkably, also several members of two further rare classes of meteorites have low (21Ne/22Ne)cos ratios: acapulcoites/lodranites [7] and angrites [8]. Since it is not obvious why SCR-Ne should be rather common in some meteorite classes but not in others, we revisit here the evidence for SCR-Ne based on the parameter 21Ne/22Ne as predicted by the GCR nuclide production model by [6, 9]. Garrison et al. [1] concluded that the lowest (21Ne/22Ne)GCR increases slightly with an increasing proportion of Mg, as observed in mineral separates from the large Bruderheim chondrite. Following [2], Fig. 1 shows the model predictions [6, 9] for meteorites with 5 and 10 cm radius and major element compositions of various shergottites. The lowest (21Ne/22Ne)GCR are expected in small meteorites, which might also have a larger probability of SCR-Ne-bearing material both to survive and being chosen in an arbitrary sampling. The predicted 21Ne/22Ne range for 10 cm meteorites indeed tends to increase with increasing Mg/(Al+Si), with a slope similar to that proposed by [1]. However, no such trend is observed for the 5 cm meteorites. This is due to the fact that in very small meteorites the cascade of lowenergy secondary cosmic-ray neutrons (inducing the reaction 24Mg(n,α)21Ne) is not yet well developed. According to [6, 9], the lower limit of 21Ne/22Ne produced purely by GCR in meteorites of shergottitic major element composition is thus around 0.81, essentially independent of Mg/(Al+Si).  Note that [1] concluded that (21Ne/22Ne)cos ratios below 0.80 are very rare in the hundreds of chondrites they evaluated and suggested that 0.80 is about the lowest ratio possibly produced in ordinary chondrites by a GCR irradiation. This value indeed corresponds closely to the lowest (21Ne/22Ne)GCR  ratio predicted by [9] for L-chondrites with r=5 cm (Fig.1), suggesting that the model accurately predicts the absolute (21Ne/22Ne)GCR ratios at least in small meteorites with approximately chondritic major target element composition.  Garrison et al. [1] compared the 21Ne/22Ne ratios in shergottites with values expected for chondrites, except for variable Mg proportions, but did not consider the substantially variable Na concentrations in shergottites, which has a very high production rate for cosmogenic Ne with a very low 21Ne/22Ne ratio of about 0.5 [6]. Fig. 2 illustrates the influence of Na on the example of a r=10 cm meteorite with elemental abundances of Shergotty except for three different Na concentrations: 0.89% (real Shergotty, close to the average L-chondrite value of 0.69%), 0.26%, and 1.65% (the lowest and highest shergottite values considered here, Y793605 & Los Angeles, resp.). Variable Na alone indeed shifts (21Ne/22Ne)GCR in shergottites by about ±0.02. Therefore, Na should be considered for each shergottite individually but variable GCR-Ne production from Na alone is unable to explain the lowest measured values in Fig. 1.  Also acapulcoites, lodranites, and angrites have chemical compositions and hence cosmogenic Ne production rates quite similar but not identical to chondrites. Fig. 2 shows (21Ne/22Ne)GCR predicted by [6] for selected r=10 cm meteorites of these classes. All respective lines fall close to or above the L-chondrite line, by up to ~0.03. The low observed 21Ne/22Ne values of representatives of these classes can therefore not be explained by different chemical compositions of GCRonly irradiated bodies.  Cosmogenic nuclide production does not only depend on shielding and composition of the analysed sample but to some extent also on the chemical composition of the whole meteorite. This “matrix effect” arises because fluxes and energy distribution of secondary cosmic ray particles depend on the composition of the irradiated material [e. g. 6]. For example, the 21Ne/22Ne ratio is sizeably lower in silicates of mesosiderites than in silicate samples from chondrites [10]. Fig. 2 illustrates the matrix effect as predicted by [6]. An L-chondritic inclusion in a r=10 cm CI chondrite will have a (21Ne/22Ne)GCR ratio lower than an L-chondritic sample in an L-chondritic matrix by approximately 0.03 – 0.04. This is primarily due the different moderation of secondary neutrons in meteorites with different H and C concentrations. Note that, in contrast, variations in the 1331.pdf

Fe concentration such as between H and L chondrites have a negligible effect on the 21Ne/22Ne ratio [6]. Shergottites, acapulcoites/lodranites, and angrites are not rich in hydrogen or carbon. Therefore, we conclude that a matrix effect cannot lead to lower-than-expected (21Ne/22Ne)GCR ratios either.   In conclusion, this exercise has not identified a plausible reason why shergottites and the achondrite classes considered here might possibly contain GCR-Ne with a 21Ne/22Ne ratio lower than approximately 0.80.  For some of these meteorites (e. g. GRV99027, MAC88177) minimum expected (21Ne/22Ne)GCR are even slightly higher and in no case lower than in chondrite samples of identical shielding. In agreement with earlier authors [1-3,7], we thus have to conclude that a sizeable fraction of the meteorites of these classes retain a record of an irradiation by SCR, in quite striking contrast to the very numerous ordinary chondrites investigated for cosmogenic Ne, hardly any of which show unequivocal signs of SCR-Ne.   Exposure age determinations of members of these meteorite classes based on 21Ne thus should take into account the possible presence of SCR-Ne. If several analyses with a large spread in 21Ne/22Ne are available (e. g., Shergotty; Fig. 1), samples with higher 21Ne/22Ne ratios should be preferred, as the large spread makes it unlikely that also such samples contain SCR-Ne. It should also be considered, however, that for samples (of chondritic composition) with 21Ne/22Ne > 0.93 a shielding correction based on (21Ne/22Ne)GCR becomes unreliable [11]. If only a single sample is available, a quantitative correction for SCR-Ne will be possible only if shielding information other than 21Ne/22Ne is available. For example, even in a shergottite sample (with chondritic Na) with a measured 21Ne/22Ne = 0.80 (the lower limit consistent with pure GCR-Ne),  already ~15% of the measured 21Ne would in reality derive from SCR if the GCR-Ne in the sample would actually have a (21Ne/22Ne)GCR ratio of 0.85 (corresponding, e. g., to a preatmospheric depth of 2 cm in a r=10 cm meteoroid).   Garrison et al. [1] and Swindle et al. [12] discussed several possible explanations for the preponderance of SCR-Ne in shergottites, acapulcoites/lodranites, and angrites, but it appears that systematic studies on a large number of meteorites, including depth profiles combining cosmogenic noble gases and radionuclides would be required to solve this puzzle.
