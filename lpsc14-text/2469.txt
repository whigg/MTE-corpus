Introduction: Metal (Fe-Ni alloy) is ubiquitous in carbonaceous chondrites (CCs) [e.g. 1, 2]. However, the origin of metal remains debated, and different models of formation have been proposed such as direct condensation from the nebular gas [e.g. 3], condensation of vaporized Fe-Ni alloy [e.g. 4], reduction of iron contained in silicates [e.g. 4, 5], and destabilization of sulfides [e.g. 6]. The study of metal grains in CR chondrites, one of the most metal-rich groups of CCs [e.g. 7], can supply important information about their origin and history and their further solid-state thermal history during secondary processes. Large isolated CR metal grains appear to have originated as liquid droplets, but little evidence of igneous differentiation in these former droplets has been reported so far. In the course of a study of volatile element zonation in the CR2 Renazzo chondrite [8] we encountered a large metal grain with excellent igneous zoning preserved. To enhance our understanding of the origin of metal in CCs and the possible formation of metal from a liquid as argued by [9], we present here a detailed LA-ICPMS analysis of this zoned metal grain. Methods:  A fragment of Renazzo was imaged by CT scanning using a v!tome!x 240L from GE Sensing & Inspection Technologies Phoenix X!Ray to enable analytical measurements passing through the centers of metal grains. Thus, we used X-ray tomography to locate a millimeter-sized metal grain isolated in the matrix of Renazzo (Fig. 1). Then, we cut and polished the fragment until we obtained a surface corresponding to an equatorial section of the metal grain. SEM-BSE images were obtained using a Tescan VEGA II LSU electron microscope. Laser ablation ICP-MS analyses were performed at Florida State University using a New Wave UP193 FX excimer laser ablation system coupled to a Thermo Element XR ICP-MS. Laser tracks were measured through the center of the metal grain (Fig. 1), using a 15 µm spot size, 5 µm.s-1 speed, 50 Hz repetition rate, 100% power output (1.49 GW.cm-2). To examine the homogeneity of the volatile element distribution on the rim of the grain, a laser track was taken parallel to the border of the grain with the same analytical conditions. To obtain precise compositions for even the most volatile elements, laser spots were measured using a 150 µm spot size, 10 s. dwell time, 50 Hz repetition rate, 100% power output. We used North Chile (Filomena) IIA iron meteorite, Hoba IVB iron meteorite, and NIST SRM 1263a steel as standards.  Results: The two laser tracks passing through the center of the grain show U-shaped chemical profiles for Cu (Fig. 2a), Ga, and Ge. Concentrations measured increase from the core to the border of the grain, in the range of ∼2-72 ppm for Cu, ∼0.4-4.9 and ∼0.2-9.1 ppm for Ga and Ge, respectively. Following the method developed by [10], cooling rates calculated for this metal grain are in the range of 0.1-1 K.h-1 for a peak temperature at which the diffusion profile was established (Tp) of ∼1473±100 K inferred from the correlation of Ga vs. Cu and the mutual diffusivities of these volatile siderophile elements.    Fig. 1: (a) Image in reflected light of the metal grain studied in Renazzo after LA-ICP-MS analyses. (b) BSE image of the same metal grain in which laser tracks (red) and spots (blue) were labelled.   Chemical profiles of Ir and Os display a symmetric zonation (Fig. 2b). Ir and Os contents exhibit ∼1 order of magnitude variation in their ratios relative to Ni (Fig. 3). The bulk elemental abundances obtained by averaging the two laser tracks parallel to the border of the grain display depleted and fractionated (Os, Ir) refractory element patterns while spots from the intermediate Os-, Ir-rich zone have subchondritic W/Re ratios and exhibit high abundances of compatible elements (e.g. Re, Os, Ir, Ru). The most external spots display a relatively flat pattern in refractory elements, with abundances close to the CI values. Au contents range from 0.08 to 0.30 ppm and are correlated with volatile elements such as Cu, Ga, and Ge, and anticorrelated with refractory siderophile elements, as well as Ni (5.1-6.3 wt%), Co (0.26-0.32 wt%) and Pd (2.1-1.5 ppm). W (0.4-0.7 ppm) is correlated with Pd. 2469.pdf

Fig. 3: CI-, Ni-normalized siderophile element pattern for averaged track compositions (2-23 and 2-24) and spot analyses measured by LA-ICP-MS. Pattern calculated for solid metal in equilibrium with a fractionated liquid, initially of CR metal bulk composition of [12], for residual melt fraction (F) = 1 (red), 0.4 (green), and 0.2 (blue).  We calculated, using the solid metal/liquid metal partition coefficients defined by [11], the compositions of a liquid with the bulk composition of CR metal [12] that evolved during fractional crystallization and the solid in equilibrium with this liquid for different residual melt fractions (Fig. 3). The effect of P and C was neglected and the Ge content of the initial liquid was fixed to the value measured in the core of this grain. Negative anomalies for Pd and W, Re Os, Ir, and Co abundances are well reproduced by our model, as well as, to a lesser extent, Ru, Pt, Rh, and Mo abundances. Measured Cu, Ga, Ge, Au, and As abundances display larger variations (up to more than 1 order of magnitude) than those predicted by our model (Fig. 3). The lowest abundances of these volatile elements were measured in the core of the grain. Discussion: Diffusion profiles measured for Os and Ir, siderophile element patterns, and the correlation between W and Pd all support, for this isolated metal grain, a formation by fractional crystallization. Our model of fractional crystallization from a liquid with a bulk composition of CR metal confirms this igneous origin, in particular for the negative anomalies in Pd which cannot be a result of condensation and require that the observed metal is solid metal precipitated from a liquid. The residual liquid is not observed. The intermediate Os-, Ir-rich zone, which displays typical features of cumulative patterns, was the first solid metal which crystallized, while the latest solid to crystallize was the most external part of the grain. Since the lowest contents of Cu, Ga, Ge, Au, and As were measured in the core of the grain, abundances of these volatile elements were most probably modified by diffusion after crystallization. In addition, enrichments observed for these elements from the core to the borders of the grain relative to the predictions of our crystallization model support a re-condensation of Cu, Ga, Ge, Au, and As to the exterior of the metal grain that diffused inwards during cooling. Thus, igneous zoning profiles, i.e. for Os and Ir, were only preserved due to the lower diffusion coefficients of these elements relative to Cu, Ga, Ge, Au, and As [13].  Conclusion: Our results indicate formation of this large metal grain by the fractional crystallization of a molten droplet with a bulk composition of CR metal. Former igneous features have been preserved despite the subsequent re-condensation of volatile siderophile elements to the exterior of the grain that diffused inwards during cooling.
