Introduction: There are two neutron sources responsible for the s-process in Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars: 13C and 22Ne, operating in the 13C pocket at 8 keV between thermal pulses (TPs) and during TPs at 23 keV, respectively [1, 2]. While the 13C neutron source depends on free parameters like the adopted 13C profile and the mass of the 13C pocket, the 22Ne neutron source depends on the adopted rate of the 22Ne(α,n)25Mg reaction, which gradually increases with the slow temperature increase at the bottom of the convective TP [1]. A branch point occurs where neutron-capture on a nuclide competes with β− decay due to, e.g., increased neutron density resulted from activation of the 22Ne neutron source during advanced TPs. AGB model predictions of Sr isotope abundances are affected by the 85Kr branch point, and therefore by both neutron sources, in addition to nuclear input uncertainties [2]. It was shown in [3] that the ratios of 134Ba/136Ba and 138Ba/136Ba in mainstream SiC grains can be used to constrain the 22Ne(α,n)25Mg reaction rate, and the 13C pocket adopted in the model calculations, respectively. We therefore measured correlated Sr and Ba isotopes in 90 single presolar SiC grains. Comparison of model predictions with grain Sr isotope ratios allows us to investigate nuclear uncertainties in the Kr-Rb-Sr region with the correlated Ba isotope constraints on both neutron sources.  Experimental: Strontium and Ba isotopes were measured with the CHARISMA instrument at Argonne National laboratory using previously established methods [4, 5]. The standards for Sr and Ba are SRM855a (an Al casting alloy with 0.018 wt% Sr), and BaTiO3, respectively. We ground the two standards together to form well-mixed power and then mixed it with Ag conductive epoxy for mounting into a drilled-hole on an Al stub. According to the saturation curves obtained for both schemes, Sr and Ba are both well saturated with the beam intensities used in this study. The isotopic compositions of Sr and Ba in 90 new acid-cleaned presolar SiC grains from Murchison in a previously analyzed mount [3] were measured simultaneously using four laser beams with the wavelengths tuned to Sr and Ba RIMS schemes. NanoSIMS analysis of C and Si isotopes of the grains will be done soon for grain classification. More than 1000 counts were obtained for both Sr and Ba in 56 of the 90 grains, which yielded isotopic abundance measurements with reasonable precision. Six of the 56 grains show distinctively different Sr and Ba isotopic compositions from sprocess signatures (e.g., [3]) and might have come from stars other than AGB. We therefore report Sr isotope data of the 50 acid-cleaned grains (mainstream grain candidates) with comparison to the grains from [5] in Fig. 1. Grain data are plotted with 2σ uncertainty. Results:  Grains measured 16 years ago [5] show a wide range of δ84Sr values from slightly above zero to slightly below −800‰, including the solar system value. In contrast, δ84Sr values of all the acid-cleaned grains in this study are less than −500‰ with majority of them lower than −800‰. This difference between the two sets of data is most likely caused by solar system Sr contamination in the earlier study [5]. The presolar grains in this study were acid-cleaned prior to mounting. The acid-cleaning procedure has been shown to be quite effective in removing solar system Ba contamination [3]. The 2 M , 0.5 Z  Torino AGB model explains the correlated Ba isotope ratios of the 50 grains in this study. In addition, it predicts that δ84Sr values should be lower than −800‰ during carbon-rich phase of AGB stars, consistent with our grain data, as shown in Fig. 1. Recall that 84Sr, a p-only nuclide, is bypassed by the sprocess flow and is destroyed by neutron capture. The observed 84Sr abundance in the grains derives from the residual 'N-component' present in the envelope when SiCs condense. Therefore, we conclude that the variation of δ84Sr values found earlier [5] is likely caused by solar system Sr contamination and that such contamination in our acid-cleaned grains is negligible. Using the clean Sr and Ba isotopic data, we discuss its implication to s-process nucleosynthesis calculations. Discussion: The abundances of the three Sr isotopes, 86,87,88Sr, are affected by the branch point starting at the unstable isotope 85Kr. 88Sr lies at the reunification of the two s-process channels. The MACS of neutronmagic 88Sr is extremely low and its abundance is mainly affected by the major 13C neutron source. On the other hand, the MACS of 86Sr is a factor of ten higher with respect to 88Sr. Its final abundance is determined by the 22Ne neutron source because the 86Sr produced in the 13C pocket is mostly destroyed during the peak neutron density induced by the 22Ne marginal activation, and  then restored during the neutron exposure freezeout at 23 keV. On the other hand, despite the fact that 136Ba and 138Ba are unbranched, the abundance of 138Ba is mostly sensitive to the 13C pocket conditions, while 136Ba is sensitive to both neutron sources. Thus, values of δ(88Sr/86Sr) and δ(138Ba/136Ba) are affected by the uncertainties in both neutron sources, and can be used to constrain the 13C profile and the mass of the 13C pocket.

The 22Ne(α,n)25Mg reaction rate from [6] is adopted. Threezone_d2.5 model refers to Torino AGB model with a Three-zone 13C pocket with 3.75×10−4 M   [3]. The model predictions for Sr isotopic composition suffer from uncertainties in the 22Ne(α,n)25Mg rate and neutron capture MACSs. Constraints on the 22Ne(α,n)25Mg rate based on 134Ba/136Ba values of mainstream grains were recently derived [3], which supports the estimate from a more recent measurement [6]. The 85Kr MACS has recently been improved by an indirect experiment [7], where the uncertainty is strongly reduced by 50% with respect to the KADoNiS database (http://www.kadonis.org/). The KADoNiS 88Sr MACS is adopted. The MACSs of 86,87Sr are based on old TOF and activation experiments (see KADoNiS for references) with ~5% uncertainty and are likely overestimated. As shown in Fig. 1, model calculations with 80% of KADoNiS 86,87Sr MACSs are in good agreement with the grain data. By considering the lower and upper limits of the 22Ne(α,n)25Mg rate [3], all model calculations with 80% to 90% of the 86,87Sr MACS values recommended by KADoNiS agree better with the grain data with respect to the KADoNiS values, according to our preliminary results. We tested the effect of 13C pocket mass on δ88Sr model predictions, which increase with decreasing pocket mass in model calculations with a Three-zone 13C pocket, where an exponentially decreasing 13C profile is adopted and divided into three different zones in the model (see [3] for details). Among the Three-zone models, the best match with the majority of the grain data is obtained by Three-zone_d2.5 model shown in Fig. 1, which still mismatches the grains with the lowest δ138Ba values in Fig. 2. On the other hand, we did AGB calculations with a Zone-II 13C pocket, which is a flat 13C profile and treated as a single zone in the model. As discussed by [3], Zone-II models yield δ138Ba < −400‰, but with higher δ88Sr predictions compared to the Threezone models. We have done Zone-II_d2.5 calculations shown in Fig. 2, which explains Sr and Ba isotope ratios of the two grains with δ138Ba < −400‰ within uncertainties, but mismatches the majority of the grains. More Zone-II models will be investigated to see its effect on both δ88Sr and δ138Ba values. Conclusion: Comparison of the acid-cleaned grains in this study with previous single SiC grains [5] for Sr isotopes shows that the acid-cleaning procedure is quite effective in removing solar Sr isotope contamination, consistent with our previous conclusion for Ba isotopes [3]. Preliminary AGB model tests show that the correlated Sr and Ba isotope data could provide stringent constraints on the Sr isotope nuclear uncertainties and the 13C pocket structure.
