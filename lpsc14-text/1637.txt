PROLONGED IRRADIATION AS A POSSIBLE SOLUTION FOR THE DECOUPLING OF 10Be and 41Ca IN METEORITIC REFRACTORY INCLUSIONS.  M.-C. Liu, Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan (mcliu@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw)   Introduction: Irradiation by energetic charged particles from an active young Sun has been proposed as a source for a suite of short-lived radionuclides (SLRs) [e.g., 1]. Among the SLRs that could potentially be produced by irradiation, 10Be (t1/2 = 1.3 Myr) appears to be decoupled from 26Al (t1/2 = 0.7 Myr) and 41Ca (t1/2 = 0.1 Myr) in terms of the abundances in meteoritic Ca-Al-rich Inclusions (CAIs). Isotope measurements of CAIs have shown that the 10Be/9Be ratios in CAIs span from 3×10−4 to ~10−2, regardless of the 26Al content, which could range from 26Al/27Al ~ 0 to 26Al/27Al ~ 5.2×10−5 (the canonical value) [2−8]. Given that 10Be exclusively requires an irradiation origin and that the high but variable 10Be/9Be ratios are most likely derived from the fluence fluctuations in the solar energetic particles [7−9], the decoupling between 10Be and 26Al implies that the majority of 26Al was not derived from irradiation but instead of a stellar source [4]. Compared to 10Be and 26Al, the initial abundance and distribution of 41Ca in the Solar System is poorly understood due to analytically challenging mass spectrometry. Literature data showed that 41Ca existed in the solar nebula at the level of 41Ca/40Ca = 4.2×10−9, and its presence or absence in CAIs is qualitatively correlated with 26Al [10,11]. The latter observation can be understood in the context that 26Al and 41Ca were co-delivered from a stellar source after some of the oldest solids have formed in the solar nebula, and early Solar System irradiation that produced 10Be did not account for the presence of 26Al and 41Ca [4,11]. The production of 10Be by irradiation processes involving nuclear reactions between energetic particles (protons and alphas) and oxygen-rich targets (e.g., oxides, silicates) has been reasonably well studied [e.g., 1,12]. With a favorable target chemistry, for example, CAI-like composition, the aforementioned nuclear reactions would also be conducive to the production of 41Ca, but not of 26Al [e.g., 12]. Earlier calculations have shown that assuming a short irradiation duration (~20 years), proton irradiation with fluence (~1019 cm−2) capable of producing 10Be at the observed levels in CAIs would yield a 41Ca/40Ca ratio close to 10−7, a factor of ~25 higher than the inferred initial ratio in CAIs, while 26Al/27Al was produced at the level of 10−6, more than one order of magnitude lower than 5.2×10−5 [e.g., 12] The results suggested that a stellar source was required for 26Al. However, irradiation contributions to the 41Ca inventory have never been well understood. This is because not only has 41Ca never been observed at such high abundances in any 10Bebearing refractory inclusions, but it is also absent in some of the 10Be-bearing CAIs, e.g., platy hibonite crystals (PLACs) from CM chondrites [10, 11]. Given that some of the 41Ca-free inclusions cannot have formed late [13], such a decoupling between the two radionuclides cannot be attributed to formation of these objects after 41Ca has completely decayed away. The low abundance or absence of 41Ca, albeit based on very limited data, poses a challenge to early Solar System irradiation models. To understand this 10Be−41Ca conundrum, we evaluated the outcomes of prolonged energetic charged particle irradiation. Preliminary results of calculations are reported here. Prolonged energetic charged particle irradiation: Earlier calculations of irradiation production of 10Be in the early Solar System were based on the assumption of enhanced proton flux (~1010 cm−2s−1) and short irradiation time [e.g., 1]. Such irradiation settings resulted in gross overproduction of 41Ca compared to the observed abundance when 10Be was produced at the right amounts. One potential solution to this problem is a prolonged irradiation time because of the large difference in half-lives of the two radionuclides. To understand the 41Ca abundances produced by prolonged irradiation, we performed calculations involving proton and α-particle spallation of CAI-like targets. The flux of projectiles was expressed in the form of a differential spectrum dN/dE∝E−γ, where γ = 2.7 characterizing a gradual flare (i.e., 3He-free) environment was chosen. The main nuclear reactions producing 41Ca were 42Ca(p,pn)41Ca, 44Ca(p,x)41Ca and 40Ca(α,3He)41Ca, and 10Be was produced through the 16O(p,x)10Be reaction. The cross sections of relevant nuclear reactions were either taken from the nuclear databases (e.g., ENDF/B-VII) or estimated by using the TALYS code [14]. The target composition was assumed to be CAI-like, and no energy loss or neutron irradiation was considered as we assumed irradiation of small CAIs or their precursors in the solar nebula. The length of irradiation time was kept as a free parameter, but was considerably longer than 20−30 years used in earlier work [e.g., 1]. The total proton fluence was constrained by setting irradiation-produced 10Be/9Be = 9×10−4. Results: Some calculation results are listed in Table 1. As can be seen, 41Ca/40Ca decreases with increasing irradiation time. When the irradiation time is 1637.pdf

much shorter than the half-life of 41Ca (e.g., ~104 years), the resulting 41Ca/40Ca ratio (~10−7) is too high compared to 4.2×10−9. An extremely long irradiation time of >1 Myr is required to produce 41Ca/40Ca at the level of ~10−8, only 2−3 times higher than the observed ratio in meteorites. Such a factor of 2−3 difference could be reconciled by involving the uncertainties associated with the calculations (e.g., uncertainties of cross section measurements and estimates). The flux of projectiles inferred from the calculations implies that irradiation of solids should have occurred in a less energetic environment compared to, for example, the Xpoint in the X-wind model [1]. That CAIs were steadily irradiated for more than 1 Myr requires some mechanisms retaining them against gas-drag drift into the Sun, for example, outward diffusion due to nebula turbulence [15].  The above scenario, although plausible for CAIs, does not solve the problem of the absence of 41Ca (and 26Al) in 10Be-bearing CAIs (e.g., PLACs). The 10Be/9Be ratios inferred in PLACs are at a relatively uniform level of ~5×10−4, compared to a factor 3−4 variation seen in other CV CAIs bearing 26Al (and 41Ca) [2−8]. Prolonged irradiation (> 1 Myr) producing 10Be/9Be = 5×10−4 would still yield 41Ca/40Ca ~ 10−8, because the production of 41Ca has reached a saturation level. Trapping of galactic cosmic ray (GCR) 10Be by the molecular cloud core could potentially be a solution for this decoupling [16]. If true, this mechanism should only account for 10Be in 26Al-41Ca-free refractory inclusions, as the observed variation in 10Be/9Be in 26Al-bearing CAIs appeared to be too large to be explained by the trapping model. It should be noted that 41Ca/40Ca = 4.2×10−9 was inferred based on the measurements of only three CAIs. It is not yet clear if 41Ca/40Ca = 4.2×10−9 really characterized the initial abundance in the Solar System. If there existed higher 41Ca/40Ca in 10Be-bearing CAIs (with or without 26Al), irradiation as a source for 41Ca would certainly be more favorable. Otherwise, one has to invoke a long irradiation time to marginally explain the low 41Ca/40Ca ratio. More high quality data on 41Ca/40Ca are certainly key to understanding the origin of this radionuclide.
