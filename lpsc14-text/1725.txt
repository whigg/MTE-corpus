JUPITER’S NOBLE GAS ABUNDANCES MAY REQUIRE EXTERNAL UV IRRADIATION OF THE SOLAR NEBULA. S. J. Desch1 and N. Monga1, 1School of Earth and SpaceExploration, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287. (steve.desch@asu.edu).Background: The Galileo probe measured abundances (relative to H) of many elements in Jupiter’satmosphere. While He and Ne (and perhaps O)appear depleted, other elements appear uniformlyenriched relative to H and solar abundances, with[X/H] ∼ 3 [X/H]!, where X may be C, N, S, P, Ar,Kr or Xe [1-4], using solar abundances of [5]. Twomodels of Jupiter’s enrichments, especially of thenoble gases, are currently debated: the “solar composition icy planetesimal” (SCIP) model, in whichJupiter accreted large masses of ices that trappedall elements uniformly in solar proportions [5]; orthe photoevaporated disk model , in which Jupiteraccreted gas that was simply depleted in H2 andpossibly He and Ne—but not Ar, Kr or Xe [7]. Either model requires Ar, Kr and Xe to be trappedin ices; the photoevaporated disk model posits thatUV irradiation by a nearby massive star removedgas that did not contain Ar, because it had beensequestered in ice grains that were dynamically decoupled from the gas as it was lost. Ar (and theless volatile Kr and Xe, too) can be trapped inamorphous ice as it is forming, provided temperatures are < 35K [8]. While temperatures are higherthan this, ≈ 50K, at Jupiter’s location at 5 AU,these low temperatures are achieved in protoplanetary disks beyond about 15 AU [9]. We note thatwhile [7] invoked photoevaporation from the top ofthe disk at about 5 AU, removal of gas is much morephysically plausible at 50 AU [10].Jupiter’s physical separation from the region whereAr is sequestered in ice speaks to transport, anddistinguishes between these models. In the SCIPmodel, Jupiter must directly accrete Ar-enrichedice; but Jupiter is most likely to accrete local icethat is not enriched in Ar, posing problems for theSCIP model. But the photoevaporated disk modelalso demands transport: Ar-bearing gas from 5 AUmust be transported outward to 50 AU; Ar mustbe sequestered in ices; photoevaporation must remove H2; and the newly H-depleted gas must bemixed back to the 5 AU region to be accreted byJupiter (see Figure 1). The outward transport ofgas from 5 AU to 50 AU is predicted to occur inexternally photoevaporated disks [11], but Ar mustbe sequestered into ice after the material moves beyond the 35 K line at 15 AU, but before the gas islost at 50 AU.In this abstract we examine the conditionsunder which Ar, Kr and Xe can be sequesteredinto ice in the outer solar nebula. We conclude that trapping of noble gases requiresnot only cold temperatures but also UV irradiation. UV irradiation enables both theneeded transport of ice and the trapping ofAr in it.The Need to Photodesorb Ice: To be trappedin ice, Ar must be part of the chemical structure,not simply adsorbed as monolayers on ice surfaces.Assuming the standard definition of a monolayer,(1015 atoms per cm2, or 10A˚2 per binding site),and assuming 1% of the gas mass is in the formof ice grains with radii 1mm, at most 2 × 10−8grams of Ar can be trapped per gram of gas, farshort of the solar At mass ratio fAr = 1 × 10−4[5]. Noble gas clathrates like Ar · 6H2O are thermodynamically stable below 48 K [12], perhaps asclose to the Sun as 5 AU. Likewise, amorphous icecan stably trap and hold Ar at temperatures below 35 K. But what is not clear is whether waterice and Ar gas transported outward can transformto Ar-bearing ices in reasonable timescales; at suchcold temperatures (< 50 K) such transformationsare likely to be kinetically inhibited. In practice,[8] found that trapping of Ar in amorphous ice waspossible at temperatures < 35K, but only duringco-deposition of the Ar and the water vapor. But,as long as water vapor is condensing as amorphousice, it is likely to trap all noble gases with equalefficiencies. Potentially, water ice can trap as manyAr atoms as water molecules [8].Trapping of Ar atoms in ice requires not just cold(< 35 K) temperatures, but the presence of watervapor. Cold water vapor is observed in the outerregions of protoplanetary disks such as DG Tau [13].Because of the cold temperatures, H2O moleculesare removed as soon as they encounter ice, taking atime ∼ 300 years to freeze out (assuming again 1%of the mass of the gas, with density ≈ 10−13 g cm−3,is in the form ice grains with radius 1 mm). Watervapor therefore must be continually produced, andphotodesorption of ice by UV radiation, with anefficiency ! ≈ 7 × 10−3 water molecules desorbedper UV photon [14], successfully explains the massof vapor in disks like DG Tau [13].1725.pdf

Model for Trapping Ar in IceWe calculate theflux of UV needed to continuously create water vapor sufficient to trap all of the gas-phase Ar movingoutward in a disk through an annulus between 15to 50 AU, with area A ∼ 1.6 × 1030 cm2. Disksthat are externally photoevaporated are predictedto have net outward transport of gas, with massflow perhaps M˙ ∼ 10−8M! yr−1 [11]. The number of Ar atoms flowing into this annulus per timeis fArM˙/mAr, where mAr is the mass of an argonatom. The number of H2O molecules produced inthe annulus per time is (FISRFG0e−τ/hν)!A, wherethe UV flux is G0 times the interstellar radiationfield FISRF = 1.6 × 10−3 erg cm−2 s−1, the meanenergy per photon is hν ≈ 10 eV, the UV optical depth between the disk midplane and the surface is τ , and it is assumed that essentially everyUV photon is absorbed by an ice grain. Equating these, we estimate a minimum UV flux G0 >1e+τ (M˙/10−8M! yr−1) is required. It is also necessary that the water molecules be desorbed in aregion deep enough in the disk so that they arenot immediately part of warm gas that is lost in aphotoevaporative flow. According to [10], at optical depths τ > 5, the gas ceases to be heated bythe UV flux. Setting τ = 5, we find a minimumUV flux G0 > 150(M˙/10−8M! yr−1). This is tobe compared to the UV flux leading to mass loss at50 AU, roughly G0 ≈ 3000 (M˙/10−8M! yr−1). Weconclude that the UV fluxes required to photoevaporate protoplanetary disks also produce enough UVphotodesorption of ice to produce water vapor sufficient to trap Ar and other noble gases in amorphousice, before the gas is removed from the disk.Given that Ar can be sequestered in amorphous ice,generated by the constant photodesorption and refreezing of water in the outer disk, it will not beremoved from the disk, provided dust grains growquickly enough to dynamically decouple from thegas. The formulas of [15] can be used to estimatethis timescale. Assume small (radii r0 ∼ 1µm)icy grains initially mixed with the gas with scaleheight H . These coagulate and grow in radius anamount ∆r = ficeρgasH/(4ρs) and then settle outof the gas to a new scale height Hf . Assuming anice-to-gas mass ratio fice = 0.01, gas density ρg =10−13 g cm−3, and ice density ρs = 1 g cm−3, wefind ∆r ≈ 0.2 mm. The growth timescale is tgrow ∼tK/(ficeS) ln [S(∆r/r0)(H/Hf)], where tK ≈ 140 yris the local orbital period and S ≈ 1 the stickingcoefficient, With these parameters, we estimate thetime taken for ice grains to grow to sizes sufficientto decouple from the gas is ∼ 75000 years.This is to be compared with the time for gas to crossthe annulus, (35AU)/Vr, where 2pirΣVr = M˙ . Assuming Σ ∼ 30 g cm−2 [11] and M˙ = 10−8M! yr−1,we find an outward velocity Vr = 17AUMyr−1, anda crossing time ∼ 2Myr. Dust grains therefore cangrow and decouple from the gas before crossing theannulus. Photoevaporation will therefore removeonly H2, He and Ne from the disk, not Ar, Kr orXe. The gas will be uniformly enriched relative toH in all the noble gases, and this gas will diffusivelymix on a similar timescale ∼ 2 Myr.Conclusions: The same UV that photoevaporatesa disk will also photodesorb ice, producing abundant water vapor that can recondense as amorphousice, trapping Ar, Kr and Xe as it does so. Thispresents the loss of these noble gases as the diskis photoevaporated. Subsequent mixing brings thisH-depleted gas to where Jupiter forms, thereby explaining Jupiter’s uniform enrichments.References: [1] HB Niemann et al. 1998 JGR 103,22831.
