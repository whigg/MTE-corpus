IDENTIFYING 'BAD' ASTEROID SPECTRA: A CROSS-CORRELATIVE DATABASE STUDY.  I. V. Gerasimenko1 and M. J. Gaffey1, 1University of North Dakota. Email Addresses: ivgerasimenko@randolphcollege.edu and, gaffey@space.edu.   Introduction:  Unless an object has a compositionally or petrologically heterogeneous surface, different observers should obtain similar spectra for individual asteroids and similar spectra should be obtained when a particular asteroid is observed at different times. Different spectra obtained by different groups or at different times could indicate a compositionally heterogeneous surface that would provide important insights into the nature and relationships of the object. Compositionally significant inconsistencies were discovered between the SMASS I [1], SMASS II [2] and S3OS2 [3] asteroid spectral survey datasets during the analysis of asteroid (354) Eleonora [4 and this meeting, Fig. 1]. In the case of (354) Eleonora, we were able to eliminate the possibility that these spectral differences arose from real spectral diversity on the asteroid's surface, from observing geometry or from other known sources of asteroidal spectral variations. By "compositionally significant inconsistencies" we mean that if analyzed independently, the different spectra would suggest significantly different compositions and/or different taxonomic classifications, especially within the most diverse taxonomic systems [e.g., 5,6]  It is important to determine whether this is a problem unique to asteroid (354) Eleonora or whether it is a more pervasive problem with the survey datasets. If it is a widespread problem, serious questions could arise concerning the validity of the asteroid taxonomic classifications and the asteroid compositional determinations that have been based on the survey data. We have undertaken to investigate this question. Methods: The research compares the visual and near infrared (VNIR ~0.4 - 1.0 m; CCD data) wavelength spectral observations of individual asteroids from the existing large survey datasets (SMASS I, SMASS II, S3OS2) in order to identify which asteroids have inconsistent spectral data. Where available the smaller survey datasets of Sawyer [7] and Vilas [8-10] will be incorporated into the analysis. All the necessary data for this analysis is available from the Small Bodies Data Node of the NASA Planetary Data System (http://pds.nasa.gov). Goal: Preliminary work indicates that the problem is not unique to asteroid (354) Eleonora. Figures 2 - 4 show examples of additional inconsistent data. The results of the investigation of 121 asteroids (of the first 200 asteroids) for which data is available in all three survey programs are summarized in Table 1. The research will eventually compare the spectra for all asteroids present in two or more of the survey data sets, and will tabulate the frequency of inconsistencies. If inconsistencies are widespread, the proposed work would investigate the systematics of inconsistencies in order to determine whether they arise from observational, data reduction or calibration problems (bad!) or whether they identify real surface differences on the objects (good!). The goal of this effort is to establish protocols for identifying ''bad'' spectra and eliminating such spectra from analysis efforts.    Figure 1: Asteroid 354 Eleonora spectra in visible wavelength.

other, while S3OS2 data (yellow) deviates significantly. Analysis of S3OS2data would lead to a different interpretation than that for SMASS data.      Figure 3: Different spectral curves obtained for (3) Juno by the SMASS I (purple) & SMASS II (orange) systems and by the S3OS2 (light blue) system.   Figure 4: For (12) Victoria, the SMASS II (orange) data plots right on top of the SMASS I (purple) but deviate beyond ~0.73 m from the S3OS2 (dark red) spectra.
