Introduction: Micrometeorites (i.e. interplanetary dust particles in the 20-500 microns range) extracted from ultra-clean snow in the central regions of Antarctica are well preserved from terrestrial weathering. In the CONCORDIA collection, we identified ultra-carbonaceous Antarctic micrometeorites (UCAMMs) characterized by a high concentration of organic matter (OM) with extreme deuterium excesses [1]. This OM contains a high nitrogen concentration, suggesting that UCAMMs were possibly formed by irradiation of Nrich ices at the surface of bodies beyond the trans-neptunian region [2]. Most D/H measurements are performed using H- and D- secondary ions emission. However, H-bearing polyatomic species with large secondary ion emission yields could be useful for D/H measurements [3]. We present here new results on the possibility to measure D/H ratios at high mass resolution using polyatomic ions with the NanoSIMS-50 (CAMECA). We designed a calibration protocol of the instrumental mass fractionation (IMF), that was applied to D/H microanalyses of an UCAMM fragment. Samples & Methods: To correct measurements from the IMF, we used a series of standards: a terrestrial anthracite (DonH8) crushed in a gold foil and a set of four polystyrene (PS) films prepared with different mixing proportions of non-deuterated PS (CH2-CH(Ph))n and deuterated D-33% PS (CD2-CH(Ph))n, purchased from Polymer Source with a purity of 99%. The PS films were ultra-microtomed (~200 nm) and deposited on a silicon wafer. The D/H ratio of the D-33% PS was monitored by an independent infrared measurement, and the nominal D/H ratios of the PS films were estimated from the mixing ratios: (D/H)nominal = (1.56 ± 0.16)×10-4, (5.56 ± 0.30)×10-4, (1.32 ± 0.08)×10-3 and (3.33 ± 0.10)×10-1, i.e. 1, 4, 8 and 2000 times the standard mean ocean water (SMOW) value. These ratios will be measured with accuracy by conventional mass spectrometry in the near future. The UCAMM fragment, DC06-05-94 (DC94) was crushed in a gold foil. To clean the surface before analyses, the samples were preimplanted over a 200×200 µm² area using a defocused 8 keV Cs+ primary beam of 300 pA during 30 min (total dose ~1×1016 Cs+/cm²). NanoSIMS images were acquired with a 16 keV Cs+ primary ion beam on 25×25 µm² areas (256×256 pixels per frame) on PS samples and 50×50 µm² (512×512 pixels) on DonH8 and DC94, and with a dwell time of 0.5 ms per pixel. Images of 12CH-, 12CD-, 12C2H- and 12C2D- ions were acquired simultaneously with a probe diameter of  about 0.25 µm carrying ~12.5 pA obtained by tuning lenses (L0, L1) on the primary beam and using a 300 µm aperture diaphragm (D1#1). The ions were simultaneously collected on the detectors 1 to 4 with the same magnetic field. An entrance slit of 5µm×100µm (ES#5) was used, and an aperture slit of 150µm×150µm (AS#3) reduced the beam divergence. For 12C2D- species, at mass 26 and radius 480 mm, a selection slit (ExS) of 10 µm was used. In these conditions, we measured the isotopic ratios CD/CH- on PS, and C2D-/C2H- on PS, DonH8 and DC94. An advanced mass resolution (AMR) protocol was developed to improve the spectrometer mass resolution by characterizing the secondary ion beam and choosing a specific spectrometer entrance axis on which to align the secondary ion beam [4]. Results & Discussion: Fig. 1 shows the spectrum at mass 26 from an ultrathin section of the D-33% PS sample. 12C2D is well separated from 12C13CH and its separation with 12C2H2 is sufficient to measure D/H ratios, even at natural abundance levels.   Figure 1: Mass spectrum recorded at mass 26 from an ultrathin section of the D-33% PS sample. The spectrum was averaged over 10 scans. The abscissa scale in volts refers to mass scanning with dedicated deviation plates. Voltage variations are proportional to (ΔM/M), the relative mass difference between mass lines. The built-in voltage scanning step has been here divided by 2.  The relative mass differences (ΔM/M) separating C2D from 12C13CH and C2H2 are 1/8900 and 1/16800, respectively. Following the conventional definition of the mass resolving power (MRP = 0.5/MLW(10%), where MLW(10%) is the mass line width - in relative mass units - containing 80% of the total line intensity), a MRP of 24,000 is achieved in the conditions of Fig. 1. 1,E-01 1,E+00 1,E+01 1,E+02 1,E+03 1,E+04 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 Ave ra ge c ou nts p er sc an Volts (V) 12C13CH 12C2D 12C2H2 104 103 102 101 100 10-1   The AMR protocol allows to use the NanoSIMS at high mass resolution without suffering from a substantial loss in signal. For example, on DC94, ~1.6×105 c/s were collected from C2H-, resulting in a ratio Γ of the signal produced per primary Cs+ current of ~1.4×104 c/s.pA-1 at high mass resolution, compared to Γ ~1.7×104 c/s.pA-1 obtained from H- signals at low mass resolution. The IMF calibration curves (Fig. 2) show the CD/CH- and C2D-/C2H- isotopic ratios measured on a series of 4 to 7 acquisitions obtained from different areas on each reference sample.   Figure 2: (a) IMF calibration curves of CD/CH (blue line) and C2D/C2H (red line) obtained on a series of PS samples and on DonH8 (green dot). 2σ errors are on the order of the dot size ; (b) Enlargment in linear scale of the rectangle drawn in Fig. 2a, for 0 < D/H < 1.5×10-3.  The regression line equation is calculated by the least-squares method. For the measured ratios, the statistical errors (2σ) are close to the counting statistics on each acquisition and the external reproducibility (2σ) between different acquisitions is on average 3% for CD/CH and 4% for C2D/C2H. Using either CH or C2H, the IMF regression curve has a slope close to 1, an intercept compatible with the origin and a linear determination coefficient R2 close to 1. We obtained an IMF (α = Rmeas/Rnom) equal to 0.96 ± 0.01 and to 1.03 ± 0.01 for the CD/CH and C2D/C2H ratios, respectively. The instrumental isotopic fractionation using polyatomic ions (CH-, C2H-) is thus small compared to isotopic analyses using single ions (H-). This is probably due to the large secondary emission yields of ions like CH-, OH-, C2H-, related to their high electron affinities (EA) (1.24eV, 1.83eV and 3eV, respectively), compared to that of H- (EA=0.75eV), entailing lower emission fractionation, and to the small mass difference between C2D and C2H compared to that between D and H (lower detection fractionation). Figure 3 represents the C2D-/C2H- ratio image from the DC94 fragment. The bulk D/H ratio is D/Hbulk = (5.4 ± 0.4)×10-4 [δDbulk = 2500 ± 250 ‰]. The isotopic distribution is highly heterogeneous, and exhibits extreme deuterium excesses, up to 35 times the SMOW value: D/Hmax = (5.4 ± 0.5)×10-3 [δDmax = 34,000 ± 3000 ‰].

Conclusion: At a given magnetic field, ions ranging from 12C- to 12C15N- are available for simultaneous measurements in the focal plane of the NanoSIMS, which is not the case for H- and 12C15N-. The AMR protocol [4] provides the mass separation needed for measuring safely isotopic ratios like 12CD-/12CH- or 12C2D/12C2H-. Thus, using polyatomic ions allows simultaneous measurements of the hydrogen and the nitrogen (12C15N-/12C14N-) isotopic compositions in extraterrestrial samples. 12C2D-/12C2H- and 16OD-/16OH- isotopic ratios can also be measured simultaneously, which provides access to the hydrogen isotopic composition of organic matter and of hydrated minerals in extraterrestrial samples, respectively.
