EVIDENCE FOR MULTIPLE STAGES OF EXTENSIVE LOW OUTFLOW CHANNEL FLOOR RESURFACING IN SOUTHERN CIRCUM-CHRYSE, MARS. J.A.P. Rodriguez1,2,V. Gulick1,3, V. Baker4, T. Platz2 and A.G.

Background. The history of outflow channel activity in southern circum-Chryse is of particular interest because flows from these channels may have contributed to episodes of ocean or sea formation on the planet’s northern lowlands [1,2]. The relevant channel floors of these outflow channels mostly occur within two distinct dissectional levels [3] that formed mostly during the Late Hesperian [3]. The higher elevation channel floor extends from large chaotic terrains that flank extensive zones of subsidence, which led some investigators to hypothesize that catastrophic floods emanated from aquifers [4] or from vast cavernous systems [5-7]. Flood dissection into intra-cryospheric lenses of briny fluids might have led to the formation of systems of secondary chaotic terrains (zones of ouflow channel floor collapse) within these high-level channels [8]. The lower channels extend from Hydraotes chaos, a much broader and lower-lying chaotic terrain, which opens south into Valles Marineris [3]. Thus, in addition, to ground-water evacuation invoked to form the upper level channels, discharges from vast paleo-lakes within central [9] and eastern [10] Valles Marineris might have also inundated these lower outflow channel floors. The smooth surface topography and texture of these floor levels has been interpreted as indicative of a formative history that ended with the emplacement of extensive debris flow deposits [7,11].  Here, we investigate the thus far poorly documented history of secondary chaotic terrain formation within these lower channel floors. Morphologic and morphometric analyses and interpretative synthesis. Using MRO CTX image data in combination with Mars Odyssey Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS, ~512 pixels per degree) day and night Infrared (IR) mosaics and Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA, ~460 m/pixel horizontal and ~1 m vertical resolution) surface topography, we have produced a zonal distribution map showing secondary chaotic terrains and smooth mantles within the southern circum-Chryse lower outflow channels (Fig. 1). We find that although these terrains occur pervasively throughout these channel floors, they are particularly extensive within two major zones (Chryse Chaos and Aurorae Chaos in Fig. 1). The observed mantling materials on these terrains extend ~2500 km from the northern reaches of Simud/Tiu Valles to the Ganges and Eos Chasmata, located in eastern Valles Marineris, which suggests a history of large-scale sediment and fluid discharge from Valles Marineris contributing to the formation of the lower southern circum-Chryse outflow channels [7]. The inferred paths of discharge are consistent with the observed distribution of the smooth mantles within extensive zones that exhibit lengths mostly oriented towards the northern-plains (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Map of southern circum-Chryse, which includes low channel chaos (brown) and smooth mantles (dark gray) (MOLA DEM 512 pixels per degree).   Most of the investigated chaotic terrains are elevated relative to nearby smooth mantles (Fig. 2a and and elevation profile a-a'). Individual knobs and mesas are mostly embayed by these mantles [12] and their distribution retains a fabric of NE trending lineations (black arrows in Fig. 2a). Locally, fracturing of low-lying channel floor outcops marked by bedforms may have contributed to regional chaos formation [12]. 2917.pdf

These observations point to an early stage of outflow channel activity in the region that produced channel floor materials, which was associated with extensive collapse. This stage was then followed by emplacement of the widespread mantle, which likely consisted of debris flow deposits [7]. What are now extensively mantled outflow channel surfaces comprise a major regional unconformity, which likely corresponded to a time when the history of outflow channel activity was not dominated by catastrophic floods, but by the devolatilation of sedimentary deposits.  Fig. 2 Views of Aurorae Chaos (a) and Chryse Chaos (b). S stands for smooth plains and C for chaotic terrains (MOLA DEM 512 pixels per degree). See text for details.   In addition, we have also found evidence indicating that the formation of the Chryse Chaos mostly postdated the regional mantle emplacement in northern Simud Valles, which based impact-crater statistics occurred during the Middle Amazonian or later ( Fig. 1). Chryse Chaos lies at a lower elevation than smooth channel floor materials to the north ( Fig. 2b) and it exhibits lobated fronts [12] on its surface consistent with a history of dewatering.  Palaeo-surface retention within the chaotic terrain appears to have also contributed to the generation of knobs and mesas [12]. We have also identified exhumed ridges, which might represent the remmants of dikes [12] possibly associated with previously proposed regional volcanic activity [5, 13-14]. The intrusion of such dikes into the mantle materials would have post-dated the latest stage of regional outflow channel activity, and would link the development of the Chryse Chaos to the dissipation of geothermal heat. This hypothetical scenario can also explain why the “recent” chaotic terrain formation is spatially restricted to a portion of northern Simud Valles. However, there is evidence for at least two stages of extensive collapse of these floors. Although the formation of the Chryse Chaos might have been associated with a regional geothermal anomaly, subsequent global climate change during the Amazonian [15-17], perhaps resulting from obliquity variations [18] might have triggered channel floor collapse.  Significance and implications. Investigating the geomorphology of the Martian lower elevation outflow channels is particularly important for understanding the nature of the discharges that extended from Valles Marineris into the northern plains. The early flat topography of these channel floors at approximately the same elevation (-4000 m) likely resulted in extensive sedimentation during outflow activity. Broad collapse, as described in this abstract, might be linked to a history of volume loss in volatile-rich sediments, supporting the hypothesis that the Valles Marineris discharges transported significant water volumes (e.g., floods, debris flows, glaciers). These might have contributed to the formation of oceans or seas in the planet’s northern lowlands.  A key and novel implication of this study is that an enormous volume of volatiles would have been released during outflow channel floor collapse. Chryse Chaos has as an approximate area of ~75,000 km2 and a collapse depth that averages to ~150 meters. Thus, ~10,000 km3 of volatiles, which is about half of the total volume of the Great Lakes of North America. The released volatiles could have triggered microclimatic variations in the region that would explain postflooding periglacial resurfacing [19].  References: [1] Clifford S.M. and Parker T.J.
