Introduction: The Amazonian volcanic provinces of Mars host some of the best-preserved examples of extrusive volcanic structures in the Solar system. This provides important morphologic information regarding flood basaltic eruptions that has applications to every terrestrial planet and intraplate settings on Earth. Elysium Planitia (Fig. 1a) is the youngest of these volcanic plains [e.g. 1-3]. Crater counts on volcanic units argue for multiple phases of activity over the last >0.5 Gyrs, with the most recent volcanic features dated to ~2 Ma [4]. Investigating the nature of this recent volcanism is therefore essential to our understanding of the current thermal state of Mars. Even on Earth, the nature of extrusive volcanism –which obscures previous eruptive events - makes it difficult for geologists to reconstruct the sequence and areal extent of eruptions through time. Thus far, the majority of Mars datasets have restricted investigations to the volcanic geology preserved at the surface of Elysium Planitia. Here, with the use of SHARAD we are able to expand upon those studies and penetrate over hundred meters into the subsurface to visualize the underlying structure. Sounding radar can also be used to infer the bulk compositional properties of geologic materials [see: 5-8]. We will present the result of an in-depth study of over 200 SHARAD tracks that cross Elysium Planitia (Fig. 1b). We will present a reconstruction of a sequence of now-buried flow units and assess the volume of lava associated with each eruption. SHARAD Radar: SHARAD operates at a 20 MHz center frequency (15m wavelength) with a 10 MHz bandwidth, and has a free-space vertical resolution of 15 m, equivalent to a 5 – 10 m vertical resolution for 2377.pdf

common silicic geologic materials [9]. At this wavelength SHARAD is capable of probing hundreds of meters into the subsurface. With synthetic aperture focusing and dependent on the surface roughness, SHARAD has an along track spatial resolution of 300 – 500 m. Such spatial and penetration resolution is optimal for mapping the subsurface units underlying the thousands of km expanse of Elysium plains [10,11], which are estimated to be <200 m thick [4]. SHARAD 3-d interface mapping can be utilized to derive estimates of the volume of distinct geological units. In areas where constraints can be placed on the ages of surface units, Elysium Planitia effusion rates may be calculated. Alternatively, in areas where DTMs can establish the thickness of geological units, timedelay values from sounding radar observations can be used to estimate the dielectric permittivity of the material. This value can then be matched against laboratory studies of geologic materials relevant to Mars. Measuring the loss tangent of dipping subsurface reflectors provides additional compositional constraints [7]. Such techniques have been used to explore the physical properties of Tharsis lavas [8].  SHARAD Results: The majority of the SHARAD tracks contain evidence of at least one subsurface reflector (Fig. 1c). Many reveal multiple, overlapping reflectors at different depths suggesting a complex subsurface structure. Due to the high density of the SHARAD coverage in Elysium Planitia (Fig. 1b) it is possible to trace out individual reflectors that extend between neighboring orbital tracks. Mapping the spatial distribution of reflectors provides a unique 3-d perspective of the original landscape prior to the emplacement of the most recent geologic units. Subtracting the reflector depth estimates from the MOLA gridded data removes the effects of surface elevation and allows patterns in the reflectors to be more easily discerned [see 10]. Through this process we have identified a vertical stack of four reflectors (Fig. 2). Some of the upper most reflectors in the stack show strong spatial correlation with individual lava flow units: A & B (identified by their topographic signature in the MOLA gridded data) and most likely represent the base of these flows (Fig 1a, c & 2). The bases of discrete lava flows have also been observed by SHARAD west of Ascraeus Mons [8]. Due to the similar structure in the deeper reflectors we interprete the stack to represent a sequence of individual lava flow units representative of four individual eruptive events. Considering the range of ages of the surface units of Elysium Planitia [4] and based on studies of large igneous provinces on Earth such as the Columbia Flood River basalts it is quite possible that the flow unit emplacement was separated by significant time periods. Such breaks in time between eruptions would also allow for the emplacement of thin aeolian or fluvial sediment layers that provide the dielectric contrasts implied by SHARAD reflections. Volume can be calculated by subtracting depthcalibrated SHARAD interface locations from the MOLA elevation data. We will present a volume estimate for each of the four identified lava flows.    Fig. 2. 3D reconstruction of a sequence of four lava flow units derived from interpolating between distinctive reflectors identified in the SHARAD tracks. The top two reflectors correspond to the surface lava flows: A and B, whereas the two deeper flows are completely buried below the present surface.
