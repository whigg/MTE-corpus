(prakash@sac.isro.gov.in)          Introduction: Presence of water molecules i.e. OH/H2O on lunar surface has been an active area of research in recent times. Using reflectance spectroscopy OH/H2O has been identified from several lunar areas remotely using Moon Mineralogical Mapper (M3) data. Water has also been directly estimated using  MIP instrument on-board Chandryaan-1 and LCROSS experiments[1,2]. The discovery of water molecules from lunar surface changed the perception that lunar surface/interior is bone dry. Enhanced hydration associated with endongenic water reported from Compton Belkovich (CBVT) volcanic terrain  and central Peak of Bullialdus Crater strongly supports the hydrated lunar interior [3,4]. Here, we report similar type of enhanced water signature associated with lunar far side Jackson crater as measured by M3 instrument onboard Chandrayaan-1 satellite launched on 22nd Oct, 2008 [5].      Jackson Crater: Jackson is a young impact crater (Copernican age) of ~71 km diameter located in the far side highlands. The central peak of the crater has been found to be consist of two different material. The slopes of the peak were recognized to be dominated by pure crystalline plagioclase whereas the summit area is suggested to be covered with mega-regolith or impact melts [6].  Fig.1 shows M3 images of the Jackson crater imaged during optical period OP2c but with different operating and illumination conditions and acquired on two different dates.

M3G20090621T025007  was imaged during optical period OP2c, (b) Image no M3G20090718T10140 acquired in different sun illumination angle and on a different date.    Results from M3: M3 is an imaging spectrometer onboard Chandrayaan-1 covering the spectral range from 0.45-3.00 µm with 85 spectral bands and ~140 m per pixel (in Global mode) spatial resolution [7]. M3 reflectance data (level2), corrected for thermal and photometric effects have been used for the present study [8]. Images from two different imaging dates were used to understand the OH/H2O absorption feature strength variations over a period of time, if any. The spectra from two different imaging dates were plotted together for comparing the variation in band strength of the 2800 nm absorption feature.        Water absorption from Jackson crater: Fig 2 (a) shows RGB M3  image (Red = 1000nm, Green = 1250nm and Blue = 2816nm) and the extracted reflectance spectra is shown in figure 2(b). The spectra (Fig. 2b) clearly shows a strong dip around 1.25 and 2.8µm characteristic of crystalline plagioclase and OH/H2O feature, respectively. The OH/H2O feature detected from Jackson crater seems to be much stronger than reported from the central peak of Bullialdus crater. The spectra shown in black and magenta represents same location of central peak extracted from the two different images whereas green and red spectra represents crater wall spectra. From the figure 2b it is evident that the strength of the OH/H2O feature does not vary in two different date and sun illumination condition spectra. Fig 2c represents band depth image for OH/H2O absorption feature generated from M3G20090621T025007 where red represents the maximum. The band depth image shows that the OH/H2O feature strength is high on central peak slope areas and is associated with crystalline plagioclase. The hydration feature is also not restricted to the central peak but also present on the walls of the crater and here it is associated with pyroxene mineralogy.                2072.pdf

Reflectance spectra showing 2.8µm absorption characteristic of OH/H2O. The black and red color spectra were extracted from the location marked in (a) M3G20090718T101402. Magenta and green color spectra is extracted from different sun illumination condition image M3G20090621T025007. The spectra were normalized with 750nm reflectance. (c) Band depth image of OH/H2O generated from M3G20090621T025007 where red color signifies maximum. The high strength has been observed from the central peak as well on the crater wall.             Conclusions: The presence of OH/H2O feature at polar areas is attributed to the poor sun illumination conditions and cooler surface temperatures. Jackson crater is situated on the far side of the Moon at around (22° N, 197° E) far away from the polar area. Therefore, the hydration feature observed is not superficial or an adsorbed water. Jackson crater exhibits an enhanced hydration feature associated with the fresh crystalline plagioclase slopes of the central peak and with pyroxene rich walls of the crater. The study from the two different date images suggest that the hydration feature is not superficial and not because of adsorbed water. The non-variable band strength of the hydration feature also suggests that the OH/H2O molecules are not loosely bound to the surface and may represent the absorbed water in the regolith or within the plagioclase crystal structure.
