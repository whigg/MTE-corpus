EMPLACEMENT AND EROSIVE EFFECTS OF A TURBULENT LAVA FLOW IN KASEI VALLES, MARS.  C. M. Dundas1 and L. P. Keszthelyi1, 1Astrogeology Science Center, U. S. Geological Survey, 2255 N. Gemini Dr., Flagstaff, AZ 86001, USA (cdundas@usgs.gov).    Introduction: Flood lavas cover much of both Mars and Earth and represent critical pieces of the geologic history [1]. Terrestrial flood basalts are usually emplaced as slowly inflating pahoehoe sheet flows produced by decade-long eruptions with moderate effusion rate [2-3]. However, the only well-documented Martian flood lava flow, in Athabasca Valles, was produced by a turbulent flood of lava lasting weeks to months with a flux on the order of 107 m3 s-1 [4-5].  Jaeger et al. [5] could not rule out the idea that Athabasca Valles was eroded by the lava. Cataldo et al. [6] show that thermal erosion was minor due to the short eruption, but mechanical erosion may be possible [7, 8]. More generally, the idea that the Martian outflow channels were cut by lava rather than water has recently been given new attention [e.g., 9]. However, since the Athabasca Valles flow almost perfectly filled the channel, it is difficult to interpret the interactions between the lava and the pre-existing surface.  In order to better understand erosion by Martian flood lavas, we studied lava in Kasei Valles. "Platyridged" lava similar to the Athabasca Valles flow is found along much of the floor of the valley [10], but due to the larger scale of erosion it is easier to evaluate how the lava interacted with the pre-lava topography. We find evidence for local erosion and cataract retreat, but at scales far smaller than outflow channel systems.  Methods: We used Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) derived from Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Context Camera (CTX) [11] images to investigate three locations in south Kasei Valles (SKV). DEM production methods are similar to those for the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) [12]. Standard equations [5, 13] were used to investigate lava velocity and flux based on measured channel cross-sections and lava surface slopes. Lava densities of 1,400 and 2,300 kg m-3 and viscosities of 10, 100, and 1,000 Pa s were assumed, appropriate for ultramafic to intermediate lavas of moderate vesicularity [14]. We also made morphological observations of the surface, particularly of interactions between lava and topography, to gain insights into erosion by the lava.  The first DEM is located where lava in SKV enters the upper of two large cataracts in the valley system. The second is located at a local constriction with a smaller cataract, and the third is located at the lower large cataract. These locations are particularly favorable for understanding flow dynamics because the lava largely drained away, leaving a coating on the surface.  Results: First DEM: We investigated one cross section (Fig. 1) from the first DEM, finding a flux of 0.2 - 1.0 × 106 m3/s. In all but the highest-viscosity cases the model indicates turbulent flow. Two observations imply limited erosion where the lava spills into an arm of the cataract. First, lava is found downstream of the cataract head, while the present topography would likely have captured the flow. This geometry suggests cataract retreat of around 1 - 2 km (much less than the scale of the cataract system; Fig. 1A). The arm of the cataract that captured the lava is also wider and deeper than the others. Second, the floor of an inner channel draining into the cataract (Fig. 1B) is tens of meters below the downstream continuation. Both observations point to lava erosion that was locally significant, but far smaller in scale than Kasei Valles or even the major cataract within the channel.  Second DEM: We examined three cross-sections from the second DEM: one upstream from the small cataract, one just above its head and one within the channel. Since lava built up the surface at the first two cross-sections, we estimated the original surface by extrapolating from the non-lava-coated surfaces. The modeled flux was 3 - 11 × 107 m3/s, with model fluxes from the third cross-section being roughly half of the others for given rheological parameters. The flow was turbulent and the velocity may have been up to 45 m/s.  The lowest elevation point from our estimated original surface just upstream from the cataract is close to the rim level, suggesting that erosion upstream from the cataract was minor. A high-lava mark near the channel midpoint suggests that the channel was at least 40 m deep there before emplacement of the lava. Since the morphology of the eroded channel suggests headwall retreat rather than vertical incision, at least half of the channel length may have preceded the lava flow.  Third DEM: We investigated a cross-section just upstream from the lower cataract. The setting is similar to the first DEM, but the results should be interpreted cautiously because the channel is subdivided into several sub-channels here. We use the overall width and the hydraulic radius of this channel to estimate the flow parameters. Model results indicate a flux of 0.6 - 2.0 × 106 m3/s and velocity of 4 - 15 m/s.  Discussion and Conclusions: The behavior of lava in Kasei Valles was similar to that in Athabasca Valles. It was locally turbulent and had high fluxes, ~100× those inferred for terrestrial inflated sheet flows but somewhat less than the Athabasca flow. Although only 2211.pdf

two examples are available, this emplacement style could be the standard way of emplacing large lavas on Mars, at least in the later part of the planet's history.  The mismatch in fluxes along-flow is notable. One possibility is that the platy unit represents multiple flows [10], but the lowest estimated flux was at the upstream cross-section through which all of the flows must have passed. (We observe some candidate flow fronts within the lava, but given the generally uniform preservation state, we suspect that they are due to late breakouts within the flow. Since the flux calculations and erosion observations are local, this possibility does not affect our conclusions.) Other possible sources of error are in the estimation of surface slope, differences between final topography and that when the high-lava mark was set, or very high Reynolds numbers where the velocity equations [5, 13] may be inaccurate. However, an additional intriguing possibility is that the high fluxes from the second DEM reflect breaching of a large body of ponded lava. Immediately downstream from the first large cataract, the high-lava mark is very close to level for tens of km and the current surface indicates drainage of >100 m of lava from that mark.  Morphological observations demonstrate locally significant erosion, particularly headwall retreat at cataracts. However, the scale of this erosion is far less than that of Kasei Valles. It might be argued that the larger flux of the Athabasca lava allowed it to cut that smaller channel. However, the lava was largely confined to the channel, and use of the pre-erosion topography would reduce the flux estimate. Moreover, lava in Kasei Valles was clearly aggradational in certain locations in the second DEM. Net aggradation is likely along most of its length, since we examined locations with relatively high local slopes, where mechanical erosion is concentrated. Therefore, while large, turbulent lava flows clearly have significant potential for local erosion, it is unlikely that such flows produced the large outflow channels unless they were significantly more vigorous or longer lasting than the lava we have observed in Kasei Valles—which had one of the highest fluxes of any eruption in the Solar System.
