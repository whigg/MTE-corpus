 SOME FEATURES OF DISTRIBUTIONS OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL CHROMITE GRAINS IN ORDOVICIAN LIMESTONE OF THE DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE WORLD. V. A. Alexeev, Vernadsky Institute of Geochemistry and Analytical Chemistry, RAS, Moscow 119991 Russia; e-mail: AVAL37@chgnet.ru    Introduction: In the Thorsberg quarry, Sweden, about 100 fossil L-chondrites were found in the midOrdovician sediments [1, 2]. The possibility of origin of all these meteorites as a consequence of fall the single meteorite shower ~470 Ma has been discussed in detail in [3-5]. In the Thorsberg quarry, together with the meteorites, relic sediment-dispersed extraterrestrial chromite (EC) and "other" Cr-rich spinel grains (OC) (mainly terrestrial origin) were also found. In the other places of Sweden as well as in China and Russia, analogous grains were also found in the sediment layers of the same age as age of the layers where the fossil meteorites were discovered [2, 6, 7]. Here we compare the distributions of the extraterrestrial and terrestrial grains in different layers, according to data [2, 7-9]. Data: Distributions of the grains of EC and OC through mid-Ordovician strata in Sweden, China and Russia are demonstrated in Fig. 1. We can see the layers coeval with the layers containing the fossil meteorites are enriched by extraterrestrial chromite grains. However, the same layers are also enriched by terrestrial chromite grains. According to [7], "the coexistence in some beds of high concentrations of chondritic chromite and terrestrial Cr-rich spinels, however, indicates that redistribution of heavy minerals on the sea floor, related to changes in sea level and sea-floor erosion and currents, must also be considered". Below we shall analyse the relationship of concentrations of grains of EC and OC in different layers. Discussion: Abundances of the extraterrestrial and terrestrial chromite and ilmenite grains in the quarries of Sweden, China and Russia are presented in the Tables 1 and 2.  According data of the Table 1, the average content of the extraterrestrial chromite grains (EC)  in the layers enriched with these grains in the quarries of Sweden and China  (the A2 group on Fig. 1) is equal to N(A2) = 2.03 ± 0.07 kg -1 . In the same quarries, the layers formed during other time (the A1 group) have the average content of the EC chromite grains of N(A1) = 0.050 ± 0.009 kg -1 . Hence, enrichment factor of group A2 by extraterrestrial chromite grains (in comparison with A1 group) is equal to N(A2)/N(A1)=40.6 ± 6.6. However, the same picture is also observed for grains of a terrestrial origin (OC). Here, the enrichment factor by terrestrial chromite grains is equal to 23.6 ± 6.7. According to these data, we can find "true" enrichment factor by extraterrestrial grains: K = KA(EC)/KA(OC) = 40.6/23.6 = 1.7 ± 0.6. The similar picture is also observed for representative set of samples from quarry of the Lynna River (Table 2). On the Fig. 1, these samples are denoted as groups of B1 and В2. Here, average concentration of EC grains for the layers enriched by extraterrestrial component (B2 group) is N(B2) = 7.57 ± 0.34 kg -1 , whereas for B1 group concentration of EC grains is N(B1) = 0.052 ± 0.037, i.e. an enrichment factor by extraterrestrial material is equal to N(B2)/N(B1) = 146 ± 104. However, we can also see similar enrichment for the samples of groups B2 and B1 by grains of terrestrial origin. Here, the enrichment factor is equal to 42.5 ± 13.9. And true enrichment factor by extraterrestrial grains will be equal to K = KB(EC)/KB(OC) = 146/42.5 = 3.4 ± 2.7. Conclusion: Disruption of the L-chondrite parent body ~470 Ma stipulated high concentration of the extraterrestrial chromite grains in the Ordovician limestone in Sweden, China and Russia. However the layers enriched by the extraterrestrial chromite grains (EC) are enriched as well by grains of a terrestrial origin (OC, chromite spinel and ilmenite). The analysis of the data received for different regions of the Earth has allowed drawing a conclusion that the increase in a stream of micrometeorites onto the Earth about 470 million years ago was within factor К~3-4 only, but not 2-3 orders of magnitude. The study was financially supported according to the Program P22 of the Presidium of RAS. References:  [1] Schmitz B. et al. (2001) Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 194, 1-15. [2] Lindskog A. et al.
