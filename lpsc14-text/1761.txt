Introduction:  CM chondrites are breccias in which lithic clasts showing various degrees of aqueous alteration are mixed together [1]. Aqueous alteration of CM chondrites is documented by various minerals that were either modified by or directly precipitated from fluids (e.g., carbonates, tochilinite, cronstedtite or their intergrowths = TCI, [2]). The location, timing, and conditions (e.g., fluid compositions, temperatures) of aqueous alteration in CM chondrites and the chronological relationship to brecciation are still controversial [1-5]. In order to set constraints on this issue, different approaches can be taken such as micro-structural investigations by TEM or chemical and isotopic analyses. In particular, oxygen isotope systematics of bulk CM chondrites and bulk mineral fractions (e.g., carbonates), and in situ analyses of carbonate grains have provided important constraints on fluid evolution [611]. In situ data, however, is still sparse [7-9]. Two main models have been proposed to explain  oxygen isotope systematics of CM carbonates. (a) Different populations of calcite grains apparently point towards distinct pulses of carbonate formation [7,8]. (b) A continuous trend in oxygen isotope systematics was explained by a progressive change in fluid Δ17O [6]. Both are based on a closed system, static fluid model [10]. Alternatively, gradually changing carbonate oxygen isotope data at about constant Δ17O in the Sutter's Mill CM chondrite [9] was interpreted to indicate flowing water in an open system along a temperature gradient, which is related to the depth in the parent body [11]. Here, in situ ion microprobe (SIMS) analyses of 81 calcite grains in CM chondrites Maribo [12], Murchison, Cold Bokkeveld, Nogoya, and Banten are presented and discussed within the framework of fluid evolution models outlined above. Samples and methods:  Calcite grains were identified in thin sections and characterized by EDS using a JEOL 6610-LV SEM. SIMS measurements were performed using the CRPG-Nancy CAMECA IMS 1270 and 1280 HR2 instruments. The 18O- and 16O- ions were counted on two Faraday cups (L'2 and H1), 17O- ions on the axial electron multiplier (EM) in multicollection mode. San Carlos olivine and quartz NL615 were used to monitor and correct for the yield changes of the EM. Instrumental mass fractionation was determined by replicate analyses of the Carrara marble and calcite MEX standard. The 17O counts were corrected for 16OH contribution by measuring the opposite tail of the 16OH peak assuming symmetry of the peak. This correction was cross-checked by analyzing the TAN25-4 basaltic reference glass (~4 wt% H2O). Errors for calcite analyses are better than ±1.8 and ±2.7‰ (2σ) for δ18O and δ17O, respectively. Results:  All calcites occur as isolated grains within lithic fragments or the clastic matrix. Textures range from nearly pure calcite with minor TCI to calcite that is surrounded by a TCI rim and/or contains TCI lamellae replacing the calcite. SEM EDS revealed that minor elements Fe and Mg are <1 wt% in calcite. Six calcite grains in Maribo (Δ17O: 1.5 to 4.2‰) fall towards the high end of measured δ18O and δ17O values for calcite including literature data (Fig. 1a). Calcite grains (n=23) in Cold Bokkeveld show a continous change in δ18O and δ17O (Δ17O: -0.2 to         -4.6‰). Murchison calcite (n=26) reveals a large population (n=22) ranging from δ18O 30.3 to 38.7‰ and δ17O 15.0 to 18.5‰. Four grains fall towards more 16O-rich compositions. Δ17O for all 26 calcite grains ranges from -0.2 to -3.2‰. The calcites analyzed in Banten (n=10; Δ17O: -0.8 to -2.9‰) mainly cluster between 27.3-35.6‰ δ18O and 13.4-17.2‰ δ17O. Two grains give more 16O-rich values (Fig. 1a). One out of 16 calcite grains in Nogoya shows δ18O 22.7‰ and δ17O 9.0‰. The others range from 27.4-36.6‰ and 11.4-18.4‰ in δ18O and δ17O, respectively. Δ17O of all Nogoya analyses varies between -0.1 and -3.6‰. Discussion:  A regression through all data points from this study and calcite from [7-9] gives δ17O = 0.65(±0.03) × δ18O - 5.4(±0.9) (2σ; R2 = 0.91,   MSWD = 1.3), similar within 2σ error to the regressions reported in [6-9]. The slope is distinct from the mass-dependent fractionation slope of ~0.52 that could indicate fluid flow along a temperature gradient at fixed Δ17O [11]. A slope of >0.52 implies a change in Δ17O of the fluid. The gradual change in oxygen isotope compositions of all samples (Fig. 1a) suggests that this change was continuous. The results of the present study therefore support the fluid evolution model invoked by [6] with certain carbonates in certain CM chondrites tracking different precipitation events [7]. Following [6-8,10], the fluid drives towards more 16O-rich compositions as alteration proceeds. Hence, more primitive fluids have more positive δ18O, δ17O, and Δ17O. Consequently, Maribo calcite showing the highest δ18O and δ17O is interpreted as an early precipitate from a more primitive fluid, while Murchi son, Cold Bokkeveld, Banten, and Nogoya calcite formed from a more evolved fluid, i.e., later on a relative time scale. Calcites in the four latter samples document a larger change in fluid composition than those in Maribo. Different CM chondrites either indicate a continuous range of calcite oxygen isotope compositions (e.g., Cold Bokkeveld), whereas others show apparently distinct populations (e.g., EET samples, LON 94101, Fig. 1b). All samples from this study and the literature, however, form a continuous trend in three oxygen isotope space (Fig. 1a). This might be explained by the brecciated nature of CM chondrites and not necessarily by different pulses of calcite formation in situ [7,8]. Assuming that there was once continuous fluid evolution on the CM primary accretionary rock [5], this may have resulted in CM material with a range of alteration stages that was subsequently brecciated. The degree of representative sampling of this original material by the newly formed breccias could give rise to the apparent populations vs. gradual trends. This might be confirmed by detailed studies of the petrographic context (i.e., the degree of alteration of the calcite host lithology/clast) combined with oxygen isotope constraints. Such a scenario is also supported by the observation of disequilibrium assemblages (metal-rich areas next to completely altered portions) in CM chondrites. All Maribo and some LON 94101 calcites show a slight increase in δ17O at high δ18O deviating from the general trend (Fig. 1b), the reason for which remains to be solved. Excluding both data from regression would still give a slope >0.52. One might speculate that these calcites trace more primitive, heavy water (16O-poor) and/or fluid compositions different from the other calcites (Fig. 1b). This could also be in agreement with formation of calcites on different parent bodies that were destroyed and reaccreted to second generation bodies.  The oxygen isotope composition of precipitated calcite differs from water by a temperature-dependent fractionation factor [13]. First estimates of the fluid composition in equilibrium with calcite analyzed here indicate a composition distinct from the initial CM water by [10] (Fig. 1a). This composition would be shifted towards more 16O-rich values (Fig. 1a), assuming a water temperature in the range of ~20-71°C [14]. This could indicate that the initial water composition inferred by [10] may not be true. Alternatively, the calcites formed from a fluid that had already reacted with anhydrous silicates shifting its composition towards more 16O-rich values.
