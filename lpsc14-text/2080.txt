Introduction:  The deuterium/hydrogen ratio (D/H ratio) yields important information on origin and geologic history of the fluid, and fluid-rock interactions. In-situ measurement of D/H ratio is quite useful in planetary explorations.  We examine the possibility of measuring the D/H ratio with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). LIBS is a rapid and convenient chemical analysis method, which is suitable for in-situ measurements [e.g., 1]. Pulsed laser irradiation creates small plasma on the sample surface, and the emission form the plasma is observed spectroscopically [e.g., 2]. We are trying to determine the D/H ratio of samples using Hα and Dα emission lines.  The wavelengths of emission lines on LIBS spectra depend on the elements and the energy level gap between an excited state and a lower state where electrons transit. Wavelengths of emission lines of an isotope are slightly different from those of the most abundant species because of the difference in nuclear mass. The Hα line is at a wavelength of 656.28 nm, and the Dα line would theoretically appear at 0.18 nm shorter wavelength than the Hα line. The intensity of emission lines depends on plasma temperature, which differs due to laser irradiation conditions. If H atoms and D atoms are in thermal equilibrium, however, the ratio of Dα to Hα line intensity does not depend on temperatures and must be always equal to the abundance ratio of D atoms to H atoms in samples.  In this study, as a first step, we tested the D/H ratio measurement of H2O/D2O ice with LIBS. The purpose of this study is to confirm that (1) Hα and Dα emission lines are observed separately and (2) the D/H ratio can be determined from the intensity of Dα and Hα emission lines. The influence of laser irradiation conditions and ambient pressures were also investigated.  Experiments:  The ice samples were made by freezing the H2O-D2O mixture in a refrigerator. The D/H ratios of the samples are 0/100, 10/90, and 50/50. The ice samples were placed in a vacuum chamber, and the chamber was evacuated with a turbo molecular pump. The lowest pressure achievable in this system was ~1×10-1 Pa where sublimation of the ice and evacuation are balanced. The samples were irradiated with a Nd:YAG laser. The plasma emission was collected with a reflecting lens and measured with an echelle spectrometer. The wavelength resolution of the spectrometer at 656 nm is ~0.017 nm, which is high enough to separate the centers of Hα and Dα emission line peaks. Spectra from fifty laser pulses were accumulated on each experimental run. The ambient pressures of 1.0×105, 1.0×103 and 1.5×10-1 Pa and the laser pulse energies of 100 and 200 mJ were tested.   Results and discussions: The examples of acquired spectra are shown in Figures 1 to 5. In these plots the spectra are normalized by the Hα peak heights. Figures 1, 2, and 3 are the spectra from 655.5 to 657.0 nm for the 0/100-, 10/90-, and 50/50-D/H ratio samples, respectively. The Hα peak appears at ~656.28 nm (Figure 1). When the ambient pressure was 1.5×10-1 Pa, the Hα and Dα peaks were observed separately (Figures 2 and 3). The wavelengths where those peaks appear almost match the theoretical values.  Figure 4 shows that the laser pulse energy does not change the shape of the peaks significantly; the Hα and Dα peaks were separated for both 100 and 200 mJ at 1.5×10-1 Pa. When the ambient pressures were 1×105 and 1×103 Pa, however, these peaks were not separated clearly because of line broadening (Figures 5). This indicates that D/H ratio measurement with this method is applicable only when the ambient pressure is low enough, such as the surface of Moon and asteroids.  The D/H ratios were estimated simply as the ratios of the Dα peak area to the Hα peak area. The area of the Hα and Dα peaks were determined by fitting Voigt functions to both the peaks (the fitted curves are plotted as dotted lines in Figures 1 to 3). The D/H ratios estimated by the Hα and Dα emission line measurement are summarized in Table 1.The average D/H ratios of four experimental run are listed for each experimental condition. The D/H ratios of both the 50/50- and 10/90-ratio samples are estimated correctly within the margin of error for both the 100- and 200-mJ laser pulse energy. These results show that the estimated D/H ratios do not depend on laser pulse energy. This means that thermodynamic conditions of plasma do not influence the D/H ratio measurement. Thus, the strict control of laser irradiation condition that is needed in quantitative LIBS measurement is not required in this D/H ratio measurement.  Since the expected D/H ratios of planetary materials are quite small (e.g. 1.56×10-4 for standard mean ocean water), improvements in spectral measurement precision might be needed to determine the D/H ratios  of such low D/H-ratio materials with high accuracy. Nevertheless, this study shows that in principle the D/H ratio can be determined with LIBS from the intensity of Dα and Hα emission lines.  References: [1] Wiens, R. et al.
