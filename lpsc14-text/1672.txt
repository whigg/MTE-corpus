The Workman-Reynolds Effect: An Investigation of the Ice-Water Interface of Dilute Salt Solutions   T. A. Johnson1, A. Park2, and K. P. Hand 3 1University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder (Travis.A.Johnson@colorado.edu), 2Brown University, Providence (Andrew.Park@jpl.nasa.gov), 3Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena (Kevin.P.Hand@jpl.nasa.gov)    Introduction As a dilute aqueous solution of salt rapidly freezes, ions in solution become preferentially differentiated at the ice-water interface. The Workman-Reynolds Effect (WRE) is the resulting potential that forms between the ice and its constituent dilute salt solution. This potential can range from a few to ~230 volts with the magnitude and sign of the potential being primarily dependent on the type of salt, concentration of ions, and freezing rate. As a result, the electrolysis of water could lead to significant H2 and O2 gas production that has the potential to drive the production of life on Snowball Earth and icy satellites such as Europa and Enceladus. Limmited work has been done on the WRE, primarily focusing on dilute solutions of 10-6 to 10-4 molar NaCl, and results are largely inconsistent, ranging from ~20 to 43 volts for NaCl [1-6]. Our experiments with 10-4 molar solutions of NaCl, KCl, and NH4Cl validate the WRE, though our observations conflict with those previously published. We find a WRE of only ~6-10 volts for NaCl. Differences in pH between the resulting ice and water have also been observed [1,2]. Early results demonstrate the factors that affect the outcome of the WRE and gives direction for controlled experiments for further exploration in this topic.  Approach Two 60 W, 40 x 40 x 3.75 mm square thermoelectric cooling units (Peltiers) are stacked on top of each other with a 4 mm thick aluminum plate in-between to prevent overheating the top Peltier. Cooling fluid at ~15 ºC  is circulated through copper and DOW Corning 340 silicone heat sink compound to maximize heat transfer and achieve cryogenic temperatures as low as 18 ºC. A platinum plate and wire are used for electrodes to maximize current flow. Two springs hold down the test tube with an inner diameter of 14 mm to prevent leakage of the salt solution. Polyethylene rubber foam insulation is put around the tube to help achieve higher freeze rates. Figure 1  displays the apparatus used. Potentials are taken using the NI cDAQ-9174 and a +/- 10 V voltmeter module NI 9205 with an internal impedance of 10 GΩ both of which are grounded. Data is logged into the computer using NIMax software. We supply 8.000 V with ~6.700 Amps to the Peltiers using an Aligent 3634A DC power supply.  Freeze rates are measured using a ProScopeHR camera to record videos at 15 frames per second against a ruler that is divided into 1/64th inches. Water used to create the dilute salt solutions is deionized, filtered through MilliQ, and has a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ·cm. Salts are reagent grade and anhydrous. All solutions made are 1.0x10-4 M. pH is measured with Fisher Scientific Accumet AP85.    Figure 1. Current apparatus being used for freeze-up experiments.  Results Initial experiments focused primarily on NaCl with a few tests of KCl, NH4Cl, MgSO4, and Na2SO4. Figure 2 shows typical Results for NaCl. Results for KCl and NH4Cl show similar curves, using the same controls as NaCl tests, with the WRE of KCl peaking above +10 V and NH4Cl peaking beyond -10 V. Tests with both MgSO4 and Na2SO4 display no WRE, staying at approximately 0 V for the duration of the run. Figure 3 compares our results for NaCl polycrystalline ice growth with those published by Wilson and Haymet [4]. The addition of the copper heat sink produced freezing rates past the target freeze rate of ~25µm/s - this is the freeze rate where Wilson and Haymet reported WRE having max voltage [4]. All pH tests averaged in Table 1 were taken at ~19.0ºC. The pH of the MilliQ water used for making the solution tested to be 5.44. Ions incorporated in the ice versus the water are determined by the resulting pH for each. 1672.pdf

Discussion and Conclusion Initial results for tests with solutions containing the Cl- anion validate the Workman-Reynolds Effect as well as show its variability with ionic composition and freeze rate. For both NaCl and KCl, Cl- anions are preferentially incorporated into the ice lattice over its constituent cations. In the case of NH4Cl, the ammonium ion is preferentially incorporated into the ice. Unfortunately, results were limited to a +/- 10 V cap with the NI 9205 module so no limiting WRE values for KCl and NH4Cl were acquired. Experiments were also done for these salts using a NI 9229 +/- 60 V module (1 MΩ internal impedance) and an Agilent 34405A digital multimeter (10 MΩ internal impedance) but the low impedance of these devices was a limiting factor for reliably measureing the WRE.  For both MgSO4 and Na2SO4, no WRE was observed. This could be due to the size of the sulfate ion and/or a greater dependence on freeze rate; however more research into this unexpected result is required. Although pH tests with our 10-4 M solutions were lower than expected, results indicate that the pH between the ice and resulting water do differ significantly. For NaCl the pH of the solution after the freeze-up was higher than the resulting ice. This suggests that Cl- anions are being incorporated into the ice lattice (followed with H3O+) and Na+ cations are being excluded (followed with OH-), therefore giving the ice a slightly lower pH. As examined in Table 1, this ion separation appears throughout all of our tested solutions, even the sulfates, where no WRE was unobserved.  Early results confirm legitimacy of the WRE. However, reproduction of results reported by previous researchers still proves to be difficult - mainly due to the variability of the WRE. Continuous investigation into the numerous variables of the WRE will result in a better understanding of the chemistry occurring at the ice-water interface and it's role in planetary processes and cryosphere, for both a Snowball Earth and icy worlds of our solar system.
