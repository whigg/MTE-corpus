Introduction: Chlorine has unusual geochemical properties: it is highly soluble in water, it is not incorporated in most silicates, it is generally a trace incompatible element, and it is extremely depleted on Earth relative to carbonaceous chondrites [1]. We have measured the Cl isotope ratio of different classes of martian meteorites in order to evaluate the degree of differentiation and the overall bulk martian value in comparison to Earth and chondrites. We find that the primitive martian material is unique and that there are large differences between mantle and crustal materials. Methods: There are two stable isotopes of Cl: 37Cl and 35Cl. Data are reported relative to Standard Mean Ocean Chloride (SMOC) in standard delta notation. We measured bulk 37Cl values of both the watersoluble fraction and the structurally-bound Cl as well as in situ analyses of apatite grains using SIMS. Our bulk analyses follow the procedure of [2]. Samples are powdered and leached in distilled water to extract the water-soluble fraction. The leached silicate is melted in a H2O stream to extract the structurally-bound Cl. Dissolved Cl- is converted to AgCl and finally CH3Cl for analysis in continuous flow gas source mass spectrometry. Precision is approx. ± 0.2‰. In situ ion microprobe analyses were made on the large radius UCLA Cameca 1270 ion microprobe using a Cs+ primary beam. Ion beams for mass 35 and 37 are measured simultaneously on Faraday cups with count rates of 2 to 5×107cps for 35Cl-. A synthetic Cl-apatite from the University of Heidelberg, with a concentration of 5.5 wt.% was used as a standard and had a reproducibility of 0.1‰ (n=38). Precision is lower for low Cl concentration apatites. Results: The 37Cl values of martian meteorites measured in this work range from -3.8 to +1.4‰ (Fig.1) (with one anomalous grain from NWA 7034 at 9‰). All samples that have evidence for crustal contamination (nahklites, chassignites, orthopyroxenites, and regolith breccias) [3-5] have positive 37Cl values. This is consistent with abundant independent evidence for light isotope loss by degassing [6-8]. The samples with the lowest 37Cl values are also generally those thought to be most primitive [9, 10] and likely represent the initial bulk 37Cl value of Mars. Samples with intermediate 37Cl values can be explained by partial assimilation of crustal material [11]. Assuming that the Cl content is high in crustal materials and correspondingly low in the mantle [12-17], less than 1% assimilation is sufficient to raise the 37Cl values by several per mil (Fig. 2). The amount of assimilation could be far lower if brines have infiltrated the rocks [14, 18]. This 2-compenent mixing model easily explains all the data but is remarkable when compared with other inner  Fig. 1 Cl isotope values of martian meteorites.

Mixing relations for crust and mantle assuming X[Cl]mantle = 50 ppm, 37Clmantle= -3‰ and X[Cl]crust = 5,000 ppm, 37Clcrust = +2‰. Under such conditions, even a 1% contribution of crustal material will significantly raise the 37Cl of contaminated mantle-derived materials, explaining the intermediate 37Cl values of the basaltic shergottites. Cl isotope geochemistry is potentially one of the most sensitive indicators of crustal contamination.  solar system materials. Discussion: The Earth and the least processed chondrites both have 37Cl value close to 0‰ [2, 19]. While there is a large range of 37Cl values observed in lunar apatites, the lowest values are thought to represent samples that have undergone the least amount of Cl isotope fractionation during evaporation and are also close to 0 ‰ [20]. If our two-component model is correct, it suggests that Mars has a lower 37Cl value than Earth, Moon and primitive chondrites (Fig. 3). While preferential enrichment of 37Cl is easily explained by volatilization, known mechanisms for lowering the 37Cl values are limited. The low 37Cl values of Mars may be analogous to Parnallee, the only type 3 chondrite with anomalously low 37Cl values, reaching -4.25‰ [19]. A proposed explanation for Parnallee's low value is removal of solid HCl.3H2O from HCl (g) in the cool solar nebula (140-160 K). The fractionation between HCl.3H2O (s) and HCl (g) is calculated to be 3-6 ‰ [21]. Partial crystallization of HCl.3H2O would leave the remaining HCl (g) with low 37Cl values. In order for this process to impart a low 37Cl value on the parent body, however, the solid hydrate must be removed prior to incorporation of light HCl (g). This could be accomplished by removal of the solid or transfer of the HCl to a different region of the nebula, but details of how such a mechanism would work are unclear. Furthermore, it is not clear why Mars would have evidence of this process, whereas Earth, Moon and chondrites would not be affected. One possibility is that Mars is uniquely situated in the solar system so that it was in the twophase HCl.3H2O - HCl (g) region whereas only HCl (g) would exist closer to the Sun and only HCl.3H2O (s) would be found farther away. This proposed mechanism to explain the low 37Cl value of Mars may seem improbable, but other explanations are no more satisfactory. It is possible that the low 37Cl values of some martian materials are the result of low-temperature parent-body processes, but why this would be manifest in the most primitive, least processed materials from Mars is unclear. Degassing would tend to leave the residual Cl with higher 37Cl values, not lower, so thiscan be ruled out. We know of no other mechanisms to impart low 37Cl values to the primitive olivine shergottites other than the one outlined above.   Mars is an old body that has not suffered the repeated large impacts experienced during Earth formation [22, 23]. Preferential loss of Cl by impact erosion has been proposed for Earth [1]. Such a process could raise the 37Cl of Earth if 35Cl were preferentially incorporated in the regolith between episodes of large bombardments. If correct, Mars, rather than Earth, would represent the more pristine inner solar system 37Cl value and the near-zero 37Cl value of Earth is caused by impact erosion. If this is indeed the case, it is required that the asteroid belt would have higher 37Cl values than bodies closer to the Sun, although we do not have an adequate explanation for such a process other than fractionation associated with HCl.3H2O formation.
