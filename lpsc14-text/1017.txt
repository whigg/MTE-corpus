Introduction: The biological mass extinction at the K-T boundary at ~ 65.5 Ma has been attributed to two main geological events, e.g. a large meteorite impact [1, 2] and/or eruption of the Deccan Flood basalt, India [3, 4]. Close to this stratigraphic boundary there are two major impact events,  in Mexico (Chicxulub crater, ~150 km diameter) [5] and in Ukraine (Boltysh crater, ~24 km) [6]. An important school of thought holds that the Chicxulub impact was the major factor for the biological mass extinction at the K-T boundary [7], although controversies exist. In the present review, we therefore re-examine the hypothesis of large meteorite impact and mass extinction with reference to the Jurassic-Cretaceous (J-K) boundary.  Geological events at J-K boundary: The Morokweng impact crater (centered at 26o20/S, 23o32/E), South Africa, was formed at 145±0.08 Ma close to the J-K boundary on the Kaapvaal craton by an impact of LL-6 chondrite [8]. Earlier studies on regional gravity, aeromagnetic and incomplete borehole data suggested the diameter of this structure could be as large as ~340 km [9], or as small as 75 ± 5 km [10, 11].  More recent observations from more complete diamond drilling, new geophysical data and Landsat 7 imagery, however, suggest that the original diameter of the Morokweng crater was probably between ~160 and 240 km [12, 13]. These data also suggest that the buried morphology of the Morokweng crater resembles that of the multiring impact craters on inner Solar System planets [14]. The other impact events close to the J-K boundary impact were the Mjølnir crater, Norway (~40 km, 142±2.6 Ma) and Glosses Bluff crater, Australia (~22 km, 142.5±0.8 Ma) [15]. There is also a  possible impacto-clastic layer at the Bosso River Gorge, Italy [16] and a report of high Ir within a phosphatic limestone from a J-K boundary site in northern Siberia [17].  However, no such anomaly is present at sites  in Western Europe [18]. During the late Jurassic- early Cretaceous, biocalcification in neritic and pelagic setting was suggested to be related to volcanism, and extremely low Mg/Ca ratios during mid-Cretaceous was perhaps related to high production rate of oceanic basalt [19]. For examples, there are reports of rift-related extensive basalticrhyodacitic volcanism from the Tugnui-Khilok Sector, Central Asia, across the J-K boundary [20]. Also, bimodal basalt-rhyolite volcanism has been reported from the northern Benue Trough, and the Liberian margin of the Jurassic Central Atlantic province [21].  The last magmatic events of the Karoo igneous province in Patagonia, Antarctic Peninsula, northern South Africa (Bumbeni, Kuleni complexes), Southern India and southeast Australia  also straddle the J-K boundary at  ~ca. 145 Ma [21].  Around 740 km3 volcanic rocks including acidic, intermediate and basaltic igneous rocks have been reported at the J-K boundary from the coastal range of central Chile [22]. The known candidate of marine volcanism at the J-K boundary is the Shatsky Rise in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, which has an aerial extent of ~480,000 km2 [23, 24]. The available evidence suggests that these lavas were extruded at rates similar to those of many continental flood basalts.  If this view is confirmed then the Shatsky Rise might possibly represent the largest single volcano in the Solar System. Studies on sedimentary rocks (and pollens)  from sites in western Europe and Sweden show that there was a climatic change from arid (or semi-arid) in the late Jurassic to humid at the J-K boundary [25, 26], There is also a report of tsunami deposits at this stratigraphic boundary from Boulonnais, France [27]. Biological extinctions at J-K boundary: Several researches showed that there were no major faunal changes across the J-K boundary, and the  biological turnover across this stratigraphic boundary was restricted to species level [28, 29]. At the J-K boundary, there was only a ~ 6.5 to 5% fall in marine family diversity [30, 31], and a total of 19 families of Mollusca and 7 out of a total of 11 families of ammonites became extinct at the end of Tithonian [32]. However, the extinction of ammonites was not significant at the J-K boundary compared to other ammonitic extinction events. In case of European bivalves, 22% genera became extinct in the passage of Tithonian-Cretaceous pathway [33]. In the Andes of central Chile and Argentina, sedimentological succession shows Tithonian transgression followed by Barremian-Aptian regression with no notable facies change or hiatus across the J-K boundary [34]. In Japan, also there is no such biologic turnover recorded in case of bivalve species [35]. However, a significant Tithonian extinction event among brachiopod species is noticed in Europe [36].  1017.pdf

In the case of marine micro-organisms, 30-35% of the  ostracod species became extinct at the J-K boundary,  as reported from the Scotia Shelf of North America and Europe [37].  The foraminifera and coccolithophores, however, show no such significant turnover across this boundary in Europe [38], although benthic foraminifera have essentially changed in systematic composition at the J-K boundary in the western Siberia [39]. In the  case of marine vertebrate extinction, longnecked plesiosaurs were  claimed to become extinct at the J-K boundary [40]. However, presence of plesiosaurs in reported in Cretaceous, most notably in England where they persisted throughout the J-K boundary [41]. In the case of the terrestrial faunal extinctions, the fall of diversity of family is higher (~6 to 18%) compared to those for marine counterpart (~6%) [42].  This observation, however, may be an artefact effect on fossil record as there is no record of extinction event for either dinosaur [38]  or non-marine megafloras  [43].  Discussion: On the basis of the present review, it can definitely be suggested that the J-K boundary represents a period of geological upheavals and environmental disruption, which include large meteorite impacts, important sub-marine volcanism and climatic changes. The failure of getting any global dispersion of platinum group of elements comparable to the  Ir-rich K-T boundary layer remains largely unexplained.  It appears quite certain that the J-K transition was by far less cataclysmic than the K-T boundary [44], despite three large impact events  having occurred between ~145 and ~142 Ma. Absence of important terrestrial mass extinction along the J-K boundary also supports the idea that large meteorite impacts and mass extinctions are not perhaps in a strict "cause and effect" relationship [45]. On the other hand, extinction of some marine organisms (excluding foraminifers and coccolithophores) is more important across this boundary, and it suggests perhaps a greater influence of submarine volcanism on mass extinction [19, 46]. As a Deccan size volcanism (~1.5 million km2) is thought to cause mass extinction at the K-T boundary, it appears that there could be few more important marine volcanic events at the J-K boundary, which would have enhanced CO2 (along with some toxic elements) of the ocean water above the endurance of the living organisms at that time, especially if combined to the effects of the  Milankovich climatic cycles.  In conclusion, we still cannot quantify the relative influence exerted by impacts versus volcanic (marine/subaerial) events at the J-K boundary on the marine extinction episode identified for the same period [47].
