Thesurface of Venus has signs of geologically recent volcanism [1-3], the atmosphere evolution models include volcanic activity as a source of various gases [4], but no ongoing volcanism has been reliably registered so far. Recentlythere were published works on potential recent volcanismon Venus [5,6]. These, however, did not give any directand unambiguous evidence for the ongoing or very recentvolcanic activity but only offered rather suggestions or indications. In data obtained by Venus Monitoring Camera(VMC) onboard the ESA Venus Express (VEx) we found afew transient phenomena in Ganiki Chasma that we interpreted as evidence of present volcanic activity.Ganiki Chasma is a NW branch of a cluster of youngrift zones with associated volcanism in Atla Regio [7]. Thecharacteristics of one of the volcanoes of this region, MaatMons, suggest that its activity occurred within the last tensof millions of years [1-3]. Its youth increases the chancesfor present day volcanic activity in this region and on theplanet in general, but does not prove it.VMC observations: VMC takes images in four spectral channels; one of which, centered at 1.01µm, registersthe night-side thermal emission from the planetary surface[8]. At this wavelength and mean temperature of the surface of ∼ 740K the radiation flux from the surface stronglydepends on the surface temperature. This, in principle, provides the possibility to detect higher surface temperature associated with volcanic eruption or another similar activity.VMC is able to image the surface only on the night sidewhen VEx is in the planet’s shadow. Observations are performed in nadir geometry or very close to it at latitudes from∼ 30°N to∼ 20°S. Therefore every particular surface pointmight be observed from at least 3 consequent VEx orbitsduring a given eclipse season. But VMC has only one spectral channel for the surface observations, that makes impossible to deduce optical thickness of the Venus atmosphere atthe same time as the surface properties. Therefore only certain orbits, where cloud opacity variations are rather small,can be used [9]. These factors limit the feasibility to detect and/or to determine the properties of a transient phenomenon.Here we discuss VMC observations of an area5°N – 25°N, 180°E – 200°E (fig. 1). VMC has performed36 observational sessions in this area. From these data weconstructed orbit-wise mosaics and from them computedthe maps of relative surface brightness. Analyzing thesemaps one can see several bright features that are present atthe same locations in several consequent orbits and disappear afterwards. These bright spots are seen in the originalVMC images andmosaics, but the contrast in the emissivitymaps is higher making them more visible.The bright spots are located at the edges of the rift zone.The most prominent feature (marked by “A” and shown infig. 2) is seen in mosaics from VEx orbits 793 and 795. Unfortunately the next observation here was done only fromorbit 903, that is, 108 days afterward, and we do not knowwhat happened with this feature in between. There are twomore bright spots (“B” and “C”) that behave in a similarway: they are bright in images obtained from two or threeconsequent orbits and are not visible in orbits long beforeor after.Possible explanations: The bright spots in VMC images and mosaics can be explained by presence of hot matter at or just above the surface. We considered possible observational or data processing artifacts but eventually rejected them.- Bright spots caused by the camera. The spots arepresent in several VMC images in each affected orbit. Thespacecraft rotates/moves during the imaging, thus in everyother image the given point at the surface is pictured at different pixels. It is unlikely that the brightening in the camera will follow this scheme.- Incorrect pointing information in the region with largealtitude gradients. In this case, every artificially bright spotshould be coupled with an artificial dark “ghost”, that is notobserved. Also, there are other places along the rift withsimilar altitude gradients where no bright spots were seen.- “Holes” in the clouds. In super-rotating atmosphereof Venus it is unlikely that a hole does not move for severaltens of hours, but just changes shape and transparency. Itmay be true, however, if the cause of the “hole” is someactive process at the surface.Conclusions: In several observational sessions VMCdetected transient bright spots at the edges of GanikiChasma that appeared and disappeared at the time scale offew days. These phenomena can be interpreted as indication of some localized process that releases hot matter. Thiscould be either lava, gas, or a combination of both. We ruleout instrumental effects or cloud inhomogeneity as possible causes of the transient bright spots. We are searchingfor similar events in other rift zones.References: [1] K. B. Klose et al.
