Introduction: One of the most significant concepts to have emerged from Apollo-era lunar exploration is the hypothesis than an intense, discrete bombardment occurred in the inner solar system at ~3.9 Ga, possibly triggered by a sudden massive delivery of planetesimals from the outer solar system. The nature of this late heavy bombardment (LHB) has profound implications for the emergence of life on Earth ('impact frustration') [1], the role of giant planet migration in contributing to this inhospitable environment [2], and the calibration of 'crater counting' chronologies [3]. The majority of highlands samples are complex breccias, often containing evidence of impact-induced melting and multiple impact events, although 'pristine' rock fragments have been recognized [4]. Indeed, although some 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages [see 5] indicate that portions of the lunar surface have not been thermally disturbed since 4.35±0.05 Ga, Tera et al. [6] interpreted isotopic resetting in lunar highlands samples as due to a terminal cataclysm at ~3.9 Ga. Subsequently, it became widely accepted that an apparent sharp cut-off of lunar 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages at 3.9 Ga was supporting evidence of this short period of enhanced bombardment. This interpretation is problematic for at least two reasons. The first is that lunar meteorites show a broad distribution of ages ranging from 2.5 to 4.2 Ga [7]. These results, which represent a global derivation relative to the restricted provenance of Apollo/Luna samples, suggest that the LHB hypothesis may be biased by both sampling restrictions and analysis artifacts. A second concern is that 40 Ar/ 39 Ar data from these complex lunar materials have for the most part not been rigorously interpreted in terms of diffusion and/or recoil effects. Indeed, arbitrarily assigned 'plateau ages' ca. 3.9 Ga [8] belie the fact that the vast majority of samples have bulk ages much younger or older than the assigned 'plateau age'. Unfortunately, this limitation is not simply ameliorated by using a more refined interpretive model; virtually all the analytical data to date [cf. 9] were obtained under conditions that effectively precludes recovery of sample-specific Arrhenius parameters from which thermal history information can be reliably determined.  Case history: We illustrate the potential for erroneous conclusions to be drawn from 40 Ar/ 39 Ar stepheating data by showing the difference in thermal history obtained using a rigorous, diffusion-based model as opposed to the approach conventionally used in the cosmochemical community. A high resolution age spectrum of the Jilin chondrite (sample K-1), whose parent body has been shown to have experienced thermal events at ~2.2 and ~0.5 Ga [10, 11], is shown in Fig. 1. This age spectrum was generated using isothermal duplicate vacuum heating steps, which optimizes the extraction of both the kinetic parameters, activation energy (E) and frequency factor (Do/ro 2), and the domain distribution parameters, relative size () and volume fraction ().   Fig. 1.  K/Ca and 40Ar/39Ar age spectra of Jilin H5 chondrite sample K-1. This release pattern (Fig. 1) is characterized by smoothly increasing ages that rise to a peak at 4.39 Ga, followed by a drop and then subsequent rise in age. That the drop in age is clearly correlated with decreasing K/Ca is interpreted to be due to the cessation of plagioclase degassing and the onset of pyroxene gas release. Because the degassing of these two phases is almost entirely separated in temperature, we renormalized the first 85% of the 39 Ar release (i.e., plagioclase) to 100% and calculated 39 Ar diffusion coefficients using the multi-diffusion domain (MDD) model [12]. Although the Arrhenius plot without isothermal duplicates [10] yields an apparently well-correlated array indicating E45 kcal/mol, the associated log(r/ro) plot shows extreme non-monotonic behavior demonstrating that this value is an artifact of the laboratory heating schedule. Instead, an E=67 kcal/mol, appropriate to Ar diffusion in plagioclase [13], is needed in order to reconcile the isothermal duplicate steps to yield a monotonically increasing log(r/ro) over the first portion of gas release.    Having extracted appropriate values of E, (Do/ro 2),  and , we can then compare the predicted episodic heating event for this sample relative to that obtained in the fashion advocated by Bogard [14] for calculating closure temperatures in which apparent linear arrays on Arrhenius plots are assumed to indicate E (i.e., a single diffusion length scale). While the timing of the episodic loss is indicated by the initial degassing steps, the traditional approach fails to describe both the age spectra and Arrhenius plot due to the complex multidomain behavior exhibited by the sample. Utilizing the apparent E45 kcal/mol [10] with a multi-domain model does allow an approximate fit to the Arrhenius data, but an E=67 kcal/mol yields a substantially improved fit. This ca. 20 kcal/mol difference in activation energy changes the temperature of the transient heating event (or apparent closure temperature) by ~100°C demonstrating the importance of properly modeling step-heated 40 Ar/ 39 Ar data.  Fig. 2.  K/Ca and 40Ar/39Ar age spectra of lunar sample 63504.18 Implication for lunar samples: We irradiated 27 Apollo 16 samples of various highland components from North Ray Crater and are using cycled stepheating to optimize data processing using the MDD model. For example, results for sample 63504.18 (Fig. 2) reveal all the characteristic described above of a complex, multi-domain sample and demonstrate the feasibility of using the MDD approach to reconstruct high resolution lunar thermal histories. Interpretive missteps: The persistence of misconceptions in interpretation of 40 Ar/ 39 Ar step-heating results has led to numerous problematic notions including: 1) Apparent linear arrays on Arrhenius plots from samples containing strongly contrasting diffusion dimensions, as expected for most extraterrestrial samples, cannot be directly interpreted in terms of E. 2) Because simple diffusion theory rules out the expectation that a sample that has experienced diffusive loss of 40 Ar* can preserve a 'plateau age' [see pg. 112 in 5], use of this obsolete concept to 'cherry pick' ages corresponding to the LHB [15,16] can lead to specious conclusions.
