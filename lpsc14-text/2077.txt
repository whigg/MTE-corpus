Introduction: Interplanetary Field Enhancements (IFEs) are a unique class of interplanetary field structures that feature cusp-shaped increases and decreases in the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and a thin current sheet [1, 2]. The occurrence of IFEs is attributed to the interaction between the solar wind and dust particles produced in collisions. Each IFE represents a collision between two meteoroids or a meteoroid and an asteroid upstream of the observing spacecraft. Based on the observations of IFEs over a solar cycle, Lai et al. [3] estimate that the IFE masses range from 106 to 1012 kg, and based on multi-spacecraft observations that the radial scales of IFEs are on average about six times the cross-flow scales. The duration of IFEs ranges from our detectability limit of several minutes to more than 12 hours corresponding to large but extremely rare collisions. Using the scaling obtained from measurements with multiple spacecraft encounters, the width of IFEs that we detect ranges from about 3 to 500 Earth radii across or from a small fraction of the width of the magnetosphere to much wider than the magnetosphere. When IFEs strike the magnetosphere, they should distort the magnetosphere. This could range from a small indentation to a large scale compression. They also may just give the magnetosphere a glancing blow. We also should note that we do not know the distribution of the dust in an IFE. In any event if the IFE is slowed by the magnetosphere, the compression of the Earth’s field should be seen in the ground based magnetic records that are continuously recorded. Thus it is important to calibrate the magnetospheric response to IFE arrival. If this represents a way to reliably detect IFEs then this technique gives us a new way to measure the rates of collisions of small bodies in near Earth space. In this study we examine the ground-based magnetic field perturbations associated with a well-observed IFE event on December 24, 2006 [4]. This IFE was simultaneously detected by STEREO A and B, ACE, and Wind spacecraft that were well separated in the solar wind. The STEREO B spacecraft was closest to the Earth, and it observed a sharp transition in By at 1150 UT and a peak in Bt at 1205 UT. Spacecraft observations of the magnetic field and plasma confirm that this IFE structure moves with the solar wind. Ground-based Magnetometer Observations of IFE: The ground-based observations included in this study were made by 67 stations associated with the THEMIS, CARISMA, McMAC in North America and the IMAGE array in Europe. All these magnetometer stations observed an impulse at approximately 1217 UT when the IFE was expected to arrive at the Earth’s magnetopause. Figure 1 shows representative observations in different regions of the Earth. The magnetic perturbations on the ground indicate the disturbances in the magnetosphere that propagate along magnetic field lines to the Earth. While perturbations unrelated to the IFE were present at high and middle latitudes, the IFE signature stood out in the observations at low latitudes. Figure 2 shows the equivalent currents in the ionosphere inferred from the measurements by 67 ground magnetometers at the peak of the IFE-induced impulse at 1217 UT. The available observations indicate a single vortex in the equivalent currents with a center located in the morning sector.  -20-1001020  H northward (nT)D eastward (nT)-20-1001012:10 12:15 12:20 12:25-1001020-20-1001020-20-100102012:10 12:15 12:20 12:25-1001020Universal Time (hh:mm)NorthAmericaEuropeINUV (geo lat = 68.3 L = 9.8)GILL (geo lat=56.4, L=6.2)WRTH (geo lat=43.6, L=3.4)BJN (geo lat=74.5, L=10.2)KIL (geo lat=69.0, L=6.1)TAR (geo lat=58.3, L=3.0) Figure 1: Magnetic perturbations in the H (northward) and D (eastward) components at selected ground stations during the IFE event on December 24, 2006. The impulse at approximately 1217 UT was observed by these and other ground stations.  Like the preliminary impulse induced by a sudden enhancement in solar wind pressure, the IFE-induced impulse can be seen on the ground on a global scale. The impulse can penetrate magnetic shells as well as propagate along field lines. Different from the preliminary impulse, this IFE event generated only a single vortex in the equivalent current, and the polarity in the morning sector was opposite to that expected for a pre2077.pdf

liminary impulse. The observations suggest a magnetospheric current system with a field-aligned current going into the ionosphere in the morning sector. At this time the detecting spacecraft were on the dawn side of the Earth-Sun line and the center of the disturbance is estimated to be on the dqwn side of the magnetosphere. Our estimated radius of the IFE perpendicular to the solar wind flow is 37.5 Earth radii ensuring the dqwn flank was indeed hit by the IFE.   Figure 2.

The vector length is proportional to the strength of the equivalent current. The dashed line indicates the longitude for local noon, and the gray area shows nighttime longitudes.  This one event suggests that the magnetosphere can be used for IFE detection but this is just one example of a particular size hitting the magnetosphere in one particular place. Our next step is to examine more events to understand the pattern of IFE-induced signatures on the ground so that the vast number of groundbased magnetometers and long term records may be used for detecting historical IFEs.
