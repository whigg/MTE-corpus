Introduction: Miller Range (MIL) 090206, 090340, 090356, 090405, 090805 and 090963 are six small achondrites (masses between 2.5 and 58.9 g) among the more than 2000 meteorites that were recovered from the Miller Range icefields, Antarctica [1-4]. These six meteorites have similar textures and mineral compositions, dominated by olivine, and are thus presumed to be paired [4]. Four of these samples, MIL 090206, 090340, 090356 and 090805 were initially classified as ureilites [1,2]. However, additional studies [5,6] have shown that many of the mineralogical characteristics (such as olivine and chromite compositions, absence of carbon and presence of apatite) are not consistent with ureilites. It was therefore proposed that these meteorites should be classified as ungrouped achondrites, and are possibly related to the brachinites [3-6]. Subsequent oxygen isotope analyses of the olivines in MIL 090340 support the conclusion that this meteorite is related to brachinites and brachinite-like achondrites [6]. Since relatively little is known about the cosmic-ray exposure (CRE) history of brachinites [7], we selected three of the six MIL 09 ungrouped achondrites for cosmogenic radionuclide analysis. Stable and radioactive cosmogenic nuclides can be used to determine the exposure histories, terrestrial ages, and ejection conditions of meteorites from their parent body. From these parameters, we can often ascertain whether these meteorites are paired. We report here results of the cosmogenic radionuclides: 10Be (t1/2 = 1.36 Myr), 26Al (0.705 Myr), and 36Cl (0.30 Myr) in three of the achondrites, MIL 090206, 090340 and 090963.  Experimental: Bulk samples of 40-80 mg were dissolved in an HF/HNO3 mixture in the presence of Be and Cl carrier solutions. After taking aliquots for chemical analysis, we added ~5 mg of Al carrier to the remaining solution, and separated and purified Be, Al and Cl for accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) measurements.  The bulk composition of each sample was measured by ICP-OES. The AMS measurements of 10Be, 26Al, and 36Cl were performed at PRIME Lab, Purdue University and normalized to AMS standards [8-10]. The results of the cosmogenic radionuclides are shown in Table 1. Results and Discussion: The chemical compositions of the three samples are very similar, although MIL 090206 is slightly higher in Al, Ca, Ti and slightly lower in Mg and Fe than the other two samples. The 10Be concentrations are relatively constant at 12.3-13.9 dpm/kg, relative to expected saturation levels of 18-24 dpm/kg for small to medium sized objects with the composition of MIL 090340 [11]. The 26Al concentrations in the three MIL achondrites range from 34 to 38 dpm/kg, relative to expected saturation levels of 40-70 dpm/kg for small to medium sized objects [11]. The 5-10% higher 26Al concentration in MIL 090206 is probably due to higher concentrations of the major target elements, Si and Al. Although we did not measure Si in the samples, we can estimate SiO2 from other elements; this yields a ~10% higher SiO2 content in MIL 090206. The similar 10Be and 26Al concentrations as well as similar chemical compositions in the three achondrites confirm that the meteorites are paired. Without further measurements we cannot uniquely determine the exposure history but we can limit it to two possible scenarios. The first scenario involves a CRE age of ~2 Myr in a small object (radius, R=5-10 cm), while the second scenario includes a longer CRE age in a much larger object (R>150 cm). Model calculations [11] indicate that 10Be and 26Al production rates of ~13 dpm/kg and ~35 dpm/kg, respectively, are found at <20 cm depth in objects with R >5 m or at greater depth (up to ~70 cm) in objects with R=150-300 cm (Figure 1). Although the total recovered mass of <100 g for all six MIL 09 ungrouped achondrites favors a small pre-atmospheric size, we cannot distinghuish between these two scenarios based on 10Be and 26Al data alone.  The 36Cl concentrations of ~7.0 dpm/kg in MIL 090340/090963 are - within 5% - consistent with a radius <10 cm, but the 36Cl value of 9.4 dpm/kg in MIL 090206 is higher than expected for any size if we only consider spallation reactions. However, higher 36Cl concentrations in meteorites are often due to contributions of 36Cl from neutron-capture reactions on 35Cl. Now, this requires irradiation in a large object (as suggested in scenario 2) with Cl concentrations >>10 ppm. Although Cl concentrations in achondrites are generally ~10 ppm, the Cl concentrations in the MIL achondrites are probably significantly higher, since traces of chlorapatite (with 5% Cl) were reported [5].  Model calculations show that Cl concentrations of 50100 ppm would produce 3-6 dpm/kg of neutroncapture 36Cl at a depth of 15-20 cm in an object with R>5 m [12], consistent with 10Be and 26Al concentrations. We favor a two-stage irradiation with a long first 2450.pdf

stage (>5 Myr) in a large object, followed by a short second stage (<<0.3 Myr) in a much smaller object. Other cosmogenic radionuclides, such as 14C, 41Ca, and 53Mn, as well as noble gas measurements in the MIL 09 ungrouped achondrites should further constrain the exposure history of these meteorites.   Figure 1. Comparison of measured 10Be, 26Al and 36Cl concentrations in MIL 090206, 090340 and 090963 with calculated production rates for objects with R = 10-500 cm, based on chemical composition in Table 1 and model of [11].  Conclusions: Our radionuclide measurements confirm that the three ungrouped achondrites, MIL 090206, 090340 and 090963 are paired fragments of the same meteorite fall. Based on the very similar and unique mineralogical compositions it is highly likely that all six ungrouped achondrites from Miller Range are pieces of a single meteorite fall. Although we cannot exactly constrain the exposure history of the MIL achondrites, the cosmogenic radionuclides reveal two possible exposure scenarios. In the first scenario, the meteorites were exposed for ~2 Myr in a very small object (R<10 cm), while in the second scenario the meteorites were exposed >5 Myr in an object with a diameter >3 m (and possibly >>10 m). In the second scenario, which better explains the 36Cl concentrations, a small piece was ejected from this large object in the last 104-105 year, and then quickly delivered to Earth. This two-stage scenario would suggest that the parent object of the MIL achondrites is either very close to a chaotic resonance zone, or is already in a near Earth orbit. The brachinites and other olivine-rich meteorites (pallasites and R-chondrites) are generally associated with A-type asteroids [13-14]. Although no brachinitelike asteroids have been found among the NEA population [13], several A-type asteroids are located near the 5:2 resonance zone at ~2.82 AU [14]. Since this resonance is able to deliver meteorites to Earth in 0.1-1 Myr [15-16], this region may be the most likely source for the MIL 09 ungrouped achondrites.
