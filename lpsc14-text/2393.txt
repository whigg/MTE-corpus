THE EVOLUTION OF ORGANIC MATERIAL IN THE MATRICES OF THE CR CHONDRITES.   H. G. Changela1, C. Le Guillou2 and A. J. Brearley1 1Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, MSC03-2040, 1University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM87131, USA. 2Ruhr-Universität Bochum, Inst. für Geologie, Mineralogie and Geophysik, 44780, Bochum, Germany. (Email:changela@unm.edu).  Introduction: The major form of organic matter (OM) in carbonaceous chondrites (CCs) is submicron, macromolecular material that is mostly insoluble [1]. The nature of the precursor OM that accreted into the CC parent bodies and formed these inclusions is still not understood. Contributions from a variety of sources including OM formed in interstellar [2], nebular [3] and parent body [4] enviroments have all been envisioned. The CR chondrites exhibit a wide range of aqueous alteration [5,6]. We have investigated the variation in the morphology, molecular chemistry and mineral-organic associations of OM across a range of CR petrologic types in an attempt to constrain its origins and understand its evolutionary history on the parent body. We aim to answer the following questions: A. How are different types of OM distributed in the CR chondrite matrices? B. What are the functional chemistry, morphology and surrounding mineralogy of discrete organic particles and are they related? C. Does the chemistry/morphology of OM correlate with petrologic type?  Samples & Methods:  Fresh fragments of matrix from the CR chondrites QUE 99177 (CR3), EET 87770 (CR2), EET 92042 (CR2), GRA 95229 (CR2), Renazzo (CR2), and GRO 95577 (CR1) were pressed into indium foil. Focused ion beam (FIB) sections were extracted from regions of matrix in each meteorite. Scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) was performed at the Berkeley ALS Beamline 5.3.2 and the Canadian Light Source, Saskatoon Beamline 10 ID-1. The distribution of aromatic/olefinic C was initially obtained by substracting the optical density of each pixel at the energy of aromatic/olefinic C (285.6 eV) to that of the pre C-edge (280 eV). Multiple energy X-ray absorption images from ~270 – 340 eV were collected to form stacks, enabling XANES spectra to be extracted from any regions of the images. The distribution of distinctive spectra were then obtained from the stacks using a linear fit procedure with the STXM data reduction software AXIS-2000, which searches for initially defined spectra extracted from the stacks. The relative functional group abundances were obtained by fitting background subtracted and normalized spectra using Athena software. They were fitted to a fixed arc tan function added to 27 Gaussian functions which were optimised to fit the XANES spectra [7]. Aromatic (C=C), ketone (C=O), aliphatics (CHn), carboxylics (COOH) and carbonate peaks (CO3) were measured and compared. The morphologies of the OM particles and their relationship with surrounding matrix material were then characterized by Scanning/TEM at the University of New Mexico using a JEOL 2010 TEM and a JEOL 2010F FEGSTEM, operating at 200 kV.     Results:  OM Morphology – Discrete objects with the characteristics of nanoglobules [3] were found in CRs across the full range of alteration types. Other irregularly shaped OM inclusions have non-circular external boundaries and contain voids (e.g. Fig. 1). Vein-like features also exist that have filled around matrix amorphous silicates (e.g. Fig 2a,b).  285 290 295 30000.511.52Energy (eV)Normalised Absorbance  OM InclusionsDiffuseOM Inclusions1 µmC=O CO3C-HnCOOHa.1.2.1.2.1 µm0.1 µm0.1 µmAm.

OM Chemistry – The OM inclusions in the type 3 and 2 CRs display the (C=C)-(C=O)-COOH 3-peak characteristics of CC IOM [8]. Most FIB sections have a single population of the same spectra, but some contain more than 1 population, e.g. EET 87770 (Fig. 1) has an additional population lacking the ketone peak (green spectra). Every FIB section also contains a widely distributed OM component in the matrix. This diffuse OM [7] occurs within regions of amorphous silicates which dominate the type 3s and 2s (Fig 1a) and the phyllosilicates which pervade the CR1 GRO 95577 (Fig. 2c) matrices. The spectra of these regions are always aromatic poorer and carboxylic/aliphatic richer than the OM inclusions. The most altered CRs also have inclusions and diffuse OM that have higher aliphatic and carboxylic peaks (Figs. 3,4). Carbonate CO3 is enriched in the diffuse OM of type 3 and 2 CRs, but not in GRO 95577 (Fig 4).  2393.pdf

    Discussion:  The widespread, homogenous distribution of OM in the STXM maps (Fig. 1a) is unexpected considering the minor bulk concentration of carbon in the CR chondrites (0.8-2 wt. % [3]).  285 290 295 30000.511.52Energy (eV)Normalised Absorbance  OM InclusionDiffuse-likePhyllosilicate200 nmCOOHC-HnC=COM VeinSul.Sul.Am.

Rectangle shows higher aliphatic and carboxylic peaks in the most altered chondrites. The observation of the aromatic poor/carboxylic rich diffuse [7] OM ties in with observations of this feature in a recent study of Renazzo, Murchison and Orgueil [7], suggesting it is a widespread feature across the CCs and perhaps other chondrite groups. Its presence is also consistent with the large fraction of carboxylic acids in CCs [1]. The OM inclusions in CRs do not record any distinctive chemistry associated with a particular morphology. The vein-like OM textures are spectrally identical to discrete nanoglobules [3] suggesting that they formed under similar conditions. Figure 3 shows that there are no major molecular differences between OM inclusions in type CR2 and 3 chondrites. However, there are distinctive differences in the functional group chemistry of the inclusions in the CR1 (Figs. 1b & 2d). The inclusions in GRO 95577 are aliphatic/carboxylic richer (Fig. 3) and this carboxylic/aliphatic fraction varies locally. The carboxylic/aliphatic fraction in the OM inclusions is lower than in the surrounding diffuse OM which is less than the carboxylic/aliphatic fraction of OM detectable in the phyllosilicate regions (Fig. 2c,d). The formation of coarser patches of phyllosilicates in GRO 95577 which have lower OM concentrations (lower optical density) compared to the inclusions also shows evidence of the mobility of OM during aqueous alteration.        0.450.650.851.051.251.451.650 1 2 3 4 5 6GRO 95577 (CR1)GRO 95577 (CR1)Renazzo (CR2)GRA 95229 (CR2)GRA 95229 (CR2)EET 92042 (CR2)EET 87770 (CR2)QUE 99177 (CR3)QUE 99177 (CR3)C=C C=O CO3COOHPeak Fit Areas (arb.)CHnDiffuse OMOrganic Functional Group Figure 4.

Summary & Conclusions:  OM is distributed ubiquitously across the matrices of all of the CR chondrites. Two spectrally-distinct forms of OM exist. The first is the densest form of OM that is CC IOM-like (aromaticketone-carboxylic), well defined inclusions consisting of irregular shaped, vein-like and nanoglobular morphologies. There is no distinctive functional chemistry between these textures. The other is a aromatic poor and carboxylic/aliphatic rich diffuse OM [7] distributed within and around hydrated amorphous silicates which dominate the matrices of the type 3 and 2 chondrites. The regions of phyllosilicates in the CR1 GRO 95577 have an even higher carboxylic/aliphatic fraction. The OM inclusions in the most altered CRs, namely GRO 95577, are also enriched in aliphatic and carboxylic functional groups. These observations demonstrate that alteration in CR chondrite matrices has remobilized and formed OM enriched in a carboxylic and aliphatic fraction.  References: [1] Pizzarello S. et al.
