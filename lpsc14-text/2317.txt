OBSERVATIONS ABOUT BOULDERS ON THE SOUTH POLAR TERRAIN OF ENCELADUS.  Brent C. Landry1, Lily C. Munsill1, Geoffrey C. Collins1, and Karl L. Mitchell2, 1Wheaton College, 26 E. Main St., Norton, MA 02766, gcollins@wheatoncollege.edu, 2Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91109.  Introduction:  The first high resolution images returned from the south polar region of Enceladus showed icy blocks littering the surface [1], and subsequent high resolution imaging has found similar abundances of blocks ("boulders") within the south polar terrain, but much fewer outside it.  Here we examine the size and spatial distribution of distinct, isolated positive relief features that we interpret to be boulders in the south polar terrain.  The nature and distribution of boulders has implications for their formation mechanism, for microwave scattering by the regolith, and for landed mission on Enceladus in the future. Data:  Cassini ISS NAC data of Enceladus obtained between 2005 to 2011 was processed using ISIS 3, and navigated for pointing correction with respect to the basemap by Roatsch et al. [2].  High resolution south polar data was selected from the larger data set, and assembled into a reconfigurable mosaic in ArcGIS for terrain mapping.  A smaller subset of 19 images listed in Table 1 was used for measuring the properties of the boulders. Size distribution:  The images listed in Table 1 were selected because they clearly displayed fields of positive relief features that we interpret to be boulders.  The diameter and position of each boulder within these images was measured using qview in ISIS 3. 10 10010−810−710−610−5Diameter (m)Cumulative number larger than diameter,  per m2  Figure 1: Cumulative size distribution of boulders in image 8 (open circles).Best fit power-law (green line) and exponential function (red line)shown at diameters larger than 3 pixels. The six images shown in white on Table 1 each contained significant numbers of boulders (>100) viewed at more than 3 pixels across.  The boulders more than 3 pixels across in these six images were used to examine size distribution statistics with respect to a power-law distribution N(D) = K Dc and an exponential distribution N(D) = K e(c D) where N(D) is the number of boulders larger than a certain diameter per square meter of surface, D is the diameter, K is a bestfit multiplicative constant and c is a best-fit coefficient in the exponent.  Figure 1 shows a plot of the cumulative size distribution of boulders in image 8, compared to best fit equations.  Table 2 lists the best fit coefficients c and the correlation r for power-law and exponential distributions in the six target images highlighted in Table 1.  Unlike boulders on Eros, which follow a steep -5 power law distribution [3], the best fit power law to Enceladus boulders generally has a slope between -3 and -4.  Better statistical fits to the boulder distributions in all images are obtained using an exponential curve, as has been found for boulder fields on Mars and Earth [e.g. 4].

 Spatial distribution:  The images in table 1, along with 13 additional images with resolutions better than 100 m/pixel, were examined in the ArcGIS mosaic.  The terrain was classified into rough (high density of ridges), smooth (plateau areas), and another "sulcus" category along the edges of the prominent "tiger stripe" fractures.  Within each of these terrain types, example areas were found in the Table 1 images that contained boulders and also areas that did not contain boulders.  The morphology of the boulder-containing terrain types were then mapped out into the surrounding images viewed at lower resolution.  Figure 2 shows a map of the terrain classified in this high resolution image set, separating areas with observed boulders (or likely to contain boulders by linkage to adjacent high resolution images) from areas with no observed boulders (or unlikely to contain them based on adjacent images).  No obvious pattern is found in boulder sizes or areal density with respect to proximity to other prominent terrain features, such as the tiger stripes, but additional tests need to be performed. Formation hypotheses: Since there are no craters observed in the south polar terrain of Enceladus [1], it is unlikely that boulders are the result of impact cratering processes, a common emplacement mechanism on the Moon or asteroids.  Ballistic ejection of the boulders from tiger stripe geysers [5] is on the edge of possibility given certain volcanic conditions, but is unlikely to explain the observed boulder population, as there is no clear preferred distribution of boulders with respect to the locations of the geysers. Two hypothetical mechanisms could be tested.  In one, the boulder-choked surfaces form as a lag deposit during sublimation or collapse of loose regolith.  The south polar terrain has an unusually high heat flow [6], and small particles deposited from the geysers are likely to be poor thermal conductors.  The underside of solid ice blocks with exposed tops may thus stay cooler than the surrounding regolith thus preferentially resist sublimation.  In an alternative hypothesis, the blocks initially form in the near subsurface by tectonic detachment along intersecting, tidally-worked faults. After detachment, the Brazil nut effect could bring these blocks to the top of a loose regolith layer as the surface of Enceladus is disturbed by seismicity and tides. Link to microwave observations:  Unusually high RADAR backscatter from Cassini has been reported from tectonized areas in the South Polar Terrain of Enceladus [5].  One possible explanation for this behavior is the presence of cm-scale voids within the regolith or quasi-spherical pebble piles on the surface [7], possibly implying that the boulder size distribution extends well below that observed by ISS in the uppermost surfaces of these tectonized terrains. Extrapolation from the best-fit distributions to the boulder observations down to the centimeter scale can help to resolve this issue.  Experience with extrapolation of rock populations on Mars has successfully linked orbital observations of large boulders with ground truth about small rocks from landing sites [8].
