Introduction:  The Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mission conducted an all-sky survey in 2010 at infrared wavelengths of 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 microns [1]. Over 158,000 minor planets were detected, including ~700 near-Earth objects, > 2000 Jovian Trojans, and 154 comets [2]. WISE detected both long period comets (originating from the Oort Cloud) and short period comets (originating from the transNeptunian region), creating a homogeneous dataset. This facilitates comparison of the two populations, which have likely undergone different levels of postformation evolution. Comets were detected at a range of heliocentric distances and, in some cases, at more than one epoch, enabling studies of comets throughout the Solar System. Here we present results for the 21 comets discovered or discovered to be active by WISE (Figure 1).  ! Figure 1: The 21 comets that were discovered, or discovered to be active, by WISE.  Methods: Detections of individual comets were stacked to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. On those comets that were detected with discernible activity, we performed nucleus extraction by fitting a geometric model to the coma and subtracting the best fit as described in [3, 4]. We fit extracted nucleus signals with the near-Earth asteroid thermal model (NEATM) [5] and derived diameters, and, where multi-wavelength data were available, beaming parameters and albedos.  The coma signals were fitted with a scaled Planck function to determine the color temperature of the dust. In those cases where the comet was detected at 4.6 microns, we fit reflected light and thermal emission curves to search for excess emission, indicative of CO or CO2 emission lines. We then derived production rates for those species.  Results: We found no statistically-significant difference between the sizes of the 10 WISE-discovered long period comets and those of 11 WISE-discovered short period comets.  The temperatures of the observed dust comae roughly follow the expected blackbody temperature distribution with heliocentric distance. There is no significant difference between the results for long period and short period comets, suggesting similar mineralogies or particle size distributions (Figure 2). We derived CO and CO2 production rates for 8 WISE-discovered comets and set upper limits for those comets not observed to have excess signal at 4.6 microns. There is a broad decrease in gas production with increasing heliocentric distance, as expected. We are currently working to extend these analysis methods to the full dataset of 154 comets detected by WISE in order to more fully probe the ensemble properties of the long period and Jupiter family comet families.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Heliocentric distance [AU] 100 150 200 250 Dus t t em pe ra tu re [K ]Short period comets Long period comets T = 280 / rH0.5 Figure 2: The dust comae temperature of the discovered comets versus heliocentric distance at the time of detection for short period (red) and long period (blue) comets.
