Introduction: Chondrites represent the least processed precursors of emerging planets in our solar system. Geochemical analyses of their various components, including chondrules and calcium-, aluminumrich inclusions (CAIs) improve our understanding of how the solar system evolved. For the past five decades, meteorite scientists have used electron microprobes (EMP) and scanning electron microprobes (SEM) to study modal mineral abundances, bulk chemical compositions, and textures of thin and thick sections of chondrites. These data are crucial for understanding not only the chemical and physical characteristics of the disk environment in which chondrites formed, but also the physical and chemical processes that acted on the meteorite parent bodies between their formation and sample arrival on Earth. Analyses of chondrites' three-dimensional (3D) geometry and petrology have recently become possible, and thus important in unraveling their histories [1].  X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanning is a non-destructive method for visualizing and quantifying three-dimensional textures and sizes of chondritic components in situ. CT has been used to study both the large-scale textures of chondrites [1,2] and the textures and volumes of specific mineral components of chondrites [3,4,5]. This study is part of a larger project to obtain 3D size data for CAIs and chondrules from two carbonaceous Ornans-type (CO) chondrites (Colony CO3.0 and Moss CO3.6) so that the chemistry of these inclusions, as observed in random 2D sections, can be correlated to true 3D size data to determine whether certain types of CAIs and chondrules are intrinsically larger than others. Here, we address whether CAI or chondrule volume can be approximated from crosssectional area through a linear conversion factor. The mathematically rigorous correction schemes from 2D area to 3D volume presented by Hughes [6] and Eisenhour [7] can be tested with both kinds of data in hand. Methods: Small (< 1cm2) rectilinear equant slabs of Moss CO3.6 and Colony CO3.0 were scanned at resolutions of 3.9 and 5.1 microns/voxel edge [1], respectively, with x-rays emitted from the 180 keV tube on the GE Phoenix Vtome-x-s 240 CT scanner at the Microscopy and Imaging Facility in the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH). Four scans, each covering 360 degrees of rotation, were performed for four different sections of each meteorite slab and stitched together to obtain images of each slab at the aforementioned resolutions. These images were then calibrated (using Phoenix Datos) and exported as twodimensional positive image tiff stacks into the volumetric data visualization software VGStudio Max 2.2. Individual chondrules and CAIs were manually identified using density contrast between objects of interest and surrounding matrix. Once isolated (segmented), VGStudio Max calculated their volumes. Estimates of each object's diameter were obtained from both its CT volume, and its area as previously measured from element maps of 2D thick sections analyzed using the AMNH Cameca SX100 electron microprobe [e.g., 8, 9]. Diameters for 2D data are for circles of equivalent area to that measured. Diameters for 3D data are for spheres with volume equivalent to that measured. Plots comparing the diameter from volume with that from area were used to estimate a linear correlation factor, a more crude, but perhaps equally valid approach than [6,7].  Results and Discussion: This study compared the mean values of the measured cross-sectional (2D) diameters of CAIs and chondrules with those from the volumes calculated in VG Studio Max (Figure 1). The percent difference between each pair of mean diameters was then calculated and compared with percent differences in mean chondrule diameter found by Hughes [6] and Eisenhour [7] (Figure 2). The 2D diameters of [6] were measured from disaggregated chondrules, while the diameters of chondrules in [7] were calculated from observed 2D diameters [10].

a greater extent. This trend contradicts Eisenhour's finding [7] that larger chondrules are overrepresented in thin section. The causes of this contradiction require further exploration. The similarity of this study's results to the correlation relationship, d⋅(3/2)1/2, observed by Hughes [6] suggests that this conversion factor can be applied to both the chondrules and CAIs presented here. Specifically, this factor was found to fit this study's CAI data slightly better than its chondrule data (Figure 3). Three factors that may have led to this unexpected finding include 1) cross-sectional areas were approximated as circles and volumes as spheres, 2) the chondrule dataset has n=8, whereas the the CAI dataset has n=17, and 3) the volumes of CAIs isolated in VGStudio Max have blockier shapes than their true counterparts, since gaps in the actual shape were filled in during the isolation procedure.  Figure 2: Comparison of percent difference in mean diameter found in this study and [6, 7]. A positive value indicates a mean actual diameter that is larger than the mean cross-sectional diameter. The two bars from Eisenhour's study represent the minimum and maximum percent differences observed.   Figure 3: Comparison of (3/2)1/2 d (x-axis) with D (yaxis) of chondrules (blue) and CAIs (red) testing the model of [6], where d is the measured cross-sectional diameter and D is the actual diameter. The slopes of the linear fit to each type of inclusion represent how well the corrected diameters correlate to the actual diameters where a slope of 1 indicates a perfect representation. +/- 20% error bars reflect the instrument error associated with the actual diameter measurements.  Although this study's results are similar to [6], the correction factor of (3/2)1/2 does not fit all of this study's data well (Figure 3). Eisenhour [7] proposes a modification of this factor to (4/π)1/2, but it does not fit the data any better than (3/2)1/2. Additionally, this study sought an empirical relationship between the diameters determined from VGStudio Max (3D) and EMP map areas (2D), but the fit of this relationship was no better than those proposed in [6, 7]. These findings strongly suggest that a simple converstion factor is inadequate for relating the apparent 2D size of chondrules and CAIs to their actual 3D sizes. We will apply Hughes' [6] and Eisenhour's [7] corrections to this study's data to determine their applicability. The corrections of [6, 7] and those like them have the potential to relate the apparent (2D) and actual (3D) sizes of chondrules and CAIs. A relationship between these two sizes will be a useful tool in correlating the 3D sizes of these inclusions to their 2D chemistry. Conclusions:  EMP and CT analyses of Moss CO3.6 and Colony CO3.0 tested three linear relationships relating 2D and 3D sizes of chondrules and CAIs. The results suggest that more sophisticated corrections need to be applied, and we will apply the corrections from [6, 7] to this study's data to assess their usefulness. These corrections have the potential of relating size, textural, and potentially chemical information of CAIs and chondrules. Such extrapolations can provide valuable insights into the formation of chondrites and early solar system workings.  References: [1] Ebel D. S. and Rivers M. L. (2007) Meteoritics & Planet.
