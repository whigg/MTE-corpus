Fe-Mg INTERDIFFUSION PROFILES IN ISOLATED FORSTERITES IN THE ALLENDE MATRIX. EVIDENCE FOR A PARENT BODY ORIGIN: TIME-TEMPERATURE CONSTRAINTS DEDUCED FROM A TEM STUDY.  P. Cuvillier1, H. Leroux1, D. Jacob1, 1UMET, Université Lille 1 & CNRS, 59655Villeneuve d’Ascq, France (priscille.cuvillier@ed.univ-lille1.fr).   Introduction: Fayalitic olivines are commonly found in the matrix of the Allende CV3.6 chondrite with a compositional range spreading over Fa40-55. They mainly occur as a porous assemblage of ~ 5-10 µm grains with elongated and tabular shapes. Fayalitic olivine is also found as rims surrounding both forsterite-rich type I chondrules and isolated forsterite fragments in the Allende matrix. The formation mechanism of these iron-rich olivines is still under debate. Some authors suggested an olivine formation by direct condensation from an oxidized nebular gas at high temperature [1-3], while others favored a fluid-assisted formation through aqueous and metamorphism alteration processes on the Allende parent body [4-6].   In this TEM-EDS study, we have measured and quantified Mg-Fe composition profiles in several forsterite grains (likely fragments of type I chondrules) surrounded by a fayalite-rich rim (Fig. 1). We show that the composition profiles are compatible with MgFe interdiffusion profiles. Together with the olivine microstructure, they strongly favor a secondary origin for the fayalitic olivines and support a parent body formation scenario. Moreover, the quantitative analysis of diffusion profiles enables to constrain duration times that prevailed the formation of fayalitic olivines in the parent body of Allende.

The white line localises a FIB section extracted at the interface between the forsterite fragment and the matrix for the TEM study.  Methods: TEM foils (100 nm thick) were prepared by the focused ion beam technique using an FEI Strata DB 235 at IEMN (Univ. Lille). Analytical TEM was performed using LaB6 filament FEI Tecnai G2-20 and Philips CM30 operating respectively at 200 and 300 kV. Composition profiles were measured using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Results:  Fe-rich olivines microstructure. Fayalitic rims thicknesses usually range from 0.5 to few microns (Fig. 2). Rims have the same crystallographic orientation as the forsterite in contact. They contain voids, inclusions (Al-Cr-Fe spinel, pentlandite, glass, carbon), dislocations and planar defects along (100). A similar microstructure is found in the fayalitic olivines located in the surrounding matrix (Fig. 3), with a comparable compositional range Fa40-55.  These observations suggest common origin and thermal history for the fayalitic olivine in the matrix and fayalitic rims around forsterite grains.

Glassy inclusions (white arrows) are commonly found with a composition close to the surrounding fayalitic olivine but enriched in minor element such as Al, S, and Ca. Composition profiles. Composition line profiles were recorded by EDS (probe size 5 nm) in several FIB sections across rims and their adjacent forsterite grains (Fig.4). The fayalite concentration progressively increases from the forsterite interior to the rim (or vein). Compositions are nearly constant in the rims, with a plateau 1708.pdf

close to Fa45 and display a sharp jump (from Fa45 to Fa30) at the interface with forsterite (Fig. 4). These observations suggest that the compositional profile could be decomposed in two parts with a continuous variation on the forsterite side (up to Fa30) and a plateau in the rim (Fa45), both parts being un-equilibrated.  Discussion: In order to determine the origin of composition profile in forsterite, we tested its consistency with a diffusion profile. For calculations we used a 2D geometry and the following diffusion coefficient defined by [7]: )14.0(303,222600027,8)]/²(log[ Fec XnRTsmD  We adjusted the n value (n=2 in our calculations) to obtain a better agreement of simulated profiles with experimental ones. The n value describes the weight of the dependency on iron-content (XFe) of the diffusion coefficient in Fe-bearing olivine (see [7,8] for more details).  Fig. 4: Fa component (mol%) profile recorded by EDS. There is sharp compositional jump at the interface between the rim and forsterite. Calculations are consistent with a diffusion process. A diffusion origin is also supported by the presence of Fa-rich veins into forsterite grains (with radial compositional profile in forsterite). Besides, the presence of compositional profiles from veins into forsterite grains illustrates a diffusion process which occurred on the meteorite parent body and not in the solar nebula. The time-temperature couples associated with the diffusion coefficient values extracted from the fitted profiles and corresponding to the metamorphic temperature in the Allende parent body [9] are plotted in Fig. 5.  The nanometer-scaled measurements of the composition profiles at the interface between Fe-rich olivine in the matrix and forsterite grains give some new insights to precise the formation mechanism of fayalitic olivine in the Allende matrix:    - A low-T alteration process (probably dissolution/precipitation) of fayalitic precursors occurs via a fluid-circulation in the matrix and through the chondrule fractures. This episode leads to the formation of the Fe-rich olivine of the matrix and the rims by progressive alteration of initial forsterite grains, rims and matrix olivines having the same microstructure. Inclusions in the Fe-rich olivine may originate from the dehydration of possible hydrous precursor phases, as previously pointed out by [6]. - The peak metamorphic event trigger the diffusion process into the forsterite (around T=400600°C) and a compositional gradient develops into the forsterite. At this stage, the fayalitic content of the matrix is about Fa30 and act like an infinite reservoir. - After the metamorphic event (T<400°C), the diffusion process drastically slows down in forsterite but not in the matrix olivines due to a higher Fe content, a high concentration of crystal defects and a higher porosity. Thus, iron content in matrix olivines continues to increase to the Fa45 mean value leading to a compositional jump between the Fe-rich olivine and the unaltered forsterite edge.   Fig. 5: Time-temperature couples for several composition profiles. The interdiffusion coefficient equation defined by [7] is valid only for T>600°C, we extrapolated the value for lower temperature. Timescales are in agreement with a parent body process from 102 years at 600°C to 105 years at 450°C.  References: [1] Weinbruch S. et al (1990) Meteoritics, 25,115-125. [2] Palme H. and Fegley B.
