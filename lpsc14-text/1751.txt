Imaging, topography and rock abundance estimates all provide a means to investigate the state of degradation, albedo, and the morphology of craters and ejecta. We propose that a complete inventory of Copernican and Eratosthenian craters can be derived from the above datasets. This inventory will enable the development of a crater degradation model, and improve relative age relations across the entire Moon.  Here, we present a method utilizing one of the datasets, a Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) Wide Angle Camera (WAC) 643 nm normalized reflectance map [1,2], to separate Copernican and Eratosthenian crater populations.    F igure 1. LROC WAC 643nm reflectance global map (map centered on 0°N, 0°E) overlaid with crater locations used in our calculations. Blue dots are Copernican craters, and green dots are Eratosthenian.  The surface of airless bodies like the Moon experience physical and chemical modifications caused by micrometeorite impacts and solar wind bombardment [3] that result in significant modification of the spectral reflectance of the regolith. The degree to which the surface was modified due to space weathering is called the maturity state [4]; immature surfaces have higher reflectance and shallower visible to near-infrared spectral slopes than mature surfaces of the same composition. The spectral darkening and steepening of spectral slope with increased maturity is due to the accumulation of metallic nanophase iron on regolith particles [3]. Compositional differences, such as titanium conWHQW� �LQ� LOPHQLWH�� DOVR� DIIHFW� WKH�0RRQ¶V� REVHUYHG� Ueflectance. Both iron and titanium decrease observed reflectance because they are strongly absorbing in the visible wavelengths; Fe2+ also has a strong absorptions in the near-infrared [3].   Copernican craters exhibit crisp morphology  and relatively high reflectance rays and interiors (by definition [5]), whereas Eratosthenian craters also have crisp morphology but lack observable rays. The existence or lack of rays is the key discriminator between Copernican and Eratosthenian craters. M ethod:  An LROC WAC 643 nm photometrically normalized (incidence: 30°, emission 30°, phase 30°) reflectance map forms the basis of this study [2].  The weighted mean of the normalized reflectance for 20 known Copernican craters and 20 Eratosthenian craters [6] were calculated. One half of both the Copernican and Eratosthenian craters are located in the lunar highlands, and the other half in the mare (Fig. 1). The mean reflectance was calculated from crater center to 2 diameters (D) in 40 concentric rings about the center and taking the mean reflectance value of each ring. Values from these concentric rings are used to evaluate the mean reflectance between 1.5 R < r < 2R  and  R < r < 1.5R. By selecting suitable linear classification boundaries defined over the axis ( X axis : ( R < r < 1.5 R) ,  Y axis : (1.5 R < r < 2R) )  the Copernican and Eratosthenian craters are classified.   F igure 2. LROC WAC 643 nm normalized reflectance image of highlands crater Jackson [22.05°, -163.33°] . The inner ring ( R < r < 1.5 R) and outer ring (1.5 R < r < 2R) spatial reflectance averages are used for classification.   Results: The results ( Figure 3, Figure 4) show that the classified lines can be drawn by inspection through a point (x,y = 0.069,0.075 for mare and x,y = 0.132,0.13 for highlands) so that two diagonally opposite regions are created, which classify the data. A correct detection rate (CDR) of 90% is obtained by our proposed method for both highlands and mare. 1751.pdf

 F igure 3 :  Classification results for Mare region, 18 of 20 craters are correctly classified.     F igure 4. Classification results for Highlands region, 18 of 20 craters are correctly classified. Discussion: We have shown that the radial variation of  normalized reflectance can be utilized to segregate Copernican and Eratosthenian crater populations for both mare and highlands regions - but they must be treated separately due to the difference in average reflectance .  Other methods include studying the stratigraphic relations of craters to mare materials, morphological features, and crater densities.  Studying morphologic features might be particularly useful in distinguishing between Eratosthenian and the older, more degraded craters within the Imbrian system.
