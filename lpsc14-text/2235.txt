Introduction:  Calcium-, aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) provide a unique record of the earliest processes and conditions in the solar system [e.g. 1, 2]. A small number of CAIs contain fractionated and unidentified nuclear anomalies (FUN); these FUN CAIs have mostly been found in CV chondrites [e.g. 3, 4]. Nuclear anomalies have been observed in many elements including Ti, Ca, and Sr [5-8], while large mass dependent fractionations have been observed in the isotopic composition of O, Si and Mg [4, 9]. These FUN CAIs were once thought to show little evidence for the former presence of 26Al [e.g. 6, 10], suggesting that they either formed prior to the injection of 26Al into the protoplanetary disc or that the 26Al had not yet been homogenised. However, a wide range of initial 26Al levels discovered in FUN CAIs now challenges this notion of formation prior to injection of 26Al [11]. Further study of these rare objects would provide important new constraints regarding the age of the solar system, while also potentially providing new information about the timing of injection and distribution of short lived radioisotopes in the early solar system.  The limiting factor in further studies of FUN CAIs is sample size. Many of the first found FUN CAIs were consumed during analyses by TIMS, and little or nothing of these original samples remain. Recently, two new FUN CAIs have been found; STP-1 [10] and CMS-1 [12, 13], both in Allende (CV3). Both have been subject to isotopic analyses (e.g. O, Al-Mg, Hf-W [10, 12]), but neither have been dated by U-Pb for absolute ages. Clearly we require more FUN CAIs to be found in order to build a more representative sample population so that a wider range of analyses can be performed.  To this end we have undertaken a systematic search for FUN CAIs, building on previous work [14] and utilizing the Mg isotope system as a way to quickly and efficiently identify highly fractionated objects by LAMC-ICP-MS. Modern analytical methods allow acquisition of Mg isotope data by laser ablation with precision on δ25Mg ranging from 0.05-0.3‰, depending on the signal intensity. While this level of uncertainty is an order of magnitude greater than what would be expected for solution analysis it is still far smaller than the observed fractionation effects for FUN CAIs (>20‰ per a.m.u.). In this study we present the results of a new search for FUN CAIs, including CAIs which might have highly positive or highly negative mass dependent Mg isotope fractionations.    Methods:  Mg isotopes and Al/Mg ratios were collected using a Thermo Fisher Scientific Neptune Plus MC-ICP-MS connected to a PhotonMachines Analyte 193 nm excimer laser ablation system. Collectors are aligned to allow for simultaneous acquisition of all isotopes in static multi-collection mode using 1011 Ω resistors: 24Mg (L4), 25Mg (L1), 26Mg (H1), and 27Al (H4) without dispersion or magnet jumps. A laser spot size of 20-40 μm was used for all analyses. The 6 Hz laser was operated at 5 mJ energy and a fluence of 1.2 J cm-2. Data were collected in medium resolution (mass resolving power ~4000) to avoid the small (< 5 mV) 12C14N interference on the side of the 26Mg peak. Data were corrected for mass bias and instrument drift by standard-sample bracketing with San Carlos olivine, assuming linear drift between successive analyses. The data are presented in delta notation:  δxMg = [(xMg/24Mg)smpl/(xMg/24Mg)SC-Ol -1] ×1000, where xMg is either 25Mg or 26Mg. Excess 26Mg (26Mg*) due to 26Al decay is calculated using: δ26Mg* =[(1+δ26Mg/103)/(1+δ25Mg/103)(1/0.511)-1]×103 27Al/24Mg ratios were corrected for instrumental mass bias and laser-induced elemental fractionation by standard-sample bracketing to MPI-DING GOR128 (assuming 27Al/24Mg = 0.381; [15]). Typical internal errors were 0.17‰ for δ25Mg, and 0.20‰ for δ26Mg*.  Results: Over a one month period a total of 365 AlMg analyses were made of CAIs in slabs of the CV chondrite Allende that were borrowed from the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History and the Senkenberg Museum in Frankfurt. The majority, 316 analyses, had δ25Mg values between -3 and 3‰. The remaining 49 analyses spanned a range in δ25Mg from 11.51 to 17.64‰, that is approximately 28‰ per a.m.u.   If the radiogenic δ26Mg* value is plotted vs. the 27Al/24Mg ratio the data lie on an array corresponding to an initial 26Al/27Al ratio of (5.85 ± 0.26) × 10-5 (Fig 1). This is similar to, though slightly higher than, the canonical ratio of 5.23 × 10-5 [1, 2, 16], but consistent with the  results of previous studies of CAIs in CV chondrites by laser ablation [14, 17].  Discussion and Conclusions: The traditional view of a FUN CAI is that it has a highly fractionated Mg 2235.pdf

isotopic composition (>20 ‰ per amu) and no radiogenic excess in 26Mg (i.e., 26Al/27Al of <5×10-6). By this definition most of the CAIs in our study so far are not FUN as the CAIs with large isotopic fractionations also have resolvable excesses in 26Mg (Fig 2). However, the traditional (old) definition of FUN CAIs may be obsolete. Recent Mg isotope analyses in distinct phases from FUN CAIs by ion microprobe show a range of mass dependent fractionation (fMg) from 4 to 40‰ per a.m.u., and a range of initial 26Al/27Al ratios from ~3×10-6 to within error of canonical [11]. The most fractionated objects in our study have Al-Mg systematics that are consistent with these FUN CAIs. Three CAIs from Smithsonian slabs 24, 25 and 27 have fMg values of 17.6, 15.6 and 13.9‰ per a.m.u. respectively and so based on the data of [11] require further study. In particular it will be important to search for a nuclear anomaly in the isotopic composition of elements such as Ti and Si. These measurements can be performed in situ by LA-MC-ICPMS, as used in the identification of CMS-1 [12].  As well as considering the magnitude of fMg it is interesting to compare the range of fMg values within single CAIs. In most previously studied CAIs this range is narrow, for example in Allende CAIs Egg-3 and A43 the range is less than 0.5‰ per a.m.u. [1, 2]. We see similar results, for example multiple analyses of CAI #14 from AMNH 4884 give a limited range of fMg values from 11.5 to 12.6‰ per a.m.u. In contrast, a small number of recent studies have observed a large range of fMg values (~11-14‰) within single CAIs [11, 18]. Park et al. [11] observe this in 2 FUN inclusions that have initial 26Al/27Al ratios of ~3×10-6, Sapah et al. [18] observe this in a CAI from NWA 4502 with a canonical 26Al/27Al ratio. In our study, CAI #93 from Smithsonian slab 27 contains fMg values between 0.7-13.9‰ per a.m.u. This CAI also contains an excess in 26Mg that roughly corresponds to increasing Al/Mg ratio, with an initial 26Al/27Al ratio of approximately 2-5 × 10-5. The diverse range of fMg within single CAIs and the diversity in initial 26Al/27Al ratios offers a unique opportunity to study the results of isotopic fractionation associated with evaporation.    In summary, our study, together with other recent work, shows that Al-Mg systematics in CAIs and FUN CAIs are widely variable. This is true both in their initial 26Al/27Al ratios and in the extent of fMg, which varies even in FUN CAIs. Furthermore it is clear that some CAIs have large internal variations in fMg. Identifying more FUN CAIs will be an important step both in shedding light on the behavior of the Al-Mg system, but also lending crucial insights to our understanding of early solar system processes and chronology, and the precursor materials to emerging planets.
