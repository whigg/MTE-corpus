Based on the success of the current Mars Science Laboratory rover instrument ChemCam [2], the first ever laser-based spectrographic system to be selected as an instrument on a NASA spacecraft, we have developed and tested a prototype laser-based spectroscopic instrument. Our new instrument is capable of at least 10,000 times greater sensitivity than the ChemCam instrument, allowing for faster laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), remote Raman measurements up to 8 m away with a focused laser beam, or 3 m with a defocused laser beam, and biofluorescence detection. These separate techniques are all integrated into one compact remote LIBS-RamanFluorescence instrument called QuaLITy (Q-SwitchedLaser-Induced Time-Resolved Spectroscopy) [3]. QuaLITy uses an electronically gated intensified charge-coupled device (ICCD) and a Q-switched laser. Short gate widths (on the order of 100 ns) and carefully selected gate delays on the ICCD allow for timeresolved spectroscopy, where the Raman signal and the unwanted mineral fluorescence signals can be separated from each other. The instrument can also collect LIBS measurements without plasma background and all spectra can be collected in well-lit conditions without the need for sample collection or preparation. Bio-fluorescence from samples containing biologically-relevant fluorescent molecules (e.g. porphyrins, proteins, DNA bases, etc.) have short lifetimes (<1 ns) compared to organic molecules including PAHs (<1 ns to 1 μs) (e.g. [4]) and mineral fluorescence (≥1 μs) [5]; Raman signals are produced immediately after the sample is excited by the laser beam. When measuring Raman, the QuaLITy instrument uses a gate width of 400 ns to be certain that any fluorescence from the sample is organic. Methodology: The prototype instrument was tested at various distances (3, 5, 7, and 8 m), spot sizes (5 mm, and >1 mm), laser powers (25.5 and 0.5 mJ/pulse at 20 Hz), and atmospheric conditions (Earth and Mars) with a variety of samples. The samples include minerals (Ward's Natural Science), clays (The Clay Mineral Society and NIST), NIST glass laser ablation standards (SRM 610 and SRM 612), Mars analog soil samples (Chris McKay, NASA Ames) [6], igneous rocks from Waianae Volcano, Oahu, Hawai'i, USA (Univ. Hawai'i, John Sinton), and quenched glass samples from Kilauea Volcano, Hawai'i, Hawai'i, USA (HVO). The performance of the QuaLITy instrument is compared to the performance of an Ocean Optics (OO) LIBS instrument system, which was the basis for the design of the ChemCam instrument [2]. Instrument Description: The QuaLITy instrument is a compact direct-coupled (as opposed to the fiber optic coupled ChemCam instrument) remote pulsedlaser based spectroscopy instrument (Fig. 1). The instrument consists of: (a) a Q-switched water-cooled frequency-doubled solid-state Nd:YAG 532 nm laser head (BigSky Ultra Lasers), (b) 10x beam expander, (c) a 45° 532 nm laser mirror (Edmund Optics), (d) a simple mirror, (e) 500 mm mirror lens collecting optics (Nikkor), (f) a 532 nm long pass filter (Semrock), (g) a 50 μm slit, (h) the compact spectrometer, and (i) the mini-ICCD (Syntronics 1408 by 1044 pixel with adjustable gain), with (j) ICCD electronics and (k) cooling system (all experiments use an ICCD cooled to 10 °C). The spectrometer (h) uses two stacked volume phase transmission gratings (Kaiser Holoplex) to create two spectral images with approximate spectral ranges of 534 nm to 611 nm (bottom) and 609 nm to 696 nm (top) with a resolution of ~0.06 nm/pixel. Each spectral range is binned vertically and stitched to produce a raw spectrum. The raw spectrum is wavelength calibrated Hg-Ar and Ne lamps and intensity calibrated using a SphereOptics total integration sphere radiance measurement. Results: Figure 2 compares two spectra of gypsum from a distance of 5 m held under Martian atmosphere (~7 torr CO2) with a 25.5 mJ/pulse laser energy: a single-shot QuaLITy LIBS measurement (10 ICCD gain) and a OO measurement integrated for 5 s. The average signal to noise ratio of the peaks in Fig. 2 for the QuaLITy spectrum is 124 and 88 for the OO spectrum. On average, the peak intensity in units of radiance for the QuaLITy gypsum spectrum is 9 times greater than the OO spectrum with the same collection parameters. Assuming that increasing the gain and integration time would not saturate the ICCD, a QuaLITy spectrum of the same integration time and maximum ICCD gain would have a theoretical maximum value of 9x64x100 = 57,600x increase in sensitivity for gypsum (intensity multiplier x max increase due to ICCD gain x increase due to integration time).  Figure 3 shows two examples of Raman spectra for QuaLITy measured at 3 m with a 25.5 mJ/pulse laser energy: an olivine grain in Waianae Volcano igneous rock sample PW-34 with a 5 min 100 ICCD gain spectrum (blue trace) and a 1 min gypsum spectrum with 80 ICCD gain (red trace, intensity x1/150). The OO instrument is not sensitive enough to detect Raman. The olivine spectrum is from a ~1 mm olivine phenocryst within an igneous rock sample using a 5 mm Raman laser spot size. The QuaLITy instrument uses an image detector with the optics directly coupled to the spectrometer. In this spectrometer design, the image of the target is preserved on the ICCD in the y direction. In heterogeneous samples, such as natural rocks, this is an incredibly useful tool, where several components of the rock can be identified within one measurement. The QuaLITy instrument measures Raman at 8 m, 0.5 mJ/pulse, and a focused laser spot. Figure 3 shows the spectrum for olivine (green trace, intensity x1/10) with 100 ICCD gain collected for 5 min. Raman with fluorescence measurements of McKay's soil samples, JSC Mars-1A (blue trace, up to 1400 ppm organics) and Antarctica Dry Valley Soil (red trace, up to 30 ppm organics) [6], are shown in Fig. 4. The sharp Raman line at 464 cm -1 is due to quartz grains in the Dry Valley soil. Both spectra in Fig. 4 have fluorescence backgrounds, demonstrating that the instrument is extremely sensitive to organics. Conclusions: QuaLITy is a robust compact remote integrated LIBS, Raman, and fluorescence instrument. Conservatively, QuaLITy has a >10,000 times greater sensitivity than the Ocean Optics instrument. The greater sensitivity stems from the use of an electronically gated image ICCD and direct coupling of the collection optics to the spectrometer. Raman, LIBS, and fluorescence measurements have been collected from distances of 3 to 8 m with single-shot and longer integration times.
