Introduction:  Spectral surveys of main belt asteroids in the visible to near infrared (VNIR) such as SMASS I [1], SMASS II [2], and S 3OS 2 [3], typically cut off at the wavelengths near or below 1.0 µm. This provides incomplete coverage of the diagnostic mafic silicate feature centered near 1 µm (Band I) and no coverage of the feature centered near 2 µm (Band II) in the spectra of many asteroids. This limits the surface material characterizations for such data sets based on absorption band positions. If an interpretive calibration could be developed for the ~0.4 to ~1.0 µm spectral interval, more detailed information could potentially be extracted from these extensive spectral survey data sets. Ordinary chondrites (H-, L-, and LL-types) are the most common types of meteorites falling to Earth (73.5%) [4]. The abundance and distribution of OC parent bodies has been one of the persistent questions in asteroid science. With VNIR reflectance spectra extending to 2.5 µm, it is possible to identify or exclude OC-type assemblages on individual asteroids [5,6]. We have undertaken a survey of meteorite spectral data from RELAB [7] and the Gaffey meteorite data sets [8] to investigate whether the wavelength position of the reflectance peak located between the charge transfer absorption edge shortwards of ~0.6 µm and the Band 1 centered near 1 µm can be used as a mineralogically diagnostic spectral parameter as illustrated in Figure 1.  Figure 1. Reflectance spectrum of an average of three H6 chondrites. The reflectance peak near 0.73 µm is the focus of the present effort. Since the central position of the 1 µm absorption feature in mafic silicate assemblages varies with the mineralogy and mineral chemistry of the assemblage [9-12], it is to be expected that the position of the peak introduced by the short wavelength wing of the 1 µm feature should also vary. This would also be expected for OC spectra since the central position and width of the 1 µm mafic silicate feature in ordinary chondrite spectra shifts systematically between the three types [8,13]. Herein we present the initial results of our investigation. Methods:  The investigation has focused on ordinary chondrite spectra since they comprise ~3/4 of meteorite falls and since their linkages to main belt asteroids have been a central debate in asteroid science for more than four decades. The reflectance spectra of meteorite samples were downloaded from the RELAB and PDS databases. The wavelength of the reflectance peak in each spectrum was determined by a polynomial fit to the spectral interval containing the peak. Analysis:  Preliminary results showed discernable differences in the peak wavelength between H-, L- and LL-chondrites. Further analysis shows considerable overlap in the peak position between the three OCtypes. Figure 2 illustrates the clustering of H-type OCs between 0.7 and 0.75 µm. Figure 3 illustrates the clustering noted in the LL-type OCs between 0.68 and 0.74 µm. Figure 4 illustrates the lack of clustering by the Ltype OCs. However, the L type OCs do fall generally within 0.65 and 0.78 µm.  Figure 2. H-type OC Band I Peaks. Generally the Htype chondrites fall between 0.70 and 0.75 μm as highlighted with few deviations.  Figure 3. LL type OC Band I Peaks. Generally the LL type chondrites fall between 0.68 and 0.74 m.  Figure 4. L type OC Band I Peaks. Generally the L type chondrites are spread between 0.65 and 0.78 μm.  Figure 5. Average peak positions for H-, L-, and LLtype chondrites versus metamorphic grade. The average for all metamorphic grades are shown on the right. 'Error' bars are 1 standard deviation of the mean in each case. Figure 5 shows the average peak position for each of the OC-types as a function of metamorphic grade. Although there is a considerable scatter as indicated by the standard deviation 'error' bars, there is a persistent variation towards shorter peak wavelengths with increasing metamorphic grade. This is most pronounced amongst the LL-types.  Conclusion:  While the wavelength range of the visible range peak is more constrained for H- and LLtype chondrites, the L-type chondrites prove to be problematic. These results suggest that while there are quantifiable differences between the OC-types, the wavelength position of the visible region peak reflectance is not a robust parameter for discriminating these meteorite types. This parameter however may be useful in elimination interpretation options. The systematic shift in peak position with metamorphic grade may provide an additional discriminatory parameter in spectral interpretations of CCD survey spectra.
