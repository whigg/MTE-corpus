Introduction: Apatite Ca5(PO4)3(F,Cl,OH), merrillite Ca18Na2Mg2(PO4)14, and whitlockite Ca9(Mg,Fe2+)(PO4)6[PO3(OH)] are the primary phosphate minerals found in most planetary materials including rocks from Earth, Moon, Mars, and asteroids [1-3]. For many years, the terms merrillite and whitlockite have been used interchangeably in the meteorite literature; however, the term "merrillite" has been adopted to identify the hydrogen-free form of whitlockite [4]. The atomic arrangements of merrillite and whitlockite were examined in detail by [3,5]. On Earth, whitlockite has been found in rocks from both evolved pegmatitic systems [3-4,6-7] as well as in some mantle rocks [8]. Furthermore, terrestrial whitlockite has been shown to have some merrillite component [3]. For the meteoritic and lunar materials that have been investigated, merrillite appears to be far more common than whitlockite, and it has been proposed that the whitlockite component is unique to terrestrial samples [3]. There are some reports of "whitlockite" in the meteorite literature, however these likely represent misidentifications of merrillite because there have been no reports of extraterrestrial whitlockite that have been verified through structural studies or analyzed for their H2O abundances. Hughes et al. [3] reported the atomic arrangements of two natural samples of whitlockite, of synthetic whitlockite, and of samples of synthetic whitlockite that were heated at 500 °C and 1050 °C for 24 h. The crystal chemistry and crystal structures of the phases were compared, and it was discovered that the latter treatment resulted in the dehydrogenation of whitlockite to form merrillite. The presence of merrillite vs. whitlockite is widely thought to serve as an indication that magmas are anhydrous [3, 8-12]. Recent evidence has challenged the notion that planetary magmas are anhydrous [13-24]. In fact, recent estimates of water abundances in the martian interior are similar to estimates of the terrestrial mantle [15,17,22]. Consequently, the question of a whitlockite component in planetary merrillite needs to be revisited in light of these findings. In the present study, we set out to find coexisting igneous apatite and merrillite in a martian meteorite to compare their volatile abundances and determine if a whitlockite component exists in martian merrillite.  SIMS Methods: The measurements of F, OH, Cl, C, and S in Shergotty apatite and merrillite were performed on a Cameca 6f ion microprobe at the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism, at the Carnegie Institution of Washington in Washington, DC [25] using a phosphate analysis routine from McCubbin et al. [1617]. The focused (5-10 nA) 10kV Cs+ primary ion beam was rastered on the sample to a 25 by 25 micron area. The secondary ion beam was extracted at -5 kV from an 8-micron diameter portion of the rastered area with a field aperture. An electron flood gun (-5 kV) was used to compensate for charge build up in the analysis area. A mass resolution of approximately 6000 was used to resolve 17.003[OH] from 16.999O. Standardization on five terrestrial apatites was performed at the beginning of the session. Information concerning the compositions of the standards used and the calibration curves for F, OH (reported as H2O equivalent), Cl, and S are reported in McCubbin et al. [17]. Results: We focus here only on the textures relevant directly to the phosphates. Apatites in Shergotty vary in crystal habit from euhedral to anhedral, with the euhedral grains being smaller (10-30µm), occurring as mineral inclusions in pyroxene (Figure 1). The subhedral to anhedral grains are associated with late-stage phases like silica, sulfides, and fayalitic olivine, and seem to fill the space interstitial to the earlier crystallized assemblage. Merrillite typically occurs as subhedral to anhedral grains and is also commonly associated with late-stage phases. It is unclear whether merrillite or apatite crystallized first, however only apatite is found as inclusions within pyroxene, suggesting that apatite may have been first. There is more merrillite than apatite in the meteorite, with our estimate at a 1:2 apatite:merrillite modal ratio.

Discussion: The presence of merrillite has often been used as evidence for low H abundances in magmatic systems [3, 8-12], but this assertion clearly needs to be reassessed in light of the results from the present study where merrillite coexists with OH-rich apatite. Based on recent apatite-melt partitioning experiments on shergottitic liquids, the halogens play a much larger role in stabilizing magmatic apatite than water. In fact, apatite prefers F over OH by a factor of 50-100, and it prefers Cl over OH by a factor of about 20 [26]. Consequently, relatively high abundances of H2O may be required in the melt to stabilize OH-rich apatite over merrillite, similar to the elevate abundance of H2O required to stabilize OH-rich amphiboles. The presence of merrillite in magmatic systems likely has more to do with the ratio of phosphorus to halogens in silicate liquids, with water playing a subordinate role to the halogens in the apatite-melt system. If the ratio of P to F+Cl controls whether only apatite or both merrillite and apatite crystallize, the presence of merrillite would either indicate that the system is depleted in halogens or enriched in phosphorus. Mars is inferred to have high P abundances in its bulk silicate (crust and mantle) compared to other planetary bodies [27-28] and also appears to be somewhat depleted in fluorine [29]. This could explain why merrillite is a ubiquitous phosphate phase in martian basalts despite substantial evidence supporting elevated water and Cl abundances in martian magmas [22,30-34]. Additional experimental work is required to determine the controls of apatite versus merrillite stability in silicate melts, but based on the work presented here, H2O is not likely a primary limiting factor in natural systems. It has been postulated that whitlockite and whitlockite components in merrillite are unique to Earth and may not be found in other planetary materials [3]. The results of the present study seem to support this claim, although a reason for the observation has not yet been described. Based on the water abundances in apatite, the residual Shergotty melt would have had 1.5-3.0 wt.% H2O at the time of phosphate crystallization [17]. Since merrillite and whitlockite form a solid solution (as demonstrated by [3]), it seems reasonable that the merrillite forming from this water-rich liquid should have a larger whitlockite component than 0.52.5% (<200 ppm H2O). However, the geologic environments in which whitlockite are commonly found on Earth tend to be low temperature systems (<500 °C) such as pegmatites and hydrothermal environments [4,6-7], where the stability of whitlockite has already been proven experimentally [3]. In fact, Hughes et al. [3] demonstrated that at 1050 °C, whitlockite completely dehydrogenates to merrillite, but whitlockite is stable at 500 °C. Consequently, the high-temperature igneous systems in many extraterrestrial planetary bodies will preclude the magmatic mixing of merrillite and whitlockite components if the solidus is above the upper thermal stability limit of whitlockite components in merrillite (<1050°C). Additional experiments on whitlockite thermal stability are needed to better establish where in the range of 500-1050 °C whitlockite is no longer stable.
