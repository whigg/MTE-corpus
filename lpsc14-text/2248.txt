Many of these studies rely on 3D numerical models, which consider the complexity of convection patterns and tidal dissipation [5–7] but, with the exception of [8], cannot address the crystallization of the ice due to the moving boundary that this requires. Models with crystallization are typically based on steady state numerical runs and do not take dynamic thermal evolution. Modeling a crystallizing convective shell from a set initial thickness to thermal equilibrium will give useful constraints on the maximum thickness of an internally heated ice shell as well as the amount of time it takes to achieve that thickness.   We are developing a thermal evolution model of the H2O layer of icy satellites that takes into consideration the complexities of temperature-dependent viscosity on convection, internal heating from tidal flexing, and basal heating from heat released by crystallization. As the viscosity of ice is strongly temperature dependent convection is expected to fall in the stagnant lid regime [9–11]. The lid is essentially immobile with heat transfer dominated by conduction. Below the lid, there is an essentially isothermal, and therefore isoviscous convecting core. We are building a parameterized model of thermal evolution of the crystallizing ice shell with stagnant lid convection. The lid and convecting cores are regarded as two different layers with the depth to their interface a variable in the model. The depth to the base of the ice shell is also a variable that evolves following melting or crystallization depending on the basal heat flux. We report here on the numerical models obtained to date. The first considers only conduction and the second only convection. In both cases, we include volumetric heat production from tidal dissipation [12]. The next step in our study will be to couple these two models to represent the evolution of the stagnant lid convective regime.  Conduction Model: The standard equation of conductive heat loss is solved in a static ice layer  subjected to a volumetric source that depends on the thickness of ice b and on ice viscosity and therefore temperature [12]. The thickness of ice varies according to dbdt =qbρL     (1) where qb is the basal heat flux, ρ is the density of ice, and L is the latent heat of fusion or crystallization. The heat equation is solved by the finite difference method. Node depth changes to conform to the ice thickness. Therefore, the  discretized heat equation becomes  dTidt =κkQi+i −Qi−1zi+1 − zi−1+Qikdbdt + κHs  (2) where Ti, Qi and zi are the temperature, heat flux, and depth at node i, Hs is the depth-dependent heat source, and k and κ are the thermal conductivity and diffusivity. This approach is able to reproduce analytical solutions to the Stefan problem to great accuracy and can also adopt a more complex, time-variable heat source. We currently use Eq. (1) for db/dt but will adopt later an equation for the evolution of the depth of the conductive lid for a stagnant lid regime. See Figure 1 for an illustration of these conductive parameters.  Isoviscous Convection Model:  The convective component of this model is based on the empirical results of Sotin and Labrosse’s 3-D isoviscous convection study in the presence of internal and bottomdriven heating [13]. There are two major components: The convective parameters determined by [13] and the additional thermal evolution mechanism through which crystallization or melting is accommodated. See Figure 2 for an illustration of these convective parameters. The convective system is composed of an isothermal well-mixed layer of temperature Ti bounded above and below by thermal boundary layers. The layer is heated internally by tidal dissipation, as before, but unlike conventional convective models, the temperature at the base of the layer is fixed to the melting temperature of ice, Tm, and the thickness of the layer, b, may change over time. The constant temperature difference across the ice layer ΔT acts as a second heat source or sink. Changes in ice thickness are related to the basal heat flux according to Eq. (1). The basal heat flux is determined from a heat balance equation Qb=Qt-Hs-Qi    (3) Where Hs is a non-dimensional heat source, and Qt, Qb, and Qi represent non dimensional heat fluxes at the 2248.pdf

top, bottom, and inside the ice. Following [13], the top boundary layer heat flux is given by  Qt =CRaζθiξ     (4) where θi is the internal temperature, Ra is the Rayleigh number, and C, ζ, and ξ are constants. The internal heat flux Qi corresponds to the changes in the internal temperature, θi which depends on the Rayleigh Number and the volumetric heating rate [13], both of which depend on b. Therefore Qi depends on db/dt, which itself depends on Qi through equations (1) and (3). These equations can be combined to yield dbdt = kΔTQt −HsρLb+ρCpΔTb2 dθ db (5). Results. Figure 3 shows the thermal evolution of an ice shell from “hot” and “cold” initial conditions to demonstrate the isoviscous convection model’s ability to both crystallize and melt toward thermal equilibrium. For the parameters chosen here, evolution is complete in about 20 Myrs, a relatively short duration compared to other tectonic processes. Convective and conductive evolutions take place over similar time scales. Not surprisingly, the steady-state ice thickness is larger for convective systems, which are more efficient than conductive systems to evacuate heat from the planetary interior. Figure 3 also includes the evolution of the Rayleigh Number from hot and cold initial conditions to thermal equilibrium.  Future Work:  Work on coupling the conductive lid and isoviscous convection models is ongoing. The conductive lid will be designed to thicken and thin relative to the convective layer in response to changes in vigor of convection and volumetric heat production.
