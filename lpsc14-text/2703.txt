SPHcodes are well-suited to computing gravitational interactions in 3D, tracking provenance,and are guaranteed to conserve mass, so arethe usual choice for studying this problem.Furthermore, the well-tested Hashed Oct-Tree(HOT) code [1, 2] that we use has been parallelized to work efficiently on multiprocessormachines with distributed memory. This meansthat large numbers of particles can be used witha time integration scheme that conserves bothenergy and angular momentum to much betterthan 1%.Our simulation contains 100 times moreparticles than in the state-of-the-art simulationspublished to date, which typically deploy a fewmillion particles [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] This simulationhas achieved spatial resolutions on the order of∼30 km in the planet and a few hundred kilometres in the Moon-forming disk. These resolutions are almost an order of magnitude finerthan in any of the aforementioned publishedsimulations.A careful reading of a very recent studyof resolution-dependence of Moon-forming impact simulations [7] shows that at least two important constraints on impact outcomes – theiron content of the Moon-forming disk and theamount of material with orbits lying wholly beyond the Roche limit – have not converged tonumerically stable limits in 106 particle simulations (nor in Eulerian simulations of comparable spatial resolution). Higher resolutionis required to address these issues by (i) vertically resolving the disk, and (ii) reducing numerical viscosity into the estimated range ofphysical viscosities. We have applied maturealgorithms, common in the fiel of cosmology,to find bound objects within the Moon-formingimpact disk and produce the mass functionof these ‘moonlets’ at different times. Thiswill shed light on the temporal evolution ofthe Moon-forming disk sub-structure and theeventual fate of such objects. Earlier work,with lower resolution simulations, suggests thatthese bound objects are short lived while ourhigh resolution simulation seems to show thatthese substructures can survive for most of thehistory of the Moon-forming disk.In Figure 1, we present three snapshots ofthe Moon Forming Impact. The initial Marssized object arrives from the upper-right, making initial contact with the proto-Earth. In thecentre, the “impactor” and initial debris approaches for a secondary collision. In the bottom row, the cores of the proto-planets havemerged, leaving an orbiting stream of iron-poormaterial and a vapour cloud that evolves toform the Moon.References[1] M. S. Warren and J. K.
