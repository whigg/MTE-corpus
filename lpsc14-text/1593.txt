PARABURDOO SPHERULE LAYER SPINEL COMPOSITION. A.K. Davatzes1, N. G. Swartz1 1Department of Earth and Environmental Science, Temple University (1901 N. 13th St. Philadelphia, PA, 19122; alix@temple.edu)  Introduction:  The Paraburdoo Spherule Layer (PSL) resulted from a meteor impact occurring near the Archean-Proterozoic boundary and is preserved in the Paraburdoo Member of the Wittenoom Formation in the Hamersley Basin, Western Australia [1]. U-Pb age dating of the strata directly above and below the PSL yielded an age range of approximately 2.561  - 2.597 Ga [2]. The PSL has been correlated to the Revillo layer in South Africa based on age relationships as well as geochemical markers [1,3]. The PSL is ideal for study because it is composed almost entirely of spherules, includes well preserved primary spinel and primary crystal textures, and lacks indications of post depositional reworking [1]. Like several sections of the S3 layer from the Barberton greenstone belt in South Africa [4], it is preserved in the Hamersley as a fall deposit. Prior work by Goderis et al. [3] provide a detailed discussion of the geochemistry of the spinels in this layer, as well as a discussion of the platinum group element (PGE) carriers within the spherules.  This study provides additional geochemical analyses of the spinels and compares these to the earlier spinel-bearing spherules in the S3 layer. Methods: Wavelength dispersive spectrometry was performed on the JEOL JXA-8900 Electron Probe Micro-Analyzer at Lehigh University on polished 1inch rounds and thin sections from two sample locations.  Oxide and silicate standards were used for the following suite of elements: Ca, Ti, Cr, Mg, Si, Al, Fe, Ni, and V.  FeO and Fe2O3 were calculated based on stoichiometry.   Results and Discussion: Spinel composition in the Paraburdoo spherule layer is Cr- and Ni-rich, consistent with an impact origin.  The majority of spinels observed were located as chains along the outer margins of the spherules (Figure 1 top and bottom), and all had a euhedral shape.  All of the individual spinel grains were less than 10 µm in diameter, with the majority less than 5 µm.  Some were also associated with very small oxide phases also concentrated along rims.   Though the spinels had elevated Ni compared to terrestrial chromites, the Ni concentrations were small.  Ni concentrations in the Barberton S3 spherules are commonly between 5 -18 wt % NiO, whereas nearly all of the PSL spinels had less than 3 wt % NiO.  Al2O3 concentrations were significantly higher in the PSL, with the majority of spinels within the range of 15-24 wt % compared to <10 wt % Al2O3 in all of the S3 spinels.  Ti, Mg, and Cr are also higher in the PSL spherules, whereas V is slightly lower as compared to the S3 layer.  All are consistent with a more lithophilic spinel in the Paraburdoo compared to the BGB.  None of the PSL spinels fall into the chalcophile zones defined in [4].

Total Fe content and ferric/ferrous ratios in the spinels are highly comparable between the PSL and S3 layers. Zn concentrations, which could indicate diagenetic alteration, is highly variable in the PSL, and is slightly higher in some cases than in the S3 spinels.  Concentrations range from 0-15 wt % ZnO in the PSL spinels.  There appears to be no correlation in the ferric/ferrous ratios to Zn concentration, however, spherules with the highest concentration of ZnO (>8 wt%) have slightly lower concentrations of total Fe. The single outlier with a high Fe3+/FeT ratio has a ZnO concentration of 10 wt % (Figure 2).  The average Fe3+/FeT (atoms) of the rest of the PSL analyses is approximately 0.24, which is slightly higher than the S3 layer average, but within the range observed in the S3 spinels. Spherule size does not have an affect on the Fe3+//FeT.  In general, there does not appear to be any indication of zoning in the rare spinels that were large enough to take multiple analyses, and no zoning was observed in backscatter electron imaging.  Figure 2: Calculated Fe3+/FeT (atoms) versus Cr2O3 (wt %) in the spinels from the PSL (blue) BGB S3 (green) and K/T (red) layer.  Modified from [4]. Conclusions: Low Fe3+/FeT ratios in the spinels from the PSL are more consistent with formation under oxygen-limited conditions, similar to the mid-Archean S3 spherule layer.  The ratios are significantly different than all Phanerozoic impact spinels, which have much higher Fe3+/FeT ratios.  This is a critical time at the boundary between the Archean and the Proterozoic when oxygen levels may have been rising in the atmosphere.   The overall composition of the spinels in the PSL and S3 layer are significantly different and likely reflect different starting compositions. These spinels crystallized within a melt droplet that condensed from the vaporized mix of target rock and bolide [4]. PGE analyses indicate a possible bolide composition of an L or LL chondrite [5] whereas the S3 layer was likely a CV chondrite [6]. Further work may indicate important information into the composition of the crustal target material as well. References: [1] Hassler, S. W., Simonson, B. M., Sumner, D. Y., Bodin, L.
