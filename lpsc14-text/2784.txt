Introduction: Lobate debris aprons (LDA) are Martian surface features first interpreted as ice-related due to their characteristic convex-up topographic profiles and viscous flow morphologies [1, 2]. They are typically found extending from the base of escarpments and mesas in both the northern and southern mid-latitudes, particularly in the high-relief dichotomy boundary region between Mars's northern lowlands and the highlands comprising the rest of the planet. Orbital radar sounding of LDAs by the Shallow Radar (SHARAD) instrument on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) has revealed unambiguous subsurface reflectors, analysis of which has shown that many of these LDAs are composed of nearly pure water ice insulated under a blanket of dust and rock debris âˆ¼1-10m thick [3]. Previous studies in geomorphology [4], climate modeling [5], flow modeling [6], and radar stratigraphy [7] have shown LDAs to be remnants of multiple obliquitydriven glacial cycles on Mars and thus valuable indicators of change in Amazonian palaeoclimate. It remains to be shown, however, whether the character of these cycles is dominated by regional ice sheet formation and retreat or smaller, localized glacial deposits. Assessment of regional variability in the LDA population may help answer this question. Figure 1: MOLA-derived map of Deuteronilus/Protonilus Mensae with analyzed SHARAD ground tracks mapped as black lines, candidate subsurface reflectors under LDAs plotted in yellow. Selected LDA in eastern and western Deuteronilus are highlighted in red boxes. Study Region and Methodology: SHARAD data acquired over LDAs in the dichotomy boundary region of Deuteronilus Mensae exhibit a spectrum in the strength of observed subsurface reflectors, from strong and clear to more weak and ambiguous or even nonexistent returns. In general, western Deuteronilus is dominated by Figure 2: Selected LDA in western (A) and eastern (B) Deuteronilus displayed in daytime THEMIS data. SHARAD ground tracks displayed as dashed yellow lines; example radargrams (747202000 in A and 715502000 in B) are highlighted. HiRISE footprints are displayed by red boxes and flow-parallel topographic profiles extracted from HRSC and MOLA elevation data are displayed by blue lines. unambiguous returns, while eastern Deuteronilus contains relatively few, weak returns. In this study, we explore the possibility that all LDAs contain a basal icerock interface, yet the eastern LDAs do not permit the radar to observe the interface via one or both of two proposed mechanisms. The first mechanism is a difference in surface properties, such as roughness, that may prevent radar penetration in the eastern LDAs. The second mechanism is a difference of internal composition, which could impact the attenuation of the radar signal. Variations in the dust-ice fraction could cause this, and would also be significant in determining the ice rheology, and hence the flow history and resultant topographic profile. We test for the first mechanism by using highresolution imagery obtained from the MRO HiRISE and CTX camera systems to characterize LDA surfaces   2at each site and compare surface roughness estimates, albedo, and geomorphic characteristics. Correlation of these properties with SHARAD data may imply regional differences in surficial radar properties. Topography data obtained from Mars Express' High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) and Mars Global Surveyor's Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) are used to extract flow-parallel topographic profiles to compare between sites and against idealized flow models [8, 9]. Correlation of differences in the convexness of observed flow-line profiles with differences in SHARAD data may imply regional differences in internal radar properties, testing for the second proposed mechanism. Figure 3: SHARAD data (top panel) acquired over the study sites in western (a, line 747202000) and eastern (b, line 715502000) Deuteronilus Mensae. Middle panel is simulated surface returns/clutter over the same region, with nadir ground-track MOLA topography highlighted in yellow. Bottom panel is CTX/HiRISE imagery of the regions of interest with the nadir ground-tracks of the SHARAD data mapped in yellow. Indicated by the green arrow is an unambiguous subsurface reflector in the western LDA; no subsurface reflectors are found in the eastern LDA. Note the abundance of 'knobs' rising out of the eastern LDA complex, as well as the much weaker LDA surface reflection. Preliminary Results and Discussion: Preliminary results indicate that the selected eastern LDA complex exhibited larger scale surface modification features than the western LDA, with depressions reaching an order of 1-2km in diameter. Additionally, 'knobs' of rocky material at sub-mesa height are much more common in the eastern complex, where they are seen rising above or just at the LDA surface, diverting LDA flow and causing topographic depressions in their down-slope wake. These differing structures, as well as differing geologic ages of adjacent highland surfaces between the east (more ancient Noachian geology) and west (less ancient Hesperian geology) could possibly contribute to a change in debris cover characteristics such as roughness. The proposed mechanism of radar scattering off surface debris may also be supported by the fact that initial reflections off LDA surfaces on the eastern complex are much weaker than on the western complex. Both LDAs exhibit some evidence in the topography and imagery data for multiple overlying lobes of material, implying a complex stratigraphy which is not directly evident in the radar data yet may play a role in the differing radar observations. Figure 4: The mean normalized topographic profiles from HRSC data for the nine selected profiles on each of the eastern and western Deuteronilus LDAs are plotted here against the results of a perfectly plastic model run to steady state [9]. Note that the eastern LDA appears to be generally less convex than the western LDA. The mean normalized topographic flow profile on the eastern LDA complex was found to be generally less convex than that of the western LDA complex (see figure 4) in both HRSC and MOLA data. This could be due to differing debris cover characteristics, resulting in varied topographic modification due to near-surface ice sublimation. This could also be due to differing ice rheologies between the two complexes, pointing to the need for future efforts in flow modeling and radar attenuation studies to constrain differences in dust-ice content across the LDA population.
