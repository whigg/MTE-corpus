However, althoughit has been proposed that some meteorites come fromnear-Earth asteroids (e.g.,  [2]) there is so far no confirmed data on the cosmic-ray exposure (CRE) ages ofthe surfaces of near-Earth asteroids, which might provide us with information on the dynamical life-time ofthese bodies. In this study, we aim to measure the He,Ne or Xe concentrations and isotopic compositions ofolivine-rich particles (RA-QD02-0035, -0049-1, -00494, -0051,  -0158, -0167,  -0187, -0197 and -0209) returned by the JAXA space mission Hayabusa from thesurface of near-Earth asteroid (25143)  Itokawa,  allocated to Busemann et al. [3] (7 grains) and Fujiya et al.[4] (2 grains). One of our primary goals is the determination of a CRE age for individual particles, using cosmic-ray produced  3He and  21Ne. This requires a noblegas instrument with a very high sensitivity, but also avery precise determination of the grain masses. Otherwise, the uncertainty of the CRE age will be dominatedby the mass error, which, for such small grains, can easily reach or  exceed 100% (at  microbalance errors  of~0.1-0.2  μg).  We have therefore  chosen to  image allour  grains with Synchrotron  Radiation X-ray Tomographic  Microscopy  (SRXTM)  to  determine  precisegrain volumes, and micro-Raman spectroscopy [5] andFTIR to nondestructively determine the mineral composition and thereby, density [3].Table 1: Grain volumes, densities and massesGrain Volume(μm3)#Fo Density(kg/m3)Mass(μg)0035 70700±1800 61±10 3710±120 0.262±0.0110049-1 442700±5900 58±10 3740±110 1.656±0.0530049-4 96400±1300 60±9 3720±200 0.359±0.0110158* 23500±1000 72±8 3580±90 0.084±0.0040187* 17800±900 60±5 3720±60 0.066±0.0040197* 30700±1600   70±10 3610±120 0.111±0.007* SRXTM, Raman analysis done in N2 (sealed capillaries)Methods: SRXTM analysis was done at the TOMCAT  beamline  of  the  Swiss  Light  Source  at  PaulScherrer Institute (PSI) in Switzerland. Six of the ninegrains (Table 1)  have been mounted in  ϕ =  500  μmboron-glass capillaries.  Grains 0158,  0187 and 0197,which have never been exposed to  the Earth's atmosphere, were mounted, and the capillaries sealed airtight,within an N2-filled glove box at the University of Manchester. At PSI, we used X-ray energies of 10 and 20keV. Tomographic reconstructions  were carried out ona 30-node Linux PC cluster [6]. The cubic voxel size ofthe reconstructed images is 325 nm. The He, Ne analysis was done on the compressor-source noble gas massspectrometer at ETH Zurich connected to an ultra-lowblank extraction line [7], and measured according to aprotocol by [8]. The noble gases were extracted fromthe grains in a  single temperature  step  using meltingwith an IR-laser  (λ=1064 nm). Details on calibrationand most recent  sensitivities are reported  in [9].  Thecomposition-based  production  rates  of  cosmogenic21Ne have been calculated using [10] for galactic cosmic-rays (GCR) and [11] for solar cosmic-rays (SCR).Results: Volumes between 17800±900 μm3 (0187)and 442700±5900 μm3 (0049-1) have been determinedfor six of the seven grains (Table 1). For details on thevolume determination, see [12].  The determination ofdensity was done using the #Fo number measured withFigure 1: Neon three isotope diagram of Hayabusa grains.1247.pdf

Raman spectroscopy (58±10 to 72±8 [5]), and all errors were propagated to  the masses, resulting in finalgrain masses between 0.066±0.004 μg and 1.656±0.053μg. So far, only one grain allocated to the Busemann etal. [3] consortium, 0035, has been analyzed for its He,Ne concentration and isotopic composition. The resultsof the noble gas analysis for this grain are given in Table 2.  The contribution of cosmogenic  21Ne is clearlyresolved  (see  Ne  three-isotope  diagram  in  Fig.  1),which in combination with the mass and the calculatedGCR and SCR production rates yields the very first resolved (= not an upper limit) CRE age for a Hayabusagrain, of 1.5±0.4 Ma, if the grain has been irradiated ina depth larger than ~1 cm (see Fig. 2). This age is compatible with the upper limit of ~8 Ma measured in threegrains, as given by [13].  Two  additional grains, allocated to PI W. Fujiya [4], were measured for He, Ne aswell, but since their volumes and compositions are notprecisely known, their associated ages have large errors- nevertheless, their CRE ages are larger than zero, andcompatible with both the 1.5 Ma age of grain 0035, aswell as the upper limit given by [13]. The data pointsfor all new grains are shown in Fig. 1.Table 2: He, Ne results for three Itokawa grainsGrain 3He/4He(10-4)4He/20Ne20Ne/22Ne21Ne/22Ne22Ne 21Necos(10-8 cc/g)0035 4.57(3) 301(1) 13.3(2) 0.038(1) 64.8(11) 0.40(11)0167* 2.80(2) 73(1) 13.0(1) 0.033(1) 790(6) ~0.6(5)0209* 7.3(16) 6.5(16) 10.8(19) 0.038(6) 47(6) ~0.4(3)cc/g = cm3 STP/g = 2.687 × 1019 atoms/g. *Grains grantedto PI W. Fujiya (masses estimated as ~0.2 μg, factor 2 uncertainty not included in 21Necos error for these 2 grains).Discussion: The  He,  Ne  inventories  of  all threegrains are dominated by solar-wind gases. Grain 0035has the most "pristine" or unfractionated (trapped) He,Ne composition (similar to the composition of the solarwind  as  sampled,  e.g.,  by the  Genesis  probe  [15]),while grain 0167 has 3He/4He,  4He/20Ne, and 20Ne/22Neratios  suggesting a  more  fractionated  (heavier)  solarwind  composition.  Grain  0209  possibly has  a  largeblank contribution from the gold foil. We do not haveprecise information on the original burial depth of thegrains within the regolith. Given the geometry of thesampling method,  an  origin in up  to  ~10  cm depthseems plausible.  For  any original burial depth  largerthan ~1 cm, SCR contributions are negligible, and theCRE age is consistent with 1.5 Ma over the rest of thedepth range (Fig. 2). A likely CRE age of 1.5±0.4 Mafor the surface of Itokawa (type LL [14]) is very shortcompared  to  the  CRE ages  of  most  LL chrondrites,which are typically 5-50 Ma, with a peak in the CREage histogram at ~15 Ma [1]. There are only two LLchondrites with similar CRE ages: Appley Bridge (LL6;1.5±0.5  Ma  [16])  and  Chelyabinsk  (LL5;  ~1.2  Ma[17]). Interestingly, Itokawa has a similar low-inclination orbit as Chelyabinsk [18], although the aphelion ofthe latter is in the asteroid belt, while the one of the former is between Mars and Earth. No orbit is known forAppley Bridge. It  seems unlikely that Chelyabinsk andAppley Bridge would derive directly from Itokawa, butall three materials might derive from the same precursorasteroid that experienced a surface resetting event ~1.5Ma ago (which also ejected some material into Earthcrossing orbits), either in the main asteroid belt, or during a close flyby at one of the terrestrial planets [18].References: [1] Marti, K. and Graf, T., 1992.
