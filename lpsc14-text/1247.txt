Introduction: The exposure times of meteorites to highly energetic galactic and solar cosmic-rays in space (between release from a shielded position within their parent asteroid or planet, until entering the Earth's atmosphere,  where  they are  shielded again)  have been studied by many authors (e.g. [1]). However, although it has been proposed that some meteorites come from near-Earth asteroids (e.g.,  [2]) there is so far no confirmed data on the cosmic-ray exposure (CRE) ages of the surfaces of near-Earth asteroids, which might provide us with information on the dynamical life-time of these bodies. In this study, we aim to measure the He, Ne or Xe concentrations and isotopic compositions of olivine-rich particles (RA-QD02-0035, -0049-1, -00494, -0051,  -0158, -0167,  -0187, -0197 and -0209) returned by the JAXA space mission Hayabusa from the surface of near-Earth asteroid (25143)  Itokawa,  allocated to Busemann et al. [3] (7 grains) and Fujiya et al. [4] (2 grains). One of our primary goals is the determination of a CRE age for individual particles, using cosmic-ray produced  3He and  21Ne. This requires a noble gas instrument with a very high sensitivity, but also a very precise determination of the grain masses. Otherwise, the uncertainty of the CRE age will be dominated by the mass error, which, for such small grains, can easily reach or  exceed 100% (at  microbalance errors  of ~0.1-0.2  μg).  We have therefore  chosen to  image all our  grains with Synchrotron  Radiation X-ray Tomographic  Microscopy  (SRXTM)  to  determine  precise grain volumes, and micro-Raman spectroscopy [5] and FTIR to nondestructively determine the mineral composition and thereby, density [3].

Six of the nine grains (Table 1)  have been mounted in  ϕ =  500  μm boron-glass capillaries.  Grains 0158,  0187 and 0197, which have never been exposed to  the Earth's atmosphere, were mounted, and the capillaries sealed airtight, within an N2-filled glove box at the University of Manchester. At PSI, we used X-ray energies of 10 and 20 keV. Tomographic reconstructions  were carried out on a 30-node Linux PC cluster [6]. The cubic voxel size of the reconstructed images is 325 nm. The He, Ne analysis was done on the compressor-source noble gas mass spectrometer at ETH Zurich connected to an ultra-lowblank extraction line [7], and measured according to a protocol by [8]. The noble gases were extracted from the grains in a  single temperature  step  using melting with an IR-laser  (λ=1064 nm). Details on calibration and most recent  sensitivities are reported  in [9].  The composition-based  production  rates  of  cosmogenic 21Ne have been calculated using [10] for galactic cosmic-rays (GCR) and [11] for solar cosmic-rays (SCR). Results: Volumes between 17800±900 μm3 (0187) and 442700±5900 μm3 (0049-1) have been determined for six of the seven grains (Table 1). For details on the volume determination, see [12].  The determination of density was done using the #Fo number measured with Figure 1: Neon three isotope diagram of Hayabusa grains.  Raman spectroscopy (58±10 to 72±8 [5]), and all errors were propagated to  the masses, resulting in final grain masses between 0.066±0.004 μg and 1.656±0.053 μg. So far, only one grain allocated to the Busemann et al. [3] consortium, 0035, has been analyzed for its He, Ne concentration and isotopic composition. The results of the noble gas analysis for this grain are given in Table 2.  The contribution of cosmogenic  21Ne is clearly resolved  (see  Ne  three-isotope  diagram  in  Fig.  1), which in combination with the mass and the calculated GCR and SCR production rates yields the very first resolved (= not an upper limit) CRE age for a Hayabusa grain, of 1.5±0.4 Ma, if the grain has been irradiated in a depth larger than ~1 cm (see Fig. 2). This age is compatible with the upper limit of ~8 Ma measured in three grains, as given by [13].  Two  additional grains, allocated to PI W. Fujiya [4], were measured for He, Ne as well, but since their volumes and compositions are not precisely known, their associated ages have large errors - nevertheless, their CRE ages are larger than zero, and compatible with both the 1.5 Ma age of grain 0035, as well as the upper limit given by [13]. The data points for all new grains are shown in Fig. 1.

Fujiya (masses estimated as ~0.2 μg, factor 2 uncertainty not included in 21Necos error for these 2 grains). Discussion: The  He,  Ne  inventories  of  all three grains are dominated by solar-wind gases. Grain 0035 has the most "pristine" or unfractionated (trapped) He, Ne composition (similar to the composition of the solar wind  as  sampled,  e.g.,  by the  Genesis  probe  [15]), while grain 0167 has 3He/4He,  4He/20Ne, and 20Ne/22Ne ratios  suggesting a  more  fractionated  (heavier)  solar wind  composition.  Grain  0209  possibly has  a  large blank contribution from the gold foil. We do not have precise information on the original burial depth of the grains within the regolith. Given the geometry of the sampling method,  an  origin in up  to  ~10  cm depth seems plausible.  For  any original burial depth  larger than ~1 cm, SCR contributions are negligible, and the CRE age is consistent with 1.5 Ma over the rest of the depth range (Fig. 2). A likely CRE age of 1.5±0.4 Ma for the surface of Itokawa (type LL [14]) is very short compared  to  the  CRE ages  of  most  LL chrondrites, which are typically 5-50 Ma, with a peak in the CRE age histogram at ~15 Ma [1]. There are only two LL chondrites with similar CRE ages: Appley Bridge (LL6; 1.5±0.5  Ma  [16])  and  Chelyabinsk  (LL5;  ~1.2  Ma [17]). Interestingly, Itokawa has a similar low-inclination orbit as Chelyabinsk [18], although the aphelion of the latter is in the asteroid belt, while the one of the former is between Mars and Earth. No orbit is known for Appley Bridge. It  seems unlikely that Chelyabinsk and Appley Bridge would derive directly from Itokawa, but all three materials might derive from the same precursor asteroid that experienced a surface resetting event ~1.5 Ma ago (which also ejected some material into Earthcrossing orbits), either in the main asteroid belt, or during a close flyby at one of the terrestrial planets [18].
