Asteroids are solar system remnants from the planetary formation period and the only direct information we have on the conditions and processes during this epoch.  By characterizing the mineralogical and chemical composition of asteroids we can better constrain the formation and geochemical evolution of the inner planets [1, 2]. Remote sensing is the primary means for studying asteroids.  Sample return missions, such as Hayabusa [3], will be few and far between, given their cost and complexity.  We rely primarily on asteroid spectral reflectance measurements so as to determine their mineralogical and chemical composition.  Links have also been made and debated between various meteorite classes and asteroid types [4, 5].  If such relationships can be confirmed, then meteorites would provide a low cost asteroid sample set for study.  However, a major issue in establishing this link is the spectral differences between meteorite samples measured in the lab and asteroid reflectance spectra measured remotely.  The most commonly invoked explanation for these differences is that the surfaces of asteroids are space weathered [2, 5, 6]. Surface Alteration: Space weathering is a generic term to cover all physical and chemical processes that alter the surface optical properties of rocky, airless bodies.  The dominant mechanisms are believed to be (1) irradiation by solar wind ions and cosmic rays and (2) meteoritic and micro-meteoritic bombardment.  Both mechanisms create nanometer scale particles, which are believed to be the primary source of the spectral alterations [6].  Examination of the samples returned by Hayabusa shows that on asteroids this nanophase material includes sulfur-bearing Fe- (and Mg-) rich particles as well as metallic Fe [3, 7]. Space weathering affects spectral signatures by darkening (lowering the spectral albedo), reducing spectral contrast (broadening and diminishing the strength of absorption features), creating spectral reddening at visible-near-infrared (VNIR) wavelengths (increasing the spectral slope with increasing wavelength), and creating spectral bluing at ultraviolet wavelengths (decreasing the spectral slope with increasing wavelength) [8].  Unambiguous evidence returned from such missions as Galileo and the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) shows that space weathering alters the reflectance spectra of asteroids [4, 5, 9, 10].  Space weathering has been most extensively studied in lunar materials.  However, the evidence strongly suggests that the mechanism dominating the space weathering of asteroid surfaces differs from the lunar case [2, 11].  The dominant mechanism for weathering asteroid surfaces is believed to be solar-wind ion irradiation [5, 12, 13] whereas in the lunar case micormeteoritic bombardment is believed to play a stronger role (though studies of lunar swirls has called this into question) [14, 15].  Spectra of very young (< 1 My old) asteroids from collisional asteroid families show that most spectral changes take place over short time intervals of less than 1 My [13].  Comparisons of VNIR spectral slope with family member age indicte that ion irradiation is rapid and dominates early in the surface history of an asteroid, as compared to slope changes due to micrometeoroid impacts, which are gradual and dominate later [13, 16]. Laboratory Studies: While laboratory simulations of space weathering have demonstrated changes in the general direction required to alter spectra from unweathered meteorite samples to weathered asteroid observations [6, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23], many open questions remain  and we still lack a comprehensive understanding of the space weathering process as it relates to asteroids.  To help address these issues,  we propose a new series of laboratory studies into space weathering of  asteroids by solar wind ions.  We will focus on solar wind ions for two reasons.  First, the ion flux in the solar wind is many orders of magnitude larger than that of cosmic rays [24, 25].  Second, recent laboratory work suggests that asteroid weathering due to solar wind ions proceeds more rapidly than that due to micrometeorites [13, 26].  Specifically, we will explore the proposed connection of ordinary chondrite (OC) meteorites to S-type asteroids.  Gaffey [2] has reviewed the diversity and mechanisms of asteroid space weathering and concludes that they are still not well enough understood to determine the validity of the proposed connection [2].  We will address this by a combination of laboratory simulations of solar wind space weathering; detailed sample characterization, special sample preparation,  handling, and ultimately archiving of the irradiated samples for future study; and analysis of archival spectral data for OCs and for S-type asteroids.  We will use spectral analysis tools frequently applied to asteroid observations [11, 27] to analyze the irradiated samples and archival spectral data.  Mapping the spectral parameters from archival meteorite and asteroid data, we will use the changes in spectral parameters produced by our laboratory simulations in order to determine if a space-weathering pathway exists linking meteorite classes with asteroid types via solar wind irradiation.
