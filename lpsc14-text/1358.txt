Introduction: The neutron spectrometer LEND (Lunar Exploration Neutron Detector) [1] launched into lunar orbit on-board the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) mission [2] has a primary goal to test for the presence of hydrogen in regolith of the Moon's polar regions. Due to the presence of a neutron collimator module LEND is able to provide a spatial resolution of ~10 km from 50 km orbit altitude. Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs) in circumpolar regions of the Moon were a primary target of the LEND investigation. It was found that only few of these spots indicated statistically significant evidence of the presence of hydrogen in the regolith. On the other hand, there were several cases where hydrogen was significantly detected in sunlit areas [3, 4] (see Figure 1.). Layering conditions for hydrogen to be preserved in these areas should be covered by a dessicated (or 'dry') regolith layer. We are performing a multi-instrument data analysis to determine the lower limit of hydrogen concentration and minimal depth of its presence. Data analysis: Three sets of data are used in this study: 1) Map of the collimated epithermal neutron counting rate of the LEND instrument provides neutron suppression regions and estimates of hydrogen concentration in the regolith, 2) topography and surface illumination data from Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) provides surface relief and PSR boundaries information, 3) Polar Resource Products of the Diviner experiment on-board LRO [5] provides an estimation of the depth to which hydrogen rich regolith may exist for a long time without evaporation. Properties of the regolith are investigated by comparison with the LEND measured neutron suppressions and numerical modeling of epithermal neutron flux at LRO orbit.  The statistical uncertainty of neutron suppression regions decreases as the observation time of the LEND instrument increases (see Figure 2 - 4.). Thus we use LEND data gathered during four plus years of the LRO mission. Obtained results of this multi-instrument analysis will be presented. References: [1] Mitrofanov I. G. et al.

Statistically significant suppression of the neutron flux relative to the average flux (1.7 counts per second) measured at -70° - -75° is taken as evidence for hydrogen presence in regolith.
