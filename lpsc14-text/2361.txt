 THE LUNAR EXOSPHERE-SURFACE CONNECTION: LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS OF APOLLO SOIL COMPOSITION AND SECONDARY ION EJECTION.  C. A. Dukes1 and R. A. Baragiola1, 1University of Virginia, Laboratory of Atomic and Surface Physics, Charlottesville, VA 22904, USA [cdukes@virginia.edu].  Introduction:  The composition of the lunar exosphere is derived from many sources: photo- and electron stimulated desorption, emission of radiation products, thermal desorption, meteorite impact, solar wind sputtering of neutral atoms and secondary ions. Secondary ion/atom emission is a physical process which occurs when energetic (>20eV) primary ions impact atoms on a surface, transferring energy such that one (or more) of the surface atoms or molecules are ejected. While most species are sputtered as neutrals, a typically small but significant number is ejected as ions. For measurements of the exosphere, the abundance of sputtered ion species is important, since ion mass spectrometers have much higher sensitivities than their neutral cousins, allowing the detection of both primary and trace species. Observations of neutral atoms in the lunar exosphere have been limited to Ar, He, H2, Na and K [1-3], while ion measurements from AMPTE, WIND, and SELENE have found Ar+, Na+, K+, Si+, Al+, C+, and O+ plus solar wind ions [4-6]. Laboratory simulations of ion impact on lunar soil simulants suggest many additional ion species may exist in the lunar exosphere [7].  To relate secondary ion emission to surface composition we performed experiments using 4 keV He+ on two Apollo soils (rather than simulants) where we measure secondary ion spectra and elemental surface composition in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV).  Experiment: Two mature lunar soils, Apollo 16 highland 62231 (Is/FeO=91) and Apollo 11 mare 10084 (Is/FeO=78), were irradiated with 4 keV He+ in an UHV chamber (<10-9 Torr) while positive secondary ion mass spectra (SIMS) were collected at ejected ion energies from 2 to 36 eV. Uncompacted soil was fixed to the Cu sample mount using UHV-compatible carbon tape. 4 keV He+ ions were produced in an electron-bombardment type gun directed 42° from the sample normal, and secondary ions collected at 60° from the normal (in the forward direction). However, since the soil surface is topographically irregular, local impact and collection angles varied. Incident ion flux was ~2 x 1013 He+ cm-2 s-1, measured with an in situ Faraday cup.  Secondary ions were collected by a Hiden Analytical EQS high-transmission 45-degree sector-field ionenergy analyzer and quadrupole mass spectrometer with a mass range of 1-200 amu for ion energies between 1 and 1000 eV. The sample surface was charge neutralized during data collection using low energy (<2 eV) electrons. Mass spectra were obtained from 0.4 to 100 amu, at a resolution of 0.1 amu. Each spectrum was taken in less than 10 minutes, and averaged over 10 cycles.  The soil surface composition was measured by Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a PHI 560 double-pass electron energy analyzer at a fixed pass energy of 200eV and Al X-rays (1486.6 eV) [8]. XPS provides a quantitative surface composition of the soil outermost ~5 nm, with a sensitivity of ~0.1% (atomic percent). An electron flood gun was used to suppress surface charge during data acquisition.  Results:  XPS analysis of the lunar highland soil 62231 (Fig 1) shows an atomic composition: 62.5% O, 14.2% Si, 13.1%Al, 5.3%Ca, 2.5%Mg, 1.9%Fe, 0.2%Ti, 0.3%Na, and trace Mn. The carbon signal was excluded in this analysis, since it was assumed to be terrestrial in origin, stemming from atmospheric carbon and/or from small exposed areas of the carbon tape. We note that the surface composition, which can vary from the bulk composition due to surface segregation and diffusion of species, is consistent with the published bulk composition for highland soil 62231 [9] and the adjacent soil sample 62241 [10].1200 1000 800 600 400 200 0104105MgKLLCaLMMMg2pNa1sMg1s CKLL  Intensity (Counts)Binding Energy (eV)O2sAl2pAl2sSi2pSi2sMgKLLC1sFe2pCa2pCa2sO1sTi2pFeLMMOKLL Figure 1: XPS survey spectrum for highland soil 62231.  Mass spectra for secondary ions ejected by 4 keV He+ were collected as a function of secondary ion energy. Ion spectra for 6 eV (Fig 2) and 24 eV (Fig 3) show that while the components remain the same for ions of varying energy, their ratios do not.

of the spectrometer. Total spectral count rates for the highland (and mare) soil maximized around 24 eV. Alkalis, either intrinsic or surface segregated, are ejected at higher rates than elements of comparable surface concentration, due to their low ionization potential, which enhances their signal relative to other species. In addition, we find the signal from higher mass ions is enhanced by collecting secondary ions at higher-energy.  10 20 30 40 50 6010100Energy: 6eVFe+  Intensity / cpsMass / amuCa+K/NaO+Si+Al+Mg+Na+ Figure 2: Secondary ion mass spectrum for 6 eV ions ejected from highland soil 62231 by 4 keV He+.  10 20 30 40 50 6010100SiO+K/NaO+  Intensity / cpsMass / amu Ca++Fe+Ca+Na+Si+Al+Mg+Energy: 24eV Figure 3: Secondary ion mass spectrum for 24 eV ions ejected by 4keV He+ from lunar highland soil 62231.  A similar comparison between surface composition and secondary ion emission was done with lunar mare soil 10084. XPS analysis gave a surface composition: 58.4%O, 14.9% Si, 8.2%Al, 5.0%Fe, 5.3%Ca, 4.2%Mg, 1.7%Ti, 0.3%Mn, and 2.1%Na, again consistent with the measured bulk composition [11]. Secondary ion mass spectra from the mare soil reflect the higher Ti content and lower feldspar concentration of this material, with increased Mg and Fe signals relative to Na and Ca (Fig 4).  10 20 30 40 50 6010100Fe+  Intensity / cpsMass / amuEnergy: 6 eVTi+Ca+NaO+Si+Al+Mg+Na+Ca++ Figure 4: Secondary ion mass spectrum for 6 eV ions ejected from mare soil 10084 by 4 keV He+.      Conclusion: This study demonstrates that appreciable numbers of secondary ions ejected by the solar wind type ions from lunar soils can be measured in minutes in the laboratory, and by extension observable on the Moon. While SIMS spectra presented here do not directly reproduce the lunar surface composition, the combination of laboratory SIMS and XPS data should enable the extraction of quantitative information about the surface from a spacecraft that measures exospheric ion abundances.        The secondary ion spectra measured in this study remain strongly representative of the lunar exospheric composition and suggests the existence of Ca+, Mg+, Ti+, and Fe+, as well as molecular NaO+ and SiO+ in the lunar environment. We note that, although oxygen is sputtered from the surface, O+ ions are an insignificant fraction of the SIMS spectra. References: [1] Hodges Jr. R. R. (1973) JGR, 78, 8055-8064.
