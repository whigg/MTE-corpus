Introduction: Organic matter (om) in the fine-grained matrix of primitive meteorites has traditionally been studied in extracted form, where the insoluble organic matter (iom) was obtained by dissolving away the surrounding material [1]. Previous in situ studies have shown that meteoritic om can occur in inclusions of up to 10 µm [2, 3, 4]. Those studies focussed on the very primitive CR chondrites Queen Alexandra Range (QUE) 99177 [5, 6] and Graves Nunataks (GRA) 95229. In this study, we present the results of a search for similar µm-sized om inclusions in Murchison, a CM2 carbonaceous chondrite. The data presented here are the first results obtained with the newly inaugurated Cameca nanosims 50L at Academia Sinica in Taiwan. Experimental: A 1 cm sample of the Murchison meteorite was pressed into indium, polished, and carbon coated. 12C12C-, 13C12C-, 14N12C-, 15N12C-, 28Si-, 29Si-, and 30Si- secondary ions, produced by incidence of a ∼1 pA Cs+ beam, were measured in parallel. 22 Images (23 × 23 µm, 256 × 256 pixels, 4 ms per pixel dwell time, 15 iterations per image) were recorded in automated chain mode. Results and discussion: Figure 1 shows two maps of Murchison meteorite as obtained by nanosims. The top panel displays the map in 12C2 counts on a log scale. The various shades of blue and red show that carbon is present throughout the matrix as a fine-grained material at varying levels of abundance, except where crystalline grains have replaced the matrix (black areas; the composition of these grains is not known from this measurement). The yellow to white coloured areas show regions with a higher carbon abundance. In the bottom panel of figure 1, the 15N/14N ratio is shown (measured as 12C15N/12C14N). Several of the areas that display a high carbon abundance in the top panel, also appear in the bottom panel, but not all. For example, in the second image from the right, bottom row, there is a feature (two round spheres) with a high carbon abundance. No nitrogen was detected in the same location, which may indicate a grain of carbonate, graphite, or metal carbide, although not SiC, since no silicon was detected. 17971 4434 1093 269 66 16 41 log 12C2 1500 1200 900 600 300 0-300 -600 -900 δ15N (‰) CBA Figure 1: Murchison meteorite nanosims map in 12C2 (top, log scale) and δ15N (bottom, ‰). Each image is 23 × 23 µm, and separated by 2 µm. Supra-µm-sized, organic, carbon-rich inclusions, candidates for further investigation, are circled in green.   The three areas in figure 1, bottom panel, circled in green, display a high carbon and nitrogen abundance, indicating that those inclusions are likely organic matter. They range in size from 10 µm (C) to 4 µm (B). The δ15N of these inclusions ranges from −15 ± 9.5 ‰ (C), to +31 ± 19 ‰ (A). The errors on the 15N abundances are large because of low 15N counts; for better statistics a longer integration time is needed, which would have prevented us from covering a large area. The δ15N values obtained here for the inclusions are nonetheless indicative of om, and are close to the δ15N value previously reported for Murchison's bulk iom: −1.0 ± 0.4 ‰ [1]. Outside the large carbon-rich inclusions, 90 smaller (≥ 5 pixels) 15N hot spots have been found, ranging in δ15N value from −380 ‰ to +1100 ‰. Again, the values are associated with high errors, but are indicative of the presence of small grains with a wide range in 15N enrichments or depletions. Conclusion: We have reported the discovery of large (several µm), organic, carbonrich inclusions in the CM2 meteorite Murchison. These inclusions are similar to those previously found in CR chondrites QUE 99177 and GRA 95229 [3, 4]. The 15N isotopic composition of these inclusions is variable, but close the bulk δ15N value previously measured for Murchison's iom [1]. Future research will target these inclusions for fib-liftout and further analysis. This work also represents the first results of a newly established laboratory for cosmochemistry and the recently inaugurated nanosims at the Academia Sinica Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics.
