SURFACE MAPPING OF CARBONACEOUS CHONDRITE MURCHISON INSEARCH OF ORGANIC CARBON INCLUSIONS. Z. Peeters1,2, B. Liebig1, M.C. Liu1;1 Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Roosevelt Road, sec. 4, no. 1, Taipei10617, Taiwan R.O.C; 2 zan@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw.Introduction: Organic matter (om) in thefine-grained matrix of primitive meteorites hastraditionally been studied in extracted form,where the insoluble organic matter (iom) wasobtained by dissolving away the surroundingmaterial [1]. Previous in situ studies haveshown that meteoritic om can occur in inclusions of up to 10 µm [2, 3, 4]. Those studies focussed on the very primitive CR chondrites Queen Alexandra Range (QUE) 99177[5, 6] and Graves Nunataks (GRA) 95229. Inthis study, we present the results of a searchfor similar µm-sized om inclusions in Murchison, a CM2 carbonaceous chondrite. The datapresented here are the first results obtainedwith the newly inaugurated Cameca nanosims50L at Academia Sinica in Taiwan.Experimental: A 1 cm sample of theMurchison meteorite was pressed into indium, polished, and carbon coated. 12C12C-,13C12C-, 14N12C-, 15N12C-, 28Si-, 29Si-, and30Si- secondary ions, produced by incidence ofa ∼1 pA Cs+ beam, were measured in parallel.22 Images (23 × 23 µm, 256 × 256 pixels, 4 msper pixel dwell time, 15 iterations per image)were recorded in automated chain mode.Results and discussion: Figure 1 showstwo maps of Murchison meteorite as obtainedby nanosims. The top panel displays the mapin 12C2 counts on a log scale. The variousshades of blue and red show that carbon ispresent throughout the matrix as a fine-grainedmaterial at varying levels of abundance, exceptwhere crystalline grains have replaced the matrix (black areas; the composition of these grainsis not known from this measurement). The yellow to white coloured areas show regions witha higher carbon abundance.In the bottom panel of figure 1, the 15N/14Nratio is shown (measured as 12C15N/12C14N).Several of the areas that display a high carbonabundance in the top panel, also appear in thebottom panel, but not all. For example, in thesecond image from the right, bottom row, thereis a feature (two round spheres) with a high carbon abundance. No nitrogen was detected inthe same location, which may indicate a grainof carbonate, graphite, or metal carbide, although not SiC, since no silicon was detected.1797144341093269661641log 12C2150012009006003000-300-600-900δ15N (‰)CBAFigure 1: Murchison meteorite nanosims map in 12C2 (top, log scale) and δ15N (bottom, ‰).

The three areas in figure 1, bottom panel,circled in green, display a high carbon and nitrogen abundance, indicating that those inclusions are likely organic matter. They range insize from 10 µm (C) to 4 µm (B). The δ15Nof these inclusions ranges from −15 ± 9.5 ‰(C), to +31 ± 19 ‰ (A). The errors on the15N abundances are large because of low 15Ncounts; for better statistics a longer integrationtime is needed, which would have prevented usfrom covering a large area. The δ15N valuesobtained here for the inclusions are nonetheless indicative of om, and are close to the δ15Nvalue previously reported for Murchison's bulkiom: −1.0± 0.4 ‰ [1].Outside the large carbon-rich inclusions, 90smaller (≥ 5 pixels) 15N hot spots have beenfound, ranging in δ15N value from −380 ‰to +1100 ‰. Again, the values are associatedwith high errors, but are indicative of the presence of small grains with a wide range in 15Nenrichments or depletions.Conclusion: We have reported the discovery of large (several µm), organic, carbonrich inclusions in the CM2 meteorite Murchison. These inclusions are similar to those previously found in CR chondrites QUE 99177 andGRA 95229 [3, 4]. The 15N isotopic composition of these inclusions is variable, but closethe bulk δ15N value previously measured forMurchison's iom [1]. Future research will target these inclusions for fib-liftout and furtheranalysis. This work also represents the firstresults of a newly established laboratory forcosmochemistry and the recently inauguratednanosims at the Academia Sinica Institute forAstronomy and Astrophysics.References: [1] Alexander C.
