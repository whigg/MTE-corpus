(corresponding author: JLAnderson@winona.edu)  Introduction:    Non-dimensional  scaling  relationships1,2,3 are used to understand various cratering processes  including  final  crater  sizes and  the excavation of material  from  a  growing  crater.   The principal assumption  behind  these  scaling  relationships  is  that these processes depend on a combination of the projectile's  characteristics, namely  its diameter, density, and  impact  speed.    This  simplifies  the  impact  event into a single point-source.   So  long as  the process of interest  is beyond a  few projectile  radii  from  the  impact point, the point-source assumption holds2,4.    These assumptions can be tested through laboratory experiments in which the initial conditions of the impact  are  controlled  and  resulting  processes measured  directly.    In  this  contribution, we  continue  our exploration  of  the  congruence  between  crater-size scaling  and  ejection-speed  scaling  relationships.    In particular, we examine a series of experimental suites in  which  the  projectile  diameter  and  average  grain size of the target are varied. Data Collection Methods and Experimental Conditions:    All  experiments  presented  here  were  performed with  the vertical gun  in  the Experimental  Impact Laboratory  (EIL) at NASA  Johnson Space Center.  Ejecta were documented using an updated version of the  Ejection-Velocity  Measurement  System  (EVMS); details  regarding  the  original  EVMS  are  given  in  [5].  Since  2008,  the  EVMS  has  been  updated  with  a  7megapixel Nikon D100  camera yielding much higherresolution  images  for  analysis;  the  previous  camera produced 1-megapixel photographs.   Other optimizations to the laser geometry and computer-based analytical proceedures have increased the speed at which the analyses can be completed.   Impact  speeds  ranged  from  0.6  -  2.4  km/s;  the velocity  vector was  always normal  to  the  target  surface.  Pressure in the impact chamber was less than 1 torr.   The target material was blasting sand sieved to 0.5-1 mm, giving a geometric mean grain-size of 0.71 mm.   Two suites of 4.76 mm diameter spherical projectiles were used, aluminum and glass. Data:   The EVMS projects a "sheet" of  laser  light through the impact point perpendicular to the target's surface  (Figure 1).  The  camera  views  the  event with the detector plane  subparallel  to  the  sheet at a precisely known geometry. The laser illuminates the leading edge of the growing ejecta curtain and  is strobed at  a  known  rate,  permitting  individual  ejecta  to  be traced along their ballistic trajectories (Figure 2).  Figure 1.  EVMS setup.   Figure 2. Example EVMS image (shown here inverted).  Individual  trajectories  are  measured  from  the EVMS images and extrapolated back to the target surface, yielding ejection position, speed, and angle data for each particle.  The final crater dimensions are also measured, thus permitting analysis of both crater-size and ejection-speed scaling relationships. Crater-Size Scaling:  Final crater dimensions have been  tied  to  initial  impact  conditions  through  scaling  relationships,2,3  which  infer  that  a  single  parameter  is related to the slope of the R vs. 2 relationship (Figure 3).  Values of  derived for each suite are given in Table 1. Ejection-Speed  Scaling:    The  scaled  ejection speed  is  related  to  the  scaled  ejection position by  a power  law3  whose  exponent  ex  is  a  function  of  the crater-size scaling exponent, .  These exponents and the derived values of  were calculated for each individual shot; the average values for each suite are given in Table 1.  Note that the  values derived from the 2668.pdf

ejection-speed scaling are higher than those from the crater-size scaling.  Figure  3.    Crater-size  scaling  analysis  for  glass  and aluminum suites in this study.  Discussion:   Along with  the  two  suites  from  this study,  our  previous  work5,6,7  includes  three  other suites of experiments in which the projectile diameter and grain  size of  the  target were varied; values of  determined  from  crater-size  scaling  and  ejectionspeed scaling of these suites are also given in Table 1.  The first EVMS study5  initially noted that the two scaling  relationships  yielded  different    values  and attributed  that difference  to  the  similarity  in dimensions between  the  target's  grains  and  the projectile.    Subsequent  EVMS  studies6,7  found  similar  discrepancies  between  the  crater-size  and  ejection-speed  values for .  Scaling results obtained using Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV) and a much finer grained target8, however,  showed  much  better  agreement  between the two values of  (Table 1). To examine whether this variation in  might be a result of the target's granularity, we defined a parameter,  ,  to be  the  ratio of  the projectile diameter  to the mean dimension of the grains composing the target7;  that value  is given  for all experimental suites  in Table  1.    The  higher-resolution  camera  permits  detailed analysis of much finer-grained targets than was possible  previously,  thus  increasing  the  range  in   available for EVMS study. The derived values of  as a function of  for the six experimental suites are shown in Figure 4.  Craterscaling  values  are  all  near  the  theoretical minimum.  However, at small  (similar sized projectile and target grains),  the  values  derived  from  the  ejection  speeds are much higher.   As    increases,  the ejection-speed values appear to converge with the crater-scaling values, as expected for a continuous material.  It is notable that this trend appears to be  independent of projectile material.   Future work will attempt EVMS analysis of an even finer-grained target material to achieve larger  values  for direct comparison with  the results of the PIV study7.    Figure  4.  Variation of  with .   Implications:   While the assumption is commonly made that a planetary-scale target surface would present a uniform continuum to the  incoming projectile, more  and  more  high-resolution  images  are  showing the diversity of surfaces and the number of fragments embedded  in  regoliths.    Such  large  fragments  may present  complexities  in  subsurface  structure  that could violate the point-source assumption inherent to crater-scaling relationships.  TABLE 1.
