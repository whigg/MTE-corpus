Introduction:  Remanent magnetization in the lunar crust and in returned Apollo samples indicates that the Moon formed a metallic core and an ancient dynamo magnetic field.  Recent paleomagnetic investigations of lunar samples demonstrate that the Moon had ~30-110 µT paleointensities between at least 4.2 and 3.56 billion years ago (Ga) [1-3].  While Tikoo et al. [4]  recently found that the field declined to below several µT by 3.19 Ga, how long the dynamo persisted has remained unclear because retrieving high-fidelity paleointensity estimates for weak fields is difficult for the vast majority of lunar samples [5].  Thus far, no lunar samples postdating 3.56 Ga in age have been reported to unambiguously record a thermoremanent magnetization (TRM) acquired while cooling in the presence of a core dynamo-generated field. Determining whether the lunar dynamo was still active after 3.56 Ga requires a young lunar rock with exceptionally high magnetic recording fidelity.  With this goal, we are conducting a new analysis of regolith breccia 15498.  Sample:  15498 is a regolith breccia with clasts mainly derived from mare basalt fragments welded with basaltic composition melt glass [6-7] (Fig. 1).  It was collected from the base of a boulder located at the edge of Dune Crater at Station 4 of the Apollo 15 landing site [8].  The basalt clasts contain abundant shock features including maskelynite (peak pressures >25 GPa) [6-7].  We determined a 3.302 ± 0.040 Ga 40Ar/39Ar plateau age for one mare basalt clast, which places an upper limit on the lithification age of the breccia (our 40Ar/39Ar analyses of the matrix and thermochronology models are in progress).  Trapped Ar data suggest a breccia lithification age of only ~1.3 Ga [9].   Natural remanent magnetization (NRM):   We analyzed 3 mutually oriented chips (274, 282, 287) from parent block 15498,141 (Fig. 1).  Two subsamples of matrix were prepared using a wire saw from each chip (6 total).  All subsamples were mutually oriented and subjected to three axis alternating field (AF) demagnetization measurements up to 290 mT.  Measures were taken during data processing to reduce noise from spurious gyroremanent magnetization (GRM) and anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM).  Magnetization component directions and maximum angular deviation (MAD) values were computed using principal component analysis (PCA) [10].  Fig. 1. Photograph of mutually oriented subsamples of regolith breccia 15498 (,274, 282, and 287).  The sample contains abundant mare basalt fragments (blue arrows and labels) within a glassy matrix (red arrows and labels).  The scale cube has a width of 1 cm.  The subsamples and scale cube are oriented following the Johnson Space Center convention for 15498.  We identified either two or three magnetization components in each subsample of 15498.  Low coercivity (LC) components were blocked from NRM up to ~7.5 mT.  Medium coercivity (MC) components were blocked from the end of the LC component up to ~48 mT.  The LC and MC components were nonunidirectional between subsamples.  High coercivity (HC) components were blocked in 5 out of 6 subsamples from the end of the MC component to AF levels >290 mT, depending on the subsample (Fig. 2).  A statistical test [11-12]  indicates that the HC magnetization directions in our subsamples are non-random to >99% confidence, and therefore have a common origin.   The presence of a stable HC component in our 15498 subsamples is broadly consistent with the results of a previous thermal demagnetization study which observed a high temperature (HT) magnetization that persisted to unblocking temperatures of >650°C [13].

peratures suggests that the HC/HT magnetization component is a TRM acquired when the breccia formed.    Fig. 2.  Equal area stereographic projection of HC component directions observed for mutually oriented subsamples of 15498.  Black symbols and ellipses denote linear fit directions as determined by PCA and MAD values for individual subsamples, respectively.  The green symbol and corresponding ellipse denotes the Fisher mean direction and 95% angular confidence interval.  Open symbols (dashed lines) represent directions in the upper hemisphere and filled symbols (solid lines) represent directions in the lower hemisphere  Paleointensity:  Using the AF-based ARM method (see refs. [1-4] for descriptions of methodology), we determined paleointensities for the magnetization components in our subsamples.  HC paleointensities ranged from a few hundred nT to ~2 µT, depending on the subsample.  Our results are consistent with a previous thermal study of 15498 which reported a ~2 µT paleointensity [13].  Following refs. [4-5], we determined that accurate paleointensities can be retrieved from 15498 using AF methods for TRM acquired in fields as weak as ≤~0.7 µT.  This confirms that our paleointensity estimates are reliable and that this sample has extraordinarily high-fidelity magnetic recording properties. Discussion:  Our retrieved paleointensity values are at least two orders of magnitude higher than remanent crustal fields measured at the Apollo 15 landing site (3.4 ± 2.9 nT), and at least a factor of two higher than surface fields measured at any Apollo landing site [14].  Petrographic observations and crystallization kinetic analyses suggest that the breccia matrix experienced primary cooling from above the kamacite Curie temperature of 780°C too slowly (> 1 hr [15]) to have acquired TRM from transient impact-generated fields (which are expected to last at most a few seconds for the small impacts at this time in lunar history; see discussion in ref. [4]).  Assuming that the HC component observed in 15498 is indeed a TRM (rather than a shock remanent magnetization resulting from an impact occurring after breccia lithification), our paleointensity values raise the possibility that the breccia formed in the presence of a ~1 µT core dynamo field.   No current model for thermally convective or mechanically driven dynamos can sustain a lunar field past ~2.5 Ga (e.g., refs. [16-18]).  Therefore, a core dynamo persisting beyond this date would likely require an alternative field generation mechanism such as compositional convection from inner core crystallization. Conclusions:  The presence of a unidirectional, high stability HC component across the matrix of sample 15498 is consistent with TRM acquisition in a ~1 µT field during the breccia's formation.  We are conducting additional experiments to better constrain the age of magnetization and to clarify whether the HC magnetization originated in a long-lived core dynamo field, transient impact-generated field, or a remanent crustal field.  Regardless of the field source, 15498 appears to have the youngest unambiguous paleomagnetic record of any known lunar rock. References: [1] Garrick-Bethell I. et al. (2009) Science, 323, 356-359.
