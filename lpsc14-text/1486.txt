Here,  we continue  that  study by looking  at those meteorites that have compositional similarities to the EL chondrites but have been metamorphically recrystallized. These meteorites include Happy Canyon, Miller  Range  (MIL)  090807,  Zaklodzie,  Northwest Africa (NWA) 4301 and Ilafegh 009.The goals of this study are to 1) consider the petrologic, chemical and isotopic characteristics of these recrystallized rocks, and 2) briefly discuss the problem of interpreting their petrogenetic history.Methods: Petrological and chemical analyses were performed by electron microprobe at Brown University. Oxygen  isotope  analysis  was  performed  on  MIL 090807 by infrared laser-assisted fluorination [2] at the Open University. Analyses were obtained on the wholerock samples (0.5-2 mg) and were analyzed untreated. System precision (2σ) as determined on an internal obsidian standard is: ±0.05‰ for δ17O; ±0.09‰ for δ18O; ±0.024‰ for ∆17O. The ∆17O value has been calculated using a linearized format [3]. Petrology:  Zaklodzie,  MIL  090807,  Happy Canyon, and NWA 4301 dispaly a similar granular enstatite  texture.  Granular  textures  are  indicative  of  recrystallization  and  commonly  seen  in  metamorphic basalts,  both  terrestrial  and  extraterrestrial  (i.e.,  eucrites,  howardites)  [4].  MIL  090807,  Zaklodzie  and NWA 4301  have  fairly  uniform enstatite  grain  sizes (~80  to  300  micron  diameter),  while  Happy Canyon displays a complete range of sizes (~20 to ~350 micron diameter)  that  includes  a  much smaller  size  fraction than the others. All five meteorites studied contain interstitial  feldspar,  metal,  sulfides and silica.  No glass was found in any meteorite in this study though [5] reported a few small K-rich glass inclusions in enstatite in Ilafegh 009.Ilafegh 009 is a much coarser-grained (up to 1 cm diameter)  meteorite than the others and has a texture that initially looks quite similar to an igneous rock. In fact, on first investigation, it did not appear to be very closely related to the other four recrystallized EL rocks. However,  upon subsequent  observations using correlated backscattered electron and cross-polarized petrographic microscope images, the texture showed that it probably did not result from only primary crystallization from a melt as suggested by [5-7]. Instead, closer observation shows it  contains smaller  enstatite  grains that have metamorphically welded themselves together into larger, blocky and irregularly-shaped grains. This is  evidenced  by 1)  Ca/Al  zoning  across  each  of  the smaller internal grains, and 2) sulfide, metal and feldspar grains which appear to be included in or cutting across  many  portions  of  the  larger  enstatite  grain. These  multiple  small,  welded  enstatite  grains  give  a slight irregular optical extinction to the larger grains in cross-polarized light. The  petrogenetic  history of  Ilafegh  009  seems to consist of an igneous rock that experienced at least two metamorphic events. Following the first event, Ilafegh 009 probably resembled the other  "typical"  recrystallized EL rocks and contained 20-300 micron diameter enstatites. However, following at least one subsequent metamorphic event, these smaller enstatites ripened and re-oriented around the intervening phases into the larger,  centimeter-sized,  crystallographically-contiguous grains now seen. Mineral  Chemistry:  Zaklodzie  and  NWA  4301: Nearly every mineral composition that could be measured in both Zaklodzie and NWA 4301 overlap. Zaklodzie contains En98.9-99.4, with 0.1-0.6 wt% CaO and 0.10.4 wt% Al2O3,  while NWA 4301 has En98.8-99.2,  with 0.22-0.45 wt% CaO and 0.1-0.2 wt% Al2O3. Interstitial feldspar  compositions are  An3Ab89Or8  to  An38Ab61Or1 for Zaklodzie, while NWA 4301 feldspars are slightly more calcic (An11Ab85Or4 to An41Ab57Or2). NWA 4301 also has  rare  feldspar  inclusions within enstatite,  but these are compositionally indistinguishable from the interstitial  ones.  Metal  compositions in Zaklodzie (5.66.1  wt% Ni  and 1.46-1.59  wt% Si)  and NWA 4301 (5.4-6.1 wt% Ni and 1.4-1.6 wt% Si) are in the typical range  for  EL  chondrites.  Occasional  intact  troilites (0.33-0.43 wt% Ti,  3.1-3.6 wt% Cr, and 1.0-1.7 wt% Mn) and  schreibersites  (10.5-11.0  wt% Ni  and  0.170.31 wt% Co) can be found in NWA 4301 despite bad weathering. These vary slightly from those in fresher Zaklodzie (troilite: 0.75-0.86 wt% Ti, 4.1-4.7 wt% Cr and 0.95-2.05 wt% Mn; schreibersite:  9.9-13.25 wt% Ni and 0.1-0.29 wt% Co). Alabandite was only found in  Zaklodzie  (0.17-0.25  wt%  Na,  4.8-5.1  wt%  Mg, 0.74-0.85 wt% Ca, 1.85-2.09 wt% Cr). Daubreelite was 1486.pdf

not found in either meteorite. Traces of oldhamite were found in both meteorites, but no useful analyses could be obtained. Happy Canyon: There are two pyroxenes, instead of just  one,  in  Happy Canyon,  enstatite  (En98.-99.3,  0.290.43 wt% CaO and 0.05-0.4 wt% Al2O3) and diopside (Wo45En55,  0.07-0.08 wt% TiO2,  0.55-1.0 wt% Al2O3, and 0.17-0.25 wt% Na2O). Feldspar compositions (An14Ab83Or3 to  An31Ab67Or2)  lie in the same range as  the other recrystallized EL rocks. Very severe weathering allows only silicate analyses to be quantitatively useful. MIL 090807: This meteorite is also unusual among the  recrystallized  ELs  as  it  bears  rare  olivine  grains (Fo99.9, 0.03 wt% CaO). Enstatite and feldspar compositions are typical (En98.8-99.2, 0.25-0.50 wt% CaO and An5Ab90Or5 to  An40Ab59Or1,  respectively).  Metal  (5.6-6.6 wt% Ni and 0.67-0.84 wt% Si) and sulfide (troilite: 0.71.11 wt% Ti,0.8-1.8 wt% Cr and 0.04-0.22 wt% Mn; daubreelite 0.07-0.37 wt% Ti and 1.94-2.95 wt% Mn; alabandite 0.02-0.05 wt% Na, 3.7-3.9 wt% Mg, 0.270.35  wt% Ca and 1.5-1.8 wt% Cr)  are similar to the other  recrystallized  ELs,  though  schreibersite  (21.029.9 wt% Ni and 0.05-0.25 wt% Co) in MIL is more Ni-rich.Ilafegh 009:  Perhaps the most interesting of the 5 meteorites, Ilafegh 009 has enstatite with a CaO content slightly higher than the others (En99.4-99.8, CaO 0.5-1.05 wt% CaO, 0.12-0.28 wt% Al2O3). The large enstatites are also zoned in Ca/Al and appear to be composed of smaller  enstatites  that  have  been  welded  (and/or ripened)  together.  The  feldspar  composition  (An11Ab84Or5 to An31Ab67Or2) overlaps the other meteorites in this study. Metal (6.1-6.8 wt% Ni and 1.03-1.15 wt% Si),  troilite  (0.87-1.24  wt% Ti,  1.1-1.6  wt% Cr,  and 0.05-0.1 wt% Mn) and schreibersite (6.0-14.8 wt% Ni and 0.18-0.41 wt% Co) are all consistent with an EL origin. Alabandite and oldhamite were found, but are too badly weathered to yield useful data. No daubreelite was found.Oxygen Isotopes: The oxygen isotopic results for MIL 090807, as well as previously published data for Happy Canyon and Ilafegh 009 [8] and Zaklodzie [9] are plotted in Fig. 1 relative to the fields generated from the data of [8]. NWA 4301 has not yet been analyzed for oxygen and is severely weathered.The  four  meteorites  analyzed  plot  inside  the  EH chondrite  region of oxygen isotope  space,  but  all  are very close to the EL chondrite region as well. No systematic oxygen isotopic versus chemical or petrological differences were found.Origins: One of the controversial aspects of many of  the anomalous E  meteorites,  in general,  and these five meteorites specifically, is whether their petrogenetic origin results from either external (impact melting) or internal (igneous melting) parent body processes. Texturally,  the recrystallized EL rocks described here resemble  many  primitive  achondrites,  such  as  the  lodranites,  acapulcoites  and  winonaites.  All  of  these rocks have "presumably" been melted and subsequently metamorphically  recrystallized.  Petrologically,  however, there has still been no definitive means shown to determine the source of the heat which either initially formed or subsequently metamorphosed them. The only differences  between these  groups  is  their  initial  bulk compositions  (controlled  by  temperature  and  oxygen fugacity) and their direct link, if any, to a known chondrite group. The recrystallized E rocks can easily make a compositional and oxygen isotopic connection to the EL  chondrites,  however  the  lodranites,  acapulcoites and winonaites can't make a direct  connection to any known chondritic parent. All of the EL rocks studied here are quite homogeneous with only metal  and feldspar  showing chemical evidence of small fractionation trends. Happy Canyon is probably the least metamorphosed of the five, since it still contains its smallest size fraction of enstatites and has  a  size  distribution  similar  to  a  primary  igneous rock.  The  others,  however,  have  more  uniformly ripened enstatites,  possibly having their growth aided by being surrounded by a low temperature, metamorphically-generated sulfide melt [10].References: [1] Boesenberg  J.
