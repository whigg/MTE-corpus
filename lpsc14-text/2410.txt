It is possible to make reasonable estimates of the amount of melt produced by impact events of differing scales, and likewise the depth of excavation and the quantity of unheated material which is redistibuted at the surface. However, the cumulative effect of a long sequence of impacts melting, excavating, burying and reexcavating material produces a megaregolith which is complex in its melt distribution with depth. The characteristics of the distribution depend on the size-frequency distribution of craters forming on the surface, commonly called the crater production function. Further, if we wish to trace back the presence of melt specifically for the Moon, we also need to know the history of the crater formation rate.  Method: The essence of the model is the following:  1. An initial volume, with a surface area equivalent to that of the Moon is denoted with a nominal starting age of    (typically 4.5 Ga), and a minimum crater size for the simulation is chosen,     .  2. From the lunar chronology function [3], an impact rate is found for the current model time,  , which corresponds to craters of 1 km in diameter. By means of the crater production function (PF), the equivalent rate for craters of size      is found.  3. The rate gives the average time to the next impact event producing a crater larger than     . With a Monte Carlo approach, we can use a Poisson function to find realistically distributed time intervals, although for the large number of events being simulated, it can be sufficient to employ an averaged interval. 4. The diameter of the crater formed is generated using the Monte Carlo method in such a way that the size-frequency distribution statistically conforms to the portion of the production function larger than     . 5. For each crater produced, the penetration depth is taken as      [1,2] and the volume of excavated material is approximated as the volume of the transient crater.  6. A portion of this excavated volume is considered to have been melted (or heated above the point required to reset the Ar-Ar clock):                , where     and     are the diameter and volume of the transient crater, and c and d are taken as 2×10 -4 and 3.85, respectively (after [2]). The melted material is marked in the simulation with the current clock time,  .  7. The excavated material, together with the new melt, is redistributed evenly over the entire surface of the body. This is a simplification of the real situation, but in an average sense—because of the relative frequency of smaller impacts whose ejecta do not travel so far—it provides a reasonable reflection of the amount of ejecta sourced from craters of differing sizes at any point of the surface.    Figure 1. a) Impact event causing ejection of unheated and melted material, b) the deposition of a mixed layer of unheated ejecta and melt, c) a subsequent impact event, ejecting material from both the previous layer and beneath, melting a fraction of both, and d) depositing a new layer containing both new melt and a component of reexcavated melt from the previous event.  Results: Results for an impact rate scenario as described by [3], with the rate being constant back to 3 Ga, and exponentially increasing before then are shown in Fig. 2, in comparison with those for the same scenario with the addition of a cataclysmic peak in the rate function (Fig. 3). The near-surface melt is dominated by the most recent impacts; further back in time, it is the largest impacts which dominate: it is notable that they produce sufficient melt to leave a permanent signature in the upper layers. Later impacts of lesser scale either penetrate to the original ejecta layer to bring up more of its melt, or recycle the same aged melt nearer the surface. Eventually the melt from these events becomes present at every depth down to its source ejecta layer.  Figure 2. Simulation using craters of random size larger 30 km conforming to the size-frequency distribution described by the Neukum (1983) production function over a period of 4.5 Ga using a realistic impact rate function (plotted above) and incorporating basin-forming events. The horizontal axis indicates the age of the melt. Each trace in the plot represents a histogram of the presence of differing melt ages, the baseline of the trace being plotted at the layer's depth below the surface according to the vertical axis scale. The histograms are plotted twice: in black - with all traces using the same normalisation; in grey - with exaggerated small values. The numbers at the left side of each trace  show the fraction of material of age    that has never been melted during the simulation (this fraction is excluded from the histogram, since it would plot much higher). The four prominent peaks present in both runs represent South-Pole-Aitken at 4.23 Ga, Crisium at 4.08 Ga, Imbrium at 3.88 Ga and Orientale at 3.82 Ga.   Figure 3. Simulation using craters of random size larger 30 km conforming to the size-frequency distribution described by the Neukum (1983) production function over a period of 4.5 Ga using a hypothetical impact rate function with a cataclysmic peak (plotted above) and incorporating basin-forming events. The four prominent peaks again represent South-Pole-Aitken, Crisium, Imbrium and Orientale, but have been compressed into a cataclysmic peak centred on 3.9 Ga.  Conclusion: The cataclysm peak, if there was one, should be identifiable today in the histogram of melt ages from surface samples, both those returned from the Moon by manned and unmanned spacecraft and those delivered to the Earth in the form of meteorites. More generally, this type of modelling offers the possibility of inverting the observed melt age histogram to constrain the true impact rate function.
