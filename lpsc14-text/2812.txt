These planets have radii equal to or greater than that of Jupiter and are found < 1 AU from their host star. Likely, these planets did not form in their current locations and the highly excited nature of these systems, points to the importance of giant planet migration in the early history of planetary systems as a general process [3].  Within our own solar system, the dynamical evidence for giant planet migration is vast. The dynamical structure of the Kuiper Belt shows clear evidence of outward migration by Neptune. In addition, the Kuiper Belt population appears extremely diverse in terms of color and albedo [4-5] with further evidence that these are primordial properties rather than environmental factors [6-7]. More recently it has become evident that migration may also have reshaped the populations in the inner Solar System, particularly the outer Main Belt, the Hildas and the Jovian Trojans [8-9]. Some, and perhaps all, of the objects found in these dynamical groups may have originated in the protoplanetary disk located between and beyond the giant planets and been scattered by giant planet migration to their current locations. We therefore have designed a program to obtain optical colors of  ~300 Hilda group asteroids that will allow us to identify correlations between color, albedo, size, and dynamical properties that can be used to constrain specific models of origins. Why Hildas?: The Hildas are a unique population of small bodies that are locked in a 3:2 mean motion resonance with Jupiter. Unlike other resonances in the asteroid belt, the 3:2 is a stable resonance a 3.95 AU with objects stable there for at least 2 GYr and more likely for the age of the Solar System  [10-11]. The Outer Main Belt (OMB) also has many objects that may have originated in the outer protoplanetary disk (OPD). However, the OMB appears to be more mixed with objects from the elsewhere in Main Belt and enjoys only a small advantage in terms of brightness for a given diameter and albedo. The intrinsic collisional probability for objects in the Hilda population is also a factor of 3 to 5 less than the collisional probabilities for Trojan and OMB populations [12-13], suggesting a significant population of objects that may be minimally altered by collisional processing. Thus, we have chosen to concentrate on the Hildas as possibly the nearest example of a possibly nearly pure sample of relatively pristine OPD planetesimals in the Solar System. Observations: We have observed a preliminary sample of ~150 Hilda group asteroids with the 2.3-m Bok Telescope and the 4-m Mayall telescope located at Kitt Peak National Observatory using the Sloan g,r,i, and z filters. Targets were selected from the catalog of WISE detected Hildas [14] such that correlations with optical colors and taxonomy as a function of albedo and diameter can be investigated.  Preliminary results: Though bimodal color distributions have been noted within the Kuiper Belt and Trojan populations [7, 15] and in ~100 object sample of Hilda group asteroids observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey [16], we find no evidence for a bimodal color distribution within the Hilda group from our data. We find that the colors of the Hilda group asteroids in our preliminary catalog show a smooth transition from a C taxonomic type to a D taxonomic type as presented in Figure 1. We also find no correlations between size, albedo and dynamical properties, however we caution that this is a preliminary sample which is being actively expanded with continuing observations in our observing program.  Figure 1: Sloan r-i vs i-z colors for Hildas in our preliminary sample. Black asterisks denote D-type asteroids, red circles denote T-type asteroids, purple triangles denote X-type asteroids and blue squares denote C-type asteroids using SMASS taxonomic definitions.
