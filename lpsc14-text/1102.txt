In particular the lack of small buried QCDS strongly suggests thicker accumulation of sediments in the NE corner of the basin. Introduction.  Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) data provide evidence for buried impact craters in the form of Quasi-Circular Depresssions (QCDs) not "seen" in image data. We have used these likely buried craters to assess crustal age (as opposed to surface age) of various regions on Mars [1-4]. Here we discuss another application of buried craters: determining the thickness of the materials which cover them. Figure 1 shows the principle behind using topographic data to detect buried craters.                QCDs in Chryse.  QCDs mapped in topographic data may or may not be visible in image data. Those seen in visible data almost exclusively coincide with impact craters. We assume the not-visible QCDs are buried impact craters as shown in Figure 1. Figure 2 shows colored MOLA data for the Chryse Basin and Figure 3 shows a portion of the E side of the basin. Many of the not-visible QCDs are obvious in the stretched colored topography, but contouring (bottom panel of Figure 3) brings out more subtle features.                               The location of all QCDs larger than ~ 20 km were mapped in the Chryse Basin and around the Chryse rim. QCDs were separated into visible and not-visible features by using image data and "scored" by strength of the topographic signature (a measure of the confidence of identification). Visible QCDs coincide with impact craters; the not-visible QCDs are inferred to be buried impact craters (Figure 1). Preliminary Results.  Figure 4 shows visible QCDs (visible craters) and not-visible QCDs (inferred buried craters) larger than ~ 20 km diameter in the study area. The absence of visible craters within the Chryse Basin is obvious. But there is a very large population of buried craters in the basin interior, with a density comparable to that of the Chryse Basin rim. Figure 1. Change in topographic profile (middle panel) as a crater becomes more buried (top panel), and application to a large sediment-filled basin  (bottom). MOLA "sees" the first three cases in the top panel as Quasi-Circular Depressions (QCDs); the first two would likely be "visible" in image data. The third case can only be "seen" in topographic data. The completely buried crater (fourth frame) is hidden even from MOLA. In a basin where sediment thickness increases towards the center, craters of the same size would gradually become more  difficult and finally impossible to detect. A  Figure 2. MOLA topography of Chryse Basin. Contour interval = 1 km. Reds are high, blues are low elevations. Note the channel patterns visible inside the basin, originating at mouths of outflow channels. Box area shown in top panel below. Figure 3 (right). Top: area shown in box in Figure 2 above. Middle: area in dashed box in top panel with an increased stretch of the MOLA data. QCDs very obvious in this stretch, even without contours. Bottom: same as middle with 200 m contours added. White circles are QCDs: solid are visible craters, dashed are assumed buried craters. Circle thickness "scores" the strength of the QCD signature; thicker circles are more obvious in the topographic data and, for not-visible QCDs of the same size, likely indicate less buried craters (as described in Figure 1).                  Figure 5 shows buried craters in the Chryse Basin as in Figure 4 (bottom), but separated by size. White dots are QCDs < 30 km across. This emphasizes the lack of small buried craters in the NE part of the basin, probably due to greater thickness of sediments in this are. A greater thickness of sediments may be due to convergence of flows from many outflow channels combined with a slowing of transport with increasing distance from the outflow channel mouths. Implications.  The minimum thickness of material needed to completely bury a 30 km wide crater can be estimated, given a rim height and depth for craters of this size. Crater depth-diameter relationships vary greatly [5-8] suggesting depths of 1.2 to 2.4 km. Rim heights are less freqeuently determined, but may be ~0.3 km [5]. That is, rims can be hidden by ~ 400 m of fill on the plain around the crater, but the total fill to bury a 30 km crater is ~1.5-2.7 km. This thickness is not needed over the entire area, but is needed where the craters exist to hide them. It may be that, in the NE portion of the Chryse Basin, average sediment thicknesses of 1-2 km explain the absence of buried QCDs < 30 km across. By inference, sediment thicknesses are significantly less elsewehere in the basin, especially in the SW portion.          Summary: Visible as well as buried Quasi-Circular Depressions (QCDs) from the Mars Orbier Laser Altimeter (MOLA) data provide evidence for variable sediment thicknesses within the Chryse Basin. In particular the lack of small buried QCDs strongly suggest a very thick accumulation of sediments (1-2 km?) in the NE corner of the basin where only buried craters > 30 km diameter are common.

Note absence of visible craters inside Chryse, likely due to sediment cover, but that buried craters have a density comparable to the visible craters on the basin rim. Buried crater density is highest in the SW corner and lower on the E and especially NE side of the basin. This suggests thinner sediments in the SW, thicker sediments in the E.  Figure 5. Buried craters in Chryse > 20 km in diameter. QCDs > 30 km shown as black, those < 30 km diameter as white dots. Note the high density of 20-30 km buried craters in the central and SW portion of the basin, and the almost complete absence of these in the NE corner of the Basin.
