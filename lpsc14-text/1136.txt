Introduction:  Methanogenic archaea, which consume CO2 and H2, have been considered models for possible life-forms on Mars for a long time, even before the discovery of methane in the Martian atmosphere (1-8). Several intensive experimental studies have been conducted to investigate survivability of methanogens in conditions that approach those found on Mars (2, 3, 9). So far, methanogens have survived these conditions well.  Various potential sources of methane in the martian atmosphere have been suggested such as  volcanic, meteoritic, cometary, hydrogeochemical, and biogenic sources (11). Isotopic fractionation is one of the methods to differentiate between biogenic and abiogenic sources (10).  Our goal to is to investigate the nature of carbon isotope fractionation of methane by four different species Methanothermobacter wolfeii, Methanosarcina barkeri, Methanobacterium formicicum, and Methanococcus maripaludis. They all were grown on the same H2/CO2 substrates but in different microenvironments such as growth-supporting media and two Mars regolith analogues. The two most commonly studied Mars regolith analogues are JSC Mars-1 and montmorillonite, which is a smectite clay. Methods:  The anaerobic stock cultures in growthsupporting media such as MM, MS, MSF and MSH for M. wolfeii, M. barkeri, M. formicicum, and M. maripaludis respectively, were prepared using protocols described previously (12). They were transferred into their respective new growth media every two weeks. Then the following three sets were prepared for this experiment: 1. Controls: Four 160 mL serum bottles containing 60 mL of MM, MS, MSF and MSH were prepared. 2. JSC Mars-1: Twelve 100 mL serum bottles were used, each containing 3g of JSC Mars-1 regolith. 3. Montmorillonite: Twelve 160 mL serum bottles, each containing 3g of  montmorillonite were prepared.  Twelve bottles for each JSC Mars-1 and montmorillonite were utilized to make triplicate samples for four different methanogens.  Bottles containg JSC Mars-1 and montmorillonite were left unsealed in a Coy Loboratories anaerobic chamber for deoxygenation. Then 30 mL and 60 mL of bicarbonate buffer were added to the anaerobic JSC Mars-1 and montmorillonite bottles respectively in the anaerobic chamber. Montmorillonite is highly absorptive clays. So to ensure some standing liquid above the clays, bigger bottles containing more bicarbonate buffer were used. These bottles were sealed with butyl rubber stoppers, removed from the chamber, aluminum crimped, and autoclaved. Next, 10 mL of each methanogenic working culture were centrifuged for 20 min. at 5000 rpm and washed two times with reduced sterile bicarbonate buffer following the protocol previously described (4). The washed cells of each species were resuspended in 5 mL reduced sterile bicarbonate buffer. Then 1 mL of each methanogenic cell suspension was injected into bottles containing JSC Mars-1, montmorillonite or control bottles. These inoculated bottles were pressurized with 200kPa of H2. The bottles containing M. wolfeii were incubated at 550C, M. maripaludis at 250C, and M. barkeri and M. formicicum at 370C. Headspace gas from these sample bottles was measured for methane concentration periodically by Micro-GC gas chromatograph.  To drastically reduce the presence of any residual micronutrients in the culture tubes, cultures were transferred into new sterile anaerobic microenvironment bottles containing their respective anaologues and reduced sterile bicarbonate buffer after one month. From each of the sample bottles of the first transfer, 1 mL was injected into the second transfer bottles. They were pressurized with 200kPa of H2 and incubated at their respective temperatures. Methane in their headspace gas was analyzed periodically by gas chromatograph.   The stable carbon isotope fractionation of methane in the headspace gas of all samples of the second transfer was measured by a Piccaro Cavity Ringdown Spectrometer G2201-i isotopic CO2/CH4 in the University of Arkansas Isotope Lab.  Results: The results of carbon isotopic analysis of methane by M. wolfeii, M. barkeri, M. formicicum, and M. maripaludi are shown in the figures below. Data presented here are the averages of the triplicates. M. maripaludis did not grow on montmorillonite in the first transfer.  The δ13CCH4 for M. wolfeii in growth media demonstrated an average of -51.78 0/00, but on JSC Mars-1 and montmorillonite showed more negative fractionation, of about -66.170/00 and -68.41 0/00, respectively. We found a similar trend in M. barkeri and M. marpaludis. The δ13CCH4 value in growth media of M.barkeri is  1136.pdf

-59.080/00, but is more negative when grown on JSC Mars-1 and montmorillonite with values of -71.540/00 and -73.20/00  respectively.  δ13CCH4 in M. maripaludis showed -40.590/00 in media and -49.380/00 on montmorillonite. Surprinsingly, M. formicicum when grown in media and JSC Mars-1 demonstrated little or no difference in isotopic values, which are  about -53.050/00 and -51.840/00 respectively. But on montmorillonite, it demonstrated depleted δ13CCH4 data of about -60.830/00.       Figures: Carbon isotope fractionation of methane by  M. wolfeii, M. barkeri, M. formicicum, and M. maripaludis growing on growth media MM, MS, MSF, and MSH respectively, and Mars regolith analogues such as JSC Mars-1, and montmorillonite. Discussion and Conclusions: The δ13CCH4 is calculated as:  Where (13C/12C)standard = 0.0112372 for the reference material called Pee Dee Belemnite (PDB). The carbon isotope fractionation in biological processes is an example of “kinetic isotope fractionation” (13). In methanogenesis, carbon fractionation is due to preferential use of lighter isotopes (12C) because of the lower energy costs. Several factors are responsible for the magnitude of fractionation such as the species of methanogens, hydrogen supply, growth phase, temperature, substrate level, and the isotopic effects of enzymes involved in biosynthetic pathways of methane production (13, 14). The transformation of CO2  to CH4  requires formation and breaking of several bonds during methanogenesis. So, it is crucial to understand the effect of microenvironments on the isotopic signatures of methane produced by methanogens. Here, all four species of methanogens showed more depleted value of δ13CCH4 when grown on JSC Mars-1 and montmorillonite than on their respective growth media except M. formicicum, which showed comparable fractionation in growth media as well as on JSC Mars-1. Future experiments will examine carbon isotope fractionation of methane by methanogens growing on other Mars regolith analogues, such as basalt.  References: [1] Kral T. A. et al.
