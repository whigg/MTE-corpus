Introduction: We report a comprehensive petrological study of a range of partially-melted achondrite and chondrite meteorites with the aim of constraining early-stage melting processes on asteroidal bodies. Particular emphasis is placed on constraining the relationship of ungrouped achondrites LEW 88673, MIL 090206, and MIL 090405, with other partially-melted achondrites. Samples and Analytical Methods: In addition to previously reported petrology for acapulcoites and lodranites (Acapulco; MET 01195, 33; ALHA 81187, 7; EET 84302, 28; GRA 95209, 218), brachinite ALH 84025 (,6), anamolous achondrite LEW 88763 (,14) [1], and ureilite MIL 091004 [2], we report new petrology for ungrouped achondrites MIL 090405 (,5) and MIL 090206 (,8).  Major- and minor-element mineral compositions were obtained using a Cameca SX100 electron micro-probe (EMP) at the University of Tennessee. Bulk-rock samples of these samples obtained from the Meteorite Working Group and for Norton County, carbonaceous chondrites (Ivuna, Murchison, Allende, NWA 5958), and ordinary chondrites (Chelyabinsk [also in 3], Richardton, Peace River, Kunashak) are being used for isotopic and geochemical characterization. Whole-rock trace-element abundances were determined at SIO using standard procedures [4] with a Thermo Scientific iCAP Q ICP-MS. Oxygen isotope data was obtained at the IPG-Paris by laser fluorination. Results: Oxygen isotopes - New triple-oxygen isotope data were obtained on 22 meteorite samples (Figure 1). Notable features of the new data include: (1) confirmation of the distinct oxygen isotope composition of LEW 88763 (Δ17O = -1.17 ±0.05 ‰; -1.3 [5]) from brachinites (~ -0.2 ‰ [4]); (2) MIL 090405 (Δ17O = -0.08 ±0.02 ‰) has Δ17O close to the TFL and similar to some brachinite-like achondrites (BLA); (3) MIL 090206 has a distinct Δ17O value of -0.15 ‰. Petrography and Petrology - Petrology of most of the samples has been reported previously [1,2]; so, the focus here is on MIL 090206 and MIL 090405. We find similar mineralogy for MIL 090206 to [6], with olivine (Av. Fo73.6; Figure 2), high- and low-Ca pyroxene (Figure 3), Cr-spinel, plagioclase, FeNi Metal, and FeS. Intergrowths of opx + opaques (sulfide, Feoxides, rare FeNi metal) occur along olivine grain margins, as in MIL 090340 [6,7], and brachinites [8]. MIL 090405 has similar mineralogy to MIL 090206, but has more ferroan olivine compositions (Av. Fo72.6) and lacks low-Ca pyroxene in the sample that we analyzed.

gestions of carbonaceous chondrite Ivuna. Rare earth element (REE) abundances for Ivuna are as follows (in ppm): La = 0.226; Ce = 0.565; Pr = 0.086; Nd = 0.456; Sm = 0.152; Eu = 0.051; Gd = 0.225; Tb = 0.041; Dy = 0.276; Ho = 0.061; Er = 0.186; Tm = 0.029; Yb = 0.183. Ordinary chondrite data includes Chelyabinsk and Kunashak (reported in [3]). Carbonaceous chondrite Allende has a large positive Ce anomaly and light-REE enrichment relative to Ivuna. New wholerock trace-element data for the acapulcoite-lodranite, brachinite, and ungrouped achondrite samples are in progress and will be reported.   Figure 3.

LEW 88763 is clearly distinct from brachinites and brachinite-like achondrites in oxygen isotope composition, despite having mineral compositions closest to these meteorites. Instead, the oxygen isotope composition of LEW 88763 overlaps that of acapulcoites and lodranites. We previously suggested two possible explanations for this unusual composition [1]: process-related links to brachinites (e.g., [4]) or extreme heterogeneity on the brachinite parent body. It is notable that another anomalous achondrite, NWA 6693 (Δ17O = -1.08‰) has similar oxygen isotope composition to LEW 88763, and is even more ferroan (Fo49) [9]. However, the texture of NWA 6693 is simialr to a cumulate [9], whereas LEW 88763 is finer-grained and less-equilibrated [1]. The presence of LEW 88763 and NWA 6693 in the meteorite collection points to the presence of asteroidal bodies in the early Solar System that underwent similar partial-differentiation processes to brachinites and brachinite-like achondrites, but were more oxidized. MIL 090206 and MIL 090405 - varieties of brachinite-like achondrite. MIL 090206 and MIL 090405 were provisionally classified as being superficially similar to ureilites; however, recent work has shown that they have closer affinity to brachinites [6, 10]. The new oxygen isotope and mineral-compositional data for MIL 090206 are consistent with it being a brachinite-like achondrite, with similarities to NWA 5400 or NWA 6077 [4]. MIL 090405 lacks low-Ca pyroxenes and has an oxygen isotope composition more similar to brachinites, but also has more magnesian olivine compositions compared with brachinites. Given the current constraints, we consider both of these samples to be varieties of brachinite-like achondrite. Implications for early Solar System composition and evolution. The expanding compositional range of meteorites which exhibit evidence for partial-melting processes similar to brachinite-like achondrites suggests that low-degree partial melting was a common process on numerous asteroids and planetesimals in the early Solar System. The preservation of these meteorites and lack of evidence for run-away melting on their parent bodies may owe much to impact disruption or to depletion of 26Al through segregation of Al-rich melts [4]. While this observation may be unsurprising, the large ranges in oxygen isotope composition and Mg/Fe values of silicates suggests that these bodies formed from materials with very different original oxidation and volatile compositions. Further work is ongoing to understand the processes and starting compositions of the rich diversity of early asteroidal parent bodies.    References: [1] Corder et al.
