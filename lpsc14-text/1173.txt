Introduction: The Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons experiment (DAN) on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover Curiosity is designed to detect neutrons for the purpose of sensing hydrogen within the shallow subsurface of Mars [1,2].  DAN is capable of detecting neutrons through the use of two 3 He proportional counters, one of which is unshielded and the other is shielded with cadmium, which absorbs neutrons with energies below the Cd cutoff of  ~0.4 eV [2]. DAN has two modes of operation: an active mode that makes use of a pulsed neutron generator (PNG), and a passive mode, in which the PNG is not used [1,2]. There are multiple sources of neutrons for DAN to detect in passive mode. One is derived from galactic cosmic rays (GCR). As these energetic particles propagate through the tenuous Martian atmosphere, some will interact with nuclei in the atmosphere producing secondary free neutrons through spallation, along with other particles [3]. The majority of initial GCR protons, however, will reach the surface of the planet and penetrate the subsurface up to a depth of ~1 meter, where they will interact with the nuclei of soil constituents and also produce neutrons through spallation [4]. A separate source is the MSL Multi- Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG), which produces energetic neutrons as a product of the decay of plutonium238. These neutrons, along with the GCRinduced neutrons (both from the atmosphere and the subsurface), will move throughout the subsurface and interact with the constituents of the soil through both elastic and nonelastic scattering, which will have the effect of moderating the energies of these neutrons [3]. Some neutrons escape from the surface, providing a leakage flux that the DAN 3 He proportional counters can measure. The energy spectrum of these neutrons is directly dependent on the amount of hydrogen in the subsurface. A higher hydrogen content will lead to more moderation and thus more low energy (thermalized) neutrons. Greater abundances of high thermal neutron absorption cross section elements (e.g. chlorine), however, will have the opposite effect of removing thermal neutrons from the leakage flux [4].  Methods: Simulations of the DAN detectors and the Martian neutron leakage flux are necessary for understanding the signals seen from DAN during its passive mode measurements. We use Monte Carlo modeling, specifically the Monte Carlo Neutral ParticleExtended (MCNPX) software package, which models the transport and interactions of neutrons and other particles within a user-defined geometry and compositional distribution [5].  A full scale simulation of the neutron environment on the surface of Mars is not possible when taking into account the negligible volume of the DAN detectors when compared to the volume of Mars and its atmosphere. For this reason, our model, which is previously described by Tate, et al. [6]. , consists of 3 steps in order to facilitate decoupling of the individual neutron sources contributing to the signal and improve overall statistics. Results are normalized by taking into account the amount of source particles from the MMRTG [7], the contributions from GCR, and the surface pressure of the location being investigated.   Results/Interpretations: WEH abundances have been estimated by using DAN active chlorine results for each fixed location to uniquely constrain the WEH for a given location. WEH abundances for fixed locations investigated along the rover traverse (Fig. 1) range from 0.80 wt % to 5.36 wt % with an average value of 2.77 wt %. The rover investigated locations in both the Hummocky  Plains Unit (HP) and the Bedded Fractured Unit (BF) during these sols. The HP unit exhibited an average WEH value of 2.29 wt %, while the corresponding value for the BF unit was 3.30 wt %. Rocknest contained the lowest WEH of 0.80 wt %. Locations analyzed nearest to the outcrops Link and Hottah, which are believed to be ancient streambeds [8], show increased WEH abundances of 3.51 wt % and 4.40 wt %, respectively. Locations analyzed in Yellowknife Bay (within the BF unit), where phyllosilicates were found [9], show the highest WEH contents out of these locations ranging up to 5.36 wt %, with the John Klein drill hole area being at 3.82 wt % specifically. In most cases, passive mode detects greater WEH abundances than active mode suggesting the presence of greater hydrogen abundances below 60 cm in the regolith.        Fig. 1. WEH estimations along traverse for locations stopped at during first 200 sols, indicated by circles.  DAN also acquired passive data continuously (Fig. 2) while the rover was traversing in between locations that were stopped at. These data show greater variability and higher WEH estimates than the data taken at fixed locations. In this analysis, a chorine value of 0.97 wt % has been used for all points as it is the average value of DAN active chlorine values from fixed locations during these sols and there are no other data concerning these locations characterized while the rover is traversing.     Fig. 2. WEH estimations from passive data acquired during rover traverse segments.  DAN passive data acquired along rover traverse segments give WEH estimations that range from 0.77 wt % to 8.24 wt % with an average value of 3.31 wt %. The average value of the HP unit is 3.74 wt % and 3.03 wt % for the BF unit.   Local anomalies of high thermal neutron count rates are seen in many of the traverse segments, which can be used to investigate the spatial extent of hydrogen abundances in the shallow regolith. For example, DAN passive data acquired during the traverse on sol 48 contains the highest thermal neutron count rate seen by DAN passive corresponding to a WEH content of 8.24 wt % (Fig. 3) localized to a region of ~ 1 meter in the along track direction of the rover indicating increased hydrogen content compared to its immediate surroundings. Both high and low thermal neutron count anomalies are seen in the traverse data and the length of those anomalies ranges from ~1 to many meters in the along track direction of the rover.       Fig. 3. WEH estimations from data acquired during sol 48 rover traverse segment.  Interpretations of the WEH abundances observed include water bound in hydrous minerals, as water ice is not thermodynamically stable at low latitudes on Mars. Clays, hydrous sulfates, zeolites, complex hydrous salts and others are all possible contributors to the hydrogen in the regolith.   References: [1] Mitrofanov, et al. (2012) Space Sci.
