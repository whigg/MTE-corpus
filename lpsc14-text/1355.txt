MASS-LOSS EVOLUTION OF SUPER EARTHS: EFFECTS OF STELLAR TYPES  H. Kurokawa1, L. Kaltenegger2,3, and T. Nakamoto3, 1Nagoya University, Furo-cho, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi 464-8602, Japan (kurokawa@nagoya-u.jp), 2Max Planck Institut fuer Astronomie, 3Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 4Tokyo Institute of Technology   Introduction:  The search for exoplanets has pushed toward small planets called “super Earths" whose masses are ~1-20 Earth masses. Especially, recent transit observations have revealed a populations of low mass, low density “super Earths", which possibly have large amounts of H/He envelopes. Widespread radii of super Earths indicates the diversity of compositions of super Earths (Fig. 1). These super Earths are ubiquitous around different types of host stars. The diversity originates possibly from both formation and evolution histories. Formation processes including planetary migration and capture of protoplanetary disk gas contributes the diversity [2][3]. Also, compositions of super Earths are affected by mass-loss evolution due to XUV (X-ray and EUV) driven escape of H/He envelope [4][5][6]. Because XUV luminosities differ among different spectral types of stars by an order of magnitude, the study of mass-loss evolution around different stellar types provides insights to distinguish the effects of formation processes and later evolution.   Model:  We calculate the evolution of super Earths having H/He envelopes on rocky cores, considering XUV-driven atmospheric escape and Roche-lobe overflow. The model is based on [7]. The rate of mass loss is calculated with the energy-limited escape formula [8] in which the rate is proportional to incoming XUV flux,  MASS-LOSS EVOLUTION OF SUPER-EARTHS: EFFECTS OF STELLAR TYPESH.

This is due to the lower incoming XUVflux and the lower equilibrium temperature at the sameseparation for low mass stars. The lower XUV flux results in a lower rate of mass loss (Eq. 1).

The critical separation to lose H/He envelope is small for super Earths orbiting low mass stars, meaning that super Earths having H/He envelopes are more stable around low mass stars. This is due to the lower incoming XUV flux and the lower equilibrium temperature at the same separation for low mass stars. The lower XUV flux results in a lower rate of mass loss (Eq. 1). The lower equilibrium temperature also reduces the rate of mass loss because the radius in Eq. 1 depends on the equilibrium temperature.

Discussion: Observed super Earths and the comparisons with our theoretical criteria are shown in Fig. 3. Generally, observations show the transition of super Earths with/without envelopes depending on mass and separation, which is similar with the theoretical prediction. The comparisons show that all of super Earths with H/He envelopes have larger separations than the critical separations to lose envelope, except for Kepler11 c and Kepler-11 f. Mass-Radius relations of super Earths having smaller separation than the criteria is all explained by rocky or icy compositions (Fig. 1) with the two exceptions. If Kepler-11 is exceptionally a XUV-inactive star which results in weak mass-loss for the planetary system, our results indicate that the compositions of super Earths are shaped by mass-loss evolution after their formation stages.
