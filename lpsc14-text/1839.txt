Studies of detrital shocked minerals in South Africa (Vredefort Dome), and Canada (Sudbury) have demonstrated that they can survive post-impact metamorphism, erosion, and distal sedimentary transport [1-3]. The presence of shatter cones and shocked quartz were used to confirm the Santa Fe impact structure near Santa Fe, New Mexico as having an impact origin [4]. Here we report the first occurrence of shocked zircon at the Santa Fe Impact structure, which were found as detrital grains, rather than in bedrock. Santa Fe impact structure: The age of impact is poorly constrained, but is believed to have occurred between ~1200 and ~350 Ma [4]. The structure is highly tectonized and deeply eroded; based on shatter cone distribution, the estimated original diamter is from ~6 to 13 km [4]. Figure 1. Location of Santa Fe impact structure, after [4]. Stars are locations of sediment samples. Black dots show the location of shatter cones outcrops identified previously [4].  Samples/methods:  Three ~ 1.5 kg sediment samples were collected near the Santa Fe impact structure (Fig. 1). Sample 11NM03 is mixed colluvium/alluvium; 11NM04 is modern alluvium from Little Tesuque Creek; 11NM05 is colluvium. Detrital zircons from each sample were hand-picked and imaged with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). SEM results: Backscattered electron imaging (BSE) was used to search for shock microstructures. A total of 400 detrital zircon grains were examined from sample 11NM05; planar microstructures were identified in two grains (2/400, or 0.5%). Planar fracture [5] sets consisting of open, parallel fractures with 1-10 µm spacing are visible on both exterior and interior surfaces (Fig. 2).  Discussion: These results are the first report of shocked zircons at the Santa Fe impact structure, and represent the third impact structure where detrital shocked zircons have been documented [1-3,5]. The detrital shocked zircons documented here contain planar fractures, which record shock pressures of ~20 GPa [6]; this pressure record is substantially higer than previous reports of ~10 GPa based on PDFs in quartz from bedrock [4]. The host rocks of the detrital shocked zircons have not been identified, but are probably nearby granite or supracrustal rocks [4].                          Figure 2.
