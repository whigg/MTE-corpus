DISTRIBUTION  OF  PULTUSK  METEORITE  FRAGMENTS.  T.  Brachaniec1 and  J.  W.  Kosiński2,1University  of  Silesia;  Faculty  of  Earth  Science;  Bedzinska  str.  60,  41-200  Sosnowiec;  email:tomasz.brachaniec@o2.pl, 2Comet and Meteor Workshop - Meteorites Section, Warsaw; email: meteorites@vp.pl.Pultusk  meteorite,  which  is  classified  as  a  brecciated H5 chondrite [1] fell at 30th of January 1868 inCentral Poland. The bolide was witnessed over a hugepart of Europe, from cities in Hungary and Austria inthe south,  to Gdańsk (Poland),  Russia,  in  the north,and  from Berlin  (Germany),  in  the  west  to  Grodno(Belarus),  in the east. The shock from the bolide reportedly collapsed structures in Warsaw, 60 km southof where it  impacted.  Within  a few days of the fall,about 400 pieces of the meteorite were collected. After 80 years after the fall Samsonowicz as firstpublished his  field working results [2]. He has beenshowed a map with a distribution ellipse with an areaof  approximately  130  square  kilometers  and  madea model of probable distribution of fragments with regard to their sorting (the bigger specimens in the frontpart of the strewn field, the smaller meteorites in theback part;  Fig.  1). Samsonowicz also estimated thatthe number of fragments distributed within the strewnfield could be as high as 70.000.Figure 1. Distribution map produced by Samsonowicz of Pultusk meteorite fragments and the area ofthe strewn field. Explanations: 1- meteorites weighing from 0.001 to 0.2 kg; 2 - from 0.2 to 2 kg; 3 from 2 to 9 kg. The grey shape shows main area ofcontemporary field works.      Modern  research  of literature  and  field  working(Fig.  1)  clearly show that  the  map  created  by Samsonowicz is only a approximate picture of the distribution of Pultusk meteorites. The result of a field searching is an observation that in a small area occur smalland  big specimens.  Author  has  been claimed that  inthe central part  of the ellipse should be found specimens from 0.2 to 2 kg,  however,  in  this  area  occursmall meteorites, weighing a few grams, called "Pultusk  peas".  There  are  many  indications that Samsonowicz also overestimated the amount of fallen meteorites [3][4]. Descriptions of witnesses about two/three detonations, many variation of fusion crust (from very fragmented to oriented specimens), different real distribution of meteorites in contrast to standard model probably indicate, that the main Pultusk mass at least twicebroke up in  the atmosphere.  Studies of this problemare in progress.  References: [1] Manecki  A.  (1972)  Prace Mineralogiczne,  27,  53-69.  [2]  Samsonowicz  J.  (1952)Wiadomości Muzeum Ziemi, 6, 56-68. [3] Kosiński J.W.
