Purpose: We have evaluated the application of the CubeSat Paradigm for deep space exploration, often referred to as LunarCube [1]. Over the course of this year, we conducted systems definition and design activities, with focus on enhanced guidance, navigation, and control as well as propulsion requirements for cislunar space operation, thermal requirements and communication as dominant drivers for long duration operation on the lunar surface.  The end result is costeffective, generic design(s) for a cross-section of future high priority space or surface payloads for planetary, heliophysics, and astrophysics disciplines, the requirements for which are described in Table 1.   The CubeSat Paradigm: Over the last decade, CubeSat has evolved to support cutting edge multiplatform, multi-disciplinary science as well as key SmallSat hardware and software technology R&D, in Earth orbit, e.g., the scientifically useful monitoring of Earth’s atmosphere and climate by several experiments (e.g., CINEMA, CubeSat for Ions, Neutrals, Electron, and Magnetic Fields) [2]. Recently CubeSat has been proposed as a model for a lunar swirl study mission [3]. Incorporating advances in the consumer electronics industry, the decade of development has seen the continuous reduction in size, mass, and power, and increase in processing capability of onboard avionics and power systems [4]. CubeSat use of resources, including cost and development time, are kept low by using a standard “bus,” standardized interfaces, and shared access by guest “instruments” to all subsystems using existing SmallSat protocols. This paradigm is similar to that commonly used by NASA in its first, and even second, decades, when launch rates were far higher and costs far lower [1]. Part of its appeal is that CubeSat model has afforded universities access for hands on student education subsidized by NSF, NASA and other agencies.  Progress in Extending the CubeSat Paradigm: NASA Ames has already shown leadership in the use of SmallSats, such as LCross, for lunar mission design over the last decade.  Several NASA centers are in the process of developing a 6U CubeSat design, meant to be more robust in terms of longer duration and survival in the deep space environment, as well as capable of more advanced attitude control, navigation, and communication beyond Earth orbit, with the goal of supporting high priority deep space science activities [5,6]. GSFC has completed a year long study to investigate the use of the CubeSat paradigm for deep space, as described above. Interplanetary CubeSat and LunarCube workshops are being held annually now [7]. The NASA Office of the Chief Technologist initiated programs to develop core technologies critical for deep space operations. NASA SMD Heliophysics, Astrophysics, and Earth Applications programs now include cubesat ‘test by flying’ components.  Orion testing will provide competed opportunities for up to 9 CubeSats to be deployed in cislunar space. Development of LunarCube Concept: LunarCube development plan is progressive and includes testing of later stage core technologies in earlier stages. Stage 1 (LunarCube 1) supports enhanced 1) profile: somewhat longer duration that CubeSat (many months instead of many weeks); 2) form factor: from 3U to a minimum of 6U, but potentially larger volumes, as needed; 3) radiation and thermal environment design for deep space (with greater radiation hardness provided, for example, by MilSpec components, and accommodation for passive thermal design) and short-term operation on the lunar surface (potentially by using limited duty cycle); and 4) testing for in-space propulsion, communication, and active attitude control and navigation systems. Stage 2 (LunarCube 2) enhances capability by incorporating state of the art or even currently ‘under development’ technologies in several key areas: 1) electronics and software; 2) precision navigation, control, propulsion; 3) full deep cryo operation for ‘cold cubes’; and 4) advanced payload integration. Full operation on the lunar surface would be possible. Ultimately, the LunarCube could be a virtual ‘smart phone’ with experiments as software applications. Current Activities: We developed science and preliminary design requirements, completed trade studies, and initiated conceptual designs for two other mission concepts, representing various levels of technological challenge (see Table next page).  Each of these concepts is possible as a result of work done, particularly over the last decade, toward development of miniaturized, or even MEMS versions, of standard space payload instruments. This year, we are performing thermal and vibration testing of the LWADI breadboard instrument package.
